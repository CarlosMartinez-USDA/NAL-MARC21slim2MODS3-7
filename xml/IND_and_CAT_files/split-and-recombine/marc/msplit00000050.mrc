Current risk assessments of coal ash disposal focus on pH as the primary driver of leaching from coal ash. However, redox speciation of As and Se is a major factor for their mobilization potential and has received much less attention for risk assessments, particularly in disposal scenarios where coal ash will likely be exposed to microbially-driven redox gradients. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the differences of aerobic and anaerobic conditions for the leaching of As and Se from coal ash. Batch sediment-ash slurry microcosms were performed to mimic an ash spill scenario and were monitored for changes in As and Se speciation and mobilization potential. The results showed that the dissolved As concentrations were up to 50 times greater in the anaerobic microcosms relative to the aerobic microcosms during the two week incubation. This trend was consistent with As redox speciation determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which indicated that 55% of the As in the solid phase at the end of the experiment was present as As(III) (a more leachable form of arsenic relative to As(V)). In the aerobic microcosms, only 13% of the As was As(III) and the rest was As(V). More than half of the Se was present as Se(IV) in the original fly ash and in the aerobic microcosms, while in the anaerobic microcosms Se was gradually transformed to less soluble Se(0) species. Likewise, dissolved Se concentrations were up to 25 times greater in the aerobic microcosms relative to anaerobic conditions. While the overall observations of As and Se mobilization potential from coal ash were consistent with expectations for aqueous and solid phase speciation of these elements, the findings directly show the relevance of these processes for coal ash disposal. These results highlight the need to select appropriate environmental parameters to include in risk assessments as well as provide potential geochemical monitoring tools through the use of dissolved Se/As ratios to determine the redox conditions of ash storage and spill sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aanaerobic conditions 3aarsenic 3acoal 3afly ash 3ageochemistry 3aleaching 3amonitoring 3apH 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3aselenium 3aslurries 3asolid wastes 0aCoal combustion residuals 0aWater quality 0aSolid waste disposal1 aRivera, Nelson1 aYi, Sŭng-u,1 aHarrington, James M.1 aHower, James C.1 aLevine, Keith E.1 aVengosh, Avner1 aHsu-Kim, Heileen0 tApplied geochemistry.g2016 Apr., v. 67 p.177-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245009600212520151300308592002801821650001001849650002401859650001101883650001601894650001601910650001601926650002701942650001301969650001901982650001002001650001202011650001102023650001702034650001402051650001502065650001702080650000902097653001502106653002302121653002402144653002502168653002002193653002402213700002502237700002202262700006002284773011402344856008602458852000902544655001202553IND60781492220221118175425.0220809e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078149222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1328702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZolfaghari, Shiva1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2087-491210aValorization of cheese whey to eco-friendly food packaging and biomethane via a biorefinery  aNon-degradable packaging and cheese whey are two widely produced items, disposal of which causes severe environmental issues. This study tried to address the problems by innovatively valorizing cheese whey to cleaner products including fungal chitosan, biomethane, and novel biopolymer-based films, aiming at green food packaging via a two-stage biorefinery. As the first stage, chitosan was extracted from the biomass of Mucor indicus, an edible filamentous fungus cultivated on cheese whey, resulting in 6.11 g chitosan-rich fungal biomass per 1 L of whey. The obtained fungal chitosan was embedded in wheat starch at varying portions, and further analyses investigated the characteristics of the films. ATR-FTIR and XRD results revealed the good compatibility and synergic effect of the components. The blend film with 6 wt% chitosan showed the least water swelling index (63.8%) and oxygen permeability (∼0.5 Barrer (10⁻¹⁰cm³ cm/cm².s.cmHg)). The film also had acceptable optical performance with ∼1.0 A₆₀₀/mm opacity. In the second stage, the effluent of fungal cultivation underwent anaerobic digestion, producing 498.2 mL/g VS biomethane. Overall, 1 m³ of cheese whey yielded 0.733 Kg chitosan, 17.0 m³ biomethane, and 89.6% COD removal. The applied cleaner approach, on the whole, provided a biopolymer with the potentiality to produce sustainable packaging that could alleviate plastic pollution, in addition to generating green energy and leaving eco-friendly wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMucor 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiopolymers 3abiorefining 3acheese whey 3achemical oxygen demand 3achitosan 3afungal biomass 3afungi 3aopacity 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3asynergism 3awastewater 3awheat starch 3awhey 0aBiopolymer 0aFungal cultivation 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aBiological treatment 0aFungal chitosan 0aOxygen permeability1 aHashemi, Seyed Sajad1 aKarimi, Keikhosro1 aSadeghi, Morteza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0075-15200 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 366 p.132870-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1328703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245011300212300001600325506007600341520114900417592002801566506003701594650001001631650002001641650001901661650001901680650001501699650001601714650000901730650001401739650002101753651001701774651001801791653001601809653001301825653001401838653001801852653001901870700003201889700002001921773011201941856008502053852000902138655001202147IND60524205120221207124406.0160705e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052420512DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2016.11381162doi7 aPMC48677882pmcid7 a269636422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLimon, Georgina10aInvestigation Into the Humaneness of Slaughter Methods for Guinea Pigs (Cavia porcelus) in the Andean Region  ap. 280-293.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGuinea pigs (Cavia porcelus) are an important source of nonhuman animal protein in the Andean region of South America. Specific guidelines regarding the welfare of guinea pigs before and during slaughter have yet to be developed. This study critically assessed the humaneness of 4 different stunning/slaughter methods for guinea pigs: cervical neck dislocation (n = 60), electrical head-only stunning (n = 83), carbon dioxide (CO ₂) stunning (n = 21), and penetrating captive bolt (n = 10). Following cervical neck dislocation, 97% of guinea pigs had at least 1 behavioral or cranial/spinal response. Six percent of guinea pigs were classified as mis-stunned after electrical stunning, and 1% were classified as mis-stunned after captive bolt. Increased respiratory effort was observed during CO ₂ stunning. Apart from this finding, there were no other obvious behavioral responses that could be associated with suffering. Of the methods assessed, captive bolt was deemed the most humane, effective, and practical method of stunning guinea pigs. Cervical neck dislocation should not be recommended as a slaughter method for guinea pigs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCavia 3aanimal proteins 3aanimal welfare 3acarbon dioxide 3aguidelines 3aguinea pigs 3aneck 3aslaughter 3astunning methods 3aAndes region 3aSouth America 0aGuinea pigs 0astunning 0aslaughter 0aAndean region 0aanimal welfare1 aGonzales-Gustavson, Eloy A.1 aGibson, Troy J.0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2016 July 2, v. 19, no. 3 p.280-293dRoutledgex1532-76047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2016.11381163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012200177300001600299520111200315592002801427650002301455650001701478650002401495650001501519650001001534653002401544653002101568653001901589653001901608653001001627653002401637653001801661653001801679700001901697773010601716856008501822852000901907655001201916IND60576324320221122235113.0170802e20170818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057632432DNAL7 a10.1080/10454446.2017.12447932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldred Cheek, Kristin10aMaking It Part of the Package: Edible Packaging Is More Acceptable to Young Consumers When It Is Integrated With Food  ap. 723-732.  aHow does edible packaging bias taste perceptions and acceptability? To examine this, we conducted an experiment where we manipulated what information participants received about a product with edible packaging and whether participants ate the product with its edible packaging and core food product intact or ate the edible packaging and core product layers separately. Participants who received information about edible packaging and tasted the edible packaging layer separately rated the product lower on dimensions of taste, healthiness, and intention to purchase than participants in other treatment groups. Findings suggest that framing a product as an edible package with environmental benefits can lead to negative judgments. Contrary to what environmentalists would expect, it may be best to simply not highlight its environmental benefits. Findings also suggest that consumers’ judgments of edible packaging may depend on how well the packaging material is integrated with its principal food product, and that highly separated products (such as edible cups) may face greater barriers to adoption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3aedible films 3apackaging materials 3apurchasing 3ataste 0aConsumer acceptance 0aedible packaging 0afood packaging 0asustainability 0awaste 0aedible food wrapper 0abiodegradable 0abio-packaging1 aWansink, Brian0 tJournal of food products marketing.g2017 Aug. 18, v. 23, no. 6 p.723-732dRoutledgex1540-41027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10454446.2017.12447933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009500163300001600258520071500274592002800989650001101017650002301028650002301051650001001074650002301084650002701107650001401134650001801148650001701166651001001183700001101193700002001204700001701224700001901241700001401260700001601274700001801290773011001308856008101418852000901499655001201508IND60572911320221119022748.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057291132DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-016-0650-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian14aThe complete chloroplast genome of Lilium taliense, an endangered species endemic to China  ap. 201-203.  aThe complete chloroplast genome of Lilium taliense which is a rare and endangered species native to China was determined in this study.

Process control with solvents, catalysts and temperature is of significant importance providing ways to break the above linkages, and benefiting to the further conversion of the main biomass components to small molecular products. This article discusses the effect of catalyst under hydrothermal and organosolv treatment emphasizing the cleavage of the intermolecular linkage. Acidic catalysts show good performance on cleaving the linkages between carbohydrates and lignin. Basic catalysts promoted the dissolution of lignin component. Hydrogenolysis assisted conversion of lignin can efficiently break the intermolecular linkages to yield lignin-derived bio-oil, especially in co-solvent reaction system. Besides, the effects of single solvent and co-solvent systems, as well as the cleavage of the intramolecular linkages to yield target chemicals are also included. Several further study strategies are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3aprocess control 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aBiomass 0aIntermolecular linkages 0aCatalyst 0aSolvent 0aProcess control1 aZhao, Pingping1 aHu, Changwei0 tBioresource technology.g2018 May, v. 256 p.466-477dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.02.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245012400198300001500322520167700337592002802014650001902042650001702061650001802078650001302096650001102109650001902120650001002139650000902149650001902158700002402177700001902201773015202220856007002372856010202442990002302544852000902567655001202576IND60608619020221123021811.0190510e20180628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060861902DNAL7 a10.3791/566502doi7 aPMC61020092pmcid7 a300106482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, Laura E.10aPre-conditioning the airways of mice with bleomycin increases the efficiency of orthotopic lung cancer cell engraftment  ap. e56650.  aLung cancer is a deadly treatment refractory disease that is biologically heterogeneous. To understand and effectively treat the full clinical spectrum of thoracic malignancies, additional animal models that can recapitulate diverse human lung cancer subtypes and stages are needed. Allograft or xenograft models are versatile and enable the quantification of tumorigenic capacity in vivo, using malignant cells of either murine or human origin. However, previously described methods of lung cancer cell engraftment have been performed in non-physiological sites, such as the flank of mice, due to the inefficiency of orthotopic transplantation of cells into the lungs. In this study, we describe a method to enhance orthotopic lung cancer cell engraftment by pre-conditioning the airways of mice with the fibrosis inducing agent bleomycin. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we applied this approach to engraft tumor cells of the lung adenocarcinoma subtype, obtained from either mouse or human sources, into various strains of mice. We demonstrate that injuring the airways with bleomycin prior to tumor cell injection increases the engraftment of tumor cells from 0-17% to 71-100%. Significantly, this method enhanced lung tumor incidence and subsequent outgrowth using different models and mouse strains. In addition, engrafted lung cancer cells disseminate from the lungs into relevant distant organs. Thus, we provide a protocol that can be used to establish and maintain new orthotopic models of lung cancer with limiting amounts of cells or biospecimen and to quantitatively assess the tumorigenic capacity of lung cancer cells in physiologically relevant settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aallografting 3aanimal models 3afibrosis 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3amice 3aneoplasm cells1 aArnal-Estapé, Anna1 aNguyen, Don X.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 June 28, , no. 136 p.e56650-e56650dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/566503Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56650/pre-conditioning-airways-mice-with-bleomycin-increases-efficiency  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013300167300001600300520119700316592002801513650001901541650001501560650002801575650002001603650001201623650001401635653001801649653002501667653002101692653001901713653003001732700001701762700001901779700002001798700002401818700001801842700002601860773011201886856008501998852000902083655001202092IND60524205320221117232912.0160705e20160702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052420532DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2016.11416822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZito, Sarah10aReasons People Surrender Unowned and Owned Cats to Australian Animal Shelters and Barriers to Assuming Ownership of Unowned Cats  ap. 303-319.  aMost cats surrendered to nonhuman animal shelters are identified as unowned, and the surrender reason for these cats is usually simply recorded as “stray.” A cross-sectional study was conducted with people surrendering cats to 4 Australian animal shelters. Surrenderers of unowned cats commonly gave surrender reasons relating to concern for the cat and his/her welfare. Seventeen percent of noncaregivers had considered adopting the cat. Barriers to assuming ownership most commonly related to responsible ownership concerns. Unwanted kittens commonly contributed to the decision to surrender for both caregivers and noncaregivers. Nonowners gave more surrender reasons than owners, although many owners also gave multiple surrender reasons. These findings highlight the multifactorial nature of the decision-making process leading to surrender and demonstrate that recording only one reason for surrender does not capture the complexity of the surrender decision. Collecting information about multiple reasons for surrender, particularly reasons for surrender of unowned cats and barriers to assuming ownership, could help to develop strategies to reduce the number of cats surrendered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3acaregivers 3across-sectional studies 3adecision making 3akittens 3aownership 0aCat surrender 0aunwanted cat problem 0ashelter medicine 0aanimal welfare 0areasons for cat surrender1 aMorton, John1 aVankan, Dianne1 aPaterson, Mandy1 aBennett, Pauleen C.1 aRand, Jacquie1 aPhillips, Clive J.

The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) was completed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months by parents to characterize their child's hunger (H), disinhibition (D), and cognitive restraint (CR). Baseline and follow-up TFEQ scores by diet were evaluated relative to BMI status over time.Results: All diet groups showed increased CR and decreased H and D from baseline to 3 months, with differences from baseline remaining at 12 months for CR and H. Lower BMI status during study follow-up was associated with different TFEQ scores by diet group (LC and RGL: higher CR; PC: lower H), adjusting for sex, age, and race. Higher CR at follow-up was predicted by race and higher baseline CR; only lower H at baseline predicted lower H at follow-up.Conclusion: Eating behaviors improved significantly with all diets during the initial 3 months; higher CR and lower H were sustained at treatment's end. BMI outcomes were associated with different eating behaviors in CHO-modified diet groups compared with PC diets. Targeting diets of children with obesity with specific baseline characteristics may lead to improved outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3acarbohydrates 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3acognition 3aeating habits 3afood frequency questionnaires 3aglycemic index 3ahunger 3aparents 0adietary intake 0aeating behaviors 0apediatric obesity 0aweight management1 aWoo, Jessica G.1 aBrehm, Bonnie1 aDaniels, Stephen R.1 aSaelens, Brian E.0 tChildhood obesity.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 13, no. 5 p.377-383dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2017.00203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011500171520088200286592002801168650001801196650002101214651001801235651002601253653001801279653002301297653002201320653001901342653002401361700002801385700001601413700002301429700002701452773010601479856008801585852000901673655001201682IND60741513720221118103710.0210729e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074151372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiel, Martin10aDaily accumulation rates of marine litter on the shores of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the South Pacific Ocean  aLarge amounts of floating litter accumulate in the subtropical gyres, and the shorelines of oceanic islands in the vicinity of these accumulation zones receive large amounts of litter. The dynamics of marine litter arrival were evaluated on a small pocket beach on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) between November 2016 and June 2017 over a total time period of 190 days. Plastics dominated the stranded litter, with the majority of the items showing indications to come from the high seas fisheries operating in the South Pacific. Litter accumulation rates varied between 0 and 1.90 items m⁻¹ day⁻¹, and were highest following days of strong winds from northern directions. The results indicate that the shores of Rapa Nui are exposed to continuous input of plastic litter from the contaminated waters of the subtropical gyre, which is intensified during strong onshore winds.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarine debris 3amarine pollution 3aPacific Ocean 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aMarine litter 0aAccumulation rates 0aLitter strandings 0aWind transport 0aSouth Pacific Ocean1 aLorca, Bárbara Barrera1 aBravo, Luis1 aHinojosa, Iván A.1 aMeneses, Hugo Zeballos0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2021 Aug., v. 169 p.112535-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.1125353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002700187245016100214300001600375506007600391520110600467592002801573506003701601650001601638650001201654650002201666650002801688650001901716650001701735650001301752650002301765650001801788650000701806650002201813650003301835650001601868700005801884700005601942700006001998700002002058700002302078773013302101856008102234852000902315655001202324IND60627175820221207113802.0191219e20190104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062717582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b110972doi7 aPMC70059812pmcid7 a306093612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutchinson, Jessica A.10aSelf-Assembly of Lipopeptides Containing Short Peptide Fragments Derived from the Gastrointestinal Hormone PYY₃–₃₆: From Micelles to Amyloid Fibrils  ap. 614-621.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe investigate the impact of lipidation on the self-assembly of two peptide fragments from the gastrointestinal peptide hormone PYY₃–₃₆. The lipopeptides C₁₆IKPEAP and C₁₆IKPEAPGE contain the first 6 and 8 amino acid residues, respectively, from the PYY₃–₃₆ peptide sequence, with a palmitoyl C₁₆ tail attached at the N-terminus. These lipopeptides form spherical micelles in aqueous solution, above a critical micelle concentration (cmc), which is pH-dependent. Modeling of small-angle X-ray scattering data along with molecular dynamics simulations shows the formation of micelles with a hydrophobic interior and a well-hydrated exterior. The lipopeptides have a disordered conformation over the pH and temperature ranges studied. The cmc is found to be independent of temperature, pointing to athermal micellization. In contrast to the presence of hydrated micelles in solution, β-sheet amyloid fibrils form in dried samples. Thus, the nanostructure of lipidated PYY₃–₃₆ fragment peptides can be tuned by control of pH or concentration, for future applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3aamyloid 3aaqueous solutions 3agastrointestinal system 3ahydrophobicity 3alipopeptides 3amicelles 3amolecular dynamics 3ananomaterials 3apH 3asimulation models 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3atemperature1 aHamley, Ian W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4549-09261 aTorras, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8737-76091 aAlemán, Carlos,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4462-60751 aSeitsonen, Jani1 aRuokolainen, Janne0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Jan. 04, v. 123, no. 3 p.614-621dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b110973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245012200129300001600251520170500267592002801972650002902000650001302029650002402042650002102066650001102087650000902098650001802107650002002125650001002145650001402155650001002169650000902179650001702188650001902205650001502224650003302239650002302272650001002295653001602305653002002321653002202341700002102363700001802384700002502402700002102427700002102448773014102469852000902610655001202619IND60710334820221118072013.0200908e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071033482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatheesh, Y.10aEffect of feeding Pediococcus acidilactici on performance of broiler chicken and microstructures of intestinal villus  ap. 357-362.  aThe effect of feeding encapsulated and non-encapsulated Pediococcus acidilactici on body weight gain, feed conversion efficiency, meat quality and ultra structural changes of intestinal (ileum) villus in commercial male broiler chicks was evaluated. Group 1 (Control) was fed with feed without supplementation of any probiotic organism, Group 2 was fed with non-encapsulated P. acidilactici (NEPA) @ 10⁶ cfu/g supplemented diets. Groups 3 and 4 were fed with low and high level of encapsulated Pediococcus acidilactici diets (EPAL and EPAH) @ 10⁶ cfu/g and 10⁹ cfu/g, respectively. The body weight gain during the (0–3) and (0–6) week in the control group was significantly (P<0.05) lower than NEPA, EPAL and EPAH groups. EPAL and EPAH groups showed significantly (P<0.05) better feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to control group at the end of 3ʳᵈ and 6ᵗʰ week. The sensory evaluation scores of meat revealed a significant (P<0.05) improvement in juiciness, tenderness and overall acceptance in probiotic fed broilers compared to control group. The Scanning Electron Microscopy of ileum revealed increased villus width and length (area) in EPAH group compared to all other groups (Control, NEPA and EPAL). However, NEPA and EPAL fed chicks have higher villus area compared to control group. An excellent adhesion of Pediococcus acidilactici on intestinal walls was seen in EPAL and EPAH birds compared to control and NEPA group. Encapsulated Pediococcus acidilactici enhanced the colonization and adhesion of probiotics on the surface of intestines besides increasing the density, length and width of intestinal villus resulting in better performance and meat quality in broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aadhesion 3abody weight changes 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3adiet 3aencapsulation 3afeed conversion 3aileum 3ajuiciness 3amales 3ameat 3ameat quality 3amicrostructure 3aprobiotics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asensory evaluation 3avilli 0aperformance 0abroiler chicken 0aintestinal villus1 aReddy, K.

Increased astaxanthin supplementation in foods, nutraceuticals, and cosmetic products has resulted in tremendous growth in the demand for natural astaxanthin.Astaxanthin is found widely in aquatic animals and some other organisms, but its de novo synthesis is limited to several bacteria, protists, fungi, algae and plants. Metabolic engineering offers approaches to create systems for high-efficiency production of astaxanthin, which will require in-depth dissection of the astaxanthin synthesis enzymes in the available organisms.Here, we review the de novo synthesis of astaxanthin in bacteria, protists, fungi, algae and plants, and the functional enzymes of specific organisms. A protein-sequence based phylogenetic tree was established to reveal the evolutionary relationships of astaxanthin synthesis proteins across organisms. This review will provide valuable information for the metabolic engineering of astaxanthin bioreactors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aamino acid sequences 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquatic animals 3aastaxanthin 3abacteria 3abioreactors 3acardiovascular diseases 3acoenzyme Q10 3acosmetics 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3aenzymes 3afoods 3afungi 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ametabolic engineering 3aneoplasms 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3aprotists 3avitamin E 0aDe novo synthesis 0aNatural resources1 aWang, Chunkai1 aLiu, Xiaofeng1 aZhao, Xue1 aLiu, Yanhua1 aLiu, Xinmin1 aDu, Yongmei1 aZhang, Zhongfeng1 aZhang, Hongbo0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2019 Oct., v. 92 p.162-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2019.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100006200192245012000254500001900374506007600393520052100469592002800990506003701018650001201055650002401067650001401091650001401105650002301119650001301142650001801155653002501173653001701198653001401215653001301229653001101242700001801253773009301271856008501364852000901449655001201458IND60690895820221207122254.0200508e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069089582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e020002doi7 aPMC66569572pmcid7 a313725262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBora, Sankar Jyoti1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5204-456410aSynthesis of ynones at room temperature catalyzed by copper chloride cryptand complex under solvent free conditions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn air-stable highly efficient reusable CuCl₂-cryptand-[2.2.Benzo] catalyst is reported first time for coupling reaction of terminal alkynes with different acyl chlorides in the presence of triethylamine acting both as base and solvent at room temperature to give the corresponding ynones.

The present experimental study investigates the effects of marine fouling on mechanical power harvesting performance from the Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of single circular cylinders. The towing tank VIV tests are conducted on elastically mounted rigid cylinders. Hard artificial marine fouling with aggregated spatial distribution is considered. Effects of coverage ratio and spatial distributions are investigated.The test results show that, on the whole, marine fouling suppresses the VIV oscillations. Over the upper branch, lower branch and the de-synchronization zone of the VIV response, energy transfer ratio (η) with the biofouled cylinders stay around 15–36% below that from the corresponding clean cylinder. It is also found that the coverage percentage of the fouling and the fouling irregularity negatively affect the VIV hydro energy transfer ratio. The fouling irregularity effects, however, are less significant than those from the coverage percentage. The results of the study suggest that biofouling growth may considerably degrade the long-term energy extraction performance of a VIVACE device.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofouling 3aclean energy 3aenergy transfer 3arenewable energy sources 3avibration 0aVortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) 0aHydrokinetic energy 0aHard marine fouling 0aAggregated spatial distribution 0aEnergy transfer ratio1 aZeinoddini, M.0 tRenewable energy.g2020 June, v. 152 p.516-528dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.01.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245012600129300001600255520162700271592002801898650001601926650001401942650002001956650001301976650001001989650002001999650001402019650001102033650001802044650002302062650002002085650000702105650001602112650002302128650002002151650001202171650004402183650001902227650001002246653003102256653001002287653001502297700001702312700001402329700001402343700001302357773014102370852000902511655001202520IND60710335120221118072110.0200908e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071033512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswas, A.K.10aDevelopment of low-fat, low-sodium functional chicken meat patties with the incorporation of carrageenan and broken wheat  ap. 372-376.  aThe aim of this study was to develop low-fat, low-sodium and fibre enriched chicken meat patties with the incorporation of carrageenan, broken wheat and reduced level of sodium chloride. The products were assigned following treatments: (i) control patties (contained 10% fat and 1.3% sodium chloride) and (ii) treated patties (contained 0.8% sodium chloride + 0.5% potassium chloride, 1% carageenan, 2% broken wheat and 5% fat) in standard formulation. The patties samples were evaluated for various physicochemical and sensory quality parameters. Results indicated that there were significant differences in emulsion stability, cooking yield, emulsion and product pH, water activity, moisture, protein and fat contents in between control and treated samples. Emulsion and cooked product pH, water activity, moisture and fat contents were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in control patties. Treated samples showed comparatively higher sensory scores for appearance and colour, texture and flavour attributes. In respect to colour profiles, treated products were lighter (P < 0.05) than control samples. Differences for textural parameters were significant, except stringiness, springiness and cohesiveness, which were higher for control. Treated product was harder and shown to have more chewiness. Lipid oxidation products like peroxide and TBARS values were differed significantly. Standard plate count was marginally higher for control sample. In general, formulation containing carrageenan, dalia and potassium chloride could be helpful in improving functionality, nutritive value and acceptability of chicken patties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrageenan 3achewiness 3achicken patties 3acohesion 3acolor 3acooking quality 3aemulsions 3aflavor 3alipid content 3alipid peroxidation 3anutritive value 3apH 3aplate count 3apotassium chloride 3asodium chloride 3atexture 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3awater activity 3awheat 0aFunctional chicken patties 0aDalia 0alow-sodium1 aChatli, M.K.1 aSahoo, J.1 aSingh, J.1 aKaur, R.0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2012 Dec., v. 47, no. 3 p.372-376dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245012300198300001600321500002000337520210300357592002802460596004602488596006902534596002402603596002302627596002302650650002802673650001502701650001202716650002302728650001302751650001902764650001602783700006502799700002402864700006402888773012202952856007303074852000903147655001203156IND60789458420221119005406.0220820e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078945842DNAL7 a10.1002/osp4.3692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabak, Rachel G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2967-390610aWeight gain prevention content delivered to mothers: Lessons from an intervention embedded in a community organization  ap. 540-547.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Transparent reporting of the intervention content study participants receive is particularly important for dissemination and implementation of evidence‐based interventions to address obesity. This study explores intervention delivery and perceptions of content when an intervention is embedded within an organization's usual practice and associations with weight outcomes. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis from the Healthy Eating and Active Living Taught at Home (HEALTH) randomized trial. HEALTH is a weight gain prevention intervention embedded within a national home visiting programme (Parents as Teachers, PAT). To be consistent with PAT practice, HEALTH has a suggested but also flexible home visit structure. Therefore, the number and frequency of home visits are determined by the family's needs and preferences based on the parent educator's professional judgement. The proportion of participants who received each curriculum core lesson was explored among the 105 families randomized to the HEALTH intervention group, as were mean parent educator perception ratings of the visits (5‐point Likert‐type scale). A chi‐square test was used to examine the association between utilization (ie, low: 1‐6, middle: 7‐12, or high: 13‐18 visits) category and weight maintenance. RESULTS: Mothers received on average 13.3 (standard deviation 6.2) core visits. Mean parent educator perception of the mothers' response (out of 5) ranged from 3.99 to 4.27; educators' perception of their own experience with the lesson ranged from 4.13 to 4.34. Among mothers who maintained their weight, 13% were low, 22% were middle, and 65% were high utilizers, while among mothers who gained weight, 3%, 31%, and 67% were low, middle, and high utilizers, respectively; this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified wide variation in the visits families received from the curriculum but minimal variation in visit perceptions. Future studies could explore whether there are optimal patterns for visit content, associated with successful outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  cNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  a1R01HL143360cNHLBI  aP30DK092950cNIDDK  aR18DK089461cNIDDK 3achi-square distribution 3acurriculum 3aobesity 3astandard deviation 3ateachers 3aweight control 3aweight gain1 aMorshed, Alexandra B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9960-04091 aSchwarz, Cynthia D.1 aHaire‐Joshu, Debra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6255-56160 tObesity science & practice.g2019 Dec., v. 5, no. 6 p.540-547dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27210x2055-22387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/osp4.3693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300001800306520119500324592002801519650001501547650001101562650001801573650002501591650002401616650001701640650002001657653003501677653003501712653002201747653002801769653002801797700001601825700005701841700001501898700001601913700001501929773009901944856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60781493120221118175410.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078149312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhigang10aResearch on temperature distribution characteristics and energy saving potential of wall implanted with heat pipes in heating season  ap. 1037-1049.  aAs an important component of building energy consumption, wall heat loss needs to be studied urgently. Wall implanted with heat pipes (WIHP) is one of the latest research hotspots in this field. Firstly, the internal temperature distribution characteristics of WIHP are studied by numerical simulation in this paper. Secondly, the thermal conversion efficiency is proposed to evaluate the utilization of solar energy by WIHP. Finally, the energy saving potential of WIHP in heating season is analyzed. The results show that: (1) WIHP has a significant anisotropic heat transfer characteristic compared with the conventional wall; the average time lag of the inside surface is reduced by 2.3 h, and the average decrement factor is increased by 0.008. (2) The time lag difference between the upper and lower parts of WIHP is 6 h, and the time lag of the WIHP structural layer is increased by 1 h compared with the conventional wall. (3) The heat transfer of heat pipe increases with the increase of solar radiation, but the thermal conversion efficiency decreases. (4) WIHP can decrease the heat loss of the wall by 56% on average, and the cumulative heat loss is reduced by 5.29 kWh/m².  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3ainternal temperature 3amathematical models 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 0aWall implanted with heat pipes 0aTwo-dimensional unsteady state 0aTemperature field 0aThermal characteristics 0aEnergy saving potential1 aLiu, Qiaoli1 aYao, Wanxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1361-914X1 aZhang, Wei1 aCao, Jingfu1 aHe, Haiyan0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 195 p.1037-1049dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245014900180300001600329520120700345592002801552650001901580650001401599650001901613650002901632650002301661650002901684650002801713653003501741653002401776653002501800653001701825653002101842653002701863700003801890700003201928700006801960773009702028856008502125852000902210655001202219IND60781493220221118175338.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078149322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercedes Garcia, Angel V.12aA new optimization approach for the use of hybrid renewable systems in the search of the zero net energy consumption in water irrigation systems  ap. 853-871.  aThe search of the sustainability in the water system and the improvement of the different targets, which are included in the different sustainable development goals.

The new proposed approach proposes the use of hybrid renewable systems, which are optimized by two simulated annealing procedures included inside of the methodology. It is applied in a real irrigation network where there are pump stations. The methodology chooses the best location of the microhydropowers systems and the selection of the best machine between a database of 674 pump working as turbines defining the minimum area of photovoltaic systems to be feasible the hybrid renewable system by a techno-economical analysis. The applied optimization procedure reached an annual average self-consumption energy value above 0.9, showing an annual positive energy balance of 283 MWh, using renewable energies and they could be sold to the grid.

Micro-hydro power plants are emerging as a mature balancing technology and a great alternative to large hydropower plants as they do not encounter population displacement and many environmental problems. It is worth noting that hydroelectric power plants combined with various sources require improvement in control laws and algorithms. Strong disturbing impacts, namely transient processes, in an isolated electric power system cause an appreciable decrease in dynamic stability. This paper presents research conducted to ensure synchronous parallel operation of permanent-magnet generators used in micro-hydroelectric power plants in an isolated power system with a controllable flexible coupling between turbine and generator. The importance of this study lies in the issue of electromechanical compatibility to be achieved in parallel operation of generators that have different parameters of time constant of mechanical inertia of rotors of electrical machines. This paper provides an overview of possible solutions to the identified problem. A concept based on a controllable flexible coupling between generator and turbine is proposed as a promising avenue to solve this problem. The mathematical models are presented along with the laws and algorithms developed for automatic control of the generator speed. Oscillograms of simulation and physical modeling presented in the final part of the paper show parallel operation of permanent-magnet synchronous generators in an isolated electric power system for various electrical distances of three-phase short circuit points.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3aclimate change 3ahydroelectric power 0aOff-grid power system 0aMicro-hydroelectric power plant 0aElectromagnetic continuous variable transmission 0aStabilization of output parameters 0aHydraulic turbines 0aDynamic stability1 aSuslov, Konstantin V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0484-28571 aNazarychev, Alexander N.1 aVolkova, Irina O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7184-37561 aKozhemyakin, Vyacheslav E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2941-92061 aVoloshin, Alexander A.1 aMinakov, Andrey V.0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 196 p.125-136dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245011600172300001400288520187700302592002802179650001302207650001102220650001202231650001902243650000902262650001502271650001002286650001702296650001902313650000902332650000902341650001302350650001402363650001302377650002102390650000702411650001402418650001002432650001902442651001402461653003102475653002202506653000802528653001302536653003102549700002002580700002502600700002202625700001602647700002402663773009802687856008802785852000902873655001202882IND60607867720221121035357.0180830e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060786772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Kosuke10aEffect of NO2 in exhaust gas from an oxyfuel combustion system on the cap rock of a proposed CO2 injection site  ap. 17-26.  aA laboratory geochemical study was conducted using a drill core sample of cap rock from the Surat Basin, Australia, to investigate the effect of NO2 contained in the CO2 gas exhausted from the oxyfuel combustion process (oxyfuel combustion CO2) on the cap rock. A gas (CO2 containing NO2) was prepared to simulate the exhaust gas produced from the oxyfuel combustion process. Two types of gases (pure CO2 and CO2 containing SO2) were also prepared as reference gases. The effect of NO2 on cap rock was studied experimentally using these gases. No differences in the amounts of leached ions and pH changes for CO2 containing NO2 (36 ppmv), pure CO2, and CO2 containing SO2 (35 ppmv) existed. The pH values decreased immediately after CO2 gas injection but increased with time as a result of mineral buffering. Leaching of Fe, Mg, Ca, and K was suggested to have occurred as the result of dissolution of Fe-chlorite, prehnite and illite-smectite mixed layer clay in the shale sample. The amounts of Ca, Fe, and Mg leached with CO2 containing NO2 (318 ppmv) were higher than those for pure CO2. For the mixture containing 318 ppmv NO2, the pH increased more than that for the other gas conditions immediately after the pH fall at the start of the experiment, because oxidation-reduction reactions occurred between Fe²⁺ and NO3⁻. Moreover, the results indicated that some of the leached Ca and Fe were deposited on the shale sample because of the pH increase. Therefore, we concluded that the effects of NO2 on mineral dissolution and pH changes of formation water are negligible when oxyfuel combustion CO2 containing about 30 ppmv of NO2 is injected into an underground aquifer. In addition, even if about 300 ppmv NO2 is accidentally injected into the underground aquifer, mineral dissolution is suppressed due to the buffering of pH decrease after gas injection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abasins 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3aclay 3acombustion 3agases 3ageochemistry 3ainjection site 3aions 3airon 3aleaching 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3anitrogen dioxide 3apH 3apotassium 3ashale 3asulfur dioxide 3aAustralia 0aCarbon capture and storage 0aSupercritical CO2 0aNO2 0aCap rock 0aOxyfuel combustion process1 aOkawa, Hirokazu1 aHashimoto, Keiichiro1 aTakahashi, Ryohei1 aImai, Akira1 aSugawara, Katsuyasu0 tApplied geochemistry.g2016 July, v. 70 p.17-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006900150245010800219300001600327520151800343592002801861650002201889650001501911650002001926650001201946650001101958650001901969650001501988650002402003650001102027650001302038650001202051650001302063650001902076650002902095650001702124650002202141650002102163650001602184653002002200653001802220653001302238653001502251653001702266653002202283700001902305773009702324856008502421852000902506655001202515IND60781493420221118175403.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078149342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDasireddy, Venkata D.B.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0665-785010aPhotocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol over bismuth promoted BaTiO3 perovskite nanoparticle catalysts  ap. 885-895.  aThe photocatalytic reduction reactions of CO₂ to methanol over bismuth-promoted BaTiO₃ chemical photo-catalyst were reported for the first measurement time. Catalysts were prepared via single step deposition precipitation/solution combustion technique. Phases/morphology were characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)/scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Light absorption spectrum/bandgap energy (Eg) was calculated using ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) wavelength diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The addition of Ba/Bi increased Eg. Comparing materials, synthesised by combusting, the latter showed a surface high basicity/water adsorption. Tests indicated the formation of alcohols. Bi-containing also demonstrated CO. No CH₃OH was found for precipitated though. Activity resulted from the synergetic relationship effect between Bi/Ti, caused by the charge transfer mechanism between these component species, strong interaction phenomena and recombination. All were stable for a long temporal period. In the presence of the Ba or Bi metals over titania, the electrons (e–) from TiO₂ form an e––hole pair separation, prolonging their decay lifetime. Ba/Bi-based TiO₂ presented produced a CH₃OH yield of 5.95 μmol gcₐₜ⁻¹ h⁻¹, higher compared to structured catalytic systems, described in specific literature reports. As opposed to hydrogen, CH₃OH is a renewable storable liquid solar fuel, not only integrating carbon capture and utilisation (CCU), but also power-to-liquid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3abarium titanate 3abismuth 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3amethanol 3aphotocatalysis 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asolar energy 3aspectral analysis 3atitanium dioxide 3awavelengths 0aPhoto-catalysis 0aCO2 reduction 0aMethanol 0aPerovskite 0aNanoparticle 0aLiquid solar fuel1 aLikozar, Blaž0 tRenewable energy.g2022 Aug., v. 195 p.885-895dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.06.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001600176245014500192300001500337520141900352592002801771650001301799650001801812650001301830650001701843650001301860650001401873650002001887700001701907700001801924700001901942700001801961700001601979700001501995700001402010700001402024700001502038773015202053856007002205856010202275990002302377852000902400655001202409IND60608619520221121005210.0190510e20180211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060861952DNAL7 a10.3791/566572doi7 aPMC59123932pmcid7 a295534922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xinyi10aFabrication of spherical and worm-shaped micellar nanocrystals by combining electrospray, self-assembly, and solvent-based structure control  ap. e56657.  aMicellar nanocrystals (micelles with encapsulated nanocrystals) have become an emerging major class of nanobiomaterials. We describe a method of fabricating micellar nanocrystals based on combining top-down electrospray, bottom-up self-assembly, and solvent-based structure control. This method involves first using electrospray to generate uniform ultrafine liquid droplets, each of which functions as a micro-reactor in which self-assembly reaction occurs forming micellar nanocrystals, with the structures (micelle shape and nanocrystal encapsulation) controlled by the organic solvent used. This method is largely continuous and produces high quality micellar nanocrystal products with an inexpensive structure control approach. By using a water-miscible organic solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF), worm-shaped micellar nanocrystals can be produced due to solvent-induced/facilitated micelle fusion. Compared with the common spherical micellar nanocrystals, worm-shaped micellar nanocrystals can offer minimized non-specific cellular uptake, thus enhancing biological targeting. By co-encapsulating multiple nanocrystals into each micelle, multifunctional or synergistic effects can be achieved. Current limitations of this fabrication method, which will be part of the future work, primarily include imperfect encapsulation in the micellar nanocrystal product and the incompletely continuous nature of the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aencapsulation 3amicelles 3ananocrystals 3asolvents 3asynergism 3atetrahydrofuran1 aSun, Yuxiang1 aChen, Yanming1 aDing, Wanchuan1 aEmory, Steven1 aLi, Tianhao1 aXu, Zixing1 aHan, Ning1 aWang, Jun1 aRuan, Gang0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Feb. 11, , no. 132 p.e56657-e56657dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/566573Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/56657/fabrication-spherical-worm-shaped-micellar-nanocrystals-combining  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02839naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015200171520132100323592002801644650001501672650001101687650002501698650001601723650001301739650002101752650001201773650001301785650001101798650001001809650001101819650001501830650001601845650001201861650001401873650001201887650001401899650002001913650001001933650001401943650001601957650001001973650001401983700002301997700002502020700002302045700002002068773012702088856008502215852000902300655001202309IND60742644020221120051040.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074264402DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90613282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeale, Helen C.10aTransposon Mutagenesis of Pseudomonas syringae Pathovars syringae and morsprunorum to Identify Genes Involved in Bacterial Canker Disease of Cherry  aBacterial canker of Prunus, affecting economically important stone fruit crops including cherry, peach, apricot and plum, is caused by the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae (P.s.). Strains from two pathovars—P.s. pv. syringae (Pss) and P.s. pv. morsprunorum race 1 (PsmR1) and 2 (PsmR2)—in three phylogenetically distant clades have convergently evolved to infect Prunus. The bacteria enter woody tissues through wounds and leaf scars, causing black necrotic cankers. Symptoms are also produced on blossom, fruit and leaves. Little is known about the mechanisms P.s. uses to colonise tree hosts such as Prunus. Here, we created transposon (Tn) mutant libraries in one strain of P.s. from each of the three clades and screened the mutants on immature cherry fruit to look for changes in virulence. Mutants (242) with either reduced or enhanced virulence were detected and further characterised by in vitro screens for biofilm formation, swarming ability, and pathogenicity on leaves and cut shoots. In total, 18 genes affecting virulence were selected, and these were involved in diverse functions including motility, type III secretion, membrane transport, amino acid synthesis, DNA repair and primary metabolism. Interestingly, mutation of the effector gene, hopAU1, led to an increase in virulence of Psm R2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aPrunus 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aamino acids 3aapricots 3abacterial canker 3abiofilm 3acherries 3afruits 3agenes 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3apathovars 3apeaches 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogens 3aplums 3asecretion 3atransposons 3atrees 3avirulence1 aHulin, Michelle T.1 aHarrison, Richard J.1 aJackson, Robert W.1 aArnold, Dawn L.0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 18, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90613283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245005400168520209800222592002802320650001602348650001502364650001102379650001402390650001102404650001702415650003002432650001902462650001302481650001702494650001702511653003402528653001402562653001702576653001902593653001902612653003002631653003602661700002102697700001802718700002102736700002102757700001902778700001802797773011902815856009002934852000903024655001203033IND60661625320221118083112.0211003e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066162532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.1109962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zi10aMicrostructure affects light scattering in apples  aThe success of long-term storage of apples under controlled atmosphere (CA) depends, amongst others, on the gas exchange properties of the fruit. As gas exchange is effectively dictated by the microstructure of the fruit, the ability to obtain microstructure data becomes critical to improve storage solutions. The current study complements scattering measurements by means of spatially resolved spectroscopy (SRS) with 3D microstructure data obtained with contrast enhanced X-ray computed micro-tomography (micro-CT). Complementary measurements with both techniques were performed on apples of different cultivars that have different optimal storage conditions and different fleshy microstructure (‘Kanzi’, ‘Braeburn’, ‘Jonagold’ and ‘Golden Delicious’). The mean reduced scattering coefficients of the subsurface tissue were calculated from SRS measurements in the 750 nm to 900 nm range at specific equatorial positions on the intact apple. Microstructural parameters such as cell size (equivalent spherical diameter), anisotropy, elongation, flatness, sphericity, object count, porosity as well as pore surface density were quantified and analyzed at the same spot up to 3 mm in depth from the fruit surface. A partial least squares regression model using the microstructural parameters as the different variables to predict the reduced scattering coefficient was built in order to identify the parameters contributing most to this relation. Both mean porosity and pore surface density showed the largest absolute regression coefficients. Furthermore, plotting the reduced scattering coefficient against mean porosity and pore surface density produced a linear relationship between the two parameters with an R² of 0.89 for both sets of data. The linear relationship suggests that the porosity of individual fruit can be determined via optical SRS measurements. This could allow to sort fruit based on their porosity, thus promoting fine tuning of the storage strategies by reducing variation in the porosity and gas exchange rate of the fruit being stored together.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aanisotropy 3aapples 3acultivars 3afruits 3agas exchange 3amicro-computed tomography 3amicrostructure 3aporosity 3aspectroscopy 3astorage time 0aDynamic controlled atmosphere 0aMetamodel 0aBiophotonics 0aContrast agent 0aImage analysis 0aX-ray computed tomography 0aSpatially resolved spectroscopy1 aVan Beers, Robbe1 aAernouts, Ben1 aWatté, Rodrigo,1 aVerboven, Pieter1 aNicolaï, Bart1 aSaeys, Wouter0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2020 Jan., v. 159 p.110996-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2019.1109963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002100188245018500209300001200394506007600406520135000482592002801832506003701860650001601897650001501913650001001928650000901938650001401947650001301961650001501974650001001989650002101999650001402020650001202034651002102046700002102067700001902088700001802107700001702125773010802142856008202250852000902332655001202341IND60572912320221207064922.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057291232DNAL7 aPMC54276132pmcid7 a284994352pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2176-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMünster, Julian10aParasite fauna of the Antarctic dragonfish Parachaenichthys charcoti (Perciformes: Bathydraconidae) and closely related Bathydraconidae from the Antarctic Peninsula, Southern Ocean  ap. 235.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: As members of the Notothenioidei - the dominant fish taxon in Antarctic waters - the family Bathydraconidae includes 12 genera and 17 species. The knowledge of these species inhabiting an isolated environment is rather fragmentary, including their parasite fauna. Studies on fish hosts and their associated parasites can help gain insights into even remote ecosystems and be used to infer ecological roles in food webs; however, ecological studies on the Bathydraconidae are scarce. RESULTS: In this study, stomach contents and parasite fauna of the Antarctic dragonfish species Parachaenichthys charcoti (n = 47 specimens) as well as of Gerlachea australis (n = 5), Gymnodraco acuticeps (n = 9) and Racovitzia glacialis (n = 6) were examined. The parasite fauna of P. charcoti consisted of eight genera represented by 11 species, with three of them being new host records. Overall, 24 parasite genera and 26 species were found in the sampled fish, including eleven new host records. CONCLUSION: Analyses revealed that the majority of the parasite species found in the different fish hosts are endemic to Antarctic waters and are characterized by a broad host range. These findings are evidence for the current lack of knowledge and the need for further parasitological studies of fish species in this unique habitat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPerciformes 3aecosystems 3afauna 3afish 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3ahost range 3ahosts 3anew host records 3aparasites 3astomach 3aAntarctic region1 aKochmann, Judith1 aGrigat, Juline1 aKlimpel, Sven1 aKuhn, Thomas0 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.235-235dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2176-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009600162300002000258520142200278592002801700650002801728650001701756650001901773650001601792650002401808650001901832650001601851650001501867650001301882653002401895653002701919653001701946653002201963653002401985700001502009700001402024700001902038773012602057856008002183852000902263655001202272IND60569782820221118020702.0170610e20170607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056978282DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b040272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiangnan10aNonmonotonic Self-Deformation of Cell Nuclei on Topological Surfaces with Micropillar Array  ap. 18521-18530.  aCells respond to the mechanical signals from their surroundings and integrate physiochemical signals to initiate intricate mechanochemical processes. While many studies indicate that topological features of biomaterials impact cellular behaviors profoundly, little research has focused on the nuclear response to a mechanical force generated by a topological surface. Here, we fabricated a polymeric micropillar array with an appropriate dimension to induce a severe self-deformation of cell nuclei and investigated how the nuclear shape changed over time. Intriguingly, the nuclei of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) micropillars exhibited a significant initial deformation followed by a partial recovery, which led to an “overshoot” phenomenon. The treatment of cytochalasin D suppressed the recovery of nuclei, which indicated the involvement of actin cytoskeleton in regulating the recovery at the second stage of nuclear deformation. Additionally, we found that MSCs exhibited different overshoot extents from their differentiated lineage, osteoblasts. These findings enrich the understanding of the role of the cell nucleus in mechanotransduction. As the first quantitative report on nonmonotonic kinetic process of self-deformation of a cell organelle on biomaterials with unique topological surfaces, this study sheds new insight into cell–biomaterial interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acell nucleus 3acytochalasin D 3adeformation 3amechanotransduction 3amicrofilaments 3aosteoblasts 3astem cells 3atopology 0anuclear deformation 0apolymeric biomaterials 0acell nucleus 0amicropillar array 0amechanotransduction1 aLiu, Ruili1 aGu, Yexin1 aDing, Jiandong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 June 07, v. 9, no. 22 p.18521-18530dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b040273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245013400201500001900335500002000354520123500374592002801609596004201637650001501679650001401694650001301708700006001721700005901781700005901840773012601899856007402025852000902099655001202108IND60732548220221122141445.0210330e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073254822DNAL7 a10.1111/avsc.125622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruelheide, Helge1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3135-035610aImplementing the formal language of the vegetation classification expert systems (ESy) in the statistical computing environment R  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIMS: The machine‐readable formal language of classification expert systems has become a standard for applying plot assignment rules in vegetation classification. Here we present an efficient algorithm implementing the vegetation classification expert system in the statistical programming language R. METHODS: The principal idea of the R implementation is to solve the assignments to vegetation types not sequentially plot by plot but to parse the assignment rules into (nested) components that each can be evaluated by simultaneous vector‐based processing of all plots in a database. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the algorithm taking the EUNIS classification expert system of European habitat types (EUNIS‐ESy) as an example. The R code version of the vegetation classification expert system is particularly useful in large vegetation‐plot databases because it solves all logical operations vector‐wise across all plots, allowing for efficient evaluation of membership expressions and formulas. Another advantage of the R implementation is that membership formulas are not only readable but can also be produced as a machine‐written result, for example as the output of classification algorithms run in R.  aPublisher supplied data  a19‐28491XcCzech Science Foundation 3aalgorithms 3adatabases 3ahabitats1 aTichý, Lubomír1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8400-77411 aChytrý, Milan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8122-30751 aJansen, Florian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0331-51850 tApplied vegetation science.g2021 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.e12562-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58701x1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.125623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001600186245011800202300002000320506007600340520147700416592002801893506003701921650001601958650002101974650001701995650001402012650001602026650001702042650002302059650001202082650001402094650002302108650000902131650001402140650002402154650001402178700001802192700001502210700001502225700001902240700002002259700001702279700001802296700001702314700001802331700001502349700001602364700001902380773017602399856007902575852000902654655001202663IND60178677020221207084800.0150604e20140729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017867702DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14118591112doi7 aPMC41217852pmcid7 a250284962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSang, Dajun10aStrigolactones regulate rice tiller angle by attenuating shoot gravitropism through inhibiting auxin biosynthesis  ap. 11199-11204.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTiller angle, a key agronomic trait for achieving ideal plant architecture and increasing grain yield, is regulated mainly by shoot gravitropism. Strigolactones (SLs) are a group of newly identified plant hormones that are essential for shoot branching/rice tillering and have further biological functions as yet undetermined. Through screening for suppressors of lazy1 (sols), a classic rice mutant exhibiting large tiller angle and defective shoot gravitropism, we identified multiple SOLS that are involved in the SL biosynthetic or signaling pathway. We show that SL biosynthetic or signaling mutants can rescue the spreading phenotype of lazy1 (la1) and that SLs can inhibit auxin biosynthesis and attenuate rice shoot gravitropism, mainly by decreasing the local indoleacetic acid content. Although both SLs and LA1 are negative regulators of polar auxin transport, SLs do not alter the lateral auxin transport of shoot base, unlike LA1 , which is a positive regulator of lateral auxin transport in rice. Genetic evidence demonstrates that SLs and LA1 participate in regulating shoot gravitropism and tiller angle in distinct genetic pathways. In addition, the SL-mediated shoot gravitropism is conserved in Arabidopsis . Our results disclose a new role of SLs and shed light on a previously unidentified mechanism underlying shoot gravitropism. Our study indicates that SLs could be considered as an important tool to achieve ideal plant architecture in the future.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aagronomic traits 3abiosynthesis 3abranching 3agrain yield 3agravitropism 3aindole acetic acid 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplant architecture 3arice 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 3atillering1 aChen, Dongqin1 aLiu, Guifu1 aLiang, Yan1 aHuang, Linzhou1 aMeng, Xiangbing1 aChu, Jinfang1 aSun, Xiaohong1 aDong, Guojun1 aYuan, Yundong1 aQian, Qian1 aLi, Jiayang1 aWang, Yonghong0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 July 29, v. 111, no. 30 p.11199-11204dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14118591113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245008700162300001600249520077700265592002801042650002301070650002301093650002201116650002101138650002001159653000801179653000801187653003301195653003701228653000901265653000901274653000801283700001801291773011201309856008501421852000901506655001201515IND60602779020221122015524.0180711e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060277902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Xi10aEstimating a spatial autoregressive model with an endogenous spatial weight matrix  ap. 209-232.  aThe spatial autoregressive (SAR) model is a standard tool for analyzing data with spatial correlation. Conventional estimation methods rely on the key assumption that the spatial weight matrix is strictly exogenous, which would likely be violated in some empirical applications where spatial weights are determined by economic factors. This paper presents model specification and estimation of the SAR model with an endogenous spatial weight matrix. We provide three estimation methods: two-stage instrumental variable (2SIV) method, quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) approach, and generalized method of moments (GMM). We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators and investigate their finite sample properties by a Monte Carlo study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic factors 3aeconomic theory 0aC31 0aC51 0aSpatial autoregressive model 0aEndogenous spatial weight matrix 0a2SIV 0aQMLE 0aGMM1 aLee, Lung-fei0 tJournal of econometrics.g2015 Feb., v. 184, no. 2 p.209-232dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2014.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245006300206300001800269520134600287592002801633650001901661650001801680650001701698650001701715650002701732650001401759653001201773653001101785653004401796653003901840700005601879773011401935856008302049852000902132655001202141IND60743994620221119072811.0210909e20210906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074399462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2021.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnders, Laramy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7569-117110aUnconventional routes to developing insect-resistant crops  ap. 1439-1453.  aConcerns over widespread use of insecticides and heightened insect pest virulence under climate change continue to fuel the need for environmentally safe and sustainable control strategies. However, to develop such strategies, a better understanding of the molecular basis of plant-pest interactions is still needed. Despite decades of research investigating plant-insect interactions, few examples exist where underlying molecular mechanisms are well characterized, and even rarer are cases where this knowledge has been successfully applied to manage harmful agricultural pests. Consequently, the field appears to be static, urgently needing shifts in approaches to identify novel mechanisms by which insects colonize plants and plants avoid insect pressure. In this perspective, we outline necessary steps for advancing holistic methodologies that capture complex plant-insect molecular interactions. We highlight novel and underexploited approaches in plant-insect interaction research as essential routes to translate knowledge of underlying molecular mechanisms into durable pest control strategies, including embracing microbial partnerships, identifying what makes a plant an unsuitable host, capitalizing on tolerance of insect damage, and learning from cases where crop domestication and agronomic practices enhance pest virulence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adomestication 3ainsect pests 3apest control 3aplant-insect relations 3avirulence 0ainsects 0aplants 0acompatible and incompatible interaction 0ahost and non-host plant resistance1 aBegcy, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5046-80290 tMolecular plant.g2021 Sept. 06, v. 14, no. 9 p.1439-1453dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2021.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245016100134300001400295520122200309592002801531650002301559650002401582650001101606650001001617650001401627650002101641650001401662650001201676650001601688650001401704650001001718650001601728650002201744650001201766650001201778651000901790653002401799653002601823653001801849653002101867700002501888700002201913700001801935773013001953852000902083655001202092IND60477729420221122093552.0160105e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047772942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRazmjou, Jabraeil10aComparative population growth parameters of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), on different common bean cultivars  ap. 83-90.  aThe two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is very polyphagous and considered a serious pest worldwide. The use of relatively resistant crop cultivars may limit the negative effects of this pest; we therefore compared population growth parameters of T. urticae reared on five commonly grown bean cultivars in Iran (Derakhshan, G14, Sayyad, D81, and Talash). The life table parameters were estimated at 25±1°C, 60±10% RH, and a photoperiod of 18:6 h (L:D). Egg hatchability, development time and survival to adult stage were similar among cultivars, but we detected significant variation in fecundity and longevity, resulting in large differences for population growth parameters like the intrinsic rate of natural increase (rₘ), net reproductive rate (R₀), finite rate of increase (λ) and doubling time (DT). Sayyad was the most favourable host for two-spotted spider mites with rₘ = 0.295 (offspring/female/day), followed by G14 (0.261), D81 (0.244) and Derakhshan (0.238). The slowest population growth was observed on the Talash variety with rₘ = 0.214. These findings indicate that the choice of bean variety will affect how fast spider mite populations reach damaging levels in a culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aTetranychus urticae 3aadults 3abeans 3acultivars 3aegg hatchability 3afecundity 3afemales 3alife tables 3alongevity 3apests 3aphotoperiod 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3arearing 3aIran 0aTetranychus urticae 0alife table parameters 0abean cultivar 0aplant resistance1 aVorburger, Christoph1 aTavakkoli, Hojjat1 aFallahi, Amin0 tSystematic and applied acarology.g2009 Oct., v. 14, no. 2 p.83-90dSystematic and Applied Acarology Societyx1362-19717nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245011700173300001400290520155300304592002801857650002301885650001901908650002201927650001901949650001501968650001401983650002301997650003002020650002202050650001202072650002702084650001002111650001502121650002702136650002602163650001102189650001302200650001702213650001102230650001802241650001202259650001402271653002302285653001402308653002702322653001902349653002202368653001902390653001702409700002102426773010102447856008902548852000902637655001202646IND60558658220221121042100.0200517e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055865822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocontrol.2016.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRondot, Yvonne10aEndophytic Beauveria bassiana in grapevine Vitis vinifera (L.) reduces infestation with piercing-sucking insects  ap. 82-89.  aFungi are important natural pathogens of arthropod pests and are successfully used as biocontrol agents in various crops. In addition to colonizing arthropods, evidence has accumulated that some entomopathogenic fungi like Beauveria bassiana can endophytically colonize a wide array of plant species. However, only limited information is currently available on the endophytic colonization of grapevines with B. bassiana and whether the fungus still maintains its pathogenic habit against insect pests.Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to optimize endophytic establishment of the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana in younger, potted plants and mature grapevine plants in the vineyard. We used two different commercialized B. bassiana strains, applied either as conidial suspensions (ATCC 74040 and GHA) or as a formulated product (Naturalis®, strain ATCC 74040) on grapevine leaves. The potential of endophytic B. bassiana to provide protection against putative target pest insects like the vine mealybug Planococcus ficus was assessed in a bioassay using surface sterilized leaves. Endophytic survival of B. bassiana inside leaf tissues of seven-week-old potted plants was evident for at least 21days after inoculation, irrespective of the inoculum used. Endophytic B. bassiana reduces infestation rate and growth of P. ficus. In the vineyard B. bassiana was detected as an endophyte in mature grapevine plants up to five weeks after last application with significant reduction of infestation with grape leafhopper, Empoasca vitis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aEmpoasca vitis 3aPlanococcus ficus 3aVitis vinifera 3aarthropods 3abioassays 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acommercialization 3aconidia 3acontainer-grown plants 3acrops 3aendophytes 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afield experimentation 3agrapes 3ainoculum 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3amature plants 3atissues 3avineyards 0aBeauveria bassiana 0aEndophyte 0aEntomopathogenic fungi 0aVitis vinifera 0aPlanococcus ficus 0aEmpoasca vitis 0aInteractions1 aReineke, Annette0 tBiological control.g2018 Jan., v. 116 p.82-89dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2016.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012600170300001600296520084000312592002801152650002301180650001501203650002101218650002601239650001301265650001701278650001601295650001301311650001901324650001901343650001701362653003101379653001501410653001701425653003101442700001201473700002301485700001601508773013201524856008701656852000901743655001201752IND60773723320221122022807.0220419e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077372332DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-4576.2022.00023.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwami, Hemant10aBio-efficacy of newer molecules as seed treatment against sorghum shoot fly, Atherigona soccata Rondani infesting sorghum  ap. 132-136.  aThe field experiment was conducted to evaluate the bio-efficacy of different insecticides as seed treatment against sorghum shoot fly (Atherigona soccata Rondani).

We find the null limiting distribution of this statistic and justify why our proposal improves over related approaches. Critical values are computed for a variety of situations. Additionally, building on this ADF test statistic, we propose a procedure to test the null of no stationary cointegration which overcomes the drawback, suffered by any residual-based method, of the lack of power with respect to some relevant alternatives.

Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) is a biological control agent of spider mites that also preys on thrips. Little is known about the biology and life table of N. californicus fed on Thrips tabaci. We evaluated the development, survivorship and life-history parameters of the Boku strain of N. californicus feeding on first instar larvae of T. tabaci. Total prey consumption by protonymphs and deutonymphs were 3.85 and 3.50, respectively. Total prey consumption during the adult period in the Boku strain was 65.1 first instar larvae of T. tabaci. Ninety percent of N. californicus eggs hatched but just over 16% of newly hatched larvae attained maturity at 25°C. Developmental time was 9.00 days with T. tabaci as prey. Oviposition rate was 2.42 eggs/ female/ day. The average pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition periods were 3.54, 22 and 3.91 days, respectively. The low estimated intrinsic rate of natural increase (rₘ) of N. californicus (0.041 per day with T. tabaci) was due to high juvenile mortalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeoseiulus californicus 3aTetranychidae 3aThrips tabaci 3aadults 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3agreenhouses 3ainstars 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alife history 3alife tables 3aornamental plants 3aoviposition 3apests 3apopulation growth 3asurvival rate 3avegetables 0aNeoseiulus californicus 0aThrips tabaci, Life history 0aPopulation growth parameters1 aFathipour, Yaghoub1 aKamali, Karim0 tSystematic and applied acarology.g2009 Oct., v. 14, no. 2 p.91-100dSystematic and Applied Acarology Societyx1362-19717nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005700145245011900202300002000321520170300341592002802044650001502072650002402087650001602111650001202127650002202139650001902161650001302180650002002193700006402213773013602277856007902413852000902492655001202501IND60749508420221118170635.0210903e20210804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074950842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c012392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pengzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4813-663910aSynthesis of AD-Dihydrodipyrrins Equipped with Latent Substituents of Native Chlorophylls and Bacteriochlorophylls  ap. 11794-11811.  aNative chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls share a common trans-substituted pyrroline ring D (17-propionic acid, 18-methyl), whereas diversity occurs in ring A particularly at the 3-position. Two dihydrodipyrrins equipped with native-like D-ring substituents and tailorable A-ring substituents have been synthesized. The synthesis relies on a Schreiber-modified Nicholas reaction to construct the stereochemically defined precursor to ring D, a dialkyl-substituted pent-4-ynoic acid. The carboxylic acid group of the intact propionic acid proved unworkable, whereupon protected propionate (−CO₂ᵗBu) and several latent propyl ethers were examined. The tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-protected propanol substituent proved satisfactory for reaction of the chiral N-acylated oxazolidinone, affording (2S,3S)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)propyl)-3-methylpent-4-ynoic acid in ∼30% yield over 8 steps. Two variants for ring A, 2-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3-Br/H-5-iodo-4-methylpyrrole, were prepared via the Barton–Zard route. Dihydrodipyrrin formation from the pyrrole and pentynoic acid entailed Jacobi Pd-mediated lactone formation, Petasis methenylation, and Paal–Knorr-type pyrroline formation. The two AD-dihydrodipyrrins bear the D-ring methyl and protected propanol groups with a stereochemical configuration identical to that of native (bacterio)chlorophylls, and a bromine or no substitution in ring A corresponding to the 3-position of (bacterio)chlorophylls. The analogous β-position of a lactone–pyrrole intermediate on the path to the dihydrodipyrrin also was successfully brominated, opening opportunities for late-stage diversification in the synthesis of (bacterio)chlorophylls.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3abacteriochlorophyll 3abromination 3abromine 3aorganic chemistry 3apropionic acid 3apyrroles 3astereochemistry1 aLindsey, Jonathan S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4872-20400 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 Aug. 04, v. 86, no. 17 p.11794-11811dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c012393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005200138245015000190300001800340500002000358520167400378592002802052596007502080596005902155596006202214596005902276596009702335596008702432650001202519650001902531650002002550650001202570650001802582650002102600650004302621650002202664650001402686650001502700651001002715700005802725700005302783700005402836700006002890700005802950773013703008856007303145852000903218655001203227IND60782934720221120162842.0220714e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078293472DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.42692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8656-531410aQuantitative contribution of the Grain for Green Program to vegetation greening and its spatiotemporal variation across the Chinese Loess Plateau  ap. 1878-1891.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA distinct greening trend is evident in Asia, especially on the Loess Plateau (LP) of China, which is driven by climate change and large‐scale land‐use‐related ecological projects, especially the 'Grain for Green Program' (GFGP). However, the specific contributions of the GFGP to vegetation greening and the variation of this greening on a large spatiotemporal scale are not yet clear. We used long‐time‐series normalized difference vegetation index datasets and climate datasets based on the double mass curve method to quantify the contributions of ecological projects and climate change to the greening trend on the LP. We found that the interannual fluctuation of vegetation change was likely related to the interannual fluctuation of climate, especially precipitation. The increasing trend of vegetation change after 2005 indicated that the GFGP, as a type of external disturbance, began to improve vegetation growth. The GFGP failed initially to make a positive contribution in the first few years because of the drought conditions in 1999 and 2005. The increased precipitation played a critical role in enhancing the output of the GFGP on the LP after 2005. Then, the contribution of the GFGP increased quickly until 2013, after which it remained stable and reached average values of 58.8% ± 19.34% and 31.7% ± 24.3% in the representative areas that conducted the GFGP and in other regions with a lower implementation intensity of the GFGP, respectively. Our results highlight the contribution the GFGP has made to spatiotemporal variation due to the spatial heterogeneity of the projects, their intensity and the effect of forest stand age.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFA0607303cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a41971045cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41571130083cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41977422cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016KJXX‐91cNew Star Project of Youth Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province in China  a2018446cYouth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adrought 3aforest stands 3aland degradation 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aspatial variation 3astand age 3avegetation 3aChina1 aWang, Yunqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3380-549X1 aJin, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5374-83871 aShi, Weiyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9152-228X1 aAryal, Jagannath1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4875-21271 aComber, Alexis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3652-78460 tLand degradation & development.g2022 July 15, v. 33, no. 11 p.1878-1891dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.42693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245009400208300002000302506007600322520165800398592002802056506003702084650002802121650002602149650001502175650001302190653001402203653002702217653001802244700002102262700002402283700001902307773017602326856007902502852000902581655001202590IND60173786320221207071643.0150603e20130820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017378632DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13134241102doi7 aPMC37522152pmcid7 a239183582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCovert, Arthur W.10aExperiments on the role of deleterious mutations as stepping stones in adaptive evolution  ap. E3171-E3178.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany evolutionary studies assume that deleterious mutations necessarily impede adaptive evolution. However, a later mutation that is conditionally beneficial may interact with a deleterious predecessor before it is eliminated, thereby providing access to adaptations that might otherwise be inaccessible. It is unknown whether such sign-epistatic recoveries are inconsequential events or an important factor in evolution, owing to the difficulty of monitoring the effects and fates of all mutations during experiments with biological organisms. Here, we used digital organisms to compare the extent of adaptive evolution in populations when deleterious mutations were disallowed with control populations in which such mutations were allowed. Significantly higher fitness levels were achieved over the long term in the control populations because some of the deleterious mutations served as stepping stones across otherwise impassable fitness valleys. As a consequence, initially deleterious mutations facilitated the evolution of complex, beneficial functions. We also examined the effects of disallowing neutral mutations, of varying the mutation rate, and of sexual recombination. Populations evolving without neutral mutations were able to leverage deleterious and compensatory mutation pairs to overcome, at least partially, the absence of neutral mutations. Substantially raising or lowering the mutation rate reduced or eliminated the long-term benefit of deleterious mutations, but introducing recombination did not. Our work demonstrates that deleterious mutations can play an important role in adaptive evolution under at least some conditions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aevolutionary adaptation 3agenetic recombination 3amonitoring 3amutation 0aepistasis 0aexperimental evolution 0agenetic drift1 aLenski, Richard,1 aWilke, C.q(Claus),1 aOfria, Charles0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Aug. 20, v. 110, no. 34 p.E3171-E3178dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13134241103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013800169300001600307520111000323592002801433650002601461650002101487650001701508650001501525650001101540650001701551650001101568650001301579650001001592650001301602653002101615653003001636653002301666653001601689700001601705700002101721773013201742856008701874852000901961655001201970IND60773723520221122023150.0220419e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077372352DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-4576.2022.00025.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Manoj10aSeasonal incidence, damage intensity and management of Ocimum leaf folder, Orphanostigma abruptalis on sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum)  ap. 145-148.  aStudies on seasonal incidence, damage intensity and management of leaf folder, Orphanostigma abruptalis on Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) revealed that the pest population was at its peak (4.4 larvae per plant) during 46ᵗʰ standard week of 2020 and the population started declining from 47ᵗʰ standard week of 2020.

Preparation of CMC from husk cellulose was carried out by an etherification process, using sodium hydroxide and monochloroacetic acid (MCA), with ethanol as the supporting medium. Characterizations of CMC were carried out by analyzing the spectra of FTIR, XRD patterns and SEM photomicrographs. Degree of substitution (DS) was determined with respect to particle size using chemical methods. Solubility, molecular weight and DS of CMC increased with decreased cellulose particle sizes. Microbiological testing of the prepared CMC was done by the pour plate method. Concentrations of heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, cadmium and mercury in the purified CMC were measured by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy technique and found to be within the WHO/FAO recommended value. A comparative study with CMC available in the international market was conducted. The purity of the prepared CMC was higher, at 99.99% well above the purity of 99.5% for standard CMC. High purity CMC showed a yield 2.4g/g with DS 2.41, water holding capacity 5.11g/g, oil holding capacity 1.59g/g. The obtained product is well suited for pharmaceutical and food additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn husks 3asodium hydroxide 3aheavy metals 3alead 3araw materials 3afood preparation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3afood additives 3acadmium 3amonochloroacetic acid 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3amolecular weight 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aarsenic 3acorn 3aoils 3awater holding capacity 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3asolubility 3aethanol 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aX-ray diffraction 3amercury 3aworld markets 3aparticle size 3aWorld Health Organization 0aCorn husk 0aEtherification 0aFood grade 0aCarboxymethyl cellulose 0acellulose 0aCellulose1 aYeasmin, Mst.

Based on series estimators, test statistics are established that allow for tests of the general model against a parametric or nonparametric specification as well as a test of exogeneity of the vector of regressors. The tests’ asymptotic distributions under correct specification are derived and their consistency against any alternative model is shown. Under a sequence of local alternative hypotheses, the asymptotic distributions of the tests are derived. Moreover, uniform consistency is established over a class of alternatives whose distance to the null hypothesis shrinks appropriately as the sample size increases. A Monte Carlo study examines finite sample performance of the test statistics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic theory 0aC12 0aC14 0aNonparametric regression 0aInstrument 0aLinear operator 0aOrthogonal series estimation 0aHypothesis testing 0aLocal alternative 0aUniform consistency0 tJournal of econometrics.g2015 Feb., v. 184, no. 2 p.328-346dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2014.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001400280520138200294592002801676650000801704650000901712650002001721650001401741650000901755650001301764650000901777651001001786651001801796700001601814700001601830773012601846856008201972852000902054655001202063IND60771132220221116170534.0220323e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077113222DNAL7 a10.1007/s11707-021-0871-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Chunyi10aCharacteristics of extreme rainfall and rainbands evolution of Super Typhoon Lekima (2019) during its landfall  ap. 64-74.  aAs one of the most devastating tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific Ocean, Super Typhoon Lekima (2019) has caused a wide range of heavy rainfall in China. Based on the CMA Multi-source merged Precipitation Analysis System (CMPAS)-hourly data set, both the temporal and spatial distribution of extreme rainfall is analyzed. It is found that the heavy rainfall associated with Lekima includes three main episodes with peaks at 3, 14 and 24 h after landfall, respectively. The first two rainfall episodes are related to the symmetric outburst of the inner rainband and the persistence of outer rainband. The third rainfall episode is caused by the influence of cold, dry air from higher latitudes and the peripheral circulation of the warm moist tropical storm. The averaged rainrate of inner rainbands underwent an obvious outburst within 6 h after landfall. The asymmetric component of the inner rainbands experienced a transport from North (West) quadrant to East (South) quadrant after landfall which was related to the storm motion other than the Vertical Wind Shear (VWS). Meanwhile the outer rainband in the vicinity of three times of the Radius of Maximum Wind (RMW) was active over a 12-h period since the decay of the inner rainband. The asymmetric component of the outer rainband experienced two significant cyclonical migrations in the northern semicircle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acold 3adata collection 3aevolution 3arain 3atyphoons 3awind 3aChina 3aPacific Ocean1 aWu, Liguang1 aQin, Nannan0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2022 Mar., v. 16, no. 1 p.64-74dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001783x2095-01957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-021-0871-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245017100170300001600341520178200357592002802139596005702167650001902224650001702243650002002260650002002280650002402300650001302324650001702337650001702354650001602371650004302387650001002430650001202440650001102452650001402463650001302477650002002490650002702510650001102537700001902548700001802567700005902585773010302644856008102747852000902828655001202837IND60604943320221120102844.0180718e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060494332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10201-018-0547-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasheduzzaman, Md.10aDetermination of dissolved and particulate thiols in Lake Biwa water and extracted fulvic acids by solid phase extraction followed by HPLC with fluorescence detection  ap. 299-309.  aThiols are important antioxidants that can modulate the bioavailability and biogeochemistry of many soft metals, although their detection remains challenging in both their reduced (R–S) and oxidized (R–S–S–R) forms. Here, a modified biochemical method was applied to determine the levels of dissolved and particulate thiols in Lake Biwa water and extracted Lake Biwa fulvic acids obtained at various depths. This method involves the use of the reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and the fluorescent label 7-fluorobenzofurazan-4-sulfonic acid ammonium salt (SBD-F), followed by solid-phase extraction and HPLC with fluorescence detection. Dissolved cysteine (Cys) (2.0–6.0 nM), glutathione (GSH) (2.8–5.1 nM), and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (1.6–4.2 nM) were detected throughout the water column but were broadly consistent at depths of 5–20 m. In contrast, abundant levels of particulate cysteine (1.3–3.5 × 10² nM) and glutathione (1.6–3.1 × 10² nM) were detected down to depths of 15 m. The particulate cysteine and glutathione were significantly covariant, and the ratios between them reflected the differences in the plankton community composition and availability of these compounds. This work also studied the concentrations of Cys, GSH and NAC in Lake Biwa fulvic acids (LBFAs) for the first time (at 0 m: cysteine, 0.8 nM; glutathione, 1.6 nM; NAC, 2.5 nM; at 10 m: cysteine, 1.4 nM; glutathione, 0.6 nM; NAC, 1.6 nM). The nanomolar to sub-nanomolar concentrations of the particulate and dissolved Cys, GSH and NAC in the lake indicates that these are an important class of ligands for chalcophile metals and may influence the distribution of plankton communities from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion of the lake.  aPublisher supplied data  a26340008cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aacetylcysteine 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3abiogeochemistry 3acommunity structure 3acysteine 3afluorescence 3afulvic acids 3aglutathione 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alakes 3aligands 3ametals 3aphosphine 3aplankton 3areducing agents 3asolid phase extraction 3athiols1 aKawaguchi, Mai1 aObata, Hajime1 aMaruo, Masahiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1060-79870 tLimnology.g2018 Aug., v. 19, no. 3 p.299-309dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3949861x1439-86217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-018-0547-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011700177300001600294520090500310536020801215592002801423596024501451596003201696650002801728650001701756650003801773650002501811650001001836650002101846650001501867650001101882650001301893650001101906650003101917650002701948650004401975650000902019650001302028650001702041653002902058700002002087700001702107700001702124700003102141700002002172773012302192856008502315852000902400655001202409IND60695943720221118235554.0200520e20200216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069594372DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14910402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShkondrov, Aleksandar12aA new tetracyclic saponin from Astragalus glycyphyllos L. and its neuroprotective and hMAO-B inhibiting activity  ap. 511-517.  aA new tetracyclic saponin, 17(R),20(R)-3β,6α,16β-trihydroxycycloartanyl-23-carboxylic acid 16-lactone 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1) together with one known flavonoid, camelliaside A (2) were isolated from the aerial parts of Astragalus glycyphyllos L. Their structures were determined by chemical, HRESIMS and NMR methods. On 6-hydroxydopamine in vitro model on isolated rat brain synaptosomes, compounds 1–2 had statistically significant neuroprotective activity similar to that of Silibinin, tested at 100 μM. Saponin 1 possessed the most prominent neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in this in vitro model. On human recombinant monoamine oxidase type B enzyme compound 1 displayed strong inhibiting activity, compared to Selegiline (1 μM). It could be concluded that the new epoxycycloartane saponin 1 could be a promising leading structure in respect of neurodegenerative diseases.  aNational Scientific Fund at Ministry of Education and Science of Republic of Bulgaria, contract No D H03/6/17.12.2016 and Medical Science Council at Medical University of Sofia, Grant No D-81/03.05.2018.  aPublisher supplied data  aD H03/6/17.12.2016aD-81/03.05.2018cNational Scientific Fund at Ministry of Education and Science of Republic of Bulgaria, contract No D H03/6/17.12.2016 and Medical Science Council at Medical University of Sofia, Grant No D-81/03.05.2018.  cMedical University of Sofia 3aAstragalus glycyphyllos 3aaerial parts 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3aantioxidant activity 3abrain 3acarboxylic acids 3aflavonoids 3ahumans 3alactones 3amodels 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroprotective effect 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arats 3asaponins 3asynaptosomes 0aneuroprotective activity1 aKrasteva, Ilina1 aBucar, Franz1 aKunert, Olaf1 aKondeva-Burdina, Magdalena1 aIonkova, Iliana0 tNatural product research.g2020 Feb. 16, v. 34, no. 4 p.511-517dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2018.14910403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245018300194300001800377500002000395520168800415592002802103596005902131596008402190596008302274650002502357650001202382650002302394650001502417650002002432650002002452650001302472650001102485650002102496650002502517650001402542650002502556650002202581650001502603650001502618650001802633650001602651650001702667651001002684700001702694700001302711700001202724700001502736700001502751700001802766773013702784856007302921852000902994655001203003IND60782935020221121083045.0220714e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078293502DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.42662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, Yanmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8956-703510aSpatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services trade‐offs among ecosystem service bundles in an alpine mountainous region: A case‐ study in the Qilian Mountains, Northwest China  ap. 1846-1861.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn mountainous areas with diverse climate, topography, and socio‐economic status, ecosystem services (ES) trade‐offs may differ largely in space. However, few researches have spatially identified the trade‐offs and influencing factors of ES in different regions. We selected the Qilian Mountains (QLM) as a study area and eight key ES [grain production (GP), livestock production (LP), water yield (WY), carbon sequestration (CS), water erosion prevention (WAEC), wind erosion prevention (WIEC), habitat quality (HQ), and sightseeing (SS)] were evaluated through spatially explicit models. K‐means clustering was used to identify the ES bundles. Trade‐offs between ES were identified using factor analysis. Natural and human drivers that influence the spatial differentiation of ES were explored through redundancy analysis. The results showed the eight ES had obvious spatial heterogeneity and could be clustered into three bundles. In the entire QLM, there were obvious synergies between most ES, especially GP, LP, CS, and SS. However, several trade‐offs existed in different bundles (e.g., HQ with GP, LP, CS, and SS in bundle 1; HQ with GP, LP, and SS in bundle 2; WIEC with WY and WAEC in bundle 3). Natural factors were the main factors affecting the spatial differentiation of ES, among which vegetation coverage, elevation, precipitation, and slope have higher explanatory degrees, but differences among three bundles were great. The influence of human factors on the provisioning and cultural services was relatively high in local areas. This study can provide references for formulating regional development strategies in the QLM and other mountainous regions.  aPublisher supplied data  a41771546cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aXDA20010302cStrategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2019QZKK0405‐05cSecond Scientific Expedition to the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aerosion control 3afactor analysis 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aland degradation 3alivestock production 3amountains 3asocioeconomic status 3aspatial variation 3atopography 3avegetation 3awater erosion 3awater yield 3awind erosion 3aChina1 aZhan, Jinyan1 aLiu, Wei1 aChu, Xi1 aZhang, Fan1 aWang, Chao1 aWang, Lanyuan0 tLand degradation & development.g2022 July 15, v. 33, no. 11 p.1846-1861dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.42663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03335naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012500166300001600291520129700307592002801604650001601632650000801648650001601656650001301672650001401685650002701699650002501726650001801751650002801769650002001797650001001817650001401827650001601841650001801857650001801875650001201893650001401905650001401919650002001933650001901953650001201972650002701984653002202011653001302033653001502046653001402061653002002075653000802095653000802103653000902111653000902120653000902129653000802138653001102146653000902157653000702166653000902173653001102182653000702193653000702200653000902207653000802216700001402224700001702238700001702255700001302272700001502285700001202300700001402312773011202326856008202438852000902520655001202529IND60558658720221121042007.0190411e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055865872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2016.09.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Zhiming10aCloning, characterization and comparative analysis of four death receptorTNFRs from the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis  ap. 288-297.  aApoptosis plays an important role in homeostasis of the immune systems. The tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) play critical roles in the extrinsic apoptosis pathways and in determining cell fate. In this study, four death receptors (DR) named ChEDAR, ChTNFR27, ChTNFR5, and ChTNFR16 were identified from the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis. These ChDRs proteins had 382, 396, 414 and 384 amino acids, respectively, with the typical domains of death receptors, such as the signal peptide (SP), transmembrane helix region (TM) and death domains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ChDR proteins clustered into three distinct groups, indicating that these subfamilies had common ancestors. mRNA expression of the ChDRs were detected in all 8 of the selected oyster tissues and at different stages of development. Furthermore, expression of all the genes was increased in the hemocytes of oysters challenged with pathogens or air stress. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the full-length proteins of the ChDRs were located in the plasma membrane of HEK293T cells. Over-expression of the ChDRs activated the NF-κB-Luc reporter in HEK293T cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that the ChDRs may play important roles in the extrinsic apoptotic pathways in oysters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea 3aair 3aamino acids 3aancestry 3aapoptosis 3adeath domain receptors 3adevelopmental stages 3adose response 3afluorescence microscopy 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune system 3amessenger RNA 3aoysters 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aplasma membrane 3asignal peptide 3atissues 3atumor necrosis factors 0aC. hongkongensis 0aimmunity 0aAir stress 0aApoptosis 0aDeath receptors 0aORF 0aUTR 0aqPCR 0aRACE 0aEGFP 0ahpi 0aTNFRSF 0aEDAR 0aDR 0aNGFR 0aNF-κB 0aSP 0aTM 0aDISC 0aPBS1 aXiao, Shu1 aWang, Fuxuan1 aQin, Yanping1 aWu, Jian1 aMa, Haitao1 aLi, Jun1 aYu, Ziniu0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2016 Dec., v. 59 p.288-297dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.09.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012200165520128400287592002801571650001401599650002001613650001601633650001301649650002201662650000901684653003001693653003701723653001901760653002401779653002101803700001301824700001301837700001501850700001401865773010501879856008501984852000902069655001202078IND60647385520221123020425.0190628e20190904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064738552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.1052042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, N.F.10aInvestigation on unsaturated critical state and Hvorslev surface of compacted bentonite under high suction conditions  aIn high-level radioactive waste repositories, compacted bentonite used as buffer/backfill materials should have enough strength and stiffness to enhance the stability of the repository and to protect the waste canisters from the surrounding rock. Therefore, it is essential to understand the strength and deformation behavior of compacted bentonite. In this paper, isotropic loading tests and triaxial shear tests were carried out on unsaturated compacted GMZ bentonite. With the results of compaction and isotropic consolidation tests, the compressibility and yield behavior under isotropic condition were investigated. Based on the results of triaxial shear tests, the stress-strain relationships and dilatancy were analyzed. The overconsolidation ratios for all the specimens were determined. For normal consolidated and lightly overconsolidated soils, existence of a critical state on the compacted GMZ bentonite was confirmed. The evolution of the critical state stress ratio with change of confining pressure was analyzed. For highly overconsolidated soils, the peak strength lies above the CSL. In this regard, the Hvorslev Surface was introduced and related parameters were determined for describing the peak strength of unsaturated highly overconsolidated GMZ bentonite.  aPublisher supplied data 3abentonite 3acompressibility 3adeformation 3aisotropy 3aradioactive waste 3asoil 0aUnsaturated GMZ bentonite 0aConstant water content condition 0aYield behavior 0aCritical state line 0aHvorslev surface1 aYe, W.M.1 aChen, B.1 aChen, Y.G.1 aCui, Y.J.0 tEngineering geology.g2019 Sept. 04, v. 259 p.105204-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2019.1052043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245016000159300001800319500002000337520157500357592002801932650001201960650001101972650002201983650001802005650001802023650002102041650002002062650001302082650001902095650002202114650001902136650002202155651001002177700001702187700006402204700001802268700002602286700001902312773013702331856007302468852000902541655001202550IND60782935220221120081824.0220714e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078293522DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.42632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThakrey, Manutai10aImpact of disturbance on biomass, carbon, and nitrogen storage in vegetation and on soil properties of tropical dry deciduous forest in Chhattisgarh, India  ap. 1810-1820.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe tropical deforestation due to biotic interference, land use change, and population explosion in Asian countries has attracted the global concern with respect to conservation and protection of forest resources. Indian soils are limited in terms of nutrient reserves and organic matters. Our present study deals the influence of disturbance on phytosociology, vegetation carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) along with soil properties of tropical deciduous forest in Chhattisgarh. The stratified random sampling technique was used for quantifying the vegetation. Results revealed that 43.75% species are rare in occurrence in undisturbed forest (UF), and in disturbed forest (DF) about 50% species showed rarity over the area as per the Raunkiaer frequency class of species rarity and commonness. Total density and basal cover were 1090 trees ha⁻¹ and 28.16 m² ha⁻¹, respectively. in UF and was 190 trees ha⁻¹ and 10.99 m² ha⁻¹ in DF. The disturbance resulted into 31.63% loss in total biomass in DF compared to UF. The increasing disturbances are altering the forests attributes in terms of poor standing stock, basal area, and diversity in DF. The concentration of dominance and beta diversity value was higher in DF. It may be increased due to influx of generalist species in DF. Stand biomass was found to be 3‐times higher in UF than the DF. Higher value of C and N stock and soil nutrient were found in UF. Thus, proper conservation, protection, and restoration of these forests should be the priority to improve the C pool and ecological services.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adeciduous forests 3adeforestation 3aforest damage 3aland degradation 3aland use change 3anitrogen 3aphytosociology 3apopulation growth 3asoil nutrients 3aspecies diversity 3aIndia1 aSingh, Lalji1 aJhariya, Manoj Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5661-49041 aTomar, Anurag1 aSingh, Akhilesh Kumar1 aToppo, Shalini0 tLand degradation & development.g2022 July 15, v. 33, no. 11 p.1810-1820dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.42633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03785naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012300167300001400290520155500304536043501859592002802294596009802322650001602420650001802436650002302454650001702477650001502494650001302509650002802522650001202550650001302562650001602575650001302591650000902604650001402613650001002627650002302637650002202660650001402682650001602696650000702712650001202719650002802731650000902759650001302768653002402781653002302805653001402828653002502842700003802867700001802905700001602923700001402939773012402953856008503077852000903162655001203171IND60695943920221118235658.0200520e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069594392DNAL7 a10.1080/1745039X.2019.16394432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Qian10aEffects of dietary alpha-ketoglutarate on bacteria profiles in the faeces of lactating sows and their suckling piglets  ap. 39-56.  aThe aim of the study was to investigate the effects of dietary alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) on the faecal bacteria composition of suckling piglets after supplementation of AKG to the diet of lactating sows. After farrowing, the sows were assigned to either a normal lactation diet (control group, n = 12) or a diet supplemented with 0.25% AKG (AKG group, n = 12) based on body weight (BW) and parity. During the 21-d suckling period, BW and diarrhoea occurrences of piglets were recorded daily, while faeces were sampled weekly from sows and piglets. The levels of pH, ammonia, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactate in the faeces of piglets were determined. In particular, bacteria profiles in faeces of sows and their suckling piglets were examined by Illumina sequencing. The results showed that the AKG diet altered the faecal bacteria composition in sows during the 21-d lactation period, leading to increases (p < 0.05) in the abundances of genera Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Methanobrevibacter, but decreases (p < 0.05) in the abundances of genera Oscillospira and Dorea. AKG supplement to the sows during lactation indirectly enhanced (p < 0.05) bacterial richness and SCFA levels (especially, acetate) in the faeces of piglets during the 21-d suckling period. It is suggested that maternal AKG supplementation alters the composition of faecal bacteria in the sows, and increases the faecal bacteria richness and acetate levels in the piglets, which might be associated with an enhanced growth performance of piglets.  aThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Hunan Province (2016JJ1015), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31472107), the Chinese Academy of Sciences “Hundred Talent” award (Y451022111) and the Open Foundation of Key Laboratory of Agro-ecological Processes in Subtropical Region, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISA2016101).  aPublisher supplied data  a31472107cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aBacteroides 3aLactobacillus 3aMethanobrevibacter 3aOscillospira 3aPrevotella 3aacetates 3aalpha-ketoglutaric acid 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abody weight 3adiarrhea 3adiet 3afarrowing 3afeces 3agrowth performance 3alactating females 3alactation 3alactic acid 3apH 3apiglets 3ashort chain fatty acids 3asows 3asuckling 0aAlpha-ketoglutarate 0afaeces composition 0asucklings 0avolatile fatty acids1 aAdebowale, Tolulope Oluwadamilare1 aTian, Junquan1 aYin, Yulong1 aYao, Kang0 tArchives of animal nutrition.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 74, no. 1 p.39-56dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000052x1477-28177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1745039X.2019.16394433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100003400186245009500220300002000315506007600335520147500411592002801886506003701914650003101951650002701982650001902009650001402028650001702042650001502059650001502074650001702089650003002106653001502136653001602151700002402167700001702191700003102208700002102239700002402260700001902284700002002303700001502323700002102338700002202359700002202381700002102403773017602424856007902600852000902679655001202688IND60173786820221207071638.0150603e20130827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017378682DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12217401102doi7 aPMC37616312pmcid7 a239403482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Windt, Gerritje J.

However, the mechanisms that allow this rapid recall are not completely understood. We found that CD8 T M cells have more mitochondrial mass than CD8 T N cells and, that upon activation, the resulting secondary effector T (T E) cells proliferate more quickly, produce more cytokines, and maintain greater ATP levels than primary effector T cells. We also found that after activation, T M cells increase oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis and sustain this increase to a greater extent than T N cells, suggesting that greater mitochondrial mass in T M cells not only promotes oxidative capacity, but also glycolytic capacity. We show that mitochondrial ATP is essential for the rapid induction of glycolysis in response to activation and the initiation of proliferation of both T N and T M cells. We also found that fatty acid oxidation is needed for T M cells to rapidly respond upon restimulation. Finally, we show that dissociation of the glycolysis enzyme hexokinase from mitochondria impairs proliferation and blocks the rapid induction of glycolysis upon T-cell receptor stimulation in T M cells. Our results demonstrate that greater mitochondrial mass endows T M cells with a bioenergetic advantage that underlies their ability to rapidly recall in response to reinfection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abeta oxidation 3acytokines 3adissociation 3aglycolysis 3ahexokinase 3amitochondria 3aoxidative phosphorylation 0ametabolism 0alymphocytes1 aO’Sullivan, David1 aEverts, Bart1 aHuang, Stanley Ching-Cheng1 aBuck, Michael D.1 aCurtis, Jonathan D.1 aZhang, Zhihao,1 aSmith, Amber M.1 aAi, Teresa1 aFaubert, Brandon1 aJones, Russell G.1 aPearce, Edward J.1 aPearce, Erika L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Aug. 27, v. 110, no. 35 p.14336-14341dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12217401103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01506naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245014100133300001600274520043100290592002800721650002400749650001800773650001000791650001000801650001600811651001100827651000900838651002400847651001600871651001800887653001000905653001800915653001600933653002000949700002200969773013200991852000901123655001201132IND60477730120221119060504.0160105e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047773012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhi-Qiang10aFilling the gap in distribution of the genus Sonotetranychus (Acari: Tetranychidae) with a description of a new species from New Zealand  ap. 161-170.  aThe genus Sonotetranychus Tuttle, Baker & Abbatiello, 1976 (Acari: Tetranychidae), previously known from the Americas, Africa and Asia, is for the first time recorded from Australasia.

Such a cationic dendronization was verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. For the resultant amylose conjugates with various contents and generations of PAMAM dendron, their buffering capacity, binding ability with plasmid DNA and in vitro cytotoxicity were investigated. These amylose conjugates were found to exhibit good buffering capacity and biocompatibility. In particular, they could condense effectively plasmid DNA into the nanocomplexes, as confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, zeta potential, and particle size analyses as well as transmission electron microscopy observation. For their nanocomplexes with plasmid DNA, the in vitro transfection properties in human embryonic kidney 293T cells were studied by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. It was found that the transfection efficiency could be optimized by the dendronization extent of amylose and the complexation extent of dendronized amylose with plasmid DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagarose 3aamylose 3abinding capacity 3abiocompatibility 3abuffering capacity 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3ahumans 3akidneys 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size 3aplasmids 3apotato starch 3atransfection 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aAmylose 0aCationic dendronization 0aClick conjugation 0aPlasmid DNA 0aGene delivery1 aLin, Jiantao1 aZhuang, Baoxiong1 aLi, Xiaojun1 aZhang, Li-Ming0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Aug., v. 79 p.209-216dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.04.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245008400163300002000247520054300267592002800810650001600838650002300854650001300877650001000890650002200900650002800922650001300950650002100963700001300984700001600997700001501013700005701028700001901085773013601104856007901240852000901319655001201328IND60749509120221118170859.0210903e20210809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074950912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c012902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Yu-Ming10aPhotoinduced Acetylation of Anilines under Aqueous and Catalyst-Free Conditions  ap. 12344-12353.  aA green and efficient visible-light induced functionalization of anilines under mild conditions has been reported.

This study investigated the venom proteomes of both species through a protein decomplexation strategy, applying C₁₈ reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and protein identification through nano-electrospray ionization liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-LCMS/MS) of trypsin-digested peptides. The venom antigenicity was profiled against the Thai Green Pit Viper Antivenom (GPVAV, a hetero-specific antivenom), using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The venom proteomes of T. wiroti and T. puniceus consisted of 10 and 12 toxin families, respectively. The major proteins were of diverse snake venom serine proteases (19–30% of total venom proteins), snake venom metalloproteinases (17–26%), disintegrins (9–16%), phospholipases A₂ (8–28%) and C-type lectins (~8%). These were putative snake toxins implicated in hemorrhage and coagulopathy, consistent with clinical hemotoxicity. GPVAV showed strong immunorecognition toward high and medium molecular weight proteins (e.g., SVMP and PLA₂) in both venoms, while a lower binding activity was observed toward small proteins such as disintegrins. Conserved antigenicity in the major hemotoxins supported toxicity cross-neutralization by GPVAV and indicated that the immunorecognition of low molecular weight toxins may be optimized for improved binding efficacy. Taken together, the study provides insights into the pathophysiology and antivenom treatment of envenomation caused by T. wiroti and T. puniceus in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrimeresurus 3aantivenoms 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahemorrhage 3aionization 3alectins 3ametalloproteinases 3amolecular weight 3apathophysiology 3apeptides 3aphospholipases 3aphysiology 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aserine proteinases 3asnakes 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3aIndonesia 3aMalaysia 0aCraspedocephalus 0aHemotoxin 0aGreen pit viper antivenom 0aVenomics 0aImmunorecognition1 aTan, Kae Yi1 aTan, Choo Hock0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Dec., v. 40 p.100875-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1008753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013900170520160900309592002801918650001601946650001701962650001901979650001701998650002302015650001102038650002002049650001902069650001002088650001402098650001102112650001602123651001202139651001702151653001602168653002502184653002102209653002002230653001202250653002402262700002402286700002302310700002602333700002302359700002002382700002202402773010502424856008502529852000902614655001202623IND60647385820221123042316.0220207e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064738582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2019.1085362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEid, Ebrahem M.10aEffect of the conversion of mangroves into shrimp farms on carbon stock in the sediment along the southern Red Sea coast, Saudi Arabia  aThe conservation of coastal ecosystems and specially mangroves ‘‘blue carbon’’ is receiving more attention as consequence of their recognition as high ecosystem carbon stocks and for the fact that these areas are undergoing land conversion. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of land use changes due to conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms on the bulk density (SBD), organic carbon (SOC) concentration, and SOC stock in the sediments along the southern Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast. Shrimp farms and mangrove locations showed significant (P < 0.001) differences in SBD with high mean values in the sediments of shrimp farms. Shrimp farms and mangrove locations showed significant (P < 0.001) SOC concentration differences with high mean values in the sediments of mangroves. Considering the whole depth of sediment interval (0-100 cm), the highest value of SOC stock was recorded at mangroves (29.2 kg C m⁻²) and the lowest was identified at the locations of shrimp farms (19.9 kg C m⁻²). The results show that SOC stock of mangroves is 147% higher than that of shrimp farms confirming the fact that anthropogenic factors contributed significantly to SOC stock decrease. The mean cumulative potential carbon dioxide (CO₂) emission due to loss soil carbon stock from mangrove conversion to the shrimp ponds was 34.9 kg CO₂ m⁻². In conclusion, the conversion of mangroves into shrimp farms contributed to the loss of SOC stock, therefore, the preservation of mangrove areas has an important value especially in arid areas such as Saudi Arabia.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue carbon 3abulk density 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3acoastal ecosystems 3acoasts 3aland use change 3aorganic carbon 3aponds 3asediments 3ashrimp 3asoil carbon 3aRed Sea 3aSaudi Arabia 0aBlue carbon 0aCarbon sequestration 0aCoastal wetlands 0aLand use change 0aRed Sea 0aShrimp aquacultures1 aArshad, Muḥammad,1 aShaltout, Kamal H.1 aEl-Sheikh, Mohamed A.1 aAlfarhan, Ahmed H.1 aPicó, Yolanda,1 aBarceló, Damià,0 tEnvironmental research.g2019 Sept., v. 176 p.108536-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.1085363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245013000169300001600299520130700315592002801622650002601650650002301676650002001699650001201719650001001731650001401741650000901755650002501764650000901789650002201798650002101820650001201841650001401853650001001867650001001877700003201887700002601919700002701945700002601972773008501998856004802083852000902131655001202140IND4473915920221121011845.0120726e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447391592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-012-0655-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Sindynara10aGenetic control of resistance to Meloidogyne incognita race 1 in the Brazilian common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cv. Aporé  ap. 867-873.  aThe use of resistant cultivars is one of the best methods for nematode control and reduction of economic losses caused by these pathogens. Studies of inheritance of nematode resistance in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) are nonetheless scarce. The present paper reports on the estimation of genetic parameters associated with resistance to the root nematode Meloidogyne incognita race 1 in common beans. Two contrasting bean lines, ‘Aporé’ (P1 = nematode resistant) e ‘Macarrão Rasteiro Conquista’ (P2 = susceptible), and the generations F1 (P1 × P2), F2 (P1 × P2), BC1(P1) = (F1 × P1) and BC1(P2) = (F1 × P2), were assessed 45 days after nematode inoculation, through a scale related to the number of eggs per gram of root tissue. Dominant genetic effects were inferior in magnitude to additive effects, indicating incomplete dominance of nematode resistance. Dominance was in the direction of increased nematode resistance (i.e., lower number of eggs per g root). Resistance to Meloidogyne incognita race 1 in common bean is under control of a single gene locus, with incomplete dominance of the resistance allele present in ‘Aporé’, but modifier genes affecting its expression appear to be present in the susceptible parent ‘Macarrão Rasteiro Conquista’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aadditive effect 3aalleles 3abeans 3acultivars 3aeggs 3aincomplete dominance 3aloci 3amodifiers (genes) 3anematode control 3aparents 3apathogens 3araces 3aroots1 aGomes, Luiz Antonio Augusto1 aMaluf, Wilson Roberto1 aFurtini, Isabela Volpi1 aCampos, Vicente Paulo0 tEuphytica.g2012 Aug., v. 186, no. 3 p.867-873dSpringer-Verlagx0014-23367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-012-0655-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245013300211300002000344506007600364520155600440592002801996506003702024650001902061650002502080650001802105650001702123650001702140650002102157650001302178650001102191650004302202650001102245650001202256650002102268650003102289650001602320650001402336650002502350650002102375653001702396653001802413700001902431700002502450700001702475700002002492700001902512700001902531700002102550700002202571700002902593700002102622700002002643700002202663773017602685856007902861852000902940655001202949IND60173787020221207111116.0150603e20130827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017378702DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12226471102doi7 aPMC37616332pmcid7 a239464262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChua, Eric Chern-Pin10aExtensive diversity in circadian regulation of plasma lipids and evidence for different circadian metabolic phenotypes in humans  ap. 14468-14473.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe circadian system regulates daily rhythms in lipid metabolism and adipose tissue function. Although disruption of circadian clock function is associated with negative cardiometabolic end points, very little is known about interindividual variation in circadian-regulated metabolic pathways. Here, we used targeted lipidomics-based approaches to profile the time course of 263 lipids in blood plasma in 20 healthy individuals. Over a span of 28 h, blood was collected every 4 h and plasma lipids were analyzed by HPLC/MS. Across subjects, about 13% of lipid metabolites showed circadian variation. Rhythmicity spanned all metabolite classes examined, suggesting widespread circadian control of lipid-mediated energy storage, transport, and signaling. Intersubject agreement for lipids identified as rhythmic was only about 20%, however, and the timing of lipid rhythms ranged up to 12 h apart between individuals. Healthy subjects therefore showed substantial variation in the timing and strength of rhythms across different lipid species. Strong interindividual differences were also observed for rhythms of blood glucose and insulin, but not cortisol. Using consensus clustering with iterative feature selection, subjects clustered into different groups based on strength of rhythmicity for a subset of triglycerides and phosphatidylcholines, suggesting that there are different circadian metabolic phenotypes in the general population. These results have potential implications for lipid metabolism disorders linked to circadian clock disruption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipose tissue 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood glucose 3ablood lipids 3ablood plasma 3acircadian rhythm 3acortisol 3aenergy 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3alipid metabolism 3alipid metabolism disorders 3ametabolites 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylcholines 3atriacylglycerols 0ametabolomics 0achronobiology1 aShui, Guanghou1 aLee, Ivan Tian-Guang1 aLau, Pauline1 aTan, Luuan-Chin1 aYeo, Sing-Chen1 aLam, Buu Duyen1 aBulchand, Sarada1 aSummers, Scott A.1 aPuvanendran, Kathiravelu1 aRozen, Steven G.1 aWenk, Markus R.1 aGooley, Joshua J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Aug. 27, v. 110, no. 35 p.14468-14473dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12226471103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011600168300001600284520131200300592002801612650001301640650001201653650001301665650002201678650001301700650001301713650001301726650001501739650001101754650002201765650001001787650001201797650001501809650002201824653001201846653001501858653001101873653001001884653001101894653001501905700002201920700002801942700001701970700001601987700002102003773011602024856008602140852000902226655001202235IND60551909220221116161401.0161019e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055190922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.04.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaya, Murat10aFirst chitin extraction from Plumatella repens (Bryozoa) with comparison to chitins of insect and fungal origin  ap. 126-132.  aChitin immediately suggests the representatives of the kingdom Fungi, as well as such phyla as Annelida, Mollusca, Porifera, Cnidaria and, mostly, Arthropoda. Although Bryozoa also represents a chitin-containing phylum, no study has been developed yet on the isolation or characterization of the chitin from it. In this study, physiochemical properties of the chitin isolated from Plumatella repens belonging to the phylum Bryozoa was determined for the first time. The chitin structure was also studied comparatively by isolating chitin from an insect species (Palomena prasina) of the phylum Arthropoda, and Fomes fomentarius belonging to the kingdom Fungi. It was observed that the bryozoan chitin was in the α form, as in the arthropod and fungal chitins. The chitin contents in the dry weight of the bryozoan, fungal and insect species were observed to be 13.3%, 2.4%, and 10.8%, respectively. The insect chitin exhibited the highest thermal stability followed by that of the bryozoan and then the fungal chitins. Surface morphologies reveal that the insect and bryozoan chitins were composed of nano fibre and pore structures, whereas the fungal chitin had no pores or fibres. The crystallinity of the insect chitin (CrI=84.9%) was higher than the bryozoan (CrI=60.1%) and fungal chitins (CrI=58.5%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnelida 3aBryozoa 3aCnidaria 3aFomes fomentarius 3aMollusca 3aPalomena 3aPorifera 3aarthropods 3achitin 3acrystal structure 3afungi 3ainsects 3ananofibers 3athermal stability 0aBryozoa 0aPlumatella 0aInsect 0aFungi 0aChitin 0aExtraction1 aBaublys, Vykintas1 aŠatkauskienė, Ingrida1 aAkyuz, Bahar1 aBulut, Esra1 aTubelytė, Vaida0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2015 Aug., v. 79 p.126-132dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.04.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011500163300001600278520089400294592002801188650001301216650001501229650001501244650001801259650002301277650001501300650001901315650002401334650002101358650002101379650002401400650002201424653002401446653003401470653002901504653002501533653001501558653001501573700001601588700001501604700001801619700001501637700005701652773011401709856008501823852000901908655001201917IND60622609720221118054137.0190328e20190125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062260972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2018.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Yu10aAdsorption of poly(vinyl alcohol) on gel permeation chromatography columns depends on the degree of hydrolysis  ap. 138-143.  aBoth fully (98%) and partially (88%) hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) are characterized by aqueous gel permeation chromatography (GPC) coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering. Polymer adsorption on hydrophilic GPC columns is observed for partially hydrolyzed PVA but not for fully hydrolyzed PVA, which is driven by the hydrophobic interactions between the residual acetate groups on PVA and the stationary phase. Desorption of these partially hydrolyzed PVA chains from the packing materials is monitored by decay of the light scattering signal. It is found that the desorption of these polymer chains from porous particles is non-exponential and follows stretched exponential kinetics with index 0.36. It is also shown that asymmetric flow field flow fractionation can be successfully used for the molar mass characterization of PVA, irrespective of the degree of hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aadsorption 3adesorption 3afractionation 3agel chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3alight scattering 3amolecular weight 3apackaging materials 3apolyvinyl alcohol 0aPoly(vinyl alcohol) 0aGel permeation chromatography 0aField flow fractionation 0aDegree of hydrolysis 0aAdsorption 0aDesorption1 aWu, Xiaoxue1 aChen, Quan1 aJi, Xiangling1 aBo, Shuqin1 aLiu, Yonggang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0884-24780 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Jan. 25, v. 1585 p.138-143dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.11.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013300164520192300297592002802220650001502248650001902263650001902282650001902301650001002320650001902330650002302349650001402372650003002386650002002416650002202436650001002458650001802468650002002486650002702506653002502533653002602558653003602584653001402620653001702634700001702651700002102668700001702689700001802706773012002724856008202844852000902926655001202935IND60743995820221119073210.0220614e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074399582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1008762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gen-Ceng10aIdentification and expression profiling of chemosensory membrane protein genes in Achelura yunnanensis (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae)  aDuring the past decade, antennal transcriptome sequencing has been applied to at least 50 species from 16 families of the Lepidoptera order of insects, emphasizing the identification and characterization of chemosensory–related genes. However, little is known about the chemosensory genes in the Zygaenidae family of Lepidoptera. Herein, we report the transmembrane protein gene repertoires involved in chemoreception from Achelura yunnanensis (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae) through transcriptome sequencing, bioinformatics, phylogenetics and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approaches. Transcriptome analysis led to the generation of 555.47 million clean reads and accumulation of 83.30 gigabases of data. From this transcriptome, 132 transcripts encoding 69 odorant receptors (ORs), 33 gustatory receptors (GRs), 26 ionotropic receptors (IRs), and four sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) were identified, 69 of which were full–length sequences. Notably, the number of SNMPs in A. yunnanensis was the largest set in Lepidoptera to date. Phylogenetic analysis combined with sequence homology highlighted several conserved groups of chemoreceptors, including pheromone receptors (a so-called pheromone receptor (PR) clade: AyunOR50 and novel PR members: AyunOR39 and OR40), a phenylacetaldehyde–sensing OR (AyunOR28), carbon dioxide receptors (AyunGR1–3), and antennal IRs (13 A–IRs). In addition, a Zygaenidae–specific OR expansion was observed, including 15 A. yunnanensis members. Expression profiles revealed 99 detectable chemosensory genes in the antennae and 20 in the reproductive tissues, some of which displayed a sex-biased expression. This study identifies potential olfactory molecular candidates for sensing sex pheromones, phenylacetaldehyde or other odorants, and provides preliminary evidence for the putative reproductive function of chemosensory membrane protein genes in A. yunnanensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZygaenidae 3abioinformatics 3acarbon dioxide 3achemoreceptors 3agenes 3aodor compounds 3aphenylacetaldehyde 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asensory neurons 3asequence homology 3ataste 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atransmembrane proteins 0aAchelura yunnanensis 0aChemosensory receptor 0aSensory neuron membrane protein 0aOlfaction 0aReproduction1 aNuo, Shu-Mei1 aWang, Zheng-Quan1 aYang, An-Jin1 aLiu, Nai-Yong0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Dec., v. 40 p.100876-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1008763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03124naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009200177300001300269520185800282592002802140650001202168650002002180650001802200650002102218650001602239650002402255650001802279650001502297650001302312650001602325650001502341650001002356650001802366650002102384653001202405653000902417700002202426700002502448773012302473856008502596852000902681655001202690IND60695944320221118235808.0200520e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069594432DNAL7 a10.1080/1745039X.2019.16872492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenfelder-Kuon, Pia10aEffect of microbial phytase supplementation on P digestibility in pigs: a meta-analysis  ap. 1-18.  aThe objectives of this meta-analysis were to determine to which extent phosphorus (P) digestibility and digestible P concentration in pig diets were increased by phytase supplementation and to quantify factors that potentially influence effects of phytase supplementation. A data set with a total of 547 data lines was compiled from 88 experiments published in 74 peer-reviewed papers between 2007 and April 2019. An exponential model was determined as more suitable to describe the response of P digestibility to phytase supplementation than a polynomial model. Phytase supplementation increased P digestibility by 25.6 percentage points (standard error (SE) = 1.54) to a plateau at 64.9% (SE = 1.82). The digestible P concentration was increased by phytase supplementation in the order of 1.01 g/kg (SE = 0.102) to a plateau at 2.62 g/kg (SE = 0.122). Goodness-of-fit criteria were R² = 0.780 and root mean square error = 7.55% for P digestibility, and R² = 0.691 and root mean square error = 0.48 g/kg for digestible P concentration. Consideration of further factors such as mineral P supplementation (yes or no), ad libitum vs. restrictive feeding, mixed diets vs. single feed ingredients, sex and age of pigs did not increase the accuracy of prediction in this data set. Some of these traits exhibited responses, but they likely are artefacts generated through the imbalanced structure of the data set. Effects of dietary total P, phytate (InsP₆), InsP₆-P to total P ratio, and Ca on the effect of supplemented phytase were not quantifiable. The present meta-analysis showed that responses to phytase supplementation can be well predicted although variation in P digestibility and digestible P concentration in the data set was high. Overall, predicted effects of phytase on P digestibility well corresponded to predictions made 25 years ago.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adata collection 3adigestibility 3afeed supplements 3aingredients 3amathematical models 3ameta-analysis 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3aprediction 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3atotal phosphorus 0aphytase 0apigs1 aSiegert, Wolfgang1 aRodehutscord, Markus0 tArchives of animal nutrition.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 74, no. 1 p.1-18dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000052x1477-28177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1745039X.2019.16872493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01624naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245018700163300002000350520050700370592002800877650001300905650001400918650002300932650001400955650002300969650001200992650002201004700001401026700002001040700001501060773012101075856008101196852000901277655001201286IND60550494420221119143658.0160911e20151218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055049442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b018712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Huayin10aChemo- and Enantioselective Addition and β-Hydrogen Transfer Reduction of Carbonyl Compounds with Diethylzinc Reagent in One Pot Catalyzed by a Single Chiral Organometallic Catalyst  ap. 12614-12619.  aUsing a single chiral phosphoramide–Zn(II) complex as the catalyst, the asymmetric β-H transfer reduction of aromatic α-trifluoromethyl ketones and enantioselective addition of aromatic aldehydes with Et₂Zn in one pot were successfully realized, affording the corresponding additive products of secondary alcohols in high yields (up to 99%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee) and the reduction products of α-trifluoromethyl alcohols in good to excellent yields with up to 77% ee.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3acarbonyl compounds 3acatalysts 3aenantioselectivity 3aketones 3aorganic chemistry1 aZong, Hua1 aBian, Guangling1 aSong, Ling0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2015 Dec. 18, v. 80, no. 24 p.12614-12619dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.5b018713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008100167520114600248592002801394650001501422650001701437650002201454650000901476650001401485650002401499650001001523650003001533650001301563650001601576650002101592650001501613650001401628650000901642650001601651651001001667653001801677653001401695653002001709653002301729653003101752700005801783700001601841700001401857700001801871700005601889773009901945856008502044852000902129655001202138IND60743996120221119073134.0210820e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074399612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funeco.2021.1010902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Chunbo10aMycobiota of Eucommia ulmoides bark: Diversity, rare biosphere and core taxa  aBark represents a unique microbial habitat. Revealing the interactions among bark-associated microbes is important for understanding their diversity, stability, and function, and how core microbiome influences the health and production of the host plant. We used amplicon sequencing of bark from the medicinal plant Eucommia ulmoides collected across nine distinct biogeographical regions in China, and comprehensively analyzed the diversity, rare biosphere and core taxa of bark fungi. The co-occurrence network results showed significant differences in the compositions of core mycobiota in E. ulmoides bark between the nine regions. Ecological factors (e.g., temperature and rainfall) were crucial determinants of differences in the unique core mycobiota of E. ulmoides from different regions. The metacommunity-scale network indicated that Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Teratosphaeria were core fungal taxa of E. ulmoides bark. Moreover, some core fungal taxa included rare taxa in particular local communities which, despite their relatively low abundance, may play a significant role in the community structure of E. ulmoides bark.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aCladosporium 3aEucommia ulmoides 3abark 3abiosphere 3acommunity structure 3afungi 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3amedicinal plants 3amicrobiome 3amycobiota 3arain 3atemperature 3aChina 0aMetacommunity 0aRare taxa 0aCore microbiota 0aEcological factors 0aPlant-microbe interactions1 aZhang, Zhiyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2031-75181 aShao, Qiuyu1 aYao, Ting1 aLiang, Zongqi1 aHan, Yanfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8646-39750 tFungal ecology.g2021 Oct., v. 53 p.101090-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000080x1754-50487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2021.1010903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001400145245011000159300002000269520060500289592002800894650001600922650002200938650002000960650002000980700001701000700001801017700001301035700001501048700005301063700005801116700005901174700005301233773013601286856007901422852000901501655001201510IND60749509520221118170853.0210903e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074950952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c013252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fang10aN,N,N’,N’-Tetramethylethylenediamine-Enabled Photoredox-Catalyzed C–H Methylation of N-Heteroarenes  ap. 11905-11914.  aAiming at the valuable methylation process, readily available and inexpensive N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) was first identified as a new methyl source in photoredox-catalyzed transformation in this work.

Their effects have been studied using a targeted approach in the laboratory, several parameters were tested, the biochemical metabolites (proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) and the measurement of some biomarkers of oxidative stress (GSH, GST, GPx and CAT) of the hepatopancreas. The results showed actions in the same way for the two treatments types, first, on the biochemical parameters of metabolites revealed an increase in the level of proteins, carbohydrates and total lipids, while for antioxidants, results revealed triggered oxidative stress and induction of the detoxification system, with increased levels of GSH, GST, GPx and catalase activity. With a slight difference in the degree of impact, it is almost unnoticeable. We can say that the toxicity of iron oxide in its nanoscale is no less severe than its toxicity in the micronscale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelix aspersa 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3acomparative study 3adirect contact 3ahepatopancreas 3airon oxides 3ametabolites 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aresearch 3atoxicity 3awheat flour 0aComparison 0aFe2O Helix aspersa 0aIron oxide 0aMicroparticles 0aNanoparticles1 aBouanani, N.1 aBouacha, M.1 aBabouri, Y.1 aBensoltane, S.0 tJournal of entomological research.g2022 Mar., v. 46, no. 1 p.217-222dMalhotra Publishing HousewJournal:2033x0974-45767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-4576.2022.00039.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001600267520171700283592002802000650001702028650001802045650003002063650002602093650001402119650002202133650001002155650001902165650002302184650002102207650001202228650002802240650001502268650001102283650001602294650001502310650001402325650003202339650001402371650002402385773009702409856004802506852000902554655001202563IND50073173620221119090612.0140219e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007317362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11101-013-9294-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, Michael10aω-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites as inhibitors of mammalian tumorigenesis  ap. 139-156.  aComponents of tumorigenesis include uncontrolled proliferation and defects in cell death pathways, as well as increased angiogenesis, in which tumors develop their own blood supply, and metastasis, which enables tumor dissemination. Most anticancer drugs are designed to kill cancer cells but are relatively ineffective against some phases of tumorigenesis. Alternate strategies to prevent tumorigenesis are urgently required and considerable evidence has emerged that ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from certain plants and oily fish are important modulators of tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Epidemiological studies in man, as well as experimental studies in animal models and cells, have reported that while ω-6 PUFA accelerate tumorigenesis, ω-3 PUFA have anticancer properties. The over-expression of certain PUFA-metabolizing enzymes in tumors, including cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases and cytochromes P450 (CYP), has provided the impetus for studies on the roles of biotransformation products in the cancer-modulatory actions of PUFAs. Some ω-6 PUFA metabolites, including PGE₂, 5-HETE and the CYP-derived EETs, stimulate tumorigenesis by activating prostanoid receptors, nuclear receptors and intracellular signal transduction cascades. In contrast, ω-3 PUFA both inhibit the formation of pro-tumorigenic ω-6 PUFA metabolites and generate ω-3 metabolites that are anti-tumorigenic in their own right, including PGE₃ and the 17,18-epoxide of epoxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HETE). Some of these naturally occurring metabolites of ω-3 PUFA formed in human cells may be useful lead compounds for the development of novel agents that inhibit cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3abiotransformation 3ablood 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3aepidemiological studies 3afatty fish 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3areceptors 3asignal transduction0 tPhytochemistry reviews.g2014 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.139-156dSpringer-Verlagx1568-77677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-013-9294-4  aDNAL 7aarticle01320naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245010100131300001600232520018300248592002800431650002600459650002100485650001100506650001200517650001000529650001600539650002800555650001400583650002300597651001000620653001000630653001700640653005900657653001600716653001000732700001900742700002000761773013200781852000900913655001200922IND60477731020221119060209.0160105e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047773102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jian-Zhen13aAn new species of Steneotarsonemus Beer from sugarcane in Guangdong, China (Acari: Tarsonemidae)  ap. 225-235.  aSteneotarsonemus (Steneotarsonemus) saccharum sp. nov. is described and illustrated from adult females and males, and collected from Saccharum officinarum L. in Guangdong, China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aSteneotarsonemus 3aadults 3afemales 3amales 3anew species 3ascientific illustration 3asugarcane 3ataxon descriptions 3aChina 0aAcari 0aTarsonemidae 0aSteneotarsonemus (Steneotarsonemus) saccharum sp. nov. 0adescription 0aChina1 aChen, Jian-Wen1 aZhang, Yan-Xuan0 tSystematic and applied acarology.g2009 Dec., v. 14, no. 3 p.225-235dSystematic and Applied Acarology Societyx1362-19717nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245010800165300002000273520054000293592002800833650001600861650002300877650002200900650002200922700002500944700001700969700001900986700002301005700002601028700001801054700002101072700002101093700002301114773012101137856008101258852000901339655001201348IND60550494720171220000000.0160911e20151218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055049472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.5b019212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawaigher, Sami12aA Protocol for the exo-Mono and exo,exo-Bis Functionalization of the Diazocine Ring of Tröger’s Base  ap. 12006-12014.  aAn efficient protocol has been developed for the exo-mono and exo,exo-bis functionalization of Tröger’s base in the benzylic 6 and 12 positions of the diazocine ring.

However, the microstructure evolutions and their effects on the physical properties induced by alloying from hetero-atoms with different outermost electronic structures are still unclear. Here, we synthesized Nb-substituted WS₂ with various Nb concentrations showing unusual changes of optical behaviors and continuous electrical polarity reversal. The fully softened Raman mode, rapidly quenched photoluminescence, and severe electron scattering can be attributed to the combined effects of charge doping and lattice strain caused by atomic Nb doping. Three types of substitution modes of Nb atoms in the WS₂ lattice were observed directly from atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the role of lattice strain in the evolutions of optical and electrical characteristics. With increasing Nb concentration, n-type, ambipolar, and p-type field-effect transistors can be achieved, indicating the capacity of this doping method to engineer the properties of two-dimensional materials for future electronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrical properties 3amicrostructure 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3asulfides 3atransistors 3atransmission electron microscopy 0amonolayer tungsten disulfide 0ametal−semiconductor alloys 0aoptical engineering 0alattice strain 0aelectrical polarity reversal1 aCheng, Ningyan1 aLi, Mengjiao1 aZhou, Bin1 aBian, Ce1 aWei, Yi1 aWang, Xingguo1 aJiang, Huaning1 aBao, Lihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2942-892X1 aLin, Yenfu1 aHu, Zhigao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0575-21911 aDu, Yi1 aGong, Yongji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1432-68130 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Apr. 02, v. 12, no. 16 p.18650-18659dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b220043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01566naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009200170300001400262520065900276592002800935506003700963650001701000650001601017650002001033650001301053773013001066856008301196852000901279655001201288IND60774686320221207083215.0220422e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077468632DNAL7 a10.1177/026119290203002s132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlaauboer, Bas J.14aThe Necessity of Biokinetic Information in the Interpretation of In Vitro Toxicity Data  ap. 85-91.  aData derived from in vitro toxicity studies are not directly applicable in an assessment of the toxicity of compounds in intact organisms. The major limitation is the lack of knowledge of biokinetic behaviour in vivo. Since the toxicity of a compound will be determined by the critical concentration (or other dose metric) of the critical compound (or a metabolite thereof) at the critical site of toxic action, biokinetic behaviour must be taken into account. Possibilities of biokinetic modelling on the basis of in vitro and other non-animal data are discussed, and the application of the results in hazard and risk-assessment schedules is considered.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alaboratories 3ametabolites 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity0 tATLA.

There are only few data about their ecological diversity and population genetic structure available, though a deeper knowledge is needed to propose proper conservation and effective management. The aim of this study was to assess data on distribution patterns of freshwater sponges to study the connectivity of genotypes of Ephydatia fluviatilis in a river system. We sampled specimens from River-Sieg system (River Agger and River Sieg, Germany). We hypothesized that strong anthropogenic influence would cause a uniform distribution of population structures. The genetic structure of E. fluviatilis populations was analysed with a set of eleven microsatellite loci from seven locations in River-Sieg system. Besides of E. fluviatilis, three other species co-occurred (Ephydatia mülleri, Spongilla lacustris, Eunapius fragilis). In contrast to our hypothesis, we observed an overall correlation between genetic and geographic distances among populations of this sessile species, which follows a clear isolation-by-distance pattern. A significant microsatellite polymorphism and high levels of genetic divergence between populations (FST) in upstream reaches were present. These results will provide important information for conservation management of populations with limited dispersal ability in connected river systems.  aPublisher supplied data  a201408080026cChinese Scholarship Council 3aanthropogenic activities 3afreshwater 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3arivers 3aGermany1 aNitsche, Frank1 aArndt, Hartmut1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2811-35950 tConservation genetics.g2018 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.959-968dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870040x1566-06217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-018-1069-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014100170300001600311520143800327592002801765650002301793650001701816650001901833650001701852650002101869650002101890650001301911650001501924650001801939650001701957653001901974653003401993653002602027653001702053653002302070653003402093700002202127700002002149700002102169773011402190856008502304852000902389655001202398IND60622610020221119024150.0190328e20190125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062261002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2018.11.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRüdt, Matthias10aFactorization of preparative protein chromatograms with hard-constraint multivariate curve resolution and second-derivative pretreatment  ap. 152-160.  aCurrent biopharmaceutical production heavily relies on chromatography for protein purification. Recently, research has intensified towards finding suitable solutions to monitoring the chromatographic steps by multivariate spectroscopic sensors. Here, hard-constraint multivariate curve resolution (MCR) was investigated as a calibration-free method for factorizing bilinear preparative protein chromatograms into concentrations and spectra. Protein elutions were assumed to follow exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) curves. In three case studies, MCR was applied to chromatograms of second-derivative ultraviolet and visible (UV–vis) spectra. The three case studies consisted of the separation of a ternary mixture (ribonuclease A, cytochrome c, and lysozyme), multiple binary chromatography runs of cytochrome c and lysozyme, and the separation of an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) from unconjugated immunoglobulin G (IgG). In all case studies, good estimates of the elution curves were obtained. R2 values compared to off-line analytics exceeded 0.90. The estimated spectra allowed for protein identification based on a protein spectral library. In summary, MCR was shown to be well able to factorize protein chromatograms without prior calibration. The method may thus substantially simplify analysis of multivariate protein chromatograms with multiple co-eluting species. It may be especially useful in process development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acase studies 3achromatography 3acytochrome c 3aelectromyography 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alysozyme 3amonitoring 3aribonucleases 3aspectroscopy 0aChromatography 0aProcess analytical technology 0aUV–vis spectroscopy 0aChemometrics 0aBiopharmaceuticals 0aMultivariate curve resolution1 aAndris, Sebastian1 aSchiemer, Robin1 aHubbuch, Jürgen0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Jan. 25, v. 1585 p.152-160dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2018.11.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001400112245010200126300001600228520138300244592002801627650001701655650001301672650001001685650001801695650001401713650001201727650001601739650001401755650001401769650001801783650001001801650001001811650000701821650001201828653001201840653001301852653000801865653002301873653002301896700001401919700001501933773014101948852000902089655001202098IND60710331820221118072221.0200908e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071033182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, P.10aEffect of sex on the quality characteristics of nuggets prepared from spent Vanaraja chicken meat  ap. 218-221.  aThe present study was conducted to asses the effect of sex on the quality characteristics of nuggets prepared from vanaraja chicken meat. The formulation of nuggets prepared from male and female meat separately, consisted of 60% lean meat obtained from vanaraja birds of over 72 weeks of age slaughtered by traditional Halal method. The products developed were compared for various physicochemical and sensory parameters. pH and proximate parameters namely moisture percent, crude protein, ether extract and ash percent of both emulsion as well as cooked product showed no significant (P>0.05) difference however, moisture and fat content were marginally higher in both raw as well as cooked nuggets prepared from meat obtained from female vanaraja birds. The mean sensory scores for colour and appearance, texture and odour were significantly (P<0.05) higher in case of nuggets prepared from meat obtained from male birds whereas mean sensory score for juiciness was significantly (P<0.05) higher in case of nuggets prepared from meat obtained from female birds. Furthermore, overall acceptability was significantly (P<0.05) higher for nuggets prepared from male birds. Based on various sensory and physico-chemical parameters, nuggets prepared from meat obtained from male birds were selected as optimum for the preparation of nuggets from vanaraja chicken at 72 weeks of age.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicken meat 3achickens 3acolor 3acrude protein 3aemulsions 3afemales 3ahalal foods 3ajuiciness 3alean meat 3alipid content 3amales 3aodors 3apH 3atexture 0aNuggets 0aVanaraja 0asex 0aproximate analysis 0asensory evaluation1 aKumar, S.1 aBhat, Z.F.0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2012 Aug., v. 47, no. 2 p.218-221dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245009500173300001800268500001900286500000900305520170400314592002802018650002302046650001302069650001302082650001102095650002002106650002002126650001102146650002002157650001202177650001902189650002302208650001702231650001602248700002102264773012402285856008002409852000902489655001202498IND60663779920221120073400.0191226e200211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066377992DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2002.13172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReta-Sánchez, David G.10aCanopy Light Environment and Yield of Narrow-Row Cotton as Affected by Canopy Architecture  ap. 1317-1323.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aAlterations of plant architecture in narrow-row cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) using management and genetic strategies to improve light penetration into the canopy may increase crop yields. The objective of this study was to quantify how plant architecture changes affect light penetration into the canopy, yield, and yield components of narrow-row cotton. The study was conducted on a Glendale clay loam soil (fine montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Torrert). Two field experiments were established on 0.76-m rows in 1995 and 1996. Treatments consisted of the following plant architecture modifications: pruning leaves throughout the canopy, mechanical topping, trimming of branches, and temporarily opening the canopy during boll production. Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) interception and PPFD penetration into the canopy were measured when the canopy was fully developed. Seed-cotton yield and yield components by plots, fruiting positions, and strata by four main-stem node groups were obtained. Early canopy modifications simulating plant characteristics such as reduced plant height, short branches, and modified leaf shape increased light availability at the medium and upper part of the canopy. Modified canopy treatments grown at 97 000 plants ha⁻¹ reached high PPFD interception (90–97%), with leaf area index from 3.7 to 5.2. Treatments to increase light distribution in the canopy while maintaining a high PPFD interception increased seed-cotton yield by 34% due to a 26% increase in number of bolls per square meter. A canopy light environment improved during the first 3 wk after canopy closure (86–107 d after sowing) increased number of bolls per square meter by 33%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aTorrerts 3aagronomy 3acanopy 3aclay loam soils 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3amontmorillonite 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant architecture 3aplant height 3aseed cotton1 aFowler, James L.0 tAgronomy journal.g2002 Nov., v. 94, no. 6 p.1317-1323dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2002.13173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002200164245009100186300001600277520143400293592002801727650001101755650001401766650001401780650002601794650001201820650003301832650003701865650002801902650003901930650001101969650000901980650001201989650005802001700002302059700002602082700002202108700002302130700001802153773013102171852000902302856008302311655001202394IND2037325520221120100229.0181016e199310  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203732552DNAL7 a82864612pmid7 a10.1177/1040638793005004162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaley, Francis D.10aEstrogenic Activity in Forages: Diagnostic Use of the Classical Mouse Uterine Bioassay  ap. 603-608.  aThe classical mouse uterine bioassay was evaluated and adapted for routine diagnostic use in response to requests for evaluation of forages suspected of being estrogenic. Forages were extracted in acetone or 10% ethanol in acetone (v/v). Extracts were mixed with ground corn-based mouse feed. Immature female mice (n = 3/group) were fed a total of 100 g of the ground feed for 5 days. Body weights were monitored before and after the trial. After 6 days, the mice were euthanized and uterine weights were determined. Mean uterine weights were compared using 1 -way analysis of variance with preselected contrasts for individual means. Selected uteruses were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histologic examination. Control feeds, diethylstilbestrol (DES), estradiol, coumestrol, feeds with no reported estrogenic properties, and a feed that caused hyperestrogenism in cattle were tested. Moderate levels of estrogenic compounds resulted in dose-responsive uterine enlargements (10-270 ppm coumestrol over 5 days). Extremely high levels of estrogen frequently resulted in feed refusal and lack of uterine enlargement (10 ppm DES, 100 ppm estradiol). Diagnostically significant estrogenic activity was recovered from the feed known to have been estrogenic in cattle. The classical mouse uterine bioassay was relatively inexpensive, quick, repeatable, and capable of detecting clinically relevant coumestrol levels in hay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforage 3aestrogens 3abioassays 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assayxveterinary 2aDiethylstilbestrolxpharmacology 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aEstrogensxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aMice 2aPoaceae 2aUterusxcytologyxdrug effectsxgrowth & development.1 aMendez, Leticia E.1 aWhitehead, William E.1 aHolstege, Dirk M.1 aPlumlee, Konnie H.1 aJohnson, Bill0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 5, no. 4 p.603-608dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638793005004163Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02291naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009000172520134600262592002801608650001701636650003001653650001501683650001501698650001701713700002701730700002301757773012701780856008501907852000901992655001202001IND60742641320221122013646.0210624e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074264132DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90613022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCani, Patrice D.10aGut Microbiota and Host Metabolism: From Proof of Concept to Therapeutic Intervention  aThe field of the gut microbiota is still a relatively young science area, yet many studies have already highlighted the translational potential of microbiome research in the context of human health and disease. However, like in many new fields, discoveries are occurring at a fast pace and have provided new hope for the development of novel clinical applications in many different medical conditions, not in the least in metabolic disorders. This rapid progress has left the field vulnerable to premature claims, misconceptions and criticism, both from within and outside the sector. Tackling these issues requires a broad collaborative effort within the research field and is only possible by acknowledging the difficulties and challenges that are faced and that are currently hindering clinical implementation. These issues include: the primarily descriptive nature of evidence, methodological concerns, disagreements in analysis techniques, lack of causality, and a rather limited molecular-based understanding of underlying mechanisms. In this review, we discuss various studies and models that helped identifying the microbiota as an attractive tool or target for developing various translational applications. We also discuss some of the limitations and try to clarify some common misconceptions that are still prevalent in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman health 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3amicrobiome 3atherapeutics1 aMoens de Hase, Emilie 1 aVan Hul, Matthias 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 15, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90613023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245017600167520151500343592002801858650001501886650001201901650001801913650001601931650002901947650001701976650003601993650003102029650002102060650001402081650001802095653002902113653002302142653004502165653001802210653002102228700001602249700001802265700001802283700001802301700001302319700001202332773011402344856008602458852000902544655001202553IND60781490020221120170912.0220809e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078149002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1328312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Liming10aFeatures and mechanisms of sewage sludge hydrothermal carbonization aqueous phase after ferrous/persulfate-based process: The selective effect of oxidation and coagulation  aFe (Ⅱ)/persulfate-based system is promising in the sewage sludge hydrothermal carbonization aqueous phase (HTC-AP) treatment. In this study, the 35.0% removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 42.0% removal of UV₂₅₄ absorbance were achieved in Fe (Ⅱ)/persulfate-based system via oxidization and coagulation. Different organic components exhibit dissimilar oxidation and coagulation behaviors. The UV₂₅₄ absorbance (account for 66.9%) and fluorescent components (account for 61.4%) were mainly removed by coagulation in HTC-AP220 at Fe (Ⅱ)/PS dosage of 20/20 mM, while the contribution of oxidation to the removal of DOC (account for 52.3%) was similar to the coagulation. The N-heterocyclic compounds, protein-like substances, and amide group in HTC-AP preferentially underwent oxidization via carbonylation, carboxylation, and oxidative remodeling, while the arene, humic-like substances, benzene ring, and carboxylate were primarily removed by coagulation via π-interactions and Fe–O bond. Noteworthily, moderate doses of persulfate (molar mass ratio of Fe (Ⅱ)/persulfate <1:1) promoted the coagulation to remove organics, while higher concentrations promoted the oxidation process. Besides, the FeO(OH) was formed after C–O binding in sediments, and aliphatic hydrocarbons were refractory organic matter in the HTC-AP. Insights into the selective effect of oxidation and coagulation in Fe (Ⅱ)/persulfate-based system are essential for the efficient application of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abenzene 3acarboxylation 3acoagulation 3adissolved organic carbon 3afluorescence 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3asewage sludge 0aDissolved organic matter 0aFe(Ⅱ)/persulfate 0aHydrothermal carbonization aqueous phase 0aSewage sludge 0aSelective effect1 aZhai, Yunbo1 aLiu, Xiangmin1 aLiu, Xiaoping1 aWang, Zhexian1 aZhu, Yun1 aXu, Min0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 366 p.132831-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1328313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245008800160300002000248520145000268592002801718650001401746650002201760650001901782650001301801650001601814650001601830653002001846653002401866653002101890653001801911653001901929700002001948700001901968700001701987700001602004700001802020700001702038773012602055856008002181852000902261655001202270IND60569780020221118020726.0170610e20170607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056978002DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b030582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min Je10aPhotoresponsive Transistors Based on a Dual Acceptor-Containing Low-Bandgap Polymer  ap. 19011-19020.  aIn this Article, low-bandgap pTTDPP-BT polymers based on electron-accepting pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (DPP) and benzothiadiazole (BT) and electron-donating thienothiophene (TT) moieties were synthesized. Phototransistors have been fabricated using ambipolar-behaving pTTDPP-BT polymers as active channel materials. The electrical and photoresponsive properties of the pTTDPP-BT phototransistors were strongly dependent on the film annealing temperature. As-spun pTTDPP-BT phototransistors exhibited a low hole mobility of 0.007 cm²/(V·s) and a low electron mobility of 0.005 cm²/(V·s), which resulted in low photocurrent detection due to the limited transport of the charge carriers. Thermal treatment of the polymer thin films led to a significant enhancement in the carrier mobilities (hole and electron mobilities of 0.066 and 0.115 cm²/(V·s), respectively, for 200 °C annealing) and thus significantly improved photoresponsive properties. The 200 °C-annealed phototransistors showed a wide-range wavelength (405–850 nm) of photoresponse, and a high photocurrent/dark-current ratio of 150 with a fast photoswitching speed of less than 100 ms. This work demonstrates that a dual acceptor-containing low band gap polymer can be an important class of material in broadband photoresponsive transistors, and the crystallinity of the semiconducting polymer layer has a significant effect on the photoresponse characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acrystal structure 3aheat treatment 3apolymers 3atemperature 3awavelengths 0aphototransistor 0alow-bandgap polymer 0acarrier mobility 0aphotoresponse 0aphotoswitching1 aChoi, Shinyoung1 aLee, Myeongjae1 aHeo, Hyojung1 aLee, Youngu1 aCho, Jeong Ho1 aKim, BongSoo0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 June 07, v. 9, no. 22 p.19011-19020dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b030583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016400171520166900335592002802004650002302032650005202055650002502107650001702132650002002149650001802169650001802187650001402205650001102219650001302230650001402243700002002257700002102277700002102298700002302319773012702342856008502469852000902554655001202563IND60742641420221122013340.0210624e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074264142DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90613032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Chun-Fu 10aDose-Related Aberrant Inhibition of Intracellular Perforin Expression by S1 Subunit of Spike Glycoprotein That Contains Receptor-Binding Domain from SARS-CoV-2  aStudies had shown that severe cases of COVID-19 tend to have high viral loads and correlate with functional impairment of cytotoxic lymphocytes, and the features of cytokine storm syndrome are similar to manifestations of severe influenza that have been partially explained by suppressed perforin expression. To test the hypothesis that the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit the perforin expression, we determined the kinetics of immune responses of CD8+ T cells to low dose (LD) or high dose (HD) of S1 stimulation through an in vitro dendritic cell (DC)-T cell model over seven days of incubation. The cytotoxic activity and intracellular perforin expression of CD8+ T cells induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were aberrantly lower than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day three of incubation. Discrepantly, the levels of lymphoproliferation and cytokine (interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α) production induced by HD-S1-presenting DCs were significantly higher than those induced by LD-S1-presenting DCs from day four. The dose-related responses between doses of S1 and intracellular perforin expression showed a significant linear correlation with a negative slope. In conclusion, the S1 subunit may suppress the perforin expression in CD8+ T cells to decrease the cytotoxic capacity to kill spike-presenting cells in a dose-dependent manner; the persistence of antigen presentation may result in an overproduction of interferon-γ and subsequent proinflammatory cytokines. That may help explain the insufficient cytotoxicity against high quantities of viruses or highly replicated strains of SARS-CoV-2 in severe cases of COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantigen presentation 3acytotoxicity 3adendritic cells 3adose response 3aglycoproteins 3ainfluenza 3amodels 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms1 aHsieh, Szu-Min 1 aPan, Sung-Ching 1 aHuang, Yu-Shang 1 aChang, Shan-Chwen 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 15, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90613033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013200176300001600308520144900324592002801773650001801801650002401819650002401843650001201867650002501879650002901904650001301933650001601946650001201962650001301974650001501987650000902002650002002011650002402031650001702055650001702072650002802089650001202117650001002129650002102139650002702160651001502187651001002202651001102212651000902223651002502232653001902257653001602276653002102292653001202313653001202325700002002337773010102357856008502458852000902543655001202552IND60576322820221123014759.0170802e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057632282DNAL7 a10.1080/15275922.2017.13403702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomnitsas, Kostas A.10aFramework to improve sustainability of agriculture in small islands: The case of Pistacia vera L. cultivation in Aegina, Greece  ap. 214-225.  aPistacia vera L. (pistachio) is a tree widely cultivated for its edible nuts in Iran, the Mediterranean countries, China, the United States (mainly California), and some other countries. The objective of the present study is to provide a framework for sustainable agriculture in small islands, focusing on the cultivation of Pistacia vera L. in Aegina island, Greece. The framework comprises, among other elements, current cultivation practices, the characteristics of the island, pressures from other sectors such as tourism, current land uses, and groundwater vulnerability. Special emphasis is given to agricultural waste management for the production of compost and biochar and the subsequent application to soils in order to improve soil quality (e.g., soil organic matter, soil aggregate stability, water retention capacity, cation exchange capacity), increase soil carbon sequestration, and minimize the risk of groundwater contamination. Finally, the role of various stakeholders in the development of the sustainable framework is also discussed. The sustainability framework, if well designed and implemented, may identify pressures, environmental hotspots, and lack of concerted action between stakeholders and thus indicate mid- and long-term actions to mitigate impacts at various levels. The proposed framework may be also applied in other areas, and especially small islands, exhibiting characteristics similar to those of Aegina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia vera 3aaggregate stability 3aagricultural wastes 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3acation exchange capacity 3acomposts 3agroundwater 3aislands 3aland use 3apistachios 3arisk 3asoil aggregates 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3astakeholders 3asustainable agriculture 3atourism 3atrees 3awaste management 3awater holding capacity 3aCalifornia 3aChina 3aGreece 3aIran 3aMediterranean region 0aSustainability 0aagriculture 0aPistacia vera L. 0acompost 0abiochar1 aDoula, Maria K.0 tEnvironmental forensics.g2017 July 3, v. 18, no. 3 p.214-225dTaylor & Francisx1527-59307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2017.13403703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012200176300001600298520111100314592002801425650002301453650001201476650001101488650001201499650001101511650001901522650002001541650001101561650001301572650001201585650001501597650001301612650003701625650001401662650001401676653001501690653002601705653002401731653003401755700002101789700001801810773010501828856008701933852000902020655001202029IND60634398520221119190559.0200717e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063439852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaliutina, Kristina10aPressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of microalgae: Enhanced production of hydrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds  ap. 160-169.  aPressurized entrained-flow pyrolysis of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae was investigated. The impact of pressure on the yield and composition of pyrolysis products were studied. The results showed that the concentration of H₂ in bio-gas increased sharply with increasing pyrolysis pressure, while those of CO, CO₂, CH₄, and C₂H₆ were dramatically decreased. The concentration of H₂ reached 88.01 vol% in bio-gas at 900 °C and 4 MPa. Higher pressures promoted the hydrogen transfer to bio-gas. The bio-oils derived from pressurized pyrolysis were rich in nitrogen-containing compounds and PAHs. The highest concentration of nitrogen-containing compounds in bio-oil was achieved at 800 °C and 1 MPa. Increasing pyrolysis pressure promoted the formation of nitrogen-containing compounds such as indole, quinoline, isoquinoline and phenanthridine. Higher pyrolysis pressures led to increased sphericity, enhanced swelling, and higher carbon order of bio-chars. Pressurized pyrolysis of biomass has a great potential for poly-generation of H₂, nitrogen containing compounds and bio-char.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3abiochar 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aethane 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apyrolysis 3aquinoline 0aMicroalgae 0aPressurized pyrolysis 0aHydrogen production 0aNitrogen-containing compounds1 aTahmasebi, Arash1 aYu, Jianglong0 tBioresource technology.g2018 May, v. 256 p.160-169dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245011500170300001600285520157900301592002801880650003201908650001501940650001701955650002201972650002401994650002102018650003102039650002402070650002302094650001602117700002502133700005702158700007702215773013302292856008002425852000902505655001202514IND60627173920221118022747.0190128e20181226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062717392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b102322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Bhagyashree D.10aEffect of Local Anesthetics on the Organization and Dynamics of Hippocampal Membranes: A Fluorescence Approach  ap. 639-647.  aUnderstanding the mechanism of action of local anesthetics has been challenging. We previously showed that the local anesthetic phenylethanol (PEtOH) inhibits the function of serotonin₁A receptor, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family and a neurotransmitter receptor. With the objective of gaining insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the anesthetic (PEtOH) action, we monitored the organization and dynamics of hippocampal membranes using multiple fluorescent reporters, which include a molecular rotor (BODIPY-C₁₂) and a voltage-sensitive probe (4-(2-(6-(dioctylamino)-2-naphthalenyl)ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-pyridinium inner salt) (di-8-ANEPPS), besides pyrene. These interfacial membrane probes were chosen because membrane partitioning of PEtOH would be reflected in the membrane interfacial environment. Taken together, we report a reduction in dipole potential and microviscosity of hippocampal membranes, with a concomitant increase in lateral diffusion in the presence of PEtOH. The reduction in membrane dipole potential induced by PEtOH constitutes one of the first experimental demonstrations on the modulation of membrane dipole potential by local anesthetics. Our results assume significance in view of previous reports that correlate membrane-perturbing effects of local anesthetics to their anesthetic action. We envision that insights into the interaction of local anesthetics with membranes could serve as a crucial link in developing a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in anesthesia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aanesthesia 3afluorescence 3alocal anesthetics 3amechanism of action 3amolecular rotors 3aneurotransmitter receptors 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3aphysical chemistry 3azwitterions1 aShrivastava, Sandeep1 aPal, Sreetama1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7153-14021 aCaṭṭopādhyāẏa, Amitābha,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2618-25650 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Dec. 26, v. 123, no. 3 p.639-647dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b102323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100002000194245008000214300001400294506007600308520206800384592002802452506003702480650003402517650002202551650001102573650001802584650001502602650001702617650001102634650001202645650001202657650001502669650000702684650001702691650003302708650001302741650001402754650000902768650001302777650001102790650001902801653001702820653002002837653001602857653003402873653001702907700002602924700002002950773009802970856008803068852000903156655001203165IND60607865420221207131645.0180830e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060786542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.01.0072doi7 aPMC47920682pmcid7 a269977512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano, Susana10aMechanism of Hg(II) immobilization in sediments by sulfate-cement amendment  ap. 68-80.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReactive amendments such as Portland and super-sulfate cements offer a promising technology for immobilizing metalloid contaminants such as mercury (Hg) in soils and sediments through sequestration in less bioavailable solid forms. Tidal marsh sediments were reacted with dissolved Hg(II) in synthetic seawater and fresh water solutions, treated with Portland cement and FeSO4 amendment, and aged for up to 90 days. Reacted solids were analyzed with bulk sequential extraction methods and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy, and synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Hg LIII- and S K-edge. In amended sediments, XRD, SEM and sulfur K-edge XANES indicated formation of gypsum in seawater experiments or ettringite-type (Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12.26H2O) phases in fresh water experiments, depending on the final solution pH (seawater ∼8.5; freshwater ∼10.5). Analysis of Hg EXAFS spectra showed Cl and Hg ligands in the first- and second-coordination shells at distances characteristic of a polynuclear chloromercury(II) salt, perhaps as a nanoparticulate phase, in both seawater and fresh water experiments. In addition to the chloromercury species, a smaller fraction (∼20–25%) of Hg was bonded to O atoms in fresh water sample spectra, suggesting the presence of a minor sorbed Hg fraction. In the absence of amendment treatment, Hg sorption and resistance to extraction can be accounted for by relatively strong binding by reduced S species present in the marsh sediment detected by S XANES. Thermodynamic calculations predict stable aqueous Hg–Cl species at seawater final pH, but higher final pH in fresh water favors aqueous Hg-hydroxide species. The difference in Hg coordination between aqueous and solid phases suggests that the initial Hg–Cl coordination was stabilized in the cement hydration products and did not re-equilibrate with the bulk solution with aging. Collectively, results suggest physical encapsulation of Hg as a polynuclear chloromercury(II) salt as the primary immobilization mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acement 3aencapsulation 3afreshwater 3ageochemistry 3agypsum 3aligands 3amercury 3ametalloids 3apH 3asalt marshes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseawater 3asediments 3asoil 3asorption 3asulfur 3athermodynamics 0aMercury (Hg) 0aPortland cement 0aRemediation 0aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 0aSulfur XANES1 aVlassopoulos, Dimitri1 aO'Day, Peggy A.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2016 Apr., v. 67 p.68-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2016.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008100164300001600245520085800261592002801119650002601147650002401173650002301197650001701220650001001237650002501247650001401272650001801286650001701304700001401321700001101335700001601346700001701362700002001379700001401399700001201413773011001425856008101535852000901616655001201625IND60572909720221118222203.0170718e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057290972DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-016-0662-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weiwei10aCharacterization of the complete chloroplast genome of Camptotheca acuminata  ap. 241-243.  aThe whole chloroplast (cp) genome sequence of Camptotheca acuminata has been characterized from Illumina pair-end sequencing.

Within species, such differences can imply suites of traits associated in syndromes. Different syndrome structures have been found within species among populations differing in the selective pressures they are exposed to. Similarly, we expect species differing in mobility to show different syndrome structures in response to similar selective pressures such as landscape fragmentation. Using butterflies originating from the same fragmented landscape, we investigated the differences in mobility syndrome between four common butterflies (Pyronia tithonus, Pararge aegeria Maniola jurtina, Pieris rapae) known to differ in their mobility. We expected individuals from the less mobile species to display a resident strategy because of high dispersal cost in this fragmented landscape, and individuals from the more mobile species to display a larger range of movement strategies. Moreover, as syndromes can only be detected whenever individuals differ in their dispersal strategies, we expected mobility syndromes to be observable only in populations where dispersal polymorphism is maintained. We thus expected stronger correlations between mobility‐related traits in more mobile species. Using three mobility tests in controlled conditions designed to measure different components of mobility, we showed that mobility‐related traits were indeed correlated only in the most mobile species. The absence of correlation in the less mobile species may be explained by a low variation in movement strategies, dispersal being counter‐selected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aManiola jurtina 3aPararge aegeria 3aPieris rapae1 aHumeau, A.1 aCongretel, M.1 aFréville, H.1 aBaguette, M.0 tEcography.g2014 Apr., v. 37, no. 4 p.378-389dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00365.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012800163520124600291592002801537650001901565650001901584650002201603650001501625650000701640650001801647650002001665650002501685650001901710653001201729653001701741653001501758653003101773653002501804700001701829700001601846700001401862700001401876773012301890856008102013852000902094655001202103IND60741512320221118103627.0211030e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074151232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1119042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yuting10aPhysicochemical, emulsifying, and interfacial properties of different whey protein aggregates obtained by thermal treatment  aTo date, few studies are found to compare the interfacial properties of protein aggregates with different structures and characteristics. In this research, different whey protein isolate (WPI) aggregates (native, nanoparticles, and nanofibrils) were fabricated, and characterized, and the emulsifying, and interfacial properties of WPI (native), its nanoparticle, and nanofibril as a function of pH values and salt concentrations were systematically investigated. The Z-average diameters of WPI (native), its nanoparticle, and nanofibril were 10, 355, and 122 nm, respectively. The isoelectric point (IEP) of native WPI was found to be approximately 5.0, whereas IEP of nanoparticles was decreased to 4.7, but increased to 5.5 for nanofibrils. WPI nanofibrils exhibited highest emulsifying activity index (EAI) and emulsifying stability index (ESI) at pH 3.0, whereas WPI nanoparticle had the highest EAI and ESI at pH 7.0. Low salt concentrations can increase the EAI and ESI of proteins. The EAI and ESI were highly correlated with the particle size, zeta-potential, and surface hydrophobicity of protein molecules. A negative correlation between interfacial tension of protein molecules and EAIs was observed regardless of protein types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3aisoelectric point 3ananofibers 3apH 3aparticle size 3asurface tension 3awhey protein isolate 3azeta potential 0aProtein 0aNanoparticle 0aNanofibril 0aStructural characteristics 0aEmulsifying activity1 aPeng, Gaofei1 aPang, Xiang1 aWen, Zhen1 aYi, Jiang0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Sept., v. 149 p.111904-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1119043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245006100167300001800228500001900246500000900265520158700274592002801861650002201889650001201911650001301923650001201936650001601948650002301964650001601987650001502003650001502018650001902033650001502052650001502067650002302082650001002105650002202115651001702137700001902154773012402173856008002297852000902377655001202386IND60663780420221120113205.0191226e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066378042DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2004.10822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeleke, Takele B.10aScaling Properties of Topographic Indices and Crop Yield  ap. 1082-1090.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aTopography controls soil water distribution in semiarid environments where water is the major growth-limiting factor. Identification of the topographic index that best represents the spatial variability and scaling properties of crop yield is important for precision farming. Our objective was to characterize the scaling properties of four topographic indices [relative elevation (RE), wetness index (WI), upslope length (USL), and curvature (CR)] and their relationships to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield and biomass using multifractal and joint multifractal approaches. Wheat grain yield and terrain data were collected at 6-m intervals along a 576-m-long transect on a nonlevel landscape with dominant soil type of Aridic Ustoll, under the semiarid environment of Saskatchewan, Canada. Results indicated that CR and RE had a fractal type of scaling only for a narrow range of moment orders. Wetness index showed a monofractal scaling with fractal dimension of 0.98; whereas yield, biomass, and USL showed a multifractal scaling. Joint multifractal analyses showed a high correlation coefficient between the scaling indices of grain yield and USL (r = 0.93). Wetness index appeared to be effective as a yield covariate only at low slope areas and depressions where it has similar scaling to that of USL. Results from this study suggested that USL was the best indicator of grain yield and biomass at any scale. The implication for precision farming is that USL can be used as a guideline for varying production inputs such as fertilizer as well as for yield prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aUstolls 3aagronomy 3abiomass 3afertilizers 3afractal dimensions 3agrain yield 3aguidelines 3alandscapes 3asemiarid zones 3asoil water 3atopography 3awater distribution 3awheat 3ayield forecasting 3aSaskatchewan1 aSi, Bing Cheng0 tAgronomy journal.g2004 July, v. 96, no. 4 p.1082-1090dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2004.10823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001900164245008400183300001600267520158100283592002801864650001001892650002001902650001201922650002101934650002101955650001101976650002201987650002902009650005402038650003002092650004702122650000902169650002502178650001302203650001002216650001902226650003102245650006302276700002002339700001802359700001702377700001802394773013102412852000902543856008302552655001202635IND2037325420221121074404.0181016e199310  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203732542DNAL7 a82864602pmid7 a10.1177/1040638793005004152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Toole, Donal10aPathology of Renal Dysplasia and Bladder Aplasia-Hypoplasia in a Flock of Sheep  ap. 591-602.  aCongenital renal disease was detected in a flock of sheep in the English Midlands over 2 successive years (1982 and 1983). A Suffolk ram was removed from the flock and test mated to unrelated Suffolk ewes in another flock; 14 of the resulting 43 lambs born in 1984 had an identical congenital renal disease. Kidneys were examined microscopically from 60 clinically affected neonatal lambs. Kidneys from 7 of the 60 clinically affected neonatal lambs (1, 1983; 6, 1984) were examined ultrastructurally and compared with kidneys from 3 healthy unrelated neonatal lambs. Most affected lambs examined (52/60) had bilaterally small kidneys (≤ 2 g) with fine intracortical cysts and distinct cortical and medullary zones. Kidneys were either grossly normal (3/60 lambs) or multicystic and of normal size to markedly enlarged (5/60 lambs). The bladder was absent or vestigial in most lambs. Microscopically, poorly differentiated (“primitive”) tubules were present in renal cortex and medulla. Proximal convoluted tubules, where present, were formed by epithelial cells with distinctive round weakly autofluorescent intracytoplasmic inclusions with the ultrastructural appearance of atypical lysosomes. Loops of Henle, distal convoluted tubules, and juxtaglomerular-peripolar cell complexes were largely absent. Glomerular changes were minimal. Cystic dilatation of nephrons was restricted to proximal convoluted tubules lined by vacuolated epithelium. This distinctive congenital renal dysplasia of sheep was most likely inherited as a dominant trait with complete penetrance.  aPublisher supplied data 3asheep 3akidney diseases 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFemale 2aKidneyxpathology 2aKidney Cortexxpathology 2aKidney Diseasesxgeneticsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aKidney Medullaxpathology 2aKidney Tubulesxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aPedigree 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseases 2aUrinary Bladderxpathology 2aUrinary Bladder Diseasesxgeneticsxpathologyxveterinary.1 aJeffrey, Martin1 aJones, Trevor1 aMorgan, Glyn1 aGreen, Robert0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 5, no. 4 p.591-602dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638793005004153Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01914naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245007400172520087600246592002801122650002801150650000801178650002101186650002501207650001001232650000901242650001701251650001701268650002301285700002101308700002601329773012701355856008501482852000901567655001201576IND60742641720221122043644.0210624e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074264172DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms90613062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayor, Jennifer 10aAntiviral Efficacy of Ribavirin and Favipiravir against Hantaan Virus  aEcological changes, population movements and increasing urbanization promote the expansion of hantaviruses, placing humans at high risk of virus transmission and consequent diseases. The currently limited therapeutic options make the development of antiviral strategies an urgent need. Ribavirin is the only antiviral used currently to treat hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV), even though severe side effects are associated with this drug. We therefore investigated the antiviral activity of favipiravir, a new antiviral agent against RNA viruses. Both ribavirin and favipiravir demonstrated similar potent antiviral activity on HTNV infection. When combined, the efficacy of ribavirin is enhanced through the addition of low dose favipiravir, highlighting the possibility to provide better treatment than is currently available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHantaan orthohantavirus 3aRNA 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3afever 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3aurbanization 3avirus transmission1 aEngler, Olivier 1 aRothenberger, Sylvia 0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 June 15, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms90613063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05669naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008800170300001600258520318900274592002803463650002003491650002003511650002003531650002103551650002003572650001203592650001303604650002303617650001403640650001403654650000903668650001403677650001303691650001203704650000903716650001103725650001203736650002303748650003003771650002303801650002703824650002203851650001403873650001503887650001003902650002203912650001203934650001603946650002803962650001203990650003704002650002404039650003404063650003404097650001504131650001404146651001204160653001804172653001404190653001204204653002504216653002604241653003704267653002804304700002304332700002304355700002104378700002204399700002004421700002004441700002004461700002204481700002504503700002004528700002804548773012104576856008504697852000904782655001204791IND60524203820221117232335.0160705e20160913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052420382DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2015.11267172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarz, Simon10aPeregrine falcon egg pollutantsbMirror Stockholm POPs list including methylmercury  ap. 886-923.  aThe role of the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) as a bioindicator for the accumulation of organohalogen compounds and other persistent organic pollutants has been established in field studies. Biometric indices for damage caused by pollutants such as the shell thickness and the shell index were determined and the egg contents were analyzed for various pollutants by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A wide range of chemically activated luciferase expression (CALUX®) bioassays were performed on subsamples of the eggs. The following organohalogen compounds were found in the eggs of 2009: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene, dieldrin, hexachlorocyclohexane, polychlorobiphenyls and polychlorodibenzodioxins and polychlorodibenzofurans, polybromodiphenyl ethers, hexabromocyclododecane, tetrabromobisphenyl A, perfluoro compounds, and mercury. The DDT metabolite, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) (11,800 ng/g dry matter), was found to be the most highly concentrated egg contaminant followed by 2,2′,4,4′,5,5′-hexachlorobiphenyl (3800 ng/g). After a past general drop in pollution level, most egg contaminants presently plateau at levels that may still exceed limit values in foods of animal origin (DDE) or even toxicological thresholds (polychlorobiphenyls + polychlorodibenzodioxins, polybromodiphenyl ethers, perfluorooctanesulfonate, methylmercury). Accumulation of DDE could be shown in peregrine falcon eggs from the uplands of Southwest Germany with elevations up to 1500 m, presumably due to its global distribution and its cold condensation in higher altitudes. In contrast, the concentration of polychlorobiphenyls in falcon eggs decreases with elevation, indicating that these pollutants originate mainly from conurbations and local industrial sites. Significant negative correlations were found between both shell index and thickness and the concentration of Hg. A deleterious effect is also evident from a no-observed-adverse-effect level of 120 ng MeHg per gram egg determined by other authors in chronic feeding studies with ibises, which resulted in decreased egg productivity and male homosexual nesting and courtship behavior. The average Hg concentration in the peregrine falcon eggs from 2009 is almost four times higher than this level. MeHg accounted for 82.5% of the Hg present in the eggs of 2009 and 2010. The cell test DR CALUX® for screening of dioxin-like activities can be used to detect not only the 29 regulated dioxin-like substances but also many other persistent organic pollutants with dioxin-like potencies, such as mixed halogenated dioxins/biphenyls. In our case, the results of bioanalytical screening methods showed no additional effect of other compounds with dioxin-like activity. Ninety-three out of 177 analytes sought could be detected in the eggs. Chlorinated paraffins, organotin compounds, some pesticides that are still in use, and phthalic esters with the exception of traces of diethylhexyl phthalate could be excluded.

It is estimated that if the current trends continue, 18% of men and 21% of women worldwide will be obese by 2025. All the current therapies are not optimal due to limited efficacy or safety; thus, there is a need for additional devices for the treatment of obesity. This study aimed to examine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a biodegradable encapsulated Epitomee device for weight loss. The technology is based on absorbent pharmaceuticals polymers and bonding materials that self‐expand in the stomach to create a pH‐sensitive super absorbent gel structure for weight loss. METHODS: A prospective, 12‐week twice daily use of the encapsulated device in patients with body mass index of 27–40 kg m⁻². Efficacy endpoints were the percent total body weight loss (%TBWL), proportion of participants with 5% TBWL and changes in cardio‐metabolic markers. Safety analysis included evaluation of adverse events, laboratory and endoscopic findings. RESULTS: Overall, 52 patients completed the study. TBWL per intension‐to‐treat analysis was 3.68 ± 3.07% (3.23 ± 2.69 kg) and 4.52 ± 2.97% (3.95 ± 2.57 kg) per protocol. No device serious adverse effects reported. The most common adverse events were headache (18.1%), viral infection (11.5%), abdominal discomfort (10.1%), bloating (7.9%), nausea and constipation (5% each) and flatulence (4.3%). Endoscopy in 26 patients revealed mild, asymptomatic gastric/duodenal erythema without erosions in five patients. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of Epitomee capsules treatment combined with lifestyle counselling resulted in 3.68–4.52% of TBWL. With continued research, the Epitomee capsules have considerable potential to become a non‐invasive, safe and effective treatment option for weight loss.  aPublisher supplied data  aEpitomee Medical provided study devicescEpitomee Medical 3aabsorbents 3abiodegradability 3abody mass index 3abody weight changes 3aconstipation 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3aendoscopy 3aerythema 3aflatulence 3agels 3aheadache 3alifestyle 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anausea 3aobesity 3aprotocols 3apublic health 3aquality of life 3asafety assessment 3astomach 3aweight loss1 aRichter, V.1 aMatalon, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1608-51951 aAbramowich, D.1 aMaliar, A.1 aShachar, E.1 aMoss, S.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PL treatment on microbial quality, bioactive compounds concentration, and water state during storage of red bell pepper fresh-cuts. Fresh-cuts were subjected to PL treatment with the fluence of 4–32 J/cm² and stored for 7 days. Results showed that PL radiation preserves bioactive compounds such as vitamin C (up to 36%), phenolics (up to 19%), or carotenoids (up to 7%) for 7 days of storage in comparison to untreated material. PL processed fresh-cuts exhibited also better free radical scavenging activity (by 23%), especially when applied fluence was 32 J/cm². PL treatment at 4 J/cm² was not sufficient to destroy microbiota. However, an application of PL at 16 J/cm² reduced tested microorganisms by 1.59–2.13 log cycles. Yeasts and molds were more sensitive to PL application in comparison to bacteria. Moreover, PL treatment can reduce the mobility of water located in the vacuoles, which is the “most available” fraction for deterioration reactions. Obtained results indicated that PL treatment with fluence above 4 J/cm² may be used for decontamination of red bell peppers without any negative changes of their chemical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acarotenoids 3adecontamination 3afree radicals 3amicrobiological quality 3aphenolic compounds 3asweet peppers 0aPulsed light 0aRed bell pepper 0aBioactive compound 0aWater availability 0aMicrobiology analysis1 aWiktor, Artur1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4058-60101 aPobiega, Katarzyna1 aWitrowa-Rajchert, Dorota1 aNowacka, Malgorzata,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Sept., v. 149 p.111906-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1119063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01423naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100002000162245006300182300001400245500001900259500000900278520043000287592002800717650002000745650001100765650001300776650001300789650001500802650001400817650001600831650001200847773012000859856009700979852000901076655001201085IND60663780620221120103643.0191122e195902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066378062DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1959.00021962005100020006x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuska, Felix V.10aResponse of Meyer Zoysia to Lime and Fertilizer Treatments  ap. 81-83.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aSynopsisMost rapid growth of Meyer zoysia was obtained when the soil pH approached a range between 6 and 7 and adequate amounts of a complete fertilizer were used.

We analyzed the relationships between attitudes and age, gender, education, occupation, years at residence, income, distance from protected area, livestock owned, livestock lost to predators and knowledge of carnivores. Three-quarters of respondents (79%) held negative attitudes toward large carnivores, while 20% were generally positive. Three variables were positively associated with attitudes towards different species: formal education (all carnivore species), years at residence (lions and cheetahs), and knowledge of carnivores (cheetahs). Attitudes toward large carnivores were not significantly related to distance from protected area, livestock owned. or livestock lost to predators. Findings suggested that interventions aimed at fostering positive attitudes toward large carnivores should focus on improving formal education and securing long-term residency for people in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acarnivores 3aeducation 3agender 3aincome 3ainterviews 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3anational parks 3apeople 3apredators 3aTanzania 0aAttitudes 0alarge carnivores 0alocal people 0aperceptions 0aTarangire National Park1 aEstes, Anna B.1 aMsuha, Maurus J.1 aLichtenfeld, Laly L.1 aDurant, Sarah M.0 tHuman dimensions of wildlife.g2017 July 4, v. 22, no. 4 p.314-330dRoutledgex1533-158X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10871209.2017.13233563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015800168300001600326520089900342592002801241650002601269650001501295650001301310650001201323650001201335650001201347650001301359650001101372650001101383650001301394650001901407650000901426650000901435650001401444650001401458650001201472650001501484650001201499650001201511650001101523650001401534650001301548650001801561650001201579650001401591650001201605650001301617650000901630651001701639651001001656653001601666653001901682653001101701653002601712700002101738700002001759700001601779700002401795700002801819773012101847856008501968852000902053655001202062IND60524203920221117232410.0160705e20160913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052420392DNAL7 a10.1080/02772248.2015.11284342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiedico, Oto10aHazardous and essential trace elements profile in the different soft tissues of Lithophaga lithophaga (Linnaeus, 1758) from Southern Adriatic Sea (Italy)  ap. 877-885.  aA characterization study of 7 hazardous (Hg, Pb, Cd, As, Cr, U, and Ni) and 11 essential (Co, Mo, Se, Cu, Zn, V, Ca, Al, Sr, Mn, and Fe) trace elements in date mussels (Lithophaga lithophaga, Linnaeus, 1758) was carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Date mussels (231 individuals), caught in the Gulf of Manfredonia (Southern Italy), were divided into 4 size-related groups. The different tissues (muscle, stomach, hepatopancreas and rest of soft tissues) were separated and analyzed to study the capability of absorption of this species. No particular differences were reported on the basis of the shell size; the soft tissues play an important role on the accumulation levels of hazardous and essential trace elements.

The release and settlement of larvae were observed in two distinct periods. The first started 3 days after collection on January 28 during the last quarter, whereas the second started 2 months later, on April 10 during the change from new moon to the first quarter. Planulation continued throughout approximately 48 h. Brooded larvae released from the mouth contained zooxanthellae, and underwent settlement after 48 h. Newly extruded larvae stayed in close contact with parental polyps. Fusion was observed among larvae from the same colony. The first septal cycle was formed by day 2–3, while the third cycle of exosepta became evident 15 days after protosepta development. The development of the corallite of primary polyp was slow, and after 9 months of analyses no evidence of budding was obtained, this indicating that colonial development is likely to be a late event in the S. stellata life history.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScleractinia 3acoasts 3alarvae 3alarval development 3alife history 3ametamorphosis 3amouth 3aBrazil1 ada Silveira, Fábio L.0 tHydrobiologia.g2003 July, v. 501, no. 1-3 p.139-147dKluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10262358322533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01350naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245006700162300002000229520033100249592002800580650002300608650001400631650002000645650001000665650001900675700002400694700002200718700002500740700002100765700001900786773012400805856007400929852000901003655001201012IND60642211120221120181352.0190506e20171017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064221112DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra10483a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Michael T.10aTotal synthesis and structural revision of a mangrove alkaloid  ap. 48754-48758.  aWe report the total synthesis of an alkaloid isolated from the mangrove fungi Hypocrea virens, based on the originally claimed structure, via a photochemical sequence.

The results show that folding proceeds through distinct intermediates in a stepwise pathway that sequentially incorporates cooperative native-like structural elements to build the native protein. Each step is seen as a concerted transition of one or more segments from an HX-unprotected to an HX-protected state. Deconvolution of the data to near amino acid resolution shows that each step corresponds to the folding of a secondary structural element of the native protein, termed a “foldon.” Each folded segment is retained through subsequent steps of foldon addition, revealing a stepwise buildup of the native structure via a single dominant pathway. Analysis of the pertinent literature suggests that this model is consistent with experimental results for many proteins and some current theoretical results. Two biophysical principles appear to dictate this behavior. The principle of cooperativity determines the central role of native-like foldon units. An interaction principle termed “sequential stabilization” based on native-like interfoldon interactions orders the pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3ahydrogen 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aprotein folding 3aproteins 3aribonucleases1 aWalters, Benjamin T.1 aKan, Zhong-Yuan1 aMayne, Leland1 aRosen, Laura E.1 aMarqusee, Susan1 aEnglander, S.

Although multiple microsites may exist in any alpine treeline ecotone (ATE) on any continent, some microsites appear to enhance density of seedling regeneration better than others. Known seedling regeneration stresses in the ATE include low temperature, low substrate moisture, high radiation, drought, wind, and both high and low snowfall amount. Relationships among various microsite types, annual temperature, annual precipitation, and tree genera groups were assessed by synthesizing 52 studies from 26 countries spanning six continents. By categorization of four main microsite types (convex, concave, object, and wood) by mean annual precipitation and temperature, four major climatic zone associations were distinguished: cold & dry, cold & wet, warm & dry, warm & wet. Successful tree recruitment varied among microsite types and by climatic zones. In general, elevated convex sites and/or decayed wood facilitated earlier snow melt for seedlings located in cold & wet climates with abundant snowfall, depressions or concave sites enhanced summer moisture and protected seedlings from wind chill exposure for seedlings growing in cold & dry locations, and objects protected seedlings from excessive radiation and wind in warm & dry high locations. Our study results suggest that climate change will most benefit seedling regeneration in cold & wet locations and will most limit seedling regeneration in warm & dry locations given likely increases in fire and drought. Study results suggest that high-elevation mountain forests with water-limited growing seasons are likely to experience recruitment declines or, at best, no new recruitment advantage as climate warms. Climate envelope models, generally focusing on adult trees rather than seedling requirements, often assume that a warming climate will move tree species upward. Study results suggest that climate models may benefit from more physically-based considerations of microsites, climate, and current seedling regeneration limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic zones 3acold 3adecayed wood 3adrought 3aecotones 3aforest regeneration 3agrowing season 3amature plants 3amelting 3amontane forests 3aseedlings 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3aspecies recruitment 3asummer 3atemperature 3atreeline 3atrees 3awind1 aYeakley, J.

An important feature of sedimentary deposits is the directional ordering of hydrostratigraphic units (HSU). Geostatistical simulation methods propose efficient algorithm for assessing HSU uncertainty. Among different geostatistical methods to simulate categorical data, Bayesian maximum entropy method (BME) and its simplified version Markov-type categorical prediction (MCP) present interesting features. In particular, the zero-forcing property of BME and MCP can provide a valuable constrain on directional properties. We illustrate the ability of MCP to simulate vertically ordered units. A regional hydrostratigraphic system with 11 HSU and different abundances is used. The transitional deterministic model of this system presents lateral variations and vertical ordering. The set of 66 (11 × 12/2) bivariate probability functions is directly calculated on the deterministic model with fast Fourier transform. Despite the trends present in the deterministic model, MCP is unbiased for the HSU proportions in the non-conditional case. In the conditional cases, MCP proved robust to datasets over-representing some HSU. The inter-realizations variability is shown to closely follow the amount and quality of data provided. Our results with different conditioning datasets show that MCP replicates adequately the directional units arrangement. Thus, MCP appears to be a practical method for generating stochastic models in a 3D hydrostratigraphic context.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adeterministic models 3ageostatistics 3ahydrogeology 3aprediction 3arisk assessment 3astochastic processes 3auncertainty1 aMarcotte, D.1 aBoucher, A.1 aD’Or, D.1 aBajc, A.1 aRaz̤āyī, Ḥasan,0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2018 May, v. 32, no. 5 p.1435-1455dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-017-1506-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013000165300001600295520131600311592002801627650001801655650002801673650001501701650003301716650001901749650001701768650001101785650002601796650001801822650001501840650001501855650002001870650002401890650002601914650001101940650000901951700001401960700001801974700001401992700001402006773013102020856008202151852000902233655001202242IND60590027820221122181858.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059002782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-017-0971-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanciu, M.D.10aOak particles size effects on viscous-elastic properties of wood polyester resin composite submitted to ultraviolet radiation  ap. 365-382.  aThe aim of this paper is to use dynamic mechanical analysis to examine the modifications of the elasto-dynamical properties of a composite made of small waste oak particles of various sizes (0.04 and 1 mm) and a polyester resin (440-M888 POLYLITE), subjected to photo-degradation by UV radiation and thermal degradations induced by temperature variations between 30 and 120 °C. Oak (Quercus robur) waste particles used in this study were the unmerchantable by-product left after converting logs into lumber. The size of the waste oak particles significantly modifies the morphological and mechanical properties of lignocellulosic composites. On the other hand, UV radiation and thermal degradation are recognized as factors causing structural modification observed at the interface between the particles and the matrix. The rheological parameters (storage modulus E′, loss modulus E″ and damping tan δ) and the glass transition temperature were determined both before and after UV treatment with the DMA242 C Netzsch instrument. Structural morphological modifications related to the impact of photo-degradation on fibres and the matrix were observed with an atomic force microscope. A strong nonlinear effect of particle size on the mechanical and rheological properties of the composites was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus robur 3aatomic force microscopy 3abyproducts 3aglass transition temperature 3alignocellulose 3aloss modulus 3alumber 3amechanical properties 3aparticle size 3aphotolysis 3apolyesters 3astorage modulus 3athermal degradation 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastes 3awood1 aBucur, V.1 aVâlcea, C.S.1 aSavin, A.1 aSturm, R.0 tWood science and technology.g2018 Mar., v. 52, no. 2 p.365-382dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-017-0971-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245017100207300001600378500001400394500002000408520120900428592002801637650002201665650001701687650001501704650001601719650001601735650001801751650002301769650001501792650002501807650001301832650001601845650001301861700002001874700002001894700002601914773012001940856007302060852000902133655001202142IND60723031720221121193010.0210110e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072303172DNAL7 a10.1111/are.149392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Syed Zakir Hussain1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8209-712210aInteractive effect of citric acid, phytase and chelated mineral on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and whole‐body composition of Labeo rohita fingerlings  ap. 842-858.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present 2 × 2×3 factorial experiment with Labeo rohita fingerlings was designed to investigate the effect of citric acid (CA), phytase (PHY) and organic trace elements (TEs) supplementations in sunflower meal‐based diets. Twelve experimental diets based on levels of CA (0 and 30 g kg⁻¹), PHY (0 and 1000 FTU kg⁻¹) and TEs [(inorganic (1.5 g kg⁻¹) and organic (1g kg⁻¹ and 0.5 g kg⁻¹)] were formulated. In vitro phytate hydrolysis was intensified with the addition of CA and PHY. The supplementation of CA, PHY and organic TEs (p < 0.05) improved the growth of fingerlings compared to the fish fed TEs from inorganic salts. Nutrient digestibility and mineral absorption w`ere significantly affected by all of the three supplements. Higher deposition (p < 0.05) of Cu, Mn, Fe and Zn in whole body was recorded by feeding organic TEs. Moreover, synergistically positive second and higher order interactions were observed for most of the studied parameters. In conclusion, supplementation of CA, PHY and organically chelated TEs alone as well as in combination, in sunflower meal‐based diets, improved the nutrient utilization in fingerlings leading to improved growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aLabeo rohita 3aabsorption 3aaquaculture 3acitric acid 3adigestibility 3agrowth performance 3ahydrolysis 3anutrient utilization 3aphytases 3aphytic acid 3aresearch1 aFatima, Mahroze1 aAfzal, Muhammad1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

Results showed a well-balanced overall sex-ratio revealing a stable population. It was a seasonal reproduction with one breeding period, occurring in spring. Overall, analysis of the size-frequency showed the presence of three cohorts during the 18 months of monitoring. Lifespan was estimated at 14 months. H. reaumurii appeared as an annual species, with semelparous females that exhibited a univoltine life cycle. Furthermore, results showed, for the first time in this specie, that males have larger body lengths and masses than females. This may suggest strongly the development of a sexual body length and mass dimorphism in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3abody length 3adimorphism 3adry environmental conditions 3alongevity 3amodels 3asex ratio 3aspring 3aunivoltine habit 0aBreeding phenology 0aXeric species 0aCohorts 0aReproductive traits 0aSexual dimorphism1 aGhemari, Chedliya1 aNasri-Ammar, Karima0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2021 Sept., v. 294 p.10-19dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6280x0044-52317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2021.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009700170300002000267520150600287592002801793650001301821650001301834650001101847650002501858650001801883650001301901650000901914650002001923650002401943650001401967650001501981650001601996650000902012650001902021700002102040773014902061856008102210852000902291655001202300IND60569602520221121223828.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056960252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7461-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElMazoudy, Reda H.10aIn ovo toxico-teratological effects of aluminum on embryonic chick heart and vascularization  ap. 21947-21956.  aIn spite of extensive research and persistent arguments, the mechanism of aluminum (Al) toxicity is still obscure. It is firmly established that aluminum is a potent neurotoxicant. So, the aim based on is aluminum damage chicken heart, as well as the vitelline circulation. In the first 3 days of incubation (D0–D2), 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg aluminum chloride/0.3 ml avian saline was injected into the center of each viable fertilized egg yolk (AL1, AL2, and AL3 groups, respectively). Control eggs were either uninjected (AL0) or injected (ALS, 0.3 ml saline). Crown rump length was significantly decreased, while, embryonic mortalities, growth delay, as well as congenital heart defects were increased in the eggs injected 2.0 or 4.0 mg of Al. Although no relationship is clear about the embryonic mortality induced by Al in chicken embryos to the dose concentration, the higher mortality occurs in early developmental stages in developing chick embryos. Furthermore, chick embryos exposed to 4.0 mg/Al showed a high incidence of defects of ventricular septation and ventricular myocardium. Configuration and density of branched vitelline vessels were also significantly deteriorated after injection with 4.0 mg/Al. It concluded that Al is a cardiac teratogen for a chick in a dose-dependent way. These data highlight a novel approach for aluminum in congenital cardiovascular defects. Therefore, further research is needed to explain the teratogenicity of Al on the embryonic heart development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3achickens 3achicks 3adevelopmental stages 3adose response 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryonic mortality 3amortality 3amyocardium 3aneurotoxins 3arump 3ateratogenicity1 aBekhet, Gamal A.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Nov., v. 23, no. 21 p.21947-21956dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7461-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04215naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245013800169300001600307520275800323592002803081650001203109650001903121650001703140650001003157650001203167650001003179650002603189650002303215650001903238650001503257650001603272650001303288650001603301650001003317650001303327650001403340650000703354650001103361650001803372650002203390651002903412651001103441700001703452700001703469700002103486773010203507856007903609852000903688655001203697IND60439614820221120162059.0151024e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043961482DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10262441013022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aØkland, Karen Anna10aFreshwater bryozoans (Bryozoa) of Norway IV: Distribution and ecology of four species of Plumatella with notes on Hyalinella punctata  ap. 179-198.  aBryozoans were investigated during field studies of 601 lakes and other surface water bodies throughout Norway from 1960 to 1978. The frequency of occurrence of Plumatella repens was evaluated in relation to 12 environmental variables. Statistically significant deviations from the frequencies expected on the basis of random distribution were described using the categories preference, avoidance and absence. P. repens is one of the most common bryozoan species in Norway. It is represented at 227 localities in our material and by 29 additional records. The species occurred frequently all over the country, north to 71° 09′ N (the northernmost record on the European mainland). Maximum elevation above sea level was 1052 m (maximum for Northern Europe). P. repens preferred lakes, avoided rivers, and was absent from the smallest water bodies. The species preferred (1) low elevation (2–200 m above sea level), (2) medium water temperature, (3) rich aquatic vegetation (eutrophic conditions), (4) small wave action, (5) high content of calcium and magnesium, (6) pH 6.4–9.6, and (7) rather high water colour. Otherwise P. repens avoided (1) habitats above 500 m but occurred up to 1052 m, (2) the lowest water temperature intervals, (3) sites with poor aquatic vegetation and stony shores, (4) medium wave action, (5) sites with a low calcium and magnesium content, (6) lakes of low water colour, and (7) lakes with pH below 6.6: it was absent from lakes with pH below 5.2. For many environmental variables, the species had a wider tolerance range than reported from elsewhere. P. fungosa, P. casmiana, and P. emarginata are all rare in Norway. The total numbers of known localities, with our records in (), are 18 (11), 7 (7), and 7 (5), respectively. These sites are all from lowland areas up to 133 m above sea level. Environmental variables in the habitats are described. P. fungosa was represented by a single floatoblast in each of the four northernmost lakes where it was recorded. One of these lakes was in North Norway some 1000 km away from the nearest known sites with living colonies. The presence of large colonies of P. fungosa in some parts of southern Norway and only `single floatoblast lakes' further north is discussed in relation to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography: birds facilitate immigration by carrying floatoblasts and environmental conditions prevent their germination and the development of living colonies. All records of P. casmiana and P. emarginata were from South Norway. Results for P. fruticosa have been published previously. Notes are given on an old and now missing sample from ca. 1900, identified by Lacourt (1968) as Hyalinella punctata – the only record of this species from Norway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryozoa 3aaquatic plants 3abiogeography 3abirds 3acalcium 3acolor 3aenvironmental factors 3aequilibrium theory 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3agermination 3ahabitats 3aimmigration 3alakes 3alowlands 3amagnesium 3apH 3arivers 3asurface water 3awater temperature 3aNorthern European region 3aNorway1 aØkland, Jan1 aGeimer, Gaby1 aMassard, Jos.

Various solutions were proposed to solve these drawbacks, which could simultaneously solve at most two problems, usually, at the expense of the third. In this work, however, a novel integration consisting of cascaded solar heat exchangers and a combined cycle power plant CCPP was used to simultaneously address the GTs shortcomings. Parabolic trough collectors PTCs were used to initially preheat the air at the combustion chamber inlet. The collectors were then used to drive an absorption inlet-air cooling cycle that will control the air temperature at the compressor’s inlet. Simple design point analysis of the proposed integration showed an increase in thermal efficiency by 7.2% and a 27.7 MW increase in power output. A linear-regression LR based optimization was then performed to generate highly accurate polynomial equations for predicting the system’s performance. These equations were then used in a Genetic Algorithm GA multi-objective optimization MOO with efficiency and capital cost as conflicting objectives. The optimum thermal efficiency was found to be in the range of 53.1 – 61.11% corresponding to a capital cost of the novel system in the range of 86.5–158.3 Mil$. A favorable optimum point for both objectives was found at an efficiency of 57.86% corresponding to a capital cost of 131.8 Mil$. Feasibility in terms of the payback period (PBP) was explored for the optimum range; resulting in a PBP equal to 2.8 years, an implication of a feasible novel cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadministrative management 3aair 3aair temperature 3aalgorithms 3acapital costs 3acombustion 3aenergy conversion 3aenergy use and consumption 3aheat 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 0aSolar power 0aGas turbine combined cycle 0aInlet air cooling 0aParabolic trough collector 0aMulti-objective optimization 0aLinear regression1 aAhmad, Adnan Darwish1 aSingh, Binit B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5161-57481 aAkafuah, Nelson K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1069-73501 aSaitō, Kōzō,0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2021 July 15, v. 240 p.114266-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2021.1142663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03783naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245012500190300001600315520151000331592002801841650001401869650001801883650001401901650001301915650001701928650002201945650002301967650002101990650001302011650001702024650002002041650001202061650002802073650002802101650002602129650002102155650002102176650003002197650002402227650001502251650003002266650004302296650003402339650004402373650002102417650004602438650002002484650004502504650000902549650003602558650006202594650004102656650005402697700001802751700001802769700002002787700001802807700001802825700001802843773009902861856008102960990002303041852000903064655001203073IND60089918620221118004018.0141102e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008991862DNAL7 a233279932pmid7 a10.1016/j.bcp.2013.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen-Kutner, Moshe10aThioredoxin-mimetic peptides (TXM) reverse auranofin induced apoptosis and restore insulin secretion in insulinoma cells  ap. 977-990.  aThe thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system (TrxR/Trx1) plays a major role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Disruption of the TrxR-Trx1 system keeps Trx1 in the oxidized state leading to cell death through activation of the ASK1-Trx1 apoptotic pathway. The potential mechanism and ability of tri- and tetra-oligopeptides derived from the canonical -CxxC- motif of the Trx1-active site to mimic and enhance Trx1 cellular activity was examined. The Trx mimetics peptides (TXM) protected insulinoma INS 832/13 cells from oxidative stress induced by selectively inhibiting TrxR with auranofin (AuF). TXM reversed the AuF-effects preventing apoptosis, and increasing cell-viability. The TXM peptides were effective in inhibiting AuF-induced MAPK, JNK and p38ᴹᴬᴾᴷ phosphorylation, in correlation with preventing caspase-3 cleavage and thereby PARP-1 dissociation. The ability to form a disulfide-bridge-like conformation was estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. The TXM peptides restored insulin secretion and displayed Trx1 denitrosylase activity. Their potency was 10–100-fold higher than redox reagents like NAC, AD4, or ascorbic acid. Unable to reverse ERK1/2 phosphorylation, TXM-CB3 (NAc-Cys-Pro-Cys amide) appeared to function in part, through inhibiting ASK1-Trx dissociation. These highly effective anti-apoptotic effects of Trx1 mimetic peptides exhibited in INS 832/13 cells could become valuable in treating adverse oxidative-stress related disorders such as diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aascorbic acid 3acaspase-3 3adiabetes 3adissociation 3ainsulin secretion 3amolecular dynamics 3aoxidative stress 3apeptides 3apharmacology 3aphosphorylation 2aAnimals 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aAuranofinxpharmacology 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aFree Radicalsxmetabolism 2aInsulinxsecretion. 2aInsulinoma 2aJanus Kinasesxmetabolism 2aMAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5xmetabolism 2aMolecular Dynamics Simulation 2aOligopeptidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aOxidative Stress 2aPeptidomimeticsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPhosphorylation 2aPoly(ADP-ribose) Polymerasesxmetabolism 2aRats 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aThioredoxin-Disulfide Reductasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aThioredoxinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism1 aKhomsky, Lena1 aTrus, Michael1 aAisner, Yonatan1 aNiv, Masha Y.1 aBenhar, Moran1 aAtlas, Daphne0 tBiochemical pharmacology.g2013 Apr. 1, v. 85, no. 7 p.977-990dElsevier Inc.x0006-29527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2013.01.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03751naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245013400176300001800310520205500328592002802383650001202411650001302423650001202436650001502448650001102463650001902474650001402493650002302507650001202530650001302542650001602555650001002571650001302581650002402594650001102618650001702629650001302646650001002659650001402669650001902683650002102702653003402723653003802757653002502795653003102820653002502851653002002876700002702896700002002923700001802943773012302961856008003084852000903164655001203173IND60563477520170710000000.0170223e20170222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056347752DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b155072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Alexandre
A. S.10aOne-Pot Synthesis of Mesoporous Ni–Ti–Al Ternary Oxides: Highly Active and Selective Catalysts for Steam Reforming of Ethanol  ap. 6079-6092.  aOne-pot synthesis of nanostructured ternary oxides of Ni, Al, and Ti was designed and performed via evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA). For the purpose of comparison, analogous oxides were also prepared by the impregnation method. The resulting materials were applied in two catalytic reactions: steam reforming of ethanol (SRE) for H₂ production (subjected to prior activation with H₂) and ethanol dehydration (ED; used without prior activation), to in situ analyze carbon accumulation by ethylene depletion when ethanol interacts with acidic sites present on the support. Modification of Ni–Al mixed oxides with titania was shown to have several benefits. CO₂, NH₃, and propylamine sorption data indicate a decrease in the strength of acidic and basic sites after addition of titania, which in turn slowed down the carbon accumulation during the ED reaction. These changes in interactions between ethanol and byproducts with the support led to different reaction pathways in SRE, indicating that the catalysts obtained by EISA with titania addition showed higher ethylene selectivity and CO₂/CO ratios. The opposite was observed for the impregnated catalysts, which were less coke-stable during ED reactions and showed no ethylene selectivity in SRE. Carbon formed during ED reactions was shown to be thermodynamically less favorable and easier to decompose in the presence of titania. All catalysts studied displayed similar and high selectivities (∼80%) and yields (∼5.3 molH₂/molₑₜₕₐₙₒₗ) toward H₂, which place them among the most active and selective catalysts for SRE. These results indicate the importance of tailoring the support surface acidity to achieve high reforming performance and higher selectivity toward SRE, one of the key processes to produce cleaner and efficient fuels. For an efficient reforming process, the yield of byproducts is low but still they affect the catalyst stability in the long-run, thus this work may impact future studies toward development of near-zero coke catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aaluminum 3aammonia 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aethanol 3aethylene 3aevaporation 3afuels 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3anickel 3aporous media 3asorption 3asteam 3asynthesis 3athermodynamics 3atitanium dioxide 0ananostructured ternary oxides 0aevaporation induced self-assembly 0acatalyst selectivity 0asteam reforming of ethanol 0amesoporous materials 0asurface acidity1 aFaustino, Patrícia

When recovered from peripheral blood or lymphoid tissues of patients and cultured in vitro, CLL malignant cells rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis. CLL B-cells co-culture with different adherent cell types, collectively referred to as stromal cells, induces leukemia cell survival, migration, and drug resistance. In addition, such survival-promoting microenvironments can rescue leukemia cells from cytotoxic therapy, giving way to disease relapse. Quite surprisingly considering that many anti-cancer drugs, including γ-secretase inhibitors, Cyclopamine and Quercetin, were reported to block Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog anti-apoptotic signaling pathways respectively, the link between the latter anti-apoptotic pathways and bone marrow stromal cells in CLL has been pointed out only recently. Data concerning the pathogenesis of CLL have been critically reviewed in regards to the growing body of evidence indicating deregulations of Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in the stromal microenvironment of affected cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3abone marrow 3acell viability 3acoculture 3acyclopamine 3acytotoxicity 3adrug resistance 3alymphocytic leukemia 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3aquercetin 3arelapse 3asignal transduction 3astromal cells 3atherapeutics1 aVecchio, Lorella1 aNwabo Kamdje, Armel Hervé0 tCellular signalling.g2012 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.1433-1443dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.03.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012400169300001600293520129600309592002801605650001501633650001901648650001701667650001501684650005001699650001501749650001201764650001901776650001501795650002401810650002101834650002401855651001001879700001701889700002001906700002201926773009701948856008102045852000902126655001202135IND60087617020221121045853.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008761702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2012.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaselles, Eduardo10aAutomatic classification-based generation of thermal infrared land surface emissivity maps using AATSR data over Europe  ap. 321-333.  aThe remote sensing measurement of land surface temperature from satellites provides a monitoring of this magnitude on a continuous and regular basis, which is a critical factor in many research fields such as weather forecasting, detection of forest fires or climate change studies, for instance. The main problem of measuring temperature from space is the need to correct for the effects of the atmosphere and the surface emissivity. In this work an automatic procedure based on the Vegetation Cover Method, combined with the GLOBCOVER land surface type classification, is proposed. The algorithm combines this land cover classification with remote sensing information on the vegetation cover fraction to obtain land surface emissivity maps for AATSR split-window bands. The emissivity estimates have been compared with ground measurements in two validation cases in the area of rice fields of Valencia, Spain, and they have also been compared to the classification-based emissivity product provided by MODIS (MOD11_L2). The results show that the error in emissivity of the proposed methodology is of the order of ±0.01 for most of the land surface classes considered, which will contribute to improve the operational land surface temperature measurements provided by the AATSR instrument.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3aforest fires 3aland cover 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3apaddies 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asurface temperature 3avegetation cover 3aweather forecasting 3aSpain1 aValor, Enric1 aAbad, Francisco1 aCaselles, Vicente0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2012 Sept., v. 124 p.321-333dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2012.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006100137245015200198300001800350500002000368520201100388592002802399596005702427650002402484650002802508650001702536650001302553650001802566650001002584650002002594650001402614650001402628650001702642651001202659700002302671700002202694700003202716700002102748773012602769856007202895852000902967655001202976IND60783141520221123041316.0220715e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078314152DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.69822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaggio, Juliana S1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7755-326912aA reassessment of the fungicidal efficacy of 1,3‐dichloropropene, chloropicrin, and metam potassium against Macrophomina phaseolina in strawberry  ap. 3416-3423.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The effectiveness of metam potassium, 1,3‐dichloropropene, chloropicrin, and different ratios of 1,3‐dichloropropene and chloropicrin on the reduction of natural and artificial inoculum of Macrophomina phaseolina were investigated in laboratory and field experiments. Additionally, a multivariate meta‐analysis with data from six field trials conducted in Florida from 2012 to 2018 was performed. RESULTS: In small‐plot field experiments using drip stakes, the highest rate (468 L ha⁻¹) of metam potassium was most effective in controlling M. phaseolina in infected crowns buried at 15.2 cm from the point of fumigant injection, whereas none of the rates was able to reduce inoculum buried at 30.5 cm. In closed‐container experiments, use of the highest rate of 1,3‐dichloropropene (168 kg ha⁻¹) resulted in the highest level of pathogen control. Different rates of chloropicrin also reduced inoculum when compared to the non‐treated control. 1,3‐dichloropropene + chloropicrin at different ratios were also highly effective in controlling M. phaseolina. Results from the meta‐analysis of open‐field experiments indicated that metam potassium and 1,3‐dichloropropene + chloropicrin (63:35, v:v) treatments were significantly more effective in reducing M. phaseolina than the 1,3‐dichloropropene + chloropicrin (39:60, v:v) treatment; however, metam potassium was not as effective at the side of the beds. CONCLUSION: 1,3‐dichloropropene alone and in mixture with chloropicrin were more effective in reducing inoculum of M. phaseolina than chloropicrin alone, indicating the fungicidal efficacy of 1,3‐dichloropropene. Formulation with higher 1,3‐dichloropropene concentration performed better than the formulation with higher chloropicrin concentration in field trials. Metam potassium was effective when applied at the highest rate, but with limited lateral movement perpendicular to the drip irrigation line. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cFlorida Strawberry Research and Education Foundation 3a1,3-dichloropropene 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3achloropicrin 3ainoculum 3ameta-analysis 3ametam 3amicroirrigation 3apathogens 3apotassium 3astrawberries 3aFlorida1 aCordova, Leandro G1 aToledo, Beatriz F1 aNoling, J.

Here, we investigated alien plant invasion into various ecosystems representing different land use types in a subtropical peri-urban area of south China. Four invasive alien species were found from five out of the six ecosystems. Lower plant diversity in both the overstory and understory was consistently associated with more severe alien plant invasion to the ecosystems. The highest total abundance and plot occurrence of the invasive plants were found in the agroforestry ecosystem representing the highest disturbance. At plot scale, an increase in invasion severity was associated with a significant decrease in overstory stem density, species richness, and diversity, but with a significant increase in overstory plant dominance. The understory community attributes in response to the increase in invasion severity followed similar patterns, except that the stem density increased with invasion severity. Higher canopy openness and thus lower leaf area index and greater understory radiation were associated with higher invasion severity of invasive plants to the understory habitat. For predicting total abundance of the invasive species, the most important variable is land use type, while for the abundance of Lantana camara and Mikania micrantha, the most important predictor variable is overstory Berger&ndash;Parker index and canopy openness, respectively. Canopy structure and understory gap light regimes were among the most important factors determining the abundance of the worst invasive plant Mikania micrantha. Our results demonstrate that land use types with varying disturbance regimes determine the spatial heterogeneity in plant diversity and community structure, which predicts alien plant invasion and habitat invasibility; and that the severity of alien plant invasion in turn is a good indicator of habitat disturbance across the ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLantana camara 3aMikania micrantha 3aagroforestry 3acanopy 3acommunity structure 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aleaf area index 3aoverstory 3aphotoperiod 3aprediction 3aspatial variation 3aspecies richness 3aunderstory 3aChina1 aSu, Yuqiao 1 aZhong, Yonglin 1 aXie, Peiyun 1 aXu, Mingfeng 1 aSu, Zhiyao 0 tForests.g2019 Oct. 03, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f101008673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245014900167300001200316520146100328592002801789650001601817650001701833650002001850650001901870650002101889650002201910650001001932650001101942650001101953650001101964650002201975650001301997650001102010650002602021651001202047773009802059856007902157852000902236655001202245IND60439614920221120162135.0151024e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043961492DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10262762008782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleeberg, Andreas10aRe-assessment of Wundsch's (1940) ‘H2S-Oscillatoria-Lake’ type using the eutrophic Lake Scharmützel (Brandenburg, NE Germany) as an example  ap. 1-5.  aThienemann's 1922 ‘biological lake’ classification indicates the increase in the trophic level of lakes. It is based on the sucession of the disappearance of certain benthic indicator organisms in relation to the gradient of a decreasing O₂concentration in the deep water, i.e. from O₂-sensitive Chironomidae spp. (non-biting midges) to the less sensitive Chaoboridae (phantom midges) larvae. As early as the mid 1930s, several lakes in Brandenburg, e.g. Lake Scharmützel, belonged to the last category of this classification. They were O₂-deficient in deep water during summer and lacked the Chironomidae larvae. Simultaneously, filamentous cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) appeared. This lead to the replacement of Thienemann's indicators, i.e. O₂ by H₂S and Chironomidae by Oscillatoriales, and to Wundsch's 1940 new ‘H₂S-Oscillatoria-Lake’ type. Since H₂S and Oscillatoriales were not clearly identified as symptoms of eutrophication, it is not justified to use them to characterise a separate lake type. However, these indicators are of ecological importance, since the regional and common creeping increase in SO₄ ²⁻ concentration favoures the current high H₂S formation. The successive deterioration in O₂ conditions, the increase in the extent of H₂S formation related to the decrease in species diversity clearly indicates that Lake Scharmützel reached a qualitatively new state of eutrophication within 60 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaoboridae 3aChironomidae 3aOscillatoriales 3aeutrophication 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aindicator species 3alakes 3alarvae 3amidges 3aoxygen 3aspecies diversity 3asulfates 3asummer 3atrophic relationships 3aGermany0 tHydrobiologia.g2003 July, v. 501, no. 1-3 p.1-5dKluwer Academic Publishersx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10262762008783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245005800170300001600228520074500244592002800989650002201017650001501039650001501054653002701069653001001096653002301106653001301129653001301142653002401155653001801179653001101197653001601208700002101224700002901245700001901274700002301293700002001316700002101336700002501357700001901382773011301401856008301514852000901597655001201606IND60650981220221118010658.0190923e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065098122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcBride, Ethan M.10aPaper spray ionization: Applications and perspectives  ap. 722-730.  aPaper spray ionization has grown to become one of the most successful ambient ionization methods within the past decade.

African buffalo and plains zebra densities were then determined in each vegetation type using road transect surveys monthly between January 2013 and December 2015. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), grass biomass, grass height and grass quality (nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus and acid detergent fibre content) were determined in each vegetation type during the wet (November to April) and dry (August to October) seasons to establish their quality as habitats for African buffalo and plains zebra. Key resultsBoth African buffalo and plains zebra mostly foraged in mixed and grassland areas, and avoided Zambezi teak vegetation type. Zambezi teak vegetation type had high NDVI due to the dense tree cover. Both African buffalo and plains zebra preferred vegetation types with intermediate grass biomass (approximately 300gm−2) and grass height (approximately 16cm). Grass nutritive value (in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus and acid detergent fibre) declined from wet to dry season in all vegetation types. ConclusionsAfrican buffalo and plains zebra in the ZNP confined their habitat use mostly to two vegetation types (mixed and grassland), which together covered 25% of the protected area. ImplicationsTeak (Baikiaea plurijuga) vegetation, which accounted for about 60% of the ZNP, was avoided by both African buffalo and plains zebra, suggesting that a significant part of the protected area was not used by the two herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data 0adigesta retention time 0agrass biomass 0ahindgut fermenters 0anormalised difference vegetation index 0anutritional requirements 0aspatial and temporal heterogeneity 0aruminants1 aMonks, Norman1 aMundy, Peter J.1 aSebata, Allan1 aChirima, Albert0 tWildlife research.g2020, v. 47, no. 2 p.106-113dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957321x1035-37127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR182013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245010900208300001400317520112600331592002801457650001401485650001601499650002801515650001301543650001301556650001701569650001701586650002101603650001001624650001301634650001301647650001601660650002201676650001201698653002001710653000801730653001101738653001801749653002701767700001601794700001401810700001801824700001701842700001801859773010401877856008701981852000902068655001202077IND60625593620221117165521.0190213e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062559362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConzatti, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8002-589410aElaboration of a thermosensitive smart biomaterial: From synthesis to the ex vivo bioadhesion evaluation  ap. 91-97.  aAlginate and chitosan are polysaccharides that are widely used in the biomedical field, especially as wound dressings. Controlled bioadhesion is an advanced functionality that offers the potential to reduce injuries due to the stripping-off of the biomaterial. Herein, we report the efficient grafting of poly-N(isopropylacryamide) (PNIPAM), a thermosensitive polymer that exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at 32 °C on the alginate/chitosan polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) surface. In vitro studies did not exhibit a cytotoxic effect, and cells adhered preferentially on the LCST on PNIPAM grafted surfaces, as reported in the literature. Ex vivo investigations revealed that the adhesive behavior of the biomaterials was not the same on the liver and pancreas. The effect of the temperature on the bioadhesion to organs was unexpected, as PNIPAM surfaces exhibited higher adhesion at low temperature. The PNIPAM was therefore able to confer PEC matrix thermosensitivity, but due to the application force, interactions between PNIPAM chains and their substrate could influence bioadhesion on tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abioadhesion 3abiocompatible materials 3achitosan 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrolytes 3ain vitro studies 3aliver 3apancreas 3apolymers 3atemperature 3athermosensitivity 3atissues 0aPolysaccharides 0aPEC 0aPNIPAM 0aSmart polymer 0aControlled bioadhesion1 aCavalie, S.1 aGayet, F.1 aTorrisani, J.1 aCarrère, N.1 aTourrette, A.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 175 p.91-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011900173300001800292520166900310592002801979650002402007650001802031650001002049650001502059650001302074650001102087650001602098650001202114650001102126650001102137700002502148773011302173856004802286852000902334655001202343IND50070625420221118102829.0131115e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007062542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-013-1611-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwapich, Christina L.10aDemography, demand, death, and the seasonal allocation of labor in the Florida harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex badius)  ap. 2011-2027.  aAs a self-organizing entity, an ant colony must divide a limited number of workers among numerous competing functions. Adaptive patterns of labor allocation should vary with colony need across each annual cycle, but remain almost entirely undescribed in ants. Allocation to foraging in 55 field colonies of the Florida harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex badius) followed a consistent annual pattern over 4 years. Foragers preceded larvae in spring and peaked during maximal larval production in summer (0.37). In spring, proportion foraging increased due to an increase in forager number and reduction in colony size, and in late summer, it decreased as colony size increased through new worker birth and a loss of ∼3 % of foragers per day. The removal of 50 % of the forager population revealed that, at the expense of larval survival, colonies did not draw workers from other castes to fill labor gaps. To determine if labor allocation was age specific, whole colonies were marked with cuticle color-specific wire belts and released, and each cohort's time to first foraging was noted. Workers that eclosed in summer alongside sexual alates darkened quickly and became foragers at ∼43 days of age, whereas autumn-born workers required 200 or more days to do so. Following colony reproduction, these long-lived individuals foraged alongside short-lived, summer-born sisters during the next calendar year. Therefore, the large-scale, predictable patterns of labor allocation in P. badius appear to be driven by bimodal worker development rate and age structure, rather than worker responsiveness to changes in colony demand. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPogonomyrmex badius 3aage structure 3adeath 3ademography 3aforaging 3alarvae 3aparturition 3asisters 3aspring 3asummer1 aTschinkel, Walter R.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2013 Dec., v. 67, no. 12 p.2011-2027dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-013-1611-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011000168300001600278500001500294520168300309592002801992650001202020650002102032650000902053650001402062650003502076650000902111650001002120650002302130650005202153650002402205650001002229650001602239650001202255650001402267650000802281650001402289653001702303653002902320653001702349653002202366700001602388700001802404700002502422700001602447700002402463773010802487856008502595852000902680655001202689IND60576088920221119083452.0190403e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057608892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, XiaoTing10aPrevalence of lapine rotavirus, astrovirus, and hepatitis E virus in Canadian domestic rabbit populations  ap. 146-149.  a2019-12-06  aLapine rotavirus and astrovirus have been associated with disease in rabbits, and there is strong evidence of zoonotic transmission of lapine hepatitis E virus (HEV). Outbreaks of enteritis are common on commercial meat farms, resulting in poor welfare, high rabbit mortality, and significant financial losses for rabbit producers. Currently, none of these viruses are routinely tested by diagnostic laboratories. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of rotavirus, astrovirus, and HEV RNA in 205 pooled and individual fecal samples from healthy Canadian laboratory, companion, shelter and commercial meat rabbit populations. Viral RNA were extracted and amplified via RT-PCR using virus-specific primers. Positive samples from the first cohort of samples tested were sequenced and aligned to previously identified viruses to confirm the products. Almost 45% (13/29) of the surveyed commercial rabbit farms were astrovirus-positive. Three commercial meat rabbit samples were positive for rotavirus, and either astrovirus or HEV RNA was also detected. Three companion rabbit samples also tested positive for lapine HEV. Samples from specific pathogen-free laboratory animals were negative for all viruses. Sequencing results showed highest identity to rotavirus A strain 30–96, lapine astrovirus strain 2208 and lapine HEV strain CMC-1. These results permit a better understanding of the prevalence of rotavirus, astrovirus, and hepatitis E virus in Canadian domestic rabbit populations, and continued screening for viruses may help to reduce risk of zoonotic agent transmission as well as providing a better understanding of potential causative agents of rabbit enteritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3arabbits 3aOrthohepevirus A 3arisk 3ascreening 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3ameat 3afarms 3alaboratory animals 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3afinancial economics 3afeces 3aRotavirus A 3aviruses 3aenteritis 3aRNA 3amortality 0aMeat rabbits 0aRabbit enteritis complex 0aEpidemiology 0aHepatitis E virus1 aBil, Joanna1 aShantz, Emily1 aHammermueller, Jutta1 aNagy, Éva,1 aTurner, Patricia V.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 208 p.146-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245010600179300001600285520126600301592002801567650001601595650002001611650001201631650002101643650001601664650001901680650001301699650001001712650000901722650002801731650002401759650003601783650005201819650004001871650003601911650001401947650006101961650002102022700002102043700002302064700001902087700002402106700002102130773009102151856007302242852000902315655001202324IND50073360220221120190817.0150206e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007336022DNAL7 a243724422pmid7 a10.1111/nph.126522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanquar, Viviane10aDynamic imaging of cytosolic zinc in Arabidopsis roots combining FRET sensors and RootChip technology  ap. 198-208.  aZinc plays a central role in all living cells as a cofactor for enzymes and as a structural element enabling the adequate folding of proteins. In eukaryotic cells, metals are highly compartmentalized and chelated. Although essential to characterize the mechanisms of Zn²⁺homeostasis, the measurement of free metal concentrations in living cells has proved challenging and the dynamics are difficult to determine. Our work combines the use of genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensors and a novel microfluidic technology, the RootChip, to monitor the dynamics of cytosolic Zn²⁺concentrations in Arabidopsis root cells. Our experiments provide estimates of cytosolic free Zn²⁺concentrations in Arabidopsis root cells grown under sufficient (0.4 nM) and excess (2 nM) Zn²⁺supply. In addition, monitoring the dynamics of cytosolic [Zn²⁺] in response to external supply suggests the involvement of high‐ and low‐affinity uptake systems as well as release from internal stores. In this study, we demonstrate that the combination of genetically encoded FRET sensors and microfluidics provides an attractive tool to monitor the dynamics of cellular metal ion concentrations over a wide concentration range in root cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aenergy transfer 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahomeostasis 3aimage analysis 3aproteins 3aroots 3azinc 2aArabidopsisxmetabolism 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aExtracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aFluorescence Resonance Energy Transferxmethods 2aImaging, Three-Dimensionalxmethods 2aIntracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aPerfusion 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aZincxmetabolism1 aGrossman, Guido,1 aVinkenborg, Jan L.1 aMerkx, Maarten1 aThomine, Sébastien1 aFrommer, Wolf B.0 tnew phytologist.g2014 Apr., v. 202, no. 1 p.198-208dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.126523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014600163300001800309520179700327592002802124650003602152650001802188650002302206650002102229650002602250650002002276650001702296650001502313650001902328650002702347650001602374650001302390650002002403650001102423653002002434653003202454653001902486653001002505653002802515653003702543700001702580700001502597700001302612700001002625700001702635700001502652700001702667700002502684773012202709856008502831852000902916655001202925IND60581906320221116165727.0180905e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058190632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2017.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yun14aThe effect of phosphorylation on the salt-tolerance-related functions of the soybean protein PM18, a member of the group-3 LEA protein family  ap. 1291-1303.  aEnzymatically driven post-translated modifications (PTMs) usually happen within the intrinsically disordered regions of a target protein and can modulate variety of protein functions. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a family of the plant intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Despite their important roles in plant stress response, there is currently limited knowledge on the presence and functional and structural effects of phosphorylation on LEA proteins. In this study, we identified three phosphorylation sites (Ser⁹⁰, Tyr¹³⁶, and Thr²⁶⁶) in the soybean PM18 protein that belongs to the group-3 LEA proteins. In yeast expression system, PM18 protein increased the salt tolerance of yeast, and the phosphorylation of this protein further enhanced its protective function. Further analysis revealed that Ser⁹⁰ and Tyr¹³⁶ are more important than Thr²⁶⁶, and these two sites might work cooperatively in regulating the salt resistance function of PM18. The circular dichroism analysis showed that PM18 protein was disordered in aqueous media, and phosphorylation did not affect the disordered status of this protein. However, phosphorylation promoted formation of more helical structure in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or trifluoroethanol (TFE). Furthermore, in dedicated in vitro experiments, phosphorylated PM18 protein was able to better protect lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the inactivation induced by the freeze-thaw cycles than its un- or dephosphorylated forms. All these data indicate that phosphorylation may have regulatory effects on the stress-tolerance-related function of LEA proteins. Therefore, further studies are needed to shed more light on functional and structural roles of phosphorylation in LEA proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aembryogenesis 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ain vitro studies 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aphosphorylation 3aplant stress 3aproteomics 3asalt tolerance 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asoy protein 3asoybeans 3astress response 3ayeasts 0aPhosphorylation 0aLate embryogenesis abundant 0aSalt-tolerance 0aYeast 0aCryoprotective function 0aIntrinsically disordered protein1 aYang, Meiyan1 aCheng, Hua1 aSun, Nan1 aSimu,1 aLi, Shuiming1 aWang, Yong1 aZheng, Yizhi1 aUversky, Vladimir N.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Nov., v. 1865, no. 11 p.1291-1303dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12097x1570-96397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbapap.2017.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012200158300002000280520127800300592002801578650001501606650002401621650002201645650001001667650001801677650001301695650001901708650001601727650000801743650001601751650001701767650000901784700001201793700001701805700001601822700001801838700001601856773012301872856007501995852000902070655001202079IND60641654220221120125904.0220513e20170522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064165422DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04041e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jinghui10aControlled synthesis of Sn-based oxides via a hydrothermal method and their visible light photocatalytic performances  ap. 27024-27032.  aControlled synthesis of Sn-based oxides with a different valence state is still a challenge. Here, we developed a facile hydrothermal method for selective preparation of SnO₂, Sn²⁺ doped SnO₂ (Sn²⁺–SnO₂), and SnO/SnO₂ composites, and SnO with SnCl₂ as a precursor. The valence state of Sn was regulated successively from Sn⁴⁺ to Sn²⁺ through controlling the hydrothermal solution from an O₂-rich to an O₂-deficient atmosphere, which was achieved by adding H₂O₂ or urea into the solution. The structure, absorption, morphology, and the visible light photocatalytic performance of the products were investigated systematically. SnO₂, Sn²⁺–SnO₂, SnO/SnO₂, and SnO could be prepared in a H₂O₂-contained, H₂O, urea-contained, and N₂ purged urea-contained solution, respectively. For Sn²⁺–SnO₂, the doping amount of Sn²⁺ could be further tuned by varying the hydrothermal temperature, while for SnO/SnO₂, the coupling amount of SnO could be controlled by the dosage of urea. Visible-light-induced photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange was achieved successfully on Sn²⁺–SnO₂ and SnO/SnO₂. However, further work is still required to improve the stability of the samples due to vulnerability of Sn²⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alight 3amethyl orange 3anitrogen 3aphotocatalysis 3atemperature 3atin 3atin dioxide 3atin monoxide 3aurea1 aLi, Hui1 aMeng, Sugang1 aYe, Xiangju1 aFu, Xianliang1 aChen, Shifu0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 22, v. 7, no. 43 p.27024-27032dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04041e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03399naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245011800187300001800305520177100323592002802094650001702122650001502139650001102154650002002165650003002185650002502215650001002240650002902250650001502279650001302294650001402307650002502321650002002346650002302366650001702389650002802406650002002434650004702454650005002501650002902551650005902580650005902639700002102698773011702719856004802836852000902884655001202893IND4466878620221120041821.0120507e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446687862DNAL7 a217738662pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2205-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThanh, Nguyen Phuc13aAn evaluation of alternative household solid waste treatment practices using life cycle inventory assessment mode  ap. 3515-3527.  aWaste disposal is an important part of the life cycle of a product and is associated with environmental burdens like any other life-cycle stages. In this study, an integrated assessment for solid waste treatment practices, especially household solid waste, was undertaken to evaluate the impact contribution of household solid waste treatment alternatives towards the sustainable development by using Life Cycle Inventory Assessment method. A case study has been investigated under various possible scenarios, such as (1) landfill without landfill gas recovery, (2) landfill with landfill gas recovery and flaring, (3) landfill with landfill gas recovery and electric generation, (4) composting, and (5) incineration. The evaluation utilized the Life Cycle Inventory Assessment method for multiple assessments based on various aspects, such as greenhouse gas emission/reduction, energy generation/consumption, economic benefit, investment and operating cost, and land use burden. The results showed that incineration was the most efficient alternative for greenhouse gas emission reduction, economic benefit, energy recovery, and land use reduction, although it was identified as the most expensive for investment and operating cost, while composting scenario was also an efficient alternative with quite economic benefit, low investment and operating cost, and high reduction of land use, although it was identified as existing greenhouse gas emission and no energy generation. Furthermore, the aim of this study was also to establish localized assessment methods that waste management agencies, environmental engineers, and environmental policy decision makers can use to quantify and compare the contribution to the impacts from different waste treatment options.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acomposting 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aenvironmental engineering 3aenvironmental policy 3agases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahouseholds 3aland use 3alandfills 3alife cycle inventory 3aoperating costs 3aproduct life cycle 3asolid wastes 3asustainable development 3awaste treatment 2aAir Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aCarbon Footprintxstatistics & numerical data 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aRefuse Disposalxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aWaste Productsxanalysisxstatistics & numerical data.1 aMatsui, Yasuhiro0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 June, v. 184, no. 6 p.3515-3527dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2205-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012400168520158700292592002801879650002801907650002301935650001401958650003101972650001202003650001402015650001702029650001702046650002202063650001502085650001702100650001102117650002502128650001802153650001002171650000702181650002702188650001902215650001602234650001302250653001602263653001802279653002102297653002102318700002602339700002102365700001702386700002002403700002802423700002002451700005802471773012302529856008302652852000902735655001202744IND60749997620221121122129.0220103e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074999762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1021542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeed, Shagufta10aValorization of banana peels waste into biovanillin and optimization of process parameters using submerged fermentation  aVanillin is used as an aroma and flavoring agent in the food, beverage, and cosmetic industries. Vanilla planifolia is the major source of natural vanillin with a market price of 1200–4000$ per kg. To fulfill the market demand, low price vanillin is synthesized chemically i.e., 15 $/kg but European and US legislation considers it unnatural and recommends biosynthesis by fermentation. Ferulic acid is the main and costly precursor for vanillin production. It is naturally present in lignin-enriched agricultural wastes. Therefore, the present study was designed to extract ferulic acid from banana peels and then convert it into biovanillin using Enterobacter hormaechei. Different fermentative parameters like substrate concentration, incubation period, pH, temperature, and agitation speed were optimized via submerged fermentation by varying one factor at a time. From 100 g of banana peels, 60 ± 0.35 mg ferulic acid was extracted and used as a substrate for biovanillin production. The maximum significant (p-value < 0.05) production of biovanillin i.e., 3.8 ± 0.14 g/L was observed by bioconversion of 7 g/L of ferulic acid at 24 h of incubation time, pH 7, 30 °C and agitation speed of 150 rpm. Identification of produced vanillin was done by FTIR and quantification by HPLC method. It was found to be 97% pure in comparison to the standard of Sigma-Aldrich. Hence, the fruit by-product i.e., banana peels served as a useful substrate for the biosynthesis of vanillin. These conditions can be further optimized on a pilot scale to commercialize the product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter hormaechei 3aVanilla planifolia 3aagitation 3aagricultural biotechnology 3abananas 3abeverages 3abiocatalysis 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3abyproducts 3aferulic acid 3afruits 3alaws and regulations 3amarket prices 3aodors 3apH 3asubmerged fermentation 3asupply balance 3atemperature 3avanillin 0aBiovanillin 0aBioconversion 0aFruit by-product 0aCharacterization1 aUr Rehman Baig, Ubaid1 aTayyab, Muhammad1 aAltaf, Imran1 aIrfan, Muhammad1 aRaẓā, Sayyid Qāsim,1 aNadeem, Fareeha1 aMehmood, Tahir1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7354-328X0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2021 Sept., v. 36 p.102154-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2021.1021543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245014100205520102900346592002801375650004401403650002501447650002201472650001901494650001801513650002501531650001801556650001901574650000701593650003301600650001101633653002001644653002701664700001601691700001701707700001401724700001601738700001901754773010601773856008701879852000901966655001201975IND60648450120221122040113.0190719e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064845012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1216932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Liwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0520-778610aCombination of steam explosion pretreatment and anaerobic alkalization treatment to improve enzymatic hydrolysis of Hippophae rhamnoides  aThe optimum condition of steam explosion pretreatment was screened for hippophae, and anaerobic calcium oxide (CaO) alkalization was further used to improve its enzymatic hydrolysis. Steam-exploded hippophae reached the lowest pH value (4.01) and the maximal hemicellulose removal (77.16%) at pressure 1.5 MPa and residence time 20 min. Lignocellulosic fractions of hippophae was remarkably reduced by CaO alkalization or steam explosion treatment, and enzymatic sugar yield was increased from 66 mg/g DM (untreated material) to 270 and 300 mg/g DM, respectively. The sequent pretreatment of steam explosion and CaO alkalization achieved a sugar yield of 330 mg/g DM, where 2% CaO loading rate was high enough. Besides, SEM, FTIR, and XRD analyses validated structural and physicochemical changes of hippophae. In conclusion, the sequent pretreatment of steam explosion at pressure 1.5 MPa for 20 min and anaerobic CaO alkalization at 2% loading rate could remarkably improve enzymatic hydrolysis of hippophae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkalinization 3acalcium oxide 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahemicellulose 3alignocellulose 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asugars 0aSteam explosion 0aAnaerobic alkalization1 aWang, Cheng1 aShi, Honghui1 aZhou, Wei1 aZhang, Qing1 aChen, Xiaoyang0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Oct., v. 289 p.121693-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1216933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245010800198300001600306500002000322520172600342592002802068596000902096596001002105596000802115650002302123650002002146650001102166650001002177650001302187650001902200650002102219650002202240650001402262650002302276650002402299650001602323650002202339650002502361650001102386650001502397651001802412651001102430700002102441700006302462700002702525700001802552773010702570856007302677852000902750655001202759IND60646804720221119035145.0190613e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680472DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.126572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Rest, Kévin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1592-840210aEffect of weather conditions on the spring migration of Eurasian Woodcock and consequences for breeding  ap. 559-572.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMigration is a critical period of time with fitness consequences for birds. The development of tracking technologies now allows researchers to examine how different aspects of bird migration affect population dynamics. Weather conditions experienced during migration are expected to influence movements and, subsequently, the timing of arrival and the energetic costs involved. We analysed satellite‐tracking data from 68 Eurasian Woodcock Scolopax rusticola fitted with Argos satellite tags in the British Isles and France (2012–17). First, we evaluated the effect of weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric stability and visibility) on migration movements of individuals. Then we investigated the consequences for breeding success (age ratio) and brood precocity (early‐brood ratio) population‐level indices while accounting for climatic variables on the breeding grounds. Air temperature, wind and relative humidity were the main variables related to migration movements, with high temperatures and northward winds greatly increasing the probability of onward flights, whereas a trend towards greater humidity over 4 days decreased the probability of movement. Breeding success was mostly affected by climatic variables on the breeding grounds. The proportion of juveniles in autumn was negatively correlated with temperature in May, but positively correlated with precipitation in June and July. Brood precocity was poorly explained by the covariates used in this study. Our data for the Eurasian Woodcock indicate that, although weather conditions during spring migration affect migration movements, they do not have a major influence on subsequent breeding success.  aPublisher supplied data  cGWCT  cONCFS  cCNB 3aScolopax rusticola 3aair temperature 3aautumn 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3aclimatic factors 3aearly development 3ajuveniles 3amigratory behavior 3apopulation dynamics 3aprobability 3arelative humidity 3areproductive success 3aspring 3awind speed 3aBritish Isles 3aFrance1 aHoodless, Andrew1 aHeward, Christopher1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7286-67761 aCazenave, Jean‐Louis1 aFerrand, Yves0 tIbis.g2019 July, v. 161, no. 3 p.559-572dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.126573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245013000160300002000290520168600310592002801996650004402024650003702068650002102105650002402126650003702150650001902187650001602206650001402222650002202236650001302258650003402271650003102305650001902336653002302355653001002378653000702388653002202395653002302417700001802440700002002458700001502478700001602493700001402509700002002523700001702543700001802560700002002578700001502598700001802613773012602631856008002757852000902837655001202846IND60586582520221121021208.0171214e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058658252DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b148362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Tianye10aChelator-Free Conjugation of 99mTc and Gd3+ to PEGylated Nanographene Oxide for Dual-Modality SPECT/MR Imaging of Lymph Nodes  ap. 42612-42621.  aPEGylated ultrasmall nanographene oxide (usNGO-PEG) has exhibited a great potential in nanotheranostics due to its newly discovered physicochemical properties derived from the rich functional groups and bonds. Herein, we developed a general, simple, and kitlike preparation approach for ⁹⁹ᵐTc- and Gd-anchored NGO-PEG using a chelator-free strategy. In this strategy, [⁹⁹ᵐTcᴵ(CO)₃(OH₂)₃]⁺ (abbreviated to ⁹⁹ᵐTcᴵ) and GdCl₃ were mixed with usNGO-PEG to yield ⁹⁹ᵐTc- and Gd-usNGO-PEG via the synergistic coordination of N and O atoms from NGO and PEG with ⁹⁹ᵐTcᴵ and Gd³⁺ without additional exogenous chelators. Under optimized conditions, the nanoprobes ⁹⁹ᵐTc- and Gd-usNGO-PEG were reliably prepared with high yields and good stability. Serial comparative experiments of the labeling yield, the measurements of −NH₂ density and ζ-potentials, and various characterizations including energy-dispersive X-ray analysis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy demonstrated that both usNGO and PEG synergistically provide the electron-donating atoms O and N to coordinate with ⁹⁹ᵐTcᴵ and Gd to form stable nanocomplexes. Furthermore, both ⁹⁹ᵐTc- and Gd-usNGO-PEG exhibited excellent in vivo imaging of lymph nodes using single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging after local injection. Therefore, these results showed the successful establishment of ⁹⁹ᵐTc- and Gd-anchored usNGO-PEG using a chelator-free strategy and the potential of multimodality SPECT/CT and MR imaging of lymph nodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achelating agents 3acomputed tomography 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aimage analysis 3alymph nodes 3amagnetism 3amaterials science 3amoieties 3anongovernmental organizations 3aphysicochemical properties 3azeta potential 0ananographene oxide 0aSPECT 0aMR 0amolecular imaging 0alymph node imaging1 aZhou, Xiaobao1 aZheng, Yingying1 aSun, Yuyun1 aZhang, Jian1 aChen, Wei1 aZhang, Jianping1 aZhou, Zhiguo1 aYang, Shiping1 aZhang, Yingjian1 aYang, Hong1 aWang, Mingwei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 9, no. 49 p.42612-42621dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b148363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245006700174300001800241520125200259592002801511650001101539650001901550650001101569650002001580650001101600650001401611650001101625650003701636650000901673650001601682700002901698700001801727773011201745856009001857990002301947852000901970655001201979IND60095814220221119202852.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009581422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaj, Abhijeet10aReaction mechanism for the free-edge oxidation of soot by O₂  ap. 3423-3436.  aThe reaction pathways for the oxidation by O₂ of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in soot particles are investigated using density functional theory at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. For this, pyrene radical (4-pyrenyl) is chosen as the model molecule, as most soot models present in the literature employ the reactions involving the conversion of 4-pyrenyl to 4-phenanthryl by O₂ and OH to account for soot oxidation. Several routes for the formation of CO and CO₂ are proposed. The addition of O₂ on a radical site to form a peroxyl radical is found to be barrierless and exothermic with reaction energy of 188kJ/mol. For the oxidation reaction to proceed further, three pathways are suggested, each of which involve the activation energies of 104, 167 and 115kJ/mol relative to the peroxyl radical. The effect of the presence of H atom on a carbon atom neighboring the radical site on the energetics of carbon oxidation is assessed. Those intermediate species formed during oxidation with seven-membered rings or with a phenolic group are found to be highly stable.

Gross changes included the presence of a white, firm, smooth, 6 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm mass that diffusely expanded and partially effaced the gall bladder and infiltrated the adjacent hepatic parenchyma. On cut surface, the mass was pale yellow and had small, irregular, dark yellow areas. Scattered through the pancreas were 2 gray, well-demarcated, soft, homogeneous, 1 cm in diameter nodules that bulged out from the capsular surface. The right femoral head had a locally extensive area of cartilage erosion. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the gall bladder and pancreatic nodules revealed a primary cholecystic adenocarcinoma and multifocal insulinomas, respectively. A metastatic focus from the gall bladder neoplasm was observed infiltrating the right adrenal gland medulla. The goat also had mild pulmonary infestation by Muellerius capillaris. Primary hepatobiliary and pancreatic neoplasia is rare in goats, and to the authors’ knowledge, neither cholecystic adenocarcinoma nor pancreatic insulinomas have been previously reported in this species.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBoer (goat breed) 3aMuellerius capillaris 3aadenocarcinoma 3aadrenal medulla 3aarthritis 3ablood serum 3acartilage 3afemales 3afemur 3agall bladder 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3agoats 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aliver 3ametastasis 3anecropsy 3apancreas 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 0aCaprine neoplasia 0agall bladder adenocarcinoma 0ahepatobiliary neoplasia 0ainsulinoma 0apancreatic neoplasia1 aRissi, Daniel R.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 26, no. 6 p.827-831dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387145532943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03835naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014200171300001800313520205700331592002802388650001302416650001102429650002802440650002102468650001502489650002202504650000902526650001902535650002302554650001302577650002102590650001602611650002302627650002002650650001002670650002002680650001702700650001302717650001802730650001102748650001802759650001202777650002402789650001102813650001002824653001102834653002702845653001202872653001402884700002702898700002002925700001802945700002302963700002402986773010803010856008203118852000903200655001203209IND60709331620221117005319.0210209e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070933162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThananurak, Pachara10aDifferent concentrations of cysteamine, ergothioneine, and serine modulate quality and fertilizing ability of cryopreserved chicken sperm  ap. 1185-1198.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of freezing diluents supplemented in three potential amines/amino acids, namely, antioxidant cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol [AET]), ergothioneine (ERG), and serine (SER), in optimization of chicken sperm cryopreservation. The semen of 36 Pradu Hang Dum males, selected based on their motility vigor score, was frozen by a simple freezing method using nitrogen vapors and dimethylformamide (DMF). In a first experiment, a wide range of AET, ERG, and SER doses were tested. Semen quality was evaluated after incubation at 5°C or after cryopreservation in straws in the Blumberger Hahnen Sperma Verdünner (BHSV) diluent + DMF (6% v/v) with or without AET, ERG, or SER. The best targeted doses of AET, ERG, or SER were then selected for experiment 2 that was focused on cryopreserved semen. Frozen-thawed sperm quality was evaluated by different in vitro tests and by evaluation of fertility. Objective motility parameters were evaluated by computer-assisted sperm analysis. Membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, and mitochondria function were evaluated using appropriate dyes and flow cytometry. Lipid peroxide production was assessed by the thiobarbituric acid test (malondialdehyde production). Fertility obtained with frozen-thawed semen supplemented or not in AET, ERG, or SER was evaluated after artificial insemination of laying hens. ERG and AET decreased sperm lipid peroxidation and decreased fertility, even at low doses. The presence of 4 mmol of SER significantly decreased lipid peroxidation, increased the frozen-thawed sperm quality, and increased fertility after sperm cryopreservation (90% vs. control 84%, P < 0.05). In a third experiment, the use of 1 mmol of sucrose (the best result of our previous study) added to 4 mmol of SER-supplemented extender was tested. This addition allowed to the highest levels of fertility (93%). In conclusion, the addition of 4 mmol of SER in semen cryopreservation diluents decreases peroxidation and improves the efficiency of the process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome 3aamines 3aartificial insemination 3acryopreservation 3acysteamine 3adimethylformamide 3adyes 3aflow cytometry 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3ain vitro studies 3alaying hens 3alipid peroxidation 3alipid peroxides 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amitochondria 3anitrogen 3asemen quality 3aserine 3asperm quality 3asucrose 3athiobarbituric acid 3avapors 3avigor 0aserine 0asemen cryopreservation 0achicken 0afertility1 aChuaychu-noo, Napapach1 aThélie, Aurore1 aPhasuk, Yupin1 aVongpralub, Thevin1 aBlesbois, Elisabeth0 tPoultry science.g2020 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.1185-1198dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245006000210300002000270506007600290520156700366592002801933506003701961650000801998650001702006650001602023650001402039650001902053650001302072650001102085650002102096650001202117650001502129653001602144653001402160653001602174653001702190653002002207700002202227700002402249700002002273700002602293700001902319700002202338773017602360856007902536852000902615655001202624IND60172234620221207094603.0150602e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017223462DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12031261092doi7 aPMC34270872pmcid7 a228474492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaloney, Kristin A.10aFunctional epialleles at an endogenous human centromere  ap. 13704-13709.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman centromeres are defined by megabases of homogenous alpha-satellite DNA arrays that are packaged into specialized chromatin marked by the centromeric histone variant, centromeric protein A (CENP-A). Although most human chromosomes have a single higher-order repeat (HOR) array of alpha satellites, several chromosomes have more than one HOR array. Homo sapiens chromosome 17 (HSA17) has two juxtaposed HOR arrays, D17Z1 and D17Z1-B. Only D17Z1 has been linked to CENP-A chromatin assembly. Here, we use human artificial chromosome assembly assays to show that both D17Z1 and D17Z1-B can support de novo centromere assembly independently. We extend these in vitro studies and demonstrate, using immunostaining and chromatin analyses, that in human cells the centromere can be assembled at D17Z1 or D17Z1-B. Intriguingly, some humans are functional heterozygotes, meaning that CENP-A is located at a different HOR array on the two HSA17 homologs. The site of CENP-A assembly on HSA17 is stable and is transmitted through meiosis, as evidenced by inheritance of CENP-A location through multigenerational families. Differences in histone modifications are not linked clearly with active and inactive D17Z1 and D17Z1-B arrays; however, we detect a correlation between the presence of variant repeat units of D17Z1 and CENP-A assembly at the opposite array, D17Z1-B. Our studies reveal the presence of centromeric epialleles on an endogenous human chromosome and suggest genomic complexities underlying the mechanisms that determine centromere identity in humans.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aHomo sapiens 3acentromeres 3achromatin 3aheterozygosity 3ahistones 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ameiosis 3asatellites 0akinetochore 0adicentric 0aepigenetics 0apolymorphism 0aheterochromatin1 aSullivan, Lori L.1 aMatheny, Justyne E.1 aStrome, Erin D.1 aMerrett, Stephanie L.1 aFerris, Alyssa1 aSullivan, Beth A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 109, no. 34 p.13704-13709dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12031261093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01413naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277520039600293592002800689650001600717650001400733650004400747650002200791650001500813700002200828700001900850700002000869773011900889856008201008852000901090655001201099IND60593210320221119213700.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059321032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-018-2327-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGromova, M.A.10aSynthetic Transformations of Higher Terpenoids. 36.* Synthesis of 13-(Oxazol-5-Yl)-15,16-Bisnorisopimaranes  ap. 293-300.  aThe conditions for oxidizing methyl isopimarate to the 15-oxo-15,16-dihydroisopimarate were studied.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can promote nutrient absorption and improve plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the mechanisms governing the effects of AMF on crop growth in organic continuous cropping substrates have not been elucidated. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that the inoculation of AMF in continuous cropping substrates promoted growth and root development, and increased the root and NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) activity of tomato seedlings. Root transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the plant hormone signal transduction pathway was highly enriched, and 109 genes that positively correlated with the AMF-inoculated plant phenotype were obtained by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which identified 9 genes related to indole acetic acid (IAA). Importantly, the levels of endogenous IAA in tomato seedlings significantly increased after AMF inoculation. Furthermore, the application of AMF significantly increased the expression levels of NADP-ME1 and NADP-ME2, as well as the activity of NADP-ME, and enhanced the root activity of tomato seedlings in comparison to that observed without inoculation of AMF. However, these effects were blocked in plants treated with 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), a polar transport inhibitor of IAA. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IAA mediates the AMF-promoted tomato growth and expression of NADP-MEs in continuous cropping substrates. The study provides convincing evidence for the reuse of continuous cropping substrates by adding AMF as an amendment.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019YFD1001901cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2019YFD1001902cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31872152cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31801902cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019T120433cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China 3aculture media 3aenzymes 3agenes 3ahorticulture 3aindole acetic acid 3anutrient uptake 3aphenotype 3asignal transduction 3asoilless culture 3atomatoes 3atranscriptomics 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aChina1 aZhang, Wenze1 aLiu, Weikang1 aAhammed, Golam Jalal1 aWen, Wenxu1 aGuo, Shirong1 aShu, Sheng1 aSun, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3807-72760 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.48-48dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02817-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005600137245007800193300001600271520216500287592002802452653001202480653003002492653001802522653001802540700001702558700003002575700001702605700002002622773010802642856007202750852000902822655001202831IND60686972220221119054222.0200320s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068697222DNAL7 a10.1071/WR191062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yuqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3411-992910aBuilding selection by the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula)  ap. 186-195.  aContextThe common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is a protected native species in Australia that can access buildings in urban areas and cause considerable damage or disruption to building occupants. Although several strategies to discourage this species from entering buildings have been recommended, few have been evaluated empirically. AimsOur study aims to analyse how landscaping and building construction influence occupancy of buildings by the common brushtail possum. MethodsWe collated reports of possums occupying 134 buildings over 12 years on the campus of The Australian National University (ANU), in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). We used generalised linear modelling (GLM) to identify associations between the total number of reported possum-related incidents for buildings and a range of landscape and building characteristics. Key resultsControlling for the effect of building size, we found that the number of reported possum-related incidents in buildings was positively associated with the percentage of tree and shrub canopy cover within the calculated home-range buffer distance of 49m from buildings, length of canopy overhanging roofs and building age, and negatively associated with tree species richness and number of trees with natural hollows and nest boxes within 49m of buildings. There were likely to be more possum-related reports from buildings in areas where the dominant tree genus was native, buildings with parapets (walls extending above the roof), buildings with structures penetrating from the roof, buildings with tile roofs and gable roofs. ConclusionsA combination of suitable habitat surrounding buildings, suitable access to the roofs of buildings and weak points in building roofs (e.g. parapets, roof penetrations), makes them more vulnerable to occupancy by the common brushtail possum. Implications Our results provided clues for managing existing buildings, or designing new buildings, in a way that may reduce the likelihood of occupancy by the common brushtail possum. Our study also demonstrated how building-maintenance records can be used to address human–wildlife conflict over time.  aPublisher supplied data 0acontrol 0ahuman–wildlife conflict 0apest wildlife 0aurban ecology1 aDoran, Bruce1 aSinclair-Hannocks, Sharyn1 aMangos, John1 aGibbons, Philip0 tWildlife research.g2020, v. 47, no. 2 p.186-195dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957321x1035-37127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR191063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04122naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245020600167300001600373520191100389536033802300592002802638650001402666650001902680650000802699650002702707650003102734650001002765650001702775650001702792650002602809650000902835650001602844650001002860650001502870650001402885650001102899650001602910650001702926650003002943650002602973650002202999650001603021651001403037653001203051653000803063653001603071653001103087653003103098653003003129653002703159700002503186700002303211700001703234700002403251773013203275856008003407852000903487655001203496IND60616353020221119071641.0181016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061635302DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387145534272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobey, Carrie L.10aRetrospective study of central nervous system lesions and association with Parelaphostrongylus species by histology and specific nested polymerase chain reaction in domestic camelids and wild ungulates  ap. 748-754.  aFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from elk (Cervus elaphus), goats, and camelids with case histories and lesions suggestive of Parelaphostrongylus tenuis were examined by histology to characterize lesions that could aid in definitively diagnosing P. tenuis infection. Additionally, sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were used in a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) using Parelaphostrongylus-specific primers to determine how PCR results corresponded with histological findings. Histological changes in brain and spinal cord consisted of linear tracks of hemorrhage; tracks or perivascular accumulations of hemosiderin-laden macrophages; acute foci of axonal degeneration and/or linear glial scars; and perivascular, parenchymal, or meningeal accumulations of eosinophils and/or lymphocytes and plasma cells. Of the 43 samples with histologic lesions consistent with neural larval migrans, 19 were PCR positive; however, only 8 were confirmed Parelaphostrongylus by DNA sequencing. Additionally, 1 goat was identified with a protostrongylid that had a 97% identity to both Parelaphostrongylus odocoilei and a protostrongylid nematode from pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus celer) from Argentina. None of the histologic lesions individually or in combination correlated statistically to positive molecular tests for the nematode. The results indicate that it is possible to extract Parelaphostrongylus DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, but extended fixation presumably can cause DNA crosslinking. Nested PCR provides another diagnostic tool to identify the cause of neurologic disease in camelids and elk with histologic lesions consistent with neural larval migrans. Furthermore, potential novel protostrongylid DNA was detected from a goat with lesions consistent with P. tenuis infection, suggesting that other neurotropic Parelaphostrongylus species may occur locally.  aFunding Support for this project was provided by the Fund for Education Advancement and Research (RW Gerhold and SJ Newman) from the Department of Biomedical and Diagnostic Sciences, and the Center of Excellence in Livestock Diseases and Human Health (C Dobey), College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamelidae 3aCervus elaphus 3aDNA 3aOzotoceros bezoarticus 3aParelaphostrongylus tenuis 3abrain 3acase studies 3acrosslinking 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelks 3aeosinophils 3agoats 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3alarvae 3amacrophages 3aplasma cells 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aretrospective studies 3asequence analysis 3aspinal cord 3aArgentina 0aAlpacas 0aelk 0aeosinophils 0allamas 0aParelaphostrongylus tenuis 0apolymerase chain reaction 0aWallerian degeneration1 aGrunenwald, Caroline1 aNewman, Shelley J.1 aMuller, Lisa1 aGerhold, Richard W.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 26, no. 6 p.748-754dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387145534273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012400167300001600291500001900307520075100326592002801077650001901105650002501124650001701149650001201166650002501178650001801203650002301221650001101244650001601255650001401271653003501285653001801320653002301338653001101361700001701372700001701389700002201406773014701428856008101575852000901656655001201665IND60689327920221120122345.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068932792DNAL7 a10.1080/096374809029155252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaslinda, W.

It is found that drying performance of LiCl solution is better than that of LiBr solution. Besides, drying performance of three mixed solutions (44%, 46% and 49%) selected is similar to that of 40% LiCl solution, verifying the feasibility of substituting single solution with much cheaper mixed solution. The water vapor pressure of mixed solutions and LiCl solution is same in experiments, therefore it can be selected as an indicative factor to evaluate substitute of LiCl solution. Moreover, the cost of the three mixed solutions is 18% cheaper than that of 40% LiCl solution at least, which shows significant economization in application. Finally, system performance of the compressed air drying system is analyzed. The dew point of outlet compressed air could reach −7.7 °C at operating pressure of 0.8 MPa, indicating the dryness can satisfy requirement of various industrial applications which used typical electricity-driven cooling-drying method. The solution temperature of regeneration could reach 70 °C, validating that it is feasible to use waste heat recycled from the air compressor to drive solution regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair drying 3adesiccants 3adewpoint 3aheat 3aindustrial applications 3aliquids 3alithium chloride 3atemperature 3avapor pressure 3awastes 3awater vapor 0aCompressed air 0aLiquid desiccant 0aDrying performance 0aEnergy consumption1 aYin, Yonggao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1556-85741 aGuo, Xiaoshuang1 aJin, Xing1 aZhang, Xiaosong0 tEnergy.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014600173300001600319520203800335592002802373650001602401650001802417650001202435650002802447650001002475650002402485650001402509650002302523650002602546650002702572650001402599650001102613650001002624650001302634650001202647650000902659650001702668650001702685650002602702650002002728650001502748650001202763650001402775650001102789650002702800653001002827653001302837653002002850653001702870653002302887700002602910773010602936856008203042852000903124655001203133IND60709331820221117005819.0210209e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070933182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGumułka, Małgorzata10aComparison of carcass traits and meat quality of intensively reared geese from a Polish genetic resource flock to those of commercial hybrids  ap. 839-847.  aThe aim of the study was to determine slaughter yield and meat quality of native Zatorska (ZG) goose and compare them to those of commercial hybrid White Koluda® goose (WKG) after fattening in an intensive production system. The experiment was carried out on 500 birds of each group and lasted up to 10 wk of age. The birds were kept on deep litter with access to free range and were fed with the same complete feed mixtures, according to dietary requirements for broiler geese. Body weight, carcass composition, and technological properties of breast and thigh muscles were evaluated (pH₂₄, L*a*b* color, water holding capacity, thermal loss, drip loss, and shear force). In addition, chemical composition of breast and thigh muscles, fatty acid profile of muscle lipids, and amino acids of proteins were determined. The body weight, weight of eviscerated carcass, and dressing percentage of ZG were lower (P < 0.05) than those in WKG. However, breast and thigh muscles of both groups of geese were characterized by similar technological and nutritive values. The differences in meat quality traits concerned only the shear force of breast muscles, with higher values (P < 0.05) for WKG. Moreover, dry matter content in breast muscles of ZG was higher than that in WKG. The effect of goose genotype on the level of oleic acid and monounsaturated fatty acids in breast muscles was shown. Also, the amino acid proportion of meat protein depended on goose breed. Breast muscles of ZG were characterized by higher (P < 0.05) content of some nonessential (Glu, Asp, Ala) and essential amino acids (Val, Thr), and thigh muscles contained less (P < 0.05) Gly, Lys, and Leu and more Pro and Ile than WKG. The present results indicate that the meat of both ZG and WKG broilers showed good technological properties and basic chemical composition and fatty acid profile, and the protein was characterized by high nutritional value. Moreover, the smaller carcasses produced from ZG can better meet the needs of the current market.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3abreast muscle 3abreasts 3acarcass characteristics 3acolor 3adressing percentage 3adrip loss 3adry matter content 3aessential amino acids 3afatty acid composition 3afinishing 3aflocks 3ageese 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3ameat 3ameat protein 3ameat quality 3anutrient requirements 3anutritive value 3aoleic acid 3arearing 3aslaughter 3athighs 3awater holding capacity 0ageese 0abroilers 0aslaughter yield 0ameat quality 0aamino acid profile1 aPołtowicz, Katarzyna0 tPoultry science.g2020 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.839-847dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03750naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245012500210300002000335506007600355520189700431592002802328506003702356650000802393650001502401650001502416650002602431650001102457650001902468650002102487650001702508650001702525650001002542650002602552650002902578650001102607650001502618650002202633650001402655650001102669650003002680650001902710653002102729653001502750700002502765700001902790700001702809700002202826700002902848700001902877773017602896856007903072852000903151655001203160IND60172234920221207093911.0150602e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017223492DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12033261092doi7 aPMC34270932pmcid7 a228697322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStecklein, Shane R.10aBRCA1 and HSP90 cooperate in homologous and non-homologous DNA double-strand-break repair and G2/M checkpoint activation  ap. 13650-13655.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExpression of functional breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) in human breast and ovarian cancers is associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutics and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. BRCA1 is a nuclear tumor suppressor that is critical for resolving double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) by homologous recombination (HR). In vitro, animal and human clinical data have demonstrated that BRCA1-deficient cancers are highly sensitive to ICL-inducing chemotherapeutic agents, are amenable to synthetic lethal approaches that exploit defects in DSB/ICL repair, and may be associated with improved survival. Conversely, high or restored expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancer is associated with therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis. There has been much interest in identifying agents that interfere with BRCA1-dependent DSB/ICL repair to restore or enhance sensitivity to cancer therapeutics. We demonstrate that the heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin [17-AAG (Tanespimycin)], currently in Phase II/III clinical evaluation for several cancers, induces BRCA1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, resulting in compromised repair of ionizing radiation- and platinum-induced DNA damage. We show that loss of HSP90 function abolishes BRCA1-dependent DSB repair and that BRCA1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to 17-AAG due to impaired Gap 2/Mitosis (G2/M) checkpoint activation and resultant mitotic catastrophe. In summary, we document an upstream HSP90-dependent regulatory point in the Fanconi anemia/BRCA DSB/ICL repair pathway, illuminate the role of BRCA1 in regulating damage-associated checkpoint and repair responses to HSP90 inhibitors, and identify BRCA1 as a clinically relevant target for enhancing sensitivity in refractory and/or resistant malignancies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aanemia 3aanimal ovaries 3abreast neoplasms 3acrosslinking 3adrug therapy 3agenes 3aheat-shock protein 90 3ahomologous recombination 3ahumans 3aionization 3aovarian neoplasms 3aprognosis 3aribose 3atumor suppressor proteins 3aubiquitination 0achemosensitivity 0aDNA repair1 aKumaraswamy, Easwari1 aBehbod, Fariba1 aWang, Wenjia1 aChaguturu, Vamsee1 aHarlan-Williams, Lisa M.1 aJensen, Roy A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 109, no. 34 p.13650-13655dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12033261093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010800158300002000266520132000286592002801606650002601634650001301660650002801673650001101701650001901712650001101731650001101742650001701753650001901770650001401789650001301803650001301816650002101829700002001850700001601870700002201886773012401908856007402032852000902106655001202115IND60641654720221120130000.0190505e20170420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064165472DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04059h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhlgren, Sara10aEGF-targeting lipodisks for specific delivery of poorly water-soluble anticancer agents to tumour cells  ap. 22178-22186.  aConcerns regarding poor aqueous solubility, high toxicity and lack of specificity impede the translation of many hydrophobic anticancer agents into safe and effective anticancer drugs. The application of colloidal drug delivery systems, and in particular the use of lipid-based nanocarriers, has been identified as a promising means to overcome these issues. PEG-stabilized lipid nanodisks (lipodisks) have lately emerged as a novel type of biocompatible, nontoxic and adaptable drug nanocarrier. In this study we have explored the potential of lipodisks as a platform for formulation and tumour targeted delivery of hydrophobic anticancer agents. Using curcumin as a model compound, we show that lipodisks can be loaded with substantial amounts of hydrophobic drugs (curcumin/lipid molar ratio 0.15). We demonstrate moreover that by deliberate choice of preparation protocols the lipodisks can be provided with relevant amounts of targeting proteins, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF). Data from in vitro cell studies verify that such EGF-decorated curcumin-loaded lipodisks are capable of EGF-receptor specific targeting of human A-431 tumour cells, and strongly suggest that the interaction between the lipodisks and the tumour cells results in receptor-mediated internalization of the disks and their cargo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3acurcumin 3aepidermal growth factor 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3amodels 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aproteins 3atoxicity 3awater solubility1 aFondell, Amelie1 aGedda, Lars1 aEdwards, Katarina0 tRSC advances.g2017 Apr. 20, v. 7, no. 36 p.22178-22186dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04059h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245006700174300001800241520153000259592002801789650001201817650001401829650001501843650001401858650001601872650001601888650001001904700001301914700001601927700002301943700002201966773009701988856009002085990002302175852000902198655001202207IND60095814620221122181258.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009581462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLam, King-Yiu10aShock tube measurements of 3-pentanone pyrolysis and oxidation  ap. 3251-3263.  aHigh-temperature 3-pentanone pyrolysis and oxidation studies were performed behind reflected shock waves using laser-based species time-history measurements (3-pentanone, CH₃, CO, C₂H₄, OH and H₂O) and ignition delay time measurements. The overall 3-pentanone decomposition rate coefficient was inferred from the measured 3-pentanone and CH₃ time-histories during pyrolysis at temperatures of 1070–1530K and a pressure of 1.6atm., and yielded a mathematical expression for kₜₒₜ=4.383×10⁴⁹T⁻¹⁰exp(−44,780/T)s⁻¹ with an uncertainty of ±35% over 1070–1330K. The measured species time-histories and ignition delay times were also compared to simulations from a detailed kinetic mechanism of Serinyel et al. (2010) [14]. The measured kₜₒₜ was approximately 3.5 times faster than the value used by Serinyel et al. Additionally, the absence of a methyl ketene decomposition reaction was identified as the cause of a deficiency in the O-atom balance of the measured 3-pentanone and CO time-histories. Using the revised overall 3-pentanone decomposition rate coefficient and an additional methyl ketene decomposition pathway, the modified mechanism was able to successfully simulate all six species time-histories, and showed a significant improvement in the predictions of ignition delay times. Finally, a comparison of ignition delay times and OH species time-histories during 3-pentanone, 2-pentanone and acetone oxidation found that 3-pentanone was the most reactive of the three ketones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aoxidation 3aprediction 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awater1 aRen, Wei1 aHong, Zekai1 aDavidson, David F.1 aHanson, Ronald K.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2012 Nov., v. 159, no. 11 p.3251-3263dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.06.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001500159245013100174300001600305500000900321500001500330520166400345592002802009650002302037650002102060650001202081650001902093650001702112650001302129650002602142650003102168650001702199650001902216650001202235650001902247650002802266650001102294650002502305650001202330650005702342650005102399650003302450650003902483650001702522650002402539650006102563650001702624651001002641651001002651653001502661653002802676700001702704700001802721700001902739700001902758700001602777773019202793852000902985856007702994655001203071IND4430884820221123020159.0191028e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443088482DNAL7 a200483132pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2009.01092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lin10aResponses of a Dominant Temperate Grassland Plant (Leymus chinensis) to Elevated Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen Addition in China  ap. 251-259.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe impact of elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentration on plant communities is varied and strongly dependent on the dominant species response, as well as nutrient conditions. Responses of a dominant species (Leymus chinensis) to elevated CO₂ and N application were examined with open-top chambers in a typical temperate grassland in northern China for 3 yr. The significant effect of elevated CO₂ on L. chinensis growth was mainly reflected in the higher photosynthetic rates, increased leaf number, larger shoot and root biomass, and higher root/shoot (R/S) ratio. Enhancement of root biomass induced by elevated CO₂ was larger (40%) than that of shoot biomass (9%). In contrast, N application had a significant impact on most growth indices examined in this study, which was reflected in the enhanced aboveground growth and depressed belowground growth. Nitrogen application significantly reduced the R/S ratio by an average of 40%. Nitrogen addition significantly enhanced the proportion of senescent biomass and decreased the proportion of green leaf biomass under elevated CO₂ There were no CO₂ × N interactions on most of the measured variables, except on photosynthetic rate and the proportion of aboveground biomass. Plant growth variables showed high interannual variation. These results indicate that belowground growth of L. chinensis is more sensitive to elevated CO₂ than is the aboveground. Aboveground growth of L. chinensis is much more sensitive to N application than to CO₂ enrichment. Therefore, the effect of elevated CO₂ on L. chinensis steppe is more likely to be underestimated if only aboveground parts are considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemporal variation 3aLeymus chinensis 3agrasses 3acarbon dioxide 3aroot systems 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aaerial parts 3asoil fertility 3asteppes 3aphotosynthesis 3adry matter partitioning 3aleaves 3anitrogen fertilizers 2aBiomass 2aCarbon Dioxidexchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aNitrogenxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effects 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aPlant Shoots 2aPlant Transpiration 2aPoaceaexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 3aChina 0aChina 0asenescence 0adry matter accumulation1 aYang, Yunxia1 aZhan, Xiaoyun1 aZhang, Canjuan1 aZhou, Shuangxi1 aWu, Dongxiu0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2010 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.251-259dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2009.01093Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02700naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011300164300001400277520143700291592002801728650001501756650001101771650002701782653001601809653001701825653002701842653002501869653002101894700001401915700005601929700001901985700001902004700005602023700005302079773008802132856008502220852000902305655001202314IND60616136620221119210624.0190214e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061613662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Lei10aExperimental analysis of super-knock occurrence based on a spark ignition engine with high compression ratio  ap. 68-75.  aThe super-knock phenomenon is a major obstacle for further improving the power density in SI engines. The objective of this paper is to experimentally investigating the mechanism involved in the occurrence of super-knock. In this work, a high compression ratio (CR = 13) coupled with advanced spark timings were employed to achieving intense or critical thermal-dynamic conditions to easily inducing the super-knock. The results show that super-knock can originate from spark ignition, which is different from previous results regarding pre-ignition. Changing the spark timing super-knock can be induced with very high pressure oscillation at the present high compression ratio. The high compression ratio could generate sufficiently high thermal-dynamic conditions to inducing the abnormal combustion. In this research, four combustion phenomena were observed. The present work indicates that there is a nonlinear relationship between knock intensity and knocking onset in terms of pressure profiles at different cycles. The super-knock or knock phenomena were dominantly induced by spark ignition, which were controlled by the pre-ignition after several cycles. Finally, the analysis of the mechanism of super-knock with severe pressure oscillation was employed based on the thermal explosion theory and cavity resonances. There are two possible auto-ignition combustion modes that can induce the intense pressure oscillation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aspark ignition engines 0aSuper-knock 0aPre-ignition 0aHigh compression ratio 0aPressure oscillation 0aCombustion modes1 aKang, Rui1 aWei, Haiqiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3665-42281 aFeng, Dengquan1 aHua, Jianxiong1 aPan, Jiaying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1870-13931 aChen, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0705-67390 tEnergy.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.68-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006300152245012200215520150900337592002801846650001501874650001701889650001101906650001201917650001301929650001001942650001001952650000901962653004001971653003602011653001202047653002602059653001402085700002302099700002202122700002302144700001902167773009802186856008702284852000902371655001202380IND60642986620221119030622.0201125e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064298662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchilling, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3831-069110aIntegrated design of working fluid and organic Rankine cycle utilizing transient exhaust gases of heavy-duty vehicles  aHeavy-duty vehicles waste a major part of their fuel energy in the exhaust gas. To recover energy from the exhaust gas, Organic Rankine Cycles are a promising technology. However, both, the Organic Rankine Cycle and its working fluid have to be tailored to the transient energy input by the exhaust gas. For this purpose, we developed the so-called 1-stage Continuous-Molecular Targeting - Computer-aided Molecular Design (1-stage CoMT-CAMD) method. 1-stage CoMT-CAMD integrates the design of novel working fluids as degree of freedom into the process optimization. However, so far, 1-stage CoMT-CAMD is limited to a nominal operating point. In this work, we enable the integrated design for transient heat sources by combining 1-stage CoMT-CAMD with aggregation techniques. Aggregation techniques allow us to represent the many operating points due to the transient heat source by a few aggregated operating points serving as input for the integrated design. A subsequent assessment of the identified working fluids ensures safety and environmental friendliness. The resulting algorithm is applied to the design of an Organic Rankine Cycle on heavy-duty vehicles using the VECTO long haul cycle to characterize the transient exhaust gas. For this case study, 6 aggregated operating points are sufficient to represent the transient exhaust gas accurately. The optimal identified working fluid is ethyl formate and increases the net power output by 30% compared to the commonly used working fluid ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aformates 3afuels 3agases 3aheat 0aIntegrated process and fluid design 0aComputer-aided molecular design 0aPC-SAFT 0aAggregation technique 0aCoMT-CAMD1 aEichler, Katharina1 aKölsch, Benedikt1 aPischinger, Stefan1 aBardow, André0 tApplied energy.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 255 p.113207-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007700166300001800243520207100261592002802332650002102360650001102381650002302392650002102415650001302436650001602449700006002465773013502525856008002660852000902740655001202749IND60646805220221119035455.0190613e20190513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b010492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDayhoff, Guy W.10aHydration and Dispersion Forces in Hydroxypropylcellulose Phase Behavior  ap. 4976-4985.  aMany-body polarization and hydration forces can strongly affect the equilibrium structure and energetics of mixed phases. Accurately reproducing both forces presents a challenge to force field models because it requires balancing hydrogen bonding at short range with many-body orientational order and dispersive attraction at long range. This work reports the first comparison of experimental measurements of the pressure–area isotherm for hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) against molecular dynamics results with four different force field models—united-atom, all-atom (OPLS and CHARMM), and Drude oscillator models. All force fields exhibit the experimentally determined, exponentially shaped repulsive force at short range. Above a critical temperature of about 40 °C and a lattice spacing of around 14 Å, HPC experiments show a reversible, heat-induced polymer aggregation into an ordered phase driven by loss of water. The nonpolarizable force fields do not display the critical point and instead show biphasic behavior at all temperatures tested. This indicates net attractive forces at intermediate lattice spacings. In contrast, the Drude polarizable force field shows positive osmotic pressure and a single, homogeneous phase over all temperatures and spacings tested. Analysis of structural data from our simulations provides several clues to help interpret these findings. Although all force fields show similar water–water hydrogen bond numbers in the mixed phase, the polarizable model predicts that water–HPC hydrogen bonds are much more favorable than HPC–HPC hydrogen bonds when polymers are dispersed. At high density, water is driven out and replaced by HPC–HPC hydrogen bonds. The polarizable force field shows that both effects have a stronger dependence on polymer density than any of the nonpolarizable models. Our observations support the conclusion that hydration forces are coupled to the polymer coordination number by local, structural waters and that long-range dispersive attraction is overestimated by pairwise additive models.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aosmotic pressure 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aRogers, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5187-17680 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 May 13, v. 123, no. 23 p.4976-4985dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b010493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016800173300001400341520135800355592002801713650001401741650001101755650001501766650001001781650002701791650001301818650001001831650001401841650001401855650005201869650001401921650001801935650001201953651001001965653000901975653001501984653001801999653001502017653001602032653001002048700002202058700002602080700002502106700002102131700002302152773010602175856008502281852000902366655001202375IND60576089520221119083326.0190403e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057608952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoltan, Mohamed A.10aMolecular characterization of circulating Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) serotype O topotype EA-3 and serotype A (African topotype) genotype IV in Egypt, 2016  ap. 89-93.  aIn January–April 2016, cattle and buffalo farm owners and veterinarians reported clinical signs suggestive of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) outbreaks among non-vaccinated cattle and buffalo herds in Egypt. The clinical disease observed was either mild (small oral lesions and speedy recovery) or severe (extensive oral lesions and/or mortalities), and the form of the disease (either mild or severe) segregated by farm. This study aimed to confirm the presence of FMDV and to characterize the circulating strains associated with the outbreaks. Vesicular epithelia were collected from 41 animals representing 15 affected cattle and buffalo farms in five governorates (Behira, Cairo, Daqahlia, Giza and Ismailia), and tested by real time (rt) RT-PCR. Consequently, 92% (38/41) of examined samples were positive. Furthermore, the VP1 coding region of 60% (23/38) of positive specimens were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. The phylogenetic analysis identified two distinct strains characterized as serotype O topotype EA-3 and serotype A (African topotype) of genotype IV in the severe and mild disease forms, respectively. The newly identified strains clustered in distinct clades in the phylogenetic trees, indicating the likelihood of new incursions into Egypt. Those strains were most closely related to previously described Sudanese strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3aepithelium 3afarms 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agenotype 3aherds 3amortality 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3aveterinarians 3aviruses 3aEgypt 0aFMDV 0aSerotype O 0aTopotype EA-3 0aSerotype A 0aGenotype IV 0aEgypt1 aNegmaldin, Ali H.1 aEl-Diasty, Mohamed M.1 aMansour, Shimaa M.G.1 aElbadry, Maha A.1 aWilkes, Rebecca P.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 208 p.89-93dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014200169300001100311520210900322592002802431596012802459650000802587650001002595650001202605650001002617650001702627650002802644650001302672650001502685650001502700650001902715650001202734650004302746650002402789700005902813700002502872700002002897700001902917700001802936700001802954773011502972856008303087852000903170655001203179IND60724015520221119102050.0220910e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072401552DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-020-02731-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshizaki, Kyoko10aPCR-based genotyping assays to detect germline APC variant associated with hereditary gastrointestinal polyposis in Jack Russell terriers  ap. 32.  aBACKGROUND: The prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) neoplastic polyps in Jack Russell terriers (JRTs) has increased in Japan since the late 2000s. Recently, we demonstrated that JRTs with GI polyps harbor identical germline variant in the APC gene (c.[462_463delinsTT]) in the heterozygous state. Thus, this disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder. Although the affected JRTs have distinct features, such as the development of multiple GI polyps and an early age of disease onset, genetic testing is indispensable for a definitive diagnosis. Here, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays capable of detecting germline APC variant were designed and validated using synthetic wild-type and mutant DNAs and genomic DNAs from carrier and non-carrier dogs. RESULT: First, the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was developed by taking advantage of the germline APC variant creating a new restriction site for MseI. In the PCR-RFLP assay, the 156-bp region containing the variant site was amplified by PCR and subsequently digested with MseI, yielding diagnostic 51 and 58 bp fragments from the mutant allele and allowing determination of the APC genotypes. It was possible to determine the genotypes using genomic DNA extracted from the peripheral blood, buccal swab, or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Next, a TaqMan duplex real-time PCR assay was developed, where a 78-bp region flanking the variant was amplified in the presence of wild-type allele- and mutant allele-specific fluorescent probes. Using blood-derived DNA, altogether 40 cycles of PCR amplification determined the APC genotypes of all examined samples by measuring the fluorescence intensities. Importantly, false-positive and false-negative errors were never detected in both assays. CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed highly reliable genetic tests for hereditary GI polyposis in JRTs, providing accurate assessment of the presence of the causative germline APC variant. The genotyping assays could contribute to the diagnosis and prevention of hereditary GI polyposis in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) (C) Grant number 18K06969cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) 3aDNA 3aJapan 3aalleles 3ablood 3afluorescence 3agastrointestinal system 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3agerm cells 3aheterozygosity 3amutants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aveterinary medicine1 aHirata, Akihiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2268-504X1 aMatsushita, Hiroyuki1 aNishii, Naohito1 aKawabe, Mifumi1 aMori, Takashi1 aSakai, Hiroki0 tBMC veterinary research.g2021 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.32-32dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02731-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005900153245012400212300002000336520133200356592002801688650001101716650001601727650004401743650000901787650001401796650002601810700005601836700001301892700001601905773012201921856008702043852000902130655001202139IND60676848920221121022356.0191122e20191008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067684892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b021142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xiangning1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6418-838910aIdentification of Light Oil in 2D NMR Spectra of Tight Sandstone Reservoirs by Using L1/L2 Two-Parameter Regularization  ap. 10537-10546.  aThis work presents L1/L2 two-parameter regularization as an efficient technique for the identification of light oil in the two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of tight sandstone reservoirs. A 2D NMR T2-T1 distribution model containing light oil, natural gas, and formation water is constructed. 2D NMR echo trains are obtained by means of the multiwaiting time Carr, Purcell, Meiboom, and Gill pulse sequence. A detailed analysis of the ill-posed characteristics to obtain 2D NMR spectrum is given using a Picard curve. The identification abilities of L1/L2 two-parameter regularization and three other techniques are compared in detail. The paper demonstrates that even if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is around 100, it is still very difficult to obtain the 2D NMR spectrum. Light oil cannot be distinguished using Tikhonov regularization and truncated singular value decomposition. Both L1/L2 two-parameter regularization and L1 norm regularization can identify light oil, while the identification ability of L1/L2 two-parameter regularization is higher than that of L1 norm regularization, especially when the SNR is very low. L1/L2 two-parameter regularization can be used as an effective technique to identify light oil from formation water in the 2D NMR spectra of tight sandstone reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3anatural gas 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3asandstone 3asignal-to-noise ratio1 aXie, Ranhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5237-45441 aJia, Hui1 aLi, Huifeng0 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Oct. 08, v. 33, no. 11 p.10537-10546dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b021143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017700171520107000348592002801418650001801446650001401464650002201478650002201500650001401522650001201536650001601548650001101564650001301575650001201588650000901600650001501609650001901624650001301643650000701656650001501663650001401678650001501692653002001707653002101727653002301748653001601771700002101787700002701808700001601835700002501851700001301876700002601889700002201915700002401937700001801961700002801979773010602007856008702113852000902200655001202209IND60648450820221122061153.0190719e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064845082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1217012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahid, Ayesha10aBioenergy potential of the residual microalgal biomass produced in city wastewater assessed through pyrolysis, kinetics and thermodynamics study to design algal biorefinery  aThe suitability of integrating biological and thermal transformation of microalgal biomass to design a biorefinery was studied.

The lipid-free residual biomass was pyrolyzed at four heating rates (10, 20, 30, 40 °C min−1) which showed a three-stage pyrolysis. The activation energies (182–256 kJ mol−1) and their corresponding lower enthalpies at the conversional fractions from 0.2 to 0.6 indicated that product formation was being favored. The values of pre-exponential factors (1015-17 s−1), Gibbs free energy (159–190 kJ mol−1) and entropy (43–81 J mol−1) showed efficient pyrolysis.

The fumigation of ethanol in diesel engines has been recognized as an effective alternative to improve efficiency and to reduce emissions. In this paper, the effects of a compression ignition engine using B7 and hydrous ethanol by fumigation method has been investigated. Hydrous ethanol was injected in the engine intake manifold by a port fuel injector, representing ethanol energy ratios from 11.5% to 52.3%. The results indicated a maximum decrease about 69% in smoke index, reduction in exhaust gas temperatures and reduction in both CO and CO2 emissions. The lowest CO emission found was 0,11% and CO2 emissions were 4.6% by volume. A maximum increase of 26.2% in thermal efficiency and 22.9% in exergy efficiency was observed. Nevertheless, an increase in HC emissions and specific fuel consumption was noted, achieving the maximum values of 121 ppm and 270.2 g/kWh, respectively. The results were satisfactory, confirming the potential to use ethanol fumigation method to improve thermal and exergy efficiency and reduce harmful gases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aenergy use and consumption 3aethanol 3aexergy 3afossil fuels 3afumigation 3agases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aprices 3asmoke 3atemperature 0aInternal combustion engine 0aCompression ignition 0aDiesel oil 0aEthanol 0aFumigation 0aDual fuel mode1 aAltafini, Carlos Roberto1 aRosa, Josimar Souza1 aCosta, Carlos Alberto0 tEnergy.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.106-117dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158300002000268520138800288592002801676650001601704650001101720650001801731650002101749650001501770650001101785650001301796650001301809650001501822650002301837650001801860650001701878650001801895700001401913700001501927700001701942700001801959700001801977773012301995856007502118852000902193655001202202IND60641655120221120100018.0220513e20170518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064165512DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra04075j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBing, Xuefeng10aMetal chloride-assisted synthesis of hierarchical porous carbons for high-rate-performance supercapacitor  ap. 26650-26657.  aHierarchical porous carbons with high surface area were prepared by direct carbonization of the polymers which were synthesized via a typical sol–gel method, using terephthalaldehyde and resorcinol as carbon precursors, and metal chloride as reaction assistant. All the metal chlorides could efficiently help to form 3-D porous network carbon with inter-linking irregular particles, and also successfully contribute to the developing of meso-macropores through the packing of grains. Such hierarchical porosity plays an important role for rapid ion diffusion, resulting in an excellent rate capability and low diffusion resistance. Moreover, it should be noted that ZnCl₂ could also act as an in situ activation agent during the carbonization process to generate large surface area of 1106 m² g⁻¹ and pore volume of 1.2 cm³ g⁻¹. In 3 mol L⁻¹ H₂SO₄, high specific capacitance of 174.6 F g⁻¹ by using the ZnCl₂-assisted hierarchical porous carbon as electrode material is obtained and it could retain ca. 84% when the current density increases from 0.1 A g⁻¹ to 20 A g⁻¹. This superior rate capability is higher than that of many hierarchical porous carbons reported in previous literatures. The facile production and excellent electrochemical performance suggested a low cost and effective method to prepare hierarchical porous carbon for energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3apolymers 3aporosity 3aresorcinol 3asol-gel processing 3asulfuric acid 3asurface area 3azinc chloride1 aJiang, Xu1 aTian, Meng1 aWang, Jitong1 aQiao, Wenming1 aLing, Licheng0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 18, v. 7, no. 43 p.26650-26657dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra04075j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245011300176300002000289520175300309592002802062650001502090650001202105650001202117650001502129650001202144650001802156650001002174650002202184650001302206650001302219650001402232650001502246650001602261700002702277700002402304700002702328700006602355700006802421773012202489856008702611852000902698655001202707IND60676849020221121031925.0191122e20191014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067684902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b021692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRawadieh, Saleh E.10aReaction of Hydroperoxy Radicals with Primary C₁–₅ Alcohols: A Profound Effect on Ignition Delay Times  ap. 11781-11794.  aIgnition delay times of primary alcohols often display a noticeable sensitivity to their initial reactions with HO₂ radicals. In view of the transient nature of HO₂ radicals, kinetic models on combustion of alcohols utilize theoretically obtained constant parameters for the abstraction HO₂ + alcohols reactions. Rate constants for the title reactions in pertinent kinetic models are often extrapolated from analogous computed values for either alkanes + HO₂ or n-butane + HO₂ reactions. Even for the simplest alcohol, methanol, literature values for the reaction rate constants considerably vary within one order of magnitude. Herein, we compute reaction rate constants for H abstraction from the weakest sites in primary C₁–₅ alcohols by HO₂ (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, n-butanol, i-butanol, t-butanol, n-pentanol, and i-pentanol). In most cases, our reaction rate coefficients tend to slightly exceed corresponding values deployed in pertinent kinetic models. We have thoroughly assessed the predictive performance of literature kinetic models in computing ignition delay times of these alcohols based on the updated rate constants for HO₂-abstraction reactions. In the case of methanol, updating kinetic parameters for the reaction CH₃OH + HO₂ → CH₂OH + H₂O₂ improves prediction of ignition delay times at lower temperatures in reference to original literature kinetic models. Likewise, a modified kinetic model for n-butane and t-butanol affords better agreement with experimental values of ignition delay times at low temperatures and high pressures. Kinetic parameters presented herein will be useful to accurately account for salient oxidation features of alcohols in real combustion engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3abutanes 3abutanol 3acombustion 3aethanol 3afree radicals 3afuels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3akinetics 3amethanol 3apentanols 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aAltarawneh, Ibrahem S.1 aBatiha, Mohammad A.1 aAl-Makhadmeh, Leema A.1 aAlmatarneh, Mansour H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2863-64871 aAltarawneh, Mohammednoor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2832-38860 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Oct. 14, v. 33, no. 11 p.11781-11794dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b021693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03797naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002300159245013600182300001600318500000900334500001500343520157300358592002801931650002101959650002101980650002102001650001302022650003002035650002402065650002202089650001902111650002002130650001502150650002102165650002302186650002402209650001502233650001502248650002002263650002402283650001402307650002902321650002802350650002602378650004702404650001202451650003002463650001302493650002102506650002902527650003002556650002202586650003902608650002002647650002102667650002002688653001702708700002002725700002102745700002302766700002002789773019202809852000903001856007703010655001203087IND4430886520221123020242.0191028e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443088652DNAL7 a200483202pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2009.01392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGrath, Joshua M.10aModifying Broiler Diets with Phytase and Vitamin D Metabolite (25-OH D3): Impact on Phosphorus in Litter, Amended Soils, and Runoff  ap. 324-332.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aAdding phytase and 25- hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH D₃) to broiler diets has been shown effective at reducing total P concentrations in broiler litter. This study was conducted to determine the impact of field application of broiler litter from modified diets on P solubility in litter-amended soils and P losses in runoff. Five broiler diets and their resulting litters were evaluated: a high P diet, a low P diet, each of those basal diets with phytase added, and a low P diet with phytase and 25-OH D₃ added. A field study was initiated at two sites with each of the five broiler litters and a commercial P fertilizer (triple superphosphate [TSP]) applied at the same total P rate (150 kg P ha⁻¹) and a control where no P was applied. Soil P was monitored over time at two depths (0–5 cm and 0–15 cm) soils were collected in the spring and fall to perform rainfall simulation studies. Broiler litter or TSP application increased soil water-soluble P and Mehlich 3-P concentrations relative to the control, however there were no consistent differences detected between litter treatments. Results from the rainfall simulation experiments indicate that diet modification with phytase or 25-OH D₃ does not increase the potential for P losses in runoff from amended soils relative to traditional diets. Moreover, broiler diet modification to reduce excreted P could be a potentially effective method for reducing watershed scale P surpluses in areas of intensive broiler production, without raising concerns over soluble P losses from litter-amended soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler chickens 3anutrient content 3aland application 3aphytases 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aagricultural runoff 3awaste utilization 3apoultry manure 3asoil amendments 3asoil depth 3alosses from soil 3aseasonal variation 3arainfall simulation 3asolubility 3aphosphorus 3abroiler feeding 3aorganic fertilizers 3aexcretion 3aenvironmental monitoring 2a6-Phytasexpharmacology 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCalcifediolxpharmacology 2aChickens 2aDietxveterinary 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFloors and Floorcoverings 2aHospitals, Animal 2aPhosphorusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Movements 0afood animals1 aSims, J.

Merr.] varieties [maturity group (MG) ≤IV] has increased in the southeastern United States as producers seek ways to increase soybean yields. The objective of this experiment was to generate agronomic management recommendations for early maturing soybean varieties across the southeastern United States and compare these management recommendations to historical recommendations for later‐maturing varieties through identification of the optimal seeding rates, row spacing, planting dates, and fertility management. Experiments were conducted across North Carolina at seven environments in 2018 and at four environments in 2019. Two MGs were used in this study: MG III and MG IV. Data on soybean yield and soybean seed quality were collected. Row spacing recommendations were similar to recommendations for later‐maturing varieties with narrow rows providing a 7.3 bu acre–¹ yield advantage across environments on average, with more pronounced yield advantages in high‐yield environments. Seeding rate impacted soybean yield but not seed quality. An economic analysis was conducted for seeding rate, suggesting that 80,000 to 120,000 seeds per acre will optimize both profit and yield across environments with May planting. Planting date sometimes impacted yield and seed quality, suggesting that earlier planting with these varieties could be critical to optimizing soybean yield and seed quality. Fertility applications at R1 (beginning of flowering) did not have an impact on soybean yield or seed quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aeconomic analysis 3aforage 3aplanting date 3aseed quality 3asoybeans 3aturf management 3aNorth Carolina1 aVann, Rachel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3802-85731 aBrown, Austin1 aFormella, Adam1 aGibbs, Andrea1 aGurganus, Rod1 aHeiniger, Ryan1 aHurry, Jarette1 aJordan, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4786-27271 aLeary, Matthew1 aLilley, Dylan1 aMalloy, Mac1 aSmith, Leslie P.1 aStowe, Katherine1 aTilley, Matthew Scott1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1937-58521 aWaters, Jalynne1 aWilliams, Anna‐Beth1 aWood, Alton1 aWoodley, Alex0 tCrop, forage & turfgrass management.g2021, v. 7, no. 2 p.e20122-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27125x2374-38327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cft2.201223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245014900153300001800302520108000320650002101400650001501421650001901436650001601455650003801471650001201509650001101521650001001532650001301542650004801555700001801603700002101621700002201642700002401664700001701688773016201705856004001867852000901907655001201916IND4535051320221121054555.0160119e20140730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453505132DNAL7 a10.1021/jf501275c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuh, Tobias10aMicrobial Transglutaminase Treatment in Pasta-Production Does Not Affect the Immunoreactivity of Gliadin with Celiac Disease Patientsâ Sera  ap. 7604-7611.  aThe effect of microbial transglutaminase (MTG)-treatment of pasta-dough on the immunoreactivity with celiac disease patientâs sera has been investigated. Modification by MTG has been proven by determination of the MTG reaction product Îµ-(Î³-glutamyl)lysine (3.63 Î¼mol/g protein), which was not detectable in non-MTG-treated pasta. Antigenicity has been analyzed by immunoblotting and ELISA using gliadin-extracts from pasta and MTG-treated pasta. Immunoblotting showed that the antibody-population (antigliadin antibodies and antideamidated gliadin antibodies) of the sera is specific for every individual patient. Immunoblotting and ELISA showed that there is no difference in immunoreactivity of gliadin extracted from pasta and MTG-pasta. Recognition pattern and intensity in Western blot as well as antibody titer has also been identical even for sera with a high antideamidated gliadin antibody titer. These results indicate no difference between pasta-gliadin and MTG-pasta-gliadin and especially no increased deamidation in pasta-gliadin by MTG-treatment. 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3aceliac disease 3adeamidation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agliadin 3alysine 3apasta 3apatients 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase1 aOhsam, Jurgen1 aPasternack, Ralf1 aYokoyama, Keiichi1 aKumazawa, Yoshiyuki1 aHils, Martin0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 July 30, v. 62, no. 30 p.7604-7611dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf501275c  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002000190245008300210300001600293520111800309592002801427653001901455653002101474653001901495700002501514700002401539700003501563700002401598700002401622700002601646700002001672700002201692700002101714773007301735856008301808852000901891655001201900IND60555018720221120122615.0161026s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055501872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.08.0022doi7 aPMC42154722pmcid7 a254607312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Bryan G.10aKetogenic diets as an adjuvant cancer therapy: History and potential mechanism  ap. 963-970.  aCancer cells, relative to normal cells, demonstrate significant alterations in metabolism that are proposed to result in increased steady-state levels of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O2•−and H2O2. It has also been proposed that cancer cells increase glucose and hydroperoxide metabolism to compensate for increased levels of ROS. Given this theoretical construct, it is reasonable to propose that forcing cancer cells to use mitochondrial oxidative metabolism by feeding ketogenic diets that are high in fats and low in glucose and other carbohydrates, would selectively cause metabolic oxidative stress in cancer versus normal cells. Increased metabolic oxidative stress in cancer cells would in turn be predicted to selectively sensitize cancer cells to conventional radiation and chemotherapies. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the hypothesis that ketogenic diets may be safely used as an adjuvant therapy to conventional radiation and chemotherapies and discusses the proposed mechanisms by which ketogenic diets may enhance cancer cell therapeutic responses.  aPublisher supplied data 0aKetogenic diet 0aOxidative stress 0aCancer therapy1 aBhatia, Sudershan K.1 aAnderson, Carryn M.1 aEichenberger-Gilmore, Julie M.1 aSibenaller, Zita A.1 aMapuskar, Kranti A.1 aSchoenfeld, Joshua D.1 aBuatti, John M.1 aSpitz, Douglas R.1 aFath, Melissa A.0 tRedox Biology.g2014, v. 2 p.963-970dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2014.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245006900160300001600229520094500245592002801190650003301218650002501251650001401276650001701290650002101307650001101328650003201339650001601371650001901387650004401406650001201450700001401462700002001476700001701496700001901513700001201532700002201544700001901566700001601585700001701601700001901618700001601637773012001653856008101773852000901854655001201863IND60614172820221119230137.0181002e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061417282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-018-2497-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing10aTwo New Isoflavones from Pueraria lobata and Their Bioactivities  ap. 851-855.  aTwo new isoflavones, 4′,6-dimethoxy-8-hydroxy-7-hydroxymethylisoflavone (1) and 4′,8-dihydroxy-7-hydroxymethyl-6-methoxyisoflavone (2), together with three known isoflavones (3–5), were isolated from Pueraria lobata.

To help ensure the reliable performance of these assays, we are developing a certified reference material (CRM) for calibrating human genomic DNA working standards. To enable sharing information over time and place, CRMs must provide accurate and stable values that are metrologically traceable to a common reference. We have shown that droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) limiting dilution end-point measurements of the concentration of DNA copies per volume of sample can be traceably linked to the International System of Units (SI). Unlike values assigned using conventional relationships between ultraviolet absorbance and DNA mass concentration, entity-based ddPCR measurements are expected to be stable over time. However, the forensic community expects DNA quantity to be stated in terms of mass concentration rather than entity concentration. The transformation can be accomplished given SI-traceable values and uncertainties for the number of nucleotide bases per human haploid genome equivalent (HHGE) and the average molar mass of a nucleotide monomer in the DNA polymer. This report presents the considerations required to establish the metrological traceability of ddPCR-based mass concentration estimates of human nuclear DNA.

Differentiation of OCs from bone marrow macrophage cells (BMMs) is regulated by RANK and the adaptor protein (DAP12/FcRγ)-mediated costimulatory signals. However, it is unknown how RANKL/RANK signal stimulates phosphorylation of DAP12/FcRγ to initiate the costimulatory signals. As reported here, we found that OC differentiation and acquisition of bone resorption capacity were suppressed in RANKL-stimulated Fyn⁻/⁻ or Fyn-siRNA-transfected BMMs, but could be restored by overexpression of Fyn kinase in Fyn⁻/⁻ BMMs. However, the RANKL-stimulated proliferation of BMMs was unaffected by the absence of Fyn. In addition, RANKL-stimulated Fyn⁻/⁻ BMMs no longer exhibited the optimal induction of typical OC markers such as NFATc1, c-Fos, c-Src, TRAF6, and cathepsin K or costimulatory signals such as the activating phosphorylations of Syk, PLCγ2, and Gab2. These were restored by overexpression of Fyn in Fyn⁻/⁻ BMMs. Immunoprecipitation studies also indicated that the adaptor proteins DAP12/FcRγ and Syk interacted with RANK during RANKL stimulation in BMMs in a Fyn-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of the DAP12/FcRγ and the recruitment of Syk by DAP12/FcRγ were suppressed in Fyn⁻/⁻ BMMs. This is the first demonstration that Fyn relays the initial RANK/RANKL signal to the ITAM-containing adaptors DAP12/FcRγ for OC differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone marrow 3abone resorption 3acathepsin K 3amacrophages 3aosteoclasts 3aosteoporosis 3aphosphorylation 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteins 3arheumatoid arthritis1 aKim, D.K.1 aKim, A.R.1 aMun, S.H.1 aLee, S.K.1 aKim, J.H.1 aKim, Y.M.1 aChoi, W.S.0 tCellular signalling.g2012 June, v. 24, no. 6 p.1306-1314dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.02.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007500171520144000246592002801686650001601714650001901730650001301749650001201762650001701774650001601791650002601807650000901833650001401842650000701856650001301863650001301876650001301889651001501902653001401917653001101931653002201942700002201964700005901986700002102045700002102066773009802087856008502185852000902270655001202279IND60743629120221117235633.0211219e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074362912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1174042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnnaduzzaman, Md10aAnoxic storage to promote arsenic removal with groundwater-native iron  aStorage containers are usually used to provide a constant water head in decentralized, community groundwater treatment systems for the removal of iron (Fe) and arsenic (As). However, the commonly practiced aeration prior to storage assists in rapid and complete Fe²⁺ oxidation, resulting in poor As removal, despite sufficient native-Fe²⁺ in the source water. In this study, it was found that application of anoxic storage enhanced As removal from groundwater, containing ≥300 µg/L of As(III) and 2.33 mg/L of Fe²⁺ in an As affected village of Rajshahi district in Bangladesh. Although the oxidation of Fe²⁺ and As(III) during oxic storage was considerably faster, the As/Fe removal ratio was higher during anoxic storage (61–80±5 µgAs/mgFe) compared to the oxic storage (45±5 µgAs/mgFe). This higher As removal efficacy in anoxic storage containers could not be attributed to the speciation of As, since As(V) concentrations were higher during oxic storage due to more favorable abiotic (As(III) oxidation by O₂ and Fenton-like intermediates) and biotic (As(III) oxidizing bacteria, e.g., Sideroxydans, Gallionella, Hydrogenophaga) conditions. The continuous, in-situ hydrous ferric oxide floc formation during flow-through operation, and the favorable lower pH aiding higher sorption capacities for the gradually formed As(V) likely contributed to the improved performance in the anoxic storage containers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGallionella 3aHydrogenophaga 3aaeration 3aarsenic 3aferric oxide 3agroundwater 3agroundwater treatment 3airon 3aoxidation 3apH 3aresearch 3asorption 3avillages 3aBangladesh 0aTreatment 0aAnoxic 0aStorage container1 aRietveld, Luuk C.1 aGhosh, Devanita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6856-38681 aHoque, Bilqis A.1 avan Halem, Doris0 tWater research.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 202 p.117404-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1174043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011400178300001800292520116500310592002801475650002301503650001901526650001301545650001101558650001501569650003101584650002401615650002001639650002301659653001301682653001301695653001501708653001701723653002301740653003701763773007901800856008901879852000901968655001201977IND60545375820221120082326.0160901e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054537582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.08.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkyol, Nihat Hakan10aCharacterizing and modeling of extensive atrazine elution tailing for stable manure-amended agricultural soil  ap. 1027-1032.  aNon-ideal sorption and extensive elution tailing behavior of atrazine was evaluated for an agricultural soil with and without stable manure amendment (10% by weight). A series of laboratory experiments showed that the sorption of atrazine was described by rate-limited, nonlinear reversible processes (Freundlich isotherm) for both non-amended and amended soil. Non-ideal transport of atrazine exhibited extensive low concentration elution tailing due to the most likely organic carbon fraction in the soil. This tailing behavior was more pronounced and extensive for soil with 10% stable-manure amendment. Two-site transport modeling analyses including non-linear sorption and rate-limited sorption–desorption provided a reasonably good match to the atrazine breakthrough curves but were unable to match the long-term concentration tailing, even for non-amended soil. A mathematical model incorporating nonlinear, rate-limited sorption/desorption described by a continuous-distribution function was used to successfully simulate atrazine transport early-time breakthrough and long-term concentration tailing for both non-amended and amended soil conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aanimal manures 3aatrazine 3acarbon 3adesorption 3alaboratory experimentation 3amathematical models 3asoil amendments 3asorption isotherms 0aAtrazine 0aSorption 0aDesorption 0aRate-limited 0aTransport modeling 0aContinuous distribution function0 tChemosphere.g2015 Jan., v. 119 p.1027-1032dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.08.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245014000180500001900320520181900339592002802158650002602186650001302212650001502225650001602240650001602256650004302272650001502315653001402330653002502344653002302369653002502392653003402417700001702451700002202468700001502490700002502505700002802530700001802558700001402576700001502590700001802605773010502623856008702728852000902815655001202824IND60739182420221121151136.0210715e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073918242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1056972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuitián-Hernández, L.10aAnalysis of the October 2014 subtropical cyclone using the WRF and the HARMONIE-AROME numerical models: Assessment against observations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSubtropical cyclones (STCs) are low-pressure systems characterized by having a thermal hybrid structure and sharing tropical and extratropical characteristics. These cyclones are widely studied due to their harmful impacts, in some cases, similar to those caused by hurricanes or tropical storms. From a numerical modeling point of view, they are considered a challenge on account of their rapid intensification. That is the reason why this paper analyzes the simulations of the STC that occurred in October 2014 near the Canary Islands through two high-resolution numerical models: Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and HARMONIE-AROME. In this study, the simulations obtained with both models of this STC are analyzed versus different observational data. METAR data are used to validate some surface simulated variables throughout the STC life while soundings are chosen to study the tropospheric behavior. Finally, MSG-SEVIRI satellite brightness temperature is used to be compared to those brightness temperatures simulated by both models to give information of the cloud top spatial structure of this atmospheric system. The 2 m temperature, 2 m dew-point temperature, and 10 m wind speed variables do not show significant deviations when carrying out the validation of both models against the available METAR data. It is outstanding the good results found for the HARMONIE-AROME model when analyzing the temperature sounding for both analyzed dates. Additionally, regarding the wind speed sounding, better results are presented in general by the HARMONIE-AROME model, being the WRF model slightly better during the pre-STC stage. Moreover, the skillfulness of the HARMONIE-AROME model is highlighted when simulating the infrared brightness temperature and cloud distribution compared to the WRF model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aobservational studies 3aresearch 3asatellites 3atemperature 3atroposphere 3aweather research and forecasting model 3awind speed 0aWRF model 0aHARMONIE-AROME model 0aNumerical modeling 0aSubtropical cyclones 0aMSG-SEVIRI satellite products1 aBolgiani, P.1 aSantos-Muñoz, D.1 aSastre, M.1 aDíaz-Fernández, J.1 aGonzález-Alemán, J.J.1 aFarrán, J.I.1 aLopez, L.1 aValero, F.1 aMartín, M.L.0 tAtmospheric research.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 260 p.105697-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1056973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011800178300001400296520128600310592002801596650001801624650001201642650002301654650001101677650001901688650001901707650001201726650001201738650001301750650002301763651001401786651001301800653000901813653000801822653001301830653000801843653000701851653000801858653001601866653002701882653003601909653002001945653002301965653003001988700002002018700001702038700002102055773009702076856008502173852000902258655001202267IND60537766520221119111352.0190416e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053776652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastaño-Isaza, Juliana10aValuing beaches to develop payment for ecosystem services schemes in Colombia’s Seaflower marine protected area  ap. 22-31.  aThe Colombian Seaflower marine protected area (SMPA) is the largest MPA in the Caribbean. The economy of the main island, San Andres (SAI) relies on tourism. This study conducted 1793 surveys to capture information about tourists’ experience and the value they placed on SAI’s beaches. Tourists considered beaches as the main reason for choosing SAI as a destination and expressed that they would be willing to pay additional money, US$ 997,468 annually, on top of what they had already paid for their vacation to protect SAI’s beaches. The study also showed how beach erosion could negatively impact economically the tourism sector of SAI, reducing revenue by 66.6% (estimated at US$ 73 million annually). This research contributed to the first stage in the development of a payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme to protect SAI’s beaches. The importance of beaches for SAI and the potential loss of revenue due to beach erosion create an opportunity to incentivize the private sector to invest in natural infrastructure that maintains and protects beaches. This study also informs the potential application of valuation studies for the development of innovative financing instruments, such as PES, to achieve financial sustainability for the MPA network in Colombia.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeach erosion 3abeaches 3aecosystem services 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3aprivate sector 3asurveys 3atourism 3atourists 3awillingness to pay 3aCaribbean 3aColombia 0aSMPA 0aSAI 0aCORALINA 0aPES 0aCV 0aWTP 0aCoastal and 0aMarine protected areas 0aPayments for ecosystem services 0aBeach valuation 0aWillingness to pay 0aPotential loss of revenue1 aNewball, Rixcie1 aRoach, Brian1 aLau, Winnie W.Y.0 tEcosystem services.g2015 Feb., v. 11 p.22-31dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100007100150245008400221300001600305520147400321592002801795650001701823650002201840650001001862650001801872650001401890650001701904650001501921651000901936700005701945773008602002856008402088852000902172655001202181IND60635704120221122233406.0190403e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063570412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2017.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanihabib, Mohammad Ebrahim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4249-830513aAn assessment framework for the mitigation effects of check dams on debris flow  ap. 277-284.  aDebris flow can be very destructive, especially in areas of dense population on mountain foothills. Check dams are constructed across drainage channels and are beneficial for reducing flow velocity and soil erosion, as well as controlling debris flows. On July 26, 1987, a destructive debris flow occurred in a watershed north of Tehran, Iran. A series of check dams were constructed in the watershed to mitigate the hazards of future debris flow due to the importance of the region. This study first proposes a procedure to estimate the volume of the sediments in a debris flow from the calculated volume of an equivalent regular flood. The procedure to estimate the sediments volume is employed in a framework to assess the effects of constructed check dams for a similar debris flow in the region. The framework considers the unfilled storage of the check dams for estimating the volume of the sediments in each catchment. Field measurements were implemented to estimate the available storage of check dams. The volume of sediments in two cases was estimated: 1) the debris flow in 1987 and 2) a probable debris flow at current time considering the available storage of constructed check dams. The comparison shows that the volume of sediments reaching the outlet of the watershed decreased 13% as the effect of check dams in trapping sediments. Applying the proposed framework to this case study shows its ability in assessment of check dams' impact on debris flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adrainage channels 3ahills 3amass movement 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aForghani, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1628-77180 tCatena.g2017 May, v. 152 p.277-284dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2017.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012700168300001300295520163100308592002801939650001201967650001901979650001201998650001902010650001702029650001202046650001902058650001902077650001502096650001502111650002102126650002102147650001902168650001102187650001202198650002502210650001702235650002102252651001002273700003102283773009402314856008102408852000902489655001202498IND60087615620221120145256.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008761562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2012.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasanta, Teodoro10aComplex land cover change processes in semiarid Mediterranean regions: An approach using Landsat images in northeast Spain  ap. 1-14.  aIn this study we used Landsat images to analyze land cover change processes since 1984 in the middle Ebro valley (Spain). The purpose was to identify abrupt changes suggesting modification of the land cover category, and gradual changes not associated with a change in the land cover type but potentially indicative of significant changes in natural areas. The results showed that: i) in analysis of land cover change the seasonality of vegetation cover is an important factor that must be taken into account in identifying the various change processes that may affect a region; ii) the major land cover changes in the study area were related to very diverse processes including urban expansion, industrial activities, the establishment of land irrigation, land extensification, natural revegetation following rural abandonment, forest fires, and changes in natural vegetated areas related to global warming and drought. With the exception of the occurrence of forest fires, the changes in natural areas (forest, shrubs and steppes) tended to be gradual with respect to both positive (forest colonization following rural abandonment and land extensification) and negative (land degradation and forest decline) processes. These areas showed rates of change that were lower in magnitude than those directly transformed by human activities. We found that time series of high spatial resolution satellite images and the application of change statistics provided a useful approach to the identification of abrupt changes, and gradual land cover change processes that are not commonly revealed using classical analytical approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aabandoned land 3adrought 3aforest decline 3aforest fires 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3aimage analysis 3airrigation 3aland cover 3aland degradation 3aland restoration 3aremote sensing 3ashrubs 3asteppes 3atime series analysis 3aurbanization 3avegetation cover 3aSpain1 aVicente-Serrano, Sergio M.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2012 Sept., v. 124 p.1-14dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2012.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245016100159300001600320500002000336520131200356592002801668650002301696650002401719650001301743650001701756650002701773650001901800650001501819650002601834650000901860650001701869650001701886651001401903700003101917700001701948700001801965700002001983700001802003700002002021700002002041700001802061700002102079700002002100700001302120700002402133773012302157856007102280852000902351655001202360IND60588539520221117233205.0180118e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058853952DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.47292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumura, Masaya10aInsecticide susceptibilities of the two rice planthoppers Nilaparvata lugens and Sogatella furcifera in East Asia, the Red River Delta, and the Mekong Delta  ap. 456-464.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The two rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens and Sogatella furcifera, have different life cycles in the regions of East Asia, the Red River Delta, and the Mekong Delta. The susceptibilities of these species to a range of insecticides have not previously been compared among the three regions over multiple years. Here, we describe the differences and similarities in insecticide susceptibilities of the two species among the three regions in 2006–2011. RESULTS: In all three regions in 2006 − 2011, N. lugens developed high and moderate levels of resistance to imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, respectively, but this species did not develop resistance to fipronil. In contrast, S. furcifera developed a high level of resistance to fipronil. The ranges in 50% lethal dose (LD₅₀) values for N. lugens treated with both imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were similar over time between East Asia and the Red River Delta, and were different in the Mekong Delta. CONCLUSION: The results support the idea that resistant populations migrate from the Red River Delta region to East Asia. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the susceptibility of N. lugens to insecticides in the Red River Delta is very important for insecticide resistance management in East Asia. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aSogatella furcifera 3afipronil 3aimidacloprid 3ainsecticide resistance 3alethal dose 50 3amonitoring 3aresistance management 3arice 3ariver deltas 3athiamethoxam 3aEast Asia1 aSanada‐Morimura, Sachiyo1 aOtuka, Akira1 aSonoda, Shoji1 aVan Thanh, Dinh1 aVan Chien, Ho1 aVan Tuong, Phan1 aLoc, Phung Minh1 aLiu, Ze‐Wen1 aZhu, Zeng‐Rong1 aLi, Jian‐Hong1 aWu, Gang1 aHuang, Shou‐Horng0 tPest management science.g2018 Feb., v. 74, no. 2 p.456-464dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.47293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245010100184300001600285520133200301592002801633650002701661650002101688650001701709650001201726650003901738650002301777650001301800650002901813650002201842650002001864650003301884650004201917700002701959700002901986700001902015773012002034856004802154852000902202655001202211IND50071565120221119163337.0140103e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007156512DNAL7 a239009052pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-013-1442-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, Rashmi10aDaunorubicin forms a specific complex with a secreted serine protease of Streptomyces peucetius   ap. 253-261.  aDaunorubicin forms specific complex with an extracellular protease in the Streptomyces peucetius culture. The drug-protein complex co-migrates in non-denaturing PAGE as a red band. De novo peptide sequencing by nano-LC–ESI–MS/MS and MASCOT analysis identified the daunorubicin binding protein as serine protease precursor. The same protease precursor was purified sans the daunorubicin, from the mutant named ΔDPSAmut, which is deficient in daunorubicin production. Daunorubicin was added to ΔDPSAmut culture and the protease readily formed the daunorubicin-protease complex. Ability of serine protease precursor to form a selective complex with daunorubicin was confirmed by this study. Selective binding of protease to daunorubicin was seen as self-resistance determinant for the organism to survive toxic levels of the drug outside the cell. Daunorubicin-protease complex placed on S. peucetius lawn did not produce clearing zone around it, whereas daunorubicin purified from the complex did produce the clearing zone. Thereby it is concluded that the protease sequesters daunorubicin to prevent its entry into cells. Sequestration of daunorubicin by extracellular protease helps the organism to maintain a steady state sub-inhibitory level of drug around the cells. A new self-resistance determinant is reported here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces peucetius 3abinding proteins 3adaunorubicin 3amutants 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aserine proteinases 3atoxicity 2aDaunorubicinxmetabolism 2aMass Spectrometry 2aProtein Binding 2aSerine Proteasesxmetabolism 2aStreptomycesxenzymologyxmetabolism.1 aKattusamy, Karuppasamy1 aDharmalingam, Kuppamuthu1 aPrasad, Ranjan0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2014 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.253-261dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-013-1442-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010400162300001800266520133000284592002801614650002301642650001701665650002301682650003101705650001001736650001201746650001301758650001801771650000901789650002401798650001901822650001501841650003301856650001701889653001201906653001901918653002201937653000901959653001801968700001601986700001202002700001602014700001602030773012402046856008002170852000902250655001202259IND60528882920221120101538.0160717e20160406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052888292DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b006492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNie, Jing-Jun10aControllable Heparin-Based Comb Copolymers and Their Self-assembled Nanoparticles for Gene Delivery  ap. 8376-8385.  aPolysaccharide-based copolymers have attracted much attention due to their effective performances. Heparin, as a kind of polysaccharide with high negative charge densities, has attracted much attention in biomedical fields. In this work, we report a flexible way to adjust the solubility of heparin from water to oil via the introduction of tetrabutylammonium groups for further functionalization. A range of heparin-based comb copolymers with poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PPEGMEMA), poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), or PPEGMEMA-b-PDMAEMA side chains were readily synthesized in a MeOH/dimethylsulfoxide mixture via atom-transfer radical polymerization. The heparin-based polymer nanoparticles involving cationic PDMAEMA were produced due to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged heparin backbone and PDMAEMA grafts. Then the pDNA condensation ability, cytotoxicity, and gene transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles were characterized in comparison with the reported gene vectors. The nanoparticles were proved to be effective gene vectors with low cytotoxicity and high transfection efficiency. This study demonstrates that by adjusting the solubility of heparin, polymer graft functionalization of heparin can be readily realized for wider applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agenes 3aheparin 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolymerization 3asolubility 3atetrabutylammonium compounds 3atransfection 0aheparin 0apolysaccharide 0afunctionalization 0aATRP 0ananoparticles1 aZhao, Weiyi1 aHu, Hao1 aYu, Bingran1 aXu, Fu-Jian0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Apr. 06, v. 8, no. 13 p.8376-8385dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b006493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010800170300001600278520171400294592002802008650000802036650001602044650001102060650001502071650002102086650001502107650001902122650001102141650001602152700002402168700002202192700002402214773009702238856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60087615720221120145345.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008761572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2012.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeddes, Jeffrey A.10aBiases in long-term NO₂ averages inferred from satellite observations due to cloud selection criteria  ap. 210-216.  aRetrievals of atmospheric trace gas column densities from space are compromised by the presence of clouds, requiring most studies to exclude observations with significant cloud fractions in the instrument's field of view. Using NO₂ observations at three ground stations representing urban, suburban, and rural environments, and tropospheric vertical column densities measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over each site, we show that the observations from space represent monthly averaged ground-level pollutant conditions well (R=0.86) under relatively cloud-free conditions. However, by analyzing the ground-level data and applying the OMI cloud fraction as a filter, we show there is a significant bias in long-term averaged NO₂ as a result of removing the data during cloudy conditions. For the ground-based sites considered in this study, excluding observations on days when OMI-derived cloud fractions were greater than 0.2 causes 12:00–14:00 mean summer mixing ratios to be underestimated by 12%±6%, 20%±7%, and 40%±10% on average (±1standard deviation) at the urban, suburban, and rural sites respectively. This bias was investigated in particular at the rural site, a region where pollutant transport is the main source of NO₂, and where long-term observations of NOy were also available. Evidence of changing photochemical conditions and a correlation between clear skies and the transport of cleaner air masses play key roles in explaining the bias. The magnitude of a bias is expected to vary from site to site depending on meteorology and proximity to NOₓ sources, and decreases when longer averaging times of ground station data (e.g. 24-h) are used for the comparison.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ameteorology 3amixing 3amonitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3apollutants 3aremote sensing 3asummer 3atroposphere1 aMurphy, Jennifer G.1 aO'Brien, Jason M.1 aCelarier, Edward A.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2012 Sept., v. 124 p.210-216dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2012.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013000167520169400297592002801991650001602019650001302035650001102048650000902059650002602068650001902094650002002113650001902133650001502152650001902167650001302186650001202199650001302211650001702224650001102241650001502252650001902267650002002286650001402306653003102320653003102351653002002382653002202402653002102424700001902445700001802464773010602482856008702588852000902675655001202684IND60671735320221118001300.0200210e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067173532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Jingqi10aSynthesis and characterization of poly(AM-SSS-AMPS)/ O-MMT nanocomposite microspheres with tailored nanomechanical properties  aIn order to overcome the inherent defects of traditional polymer microspheres as plugging agent used in oilfields, including weak mechanical properties, low dispersity in water and poor adaptability to harsh conditions, an organo-modified montmorillonite (O-MMT) was incorporated to form an exfoliated structure in acrylamide/sodium 4-styrenesulfonate/2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid (AM-SSS-AMPS) terpolymer matrix via in-situ polymerization. Such exfoliated structure not only exhibited a considerable enhancement in the comprehensive properties of nanocomposites, such as viscoelasticity, heat and shear-resistance, but also improved nanomechanical properties of microspheres. The results of nanomechanical properties showed that the energy dissipation and adhesion of nanocomposite with 3.0 wt% O-MMT were decreased to only 1.9% and 4.7% of those of the original terpolymer, respectively, implying the reduction in the agglomeration and energy consumption of microspheres in aqueous suspension. Rheology test demonstrated that the suspension (5.0 wt%) of nanocomposite microsphere with 2.0–3.0 wt% O-MMT behaved as pseudoplastic fluid, Newtonian fluid and dilatant fluid in turn at the shear rate from 10 s⁻¹ to 1000 s⁻¹, which indicated a better arrangement of microspheres in suspension under shear stress. G′ and G′′ of the suspension of nanocomposite microspheres with 3.0 wt% O-MMT were 696.6 times and 84.4 times higher than those of the terpolymer suspension, respectively, and the corresponding viscosity was 10.4 times higher at 90 ℃. These superior properties of nanocomposite microspheres will meet the tough requirements of oilfield development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aadhesion 3aenergy 3aheat 3amechanical properties 3amicroparticles 3amontmorillonite 3ananocomposites 3aoil fields 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3apropane 3arheology 3ashear stress 3asodium 3asulfonates 3asulfonic acids 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 0aMontmorillonite nanolayers 0aNano mechanical properties 0aViscoelasticity 0aRheology behavior 0aPlugging ability1 aZhao, Jianqing1 aKe, Yangchuan0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 583 p.124022-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013800165300002000303520156100323592002801884650002601912650001701938650001501955650002001970650001201990650000902002650001102011650002002022650001902042650001002061650001402071650001302085650003702098650001902135650001302154700001902167700001302186700001602199700001702215773015502232856008102387852000902468655001202477IND60569601120221121200835.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056960112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7362-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Chuifan10aChanges in subcellular distribution and antioxidant compounds involved in Pb accumulation and detoxification in Neyraudia reynaudiana  ap. 21794-21804.  aThe effects of increasing concentrations of lead (Pb) on Pb accumulation, subcellular distribution, ultrastructure, photosynthetic characteristics, antioxidative enzyme activity, malondialdehyde content, and phytochelatin contents were investigated in Neyraudia reynaudiana seedlings after a 21-day exposure. A Pb analysis at the subcellular level showed that the majority of Pb in the roots was associated with the cell wall fraction, followed by the soluble fraction. In contrast, the majority of the Pb in the leaves was located in the soluble fraction based on transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analyses. Furthermore, high Pb concentrations adversely affected N. reynaudiana cellular structure. The changes in enzyme activity suggested that the antioxidant system plays an important role in eliminating or alleviating Pb toxicity, both in the roots and leaves of N. reynaudiana. Additionally, the phytochelatin contents in the roots and leaves differed significantly between Pb-spiked treatments and control plants. Our results provide strong evidence that cell walls restrict Pb uptake into the protoplasm and establish an important protective barrier. Subsequent vacuolar compartmentalization in leaves could isolate Pb from other substances in the cell and minimize Pb toxicity in other organelles over time. These results also demonstrated that the levels of antioxidant enzymes and phytochelatin in leaves and roots are correlated with Pb toxicity. These detoxification mechanisms promote Pb tolerance in N. reynaudiana.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeyraudia reynaudiana 3aantioxidants 3acell walls 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3alead 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aphotosynthesis 3aroots 3aseedlings 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3avacuoles1 aHuang, Meiying1 aLi, Ying1 aLuo, Jiewen1 aCai, Li ping0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2016 Nov., v. 23, no. 21 p.21794-21804dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x1614-74997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7362-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002900137245013400166300001600300500002000316520141700336592002801753650001301781650001101794650001001805650002001815650001001835650001201845650001101857650002001868650001001888650002401898700002701922700002601949700003201975700002002007700002802027700003302055700003102088773012302119856007102242852000902313655001202322IND60588539720221117233254.0180118e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058853972DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.47202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Moura, Marcelo Fialho10aSequential sampling plans and economic injury levels for Empoasca kraemeri on common bean crops at different technological levels  ap. 398-405.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Empoasca kraemeri is an important pest on common bean crops at different technological levels. However, for this pest on this crop, economic injury levels have not yet been determined and plan for sequential sampling plans has not yet been developed. Thus, the objectives of this research were to develop E. kraemeri sequential sampling plans and to determine economic injury levels in the common bean at different crop technological levels. RESULTS: Common bean plants tolerate low attack intensities of this pest (up to 1 adult plant‐¹). However, with an increase in attacks, there is a reduction in grain production by the plants. The economic injury levels were 0.48, 0.39 and 0.35 adults sample‐¹ (leaf beating on a tray) for crops with low (1200 kg ha‐¹), medium (1800 kg ha‐¹) and high (2400 kg ha‐¹) technological levels, respectively. Sequential sampling plans and the standardized plan produced similar decisions. However, in these decisions there was a time saving of more than 60% compared with the standardized plan. CONCLUSION: All three economic injury levels determined and the sequential sampling plans developed in this study are suitable for incorporation into integrated management programs for common bean pests because they can be used by farmers operating at various technological levels to make adequate and rapid decisions. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmpoasca 3aadults 3abeans 3acrop production 3acrops 3afarmers 3aleaves 3apest management 3apests 3asequential sampling1 aLopes, Mayara Cristina1 aPereira, Renata Ramos1 aParish, Jorgiane Benevenute1 aChediak, Mateus1 ade Paulo Arcanjo, Lucas1 adas Graças do Carmo, Daiane1 aPicanço, Marcelo Coutinho0 tPest management science.g2018 Feb., v. 74, no. 2 p.398-405dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.47203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245012100168300002000289520134100309592002801650650002201678650001101700650001001711650001101721650002101732650000901753650001201762650001501774650001401789650001301803650001701816700002201833700002501855700002001880700002401900773012401924856007402048852000902122655001202131IND60642210320221122224610.0190506e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064221032DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra10451k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWałęsa-Chorab, Monika10aElectrochromism and electrochemical properties of complexes of transition metal ions with benzimidazole-based ligand  ap. 50858-50867.  aSix new mononuclear complexes of transition metal ions (1–6) with (E)-2-(1-methyl-2-(1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinyl)-1H-benzoimidazole L were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic methods as well as X-ray diffraction analysis. Structures of these complexes can be divided into three groups depending on the coordination number and environment of the metallic center: the first one of general formula [ML₂]X₂, the second one - [MLX₃] and the third one - [MLX₂], where X is anion or solvent molecule. Electrochemical and electrochromic properties of complexes were investigated. Complexes Fe(ii) 1, Cu(ii) 2–4 and Co(ii) 5 were found to be electroactive and their colors depend on the oxidation state of metal center and ligand molecule. Fe(ii) complex 1 exhibits purple color in the neutral state and its color changes to yellow after Fe(ii) → Fe(iii) oxidation, followed by pale-yellow after further oxidation of ligand molecule and to green when the metal center is reduced to Fe(i). The original color can be restored after electrochemical oxidation Fe(i) to Fe(ii). It was found that this complex exhibits high color stability in solution during multiple oxidation/reduction cycles. This complex can be therefore regarded as very interesting material for the construction of multielectrochromic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acobalt 3acolor 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3airon 3aligands 3ametal ions 3aoxidation 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy1 aBanasz, Radosław1 aMarcinkowski, Damian1 aKubicki, Maciej1 aPatroniak, Violetta0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 7, no. 80 p.50858-50867dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra10451k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245012800201300001600329500001400345500002000359520142600379592002801805596006901833650002701902650002301929650001701952650002001969650001201989650002202001650001602023650000902039650001102048650001802059650001502077650001402092650001602106650001302122650001602135651001402151651001302165700003302178700001902211700002202230773012002252856007302372852000902445655001202454IND60723031020221121223659.0210110e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072303102DNAL7 a10.1111/are.149182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcosta, Ernesto J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7143-925410aEffect of density, temperature and diet on the growth, survival and development of larvae and juveniles of Isostichopus sp.  ap. 611-624.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIsostichopus sp. is a variety of Isostichopus badionotus, proposed as a new species, which has been intensely fished in the Colombian Caribbean, arousing interest for its aquaculture. This study evaluated the effect of two culture densities (1–3 larvae ml⁻¹), two temperatures (23°C and 26°C) and two microalgae diets (Isochrysis galbana, Chaetoceros calcitrans, Nannochloropsis oculata 1:1:1 and I. galbana, C. calcitrans 1:1) on the survival, development and growth of its larvae. Larval culture lasted 22 days until metamorphosis to doliolaria larvae, and 7 days later, the first juveniles were observed with a size of 621.8 ± 12.7 µm (±SE). The highest growth rates, survival and percentage of doliolaria larvae were obtained with 1 larva ml⁻¹ (29.2 µm/day and 31.5% doliolaria larvae) and 26°C (28.4 µm/day and 10% doliolaria larvae). However, in the two diets examined, the larvae showed low growth rates (between 1.3 and 8.5 µm/day), stagnation in development and high mortality. Our results indicate that it is feasible to culture larvae from Isostichopus sp. to juveniles, recommending the use of 1 larva ml⁻¹ and 26°C. However, to meet the nutritional needs of the larvae the inclusion of microalgae Pavlova sp. and Tetraselmis chuii in the diet is recommended. This paper reports for the first time the successful production of sea cucumber juveniles of this species in Colombia.  aPublisher supplied data  cCorporation Center for Excellence in Marine Sciences – CEMarin 3aChaetoceros calcitrans 3aIsochrysis galbana 3aIsostichopus 3aNannochloropsis 3aPavlova 3aTetraselmis chuii 3aaquaculture 3adiet 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3amicroalgae 3amortality 3anew species 3aresearch 3atemperature 3aCaribbean 3aColombia1 aRodríguez‐Forero, Adriana1 aWerding, Bernd1 aKunzmann, Andreas0 tAquaculture research.g2021 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.611-624dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.149183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245014100157520128000298592002801578650003101606650001901637650002501656650002201681650002301703650003101726650001001757650001501767650001501782650002101797650001401818650002201832650001801854651001301872700002301885700001501908700002301923700001901946700001901965700002101984700001902005700002302024773011902047856007202166852000902238655001202247IND60648711820221120164639.0190701e20170803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064871182DNAL7 a10.3390/f80802792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaspar, Daniel10aExpression Profiling in <em>Pinus pinaster</em> in Response to Infection with the Pine Wood Nematode <em>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</em>  aForests are essential resources on a global scale, not only for the ecological benefits, but also for economical and landscape purposes. However, in recent years, a large number of forest species have suffered a serious decline, with maritime pine being one of the most affected. In Portugal, the maritime pine forest has been devastated by the pine wood nematode (PWN), the causal agent of pine wilt disease. In this study, RNA-Seq data was used to characterize the maritime pine response to infection with PWN, by determining the differentially expressed genes and identifying the regulatory networks and pathways associated. The analyses showed clear differences between an early response that occurs immediately after inoculation and a late response that is observed seven days after inoculation. Moreover, differentially expressed genes related to secondary metabolism, oxidative stress and defense against pathogen infection were identified over different time points. These results provide new insights about the molecular mechanisms and metabolic pathways involved in the response of Pinus pinaster against PWN infection, which will be a useful resource in follow-up studies and for future breeding programs to select plants with lower susceptibility to this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3aPinus pinaster 3abiochemical pathways 3abreeding programs 3aconiferous forests 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3alandscapes 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3avascular wilt 3aPortugal1 aTrindade, Cândida1 aUsié, Ana1 aMeireles, Brígida1 aBarbosa, Pedro1 aFortes, Ana M.1 aPesquita, Cátia1 aCosta, Rita L.1 aRamos, António M.0 tForests.g2017 Aug. 03, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80802793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011100165500002000276520147600296592002801772596004301800596005501843650002901898650003601927650000901963650001701972650001601989650001002005650001902015700001702034700002102051700002002072700002402092773012702116856008402243852000902327655001202336IND60790404120221123041543.0220824e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079040412DNAL7 a10.1136/vetreco-2017-0002192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlake, John10aEvaluation of a single‐administration ototopical treatment for canine otitis externa: a randomised trial  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new, single‐administration Otic Solution containing florfenicol, terbinafine and mometasone furoate for the treatment of canine otitis externa (OE). DESIGN: The clinical efficacy and safety study was a multicentre, controlled, masked and randomised field study conducted over 30 days. Two hundred and twenty‐one (221) client‐owned dogs of varying breeds with diagnosed bacterial and/or fungal OE were enrolled. PROCEDURE: Dogs were randomised to either Otic Solution or control groups. Evaluations were conducted over a minimum period of 30 days with a primary effectiveness endpoint based on the improvement in a clinical severity score at the final visit (day 30). Safety analyses were based on clinical and laboratory parameters and the occurrence of adverse events. RESULTS: The Otic Solution group demonstrated a significantly higher treatment success rate compared with that observed for the control group (72.5 per cent v 11.1 per cent, P value=0.0001) for cases of OE caused by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Malassezia pachydermatis. No significant safety findings were reported. CONCLUSIONS/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This new ototopical formulation provides safe and effective treatment of canine OE and is an important alternative antimicrobial for this indication.

Vertical profiles of LAI were derived at 0.3m height intervals from the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data using the Geometric Optical and Radiative Transfer (GORT) model. Cumulative LAI profiles obtained from LVIS were validated with data from 55 ground to canopy vertical transects using a modular field tower to destructively sample all vegetation. Our results showed moderate agreement between lidar and field derived LAI (r²=0.42, RMSE=1.91, bias=−0.32), which further improved when differences between lidar and tower footprint scales (r²=0.50, RMSE=1.79, bias=0.27) and distance of field tower from lidar footprint center (r²=0.63, RMSE=1.36, bias=0.0) were accounted for. Next, we mapped the spatial distribution of total LAI across the landscape and analyzed LAI variations over different land cover types. Mean values of total LAI were 1.74, 5.20, 5.41 and 5.62 over open pasture, secondary forests, regeneration forests after selective-logging and old-growth forests respectively. Lastly, we evaluated the sensitivities of our LAI retrieval model to variations in canopy/ground reflectance ratio and to waveform noise such as induced by topographic slopes. We found for both, that the effects were not significant for moderate LAI values (about 4). However model derivations of LAI might be inaccurate in areas of high-slope and high LAI (about 8) if ground return energies are low. This research suggests that large footprint waveform lidar can provide accurate vertical LAI profile estimates that do not saturate even at the high LAI levels in tropical rain forests and may be a useful tool for understanding the light transmittance within these canopies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aimage analysis 3alandscapes 3aleaf area index 3alidar 3amodels 3aold-growth forests 3apastures 3aradiative transfer 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asecondary forests 3atopographic slope 3atransmittance 3atropical rain forests 3aCosta Rica1 aDubayah, Ralph1 aSwatantran, Anu1 aHofton, Michelle1 aSheldon, Sage1 aClark, David B.1 aBlair, Bryan0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2012 Sept., v. 124 p.242-250dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2012.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245006900198300001600267500002000283520087100303592002801174650001001202650001401212650000901226650001301235650001601248650001701264650001701281773010701298856007301405852000901478655001201487IND60646803420221119035019.0190613e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680342DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.127082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPike, Thomas W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6942-049810aQuantifying the maculation of avian eggs using eggshell geometry  ap. 686-693.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBirds’ eggs often exhibit considerable variation in the presence and pattern of superficial pigmentation, or maculation. However, despite long appreciation of the nature of this variation both between and within species, there is still poor understanding of why such a diversity of patterns has evolved. Accurately quantifying eggshell maculation is therefore key to elucidating its functional significance. Maculation is typically quantified from photographs, and so measurements may be biased by the perceived distortion introduced by the curvature of the eggshell. Here, I consider egg geometry in order to derive measures of curved distance and surface area that can be used to characterize eggshell maculation patterns more accurately, and demonstrate the utility of this approach for quantifying and visualizing eggshell maculation from standard photographs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aegg shell 3aeggs 3ageometry 3aphotographs 3apigmentation 3asurface area0 tIbis.g2019 July, v. 161, no. 3 p.686-693dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.127083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245011400165300002000279520106500299592002801364650001101392650002401403650001601427650002301443650002101466650001101487653002601498653001701524653002501541653001901566653002501585700002001610700001501630700001301645773012601658856008001784852000901864655001201873IND60586581520221120173159.0171214e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058658152DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b144952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xiaoshuang12aA Route toward Ultrasensitive Layered Carbon Based Piezoresistive Sensors through Hierarchical Contact Design  ap. 43133-43142.  aUltrahigh sensitive piezoresistive sensors at small deformation are highly desired in many applications. Here, we propose a hierarchical contact design concept and implement it through a direct laser writing technique for fabricating layered carbon piezoresistive sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity. Sensors with unprecedented gauge factors (∼5000–10 000) at small deformation (ε < 0.1%) were successfully fabricated and demonstrated for their use in sensing both static and high-frequency (20–30 kHz) dynamic mechanical loads. A simple basic structure unit (BSU) contact network model was developed for understanding the importance of the BSU/BSU contact strength and network fractal dimension in dictating the piezoresistive sensitivity of the layered carbon piezoresistive sensors with designed hierarchical contact structures. The hierarchical contact design concept and the contact network model proposed in our work could open a general route for developing ultrasensitive piezoresistive sensors based on granular matter and composite materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acomposite materials 3adeformation 3afractal dimensions 3amechanical loads 3amodels 0apiezoresistive sensor 0agauge factor 0adirect laser writing 0alayered carbon 0ahierarchical contact1 aLuo, Jiangjiang1 aYao, Yanbo1 aLiu, Tao0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 9, no. 49 p.43133-43142dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b144953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04717naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012100171300001800292520325500310592002803565650001303593650000803606650002603614650001103640650001203651650001103663650001903674650002303693650001203716650001903728650001603747650001403763650001303777650001703790650001103807650000903818650001103827650000903838650001703847650002303864650001003887650001103897650001503908650001103923650000903934651001503943700002403958773009803982856008604080852000904166655001204175IND60089033820221116164634.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008903382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.04.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHam, Walter A.10aSize-resolved source apportionment of carbonaceous particulate matter in urban and rural sites in central California  ap. 3988-3995.  aVery little is currently known about the relationship between exposure to different sources of ambient ultrafine particles (PM₀.₁) and human health effects. If human health effects are enhanced by PM₀.₁’s ability to cross cell membranes, then more information is needed describing the sources of ultrafine particles that are deposited in the human respiratory system. The current study presents results for the source apportionment of airborne particulate matter in six size fractions smaller than 1.8 μm particle diameter including ultrafine particles (PM₀.₁) in one of the most polluted air basins in the United States. Size-resolved source apportionment results are presented at an urban site and rural site in central California’s heavily polluted San Joaquin Valley during the winter and summer months using a molecular marker chemical mass balance (MM–CMB) method. Respiratory deposition calculations for the size-resolved source apportionment results are carried out with the Multiple Path Particle Dosimetry Model (MPPD v 2.0), including calculations for ultrafine (PM₀. ₁) source deposition. Diesel engines accounted for the majority of PM₀.₁ and PM₁.₈ EC at both the urban and rural sampling locations during both summer and winter seasons. Meat cooking accounted for 33–67% and diesel engines accounted for 15–21% of the PM₀.₁ OC at Fresno. Meat cooking accounted for 22–26% of the PM₀.₁ OC at the rural Westside location, while diesel engines accounted for 8–9%. Wood burning contributions to PM₀.₁ OC increased to as much as 12% of PM₀.₁ OC during the wintertime. The modest contribution of wood smoke reflects the success of emissions control programs over the past decade. In contrast to PM₀.₁, PM₁.₈ OC had a higher fraction of unidentified source contributions (68–85%) suggesting that this material is composed of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) or primary organic aerosol (POA) that has been processed by atmospheric chemical reactions. Meat cooking was the largest identified source of PM₁.₈ organic carbon (OC) at the Fresno site (12–13%) while diesel engines were the largest identified PM₁.₈ OC source at the rural site (5–8%). Wood burning contributions to PM₁.₈ OC increased during the wintertime at both sites (6–9%) but were relatively small during the summertime (∼1%). As expected, diesel engines were the dominant source of PM₀.₁ EC respiratory deposition at both the urban and rural site in both summer and winter (0.01–0.03 μg PM₀.₁ EC deposited per m³ air inhaled). Meat cooking accounted for 0.01–0.025 μg PM₀.₁ OC deposited per m³ air inhaled while diesel fuel accounted for 0.005–0.013 μg PM₀.₁ OC deposited per m³ air inhaled. Minor contributions from wood burning, motor oil, and gasoline fuel were calculated at levels <0.005 μg PM₀.₁ OC deposited per m³ air inhaled at both urban and rural locations during winter and summer seasons. If the burden of PM₀.₁ deposited in the respiratory system is relevant for human health effects, then future toxicology studies should be carried out at PM₀.₁ concentrations and source mixtures equivalent to those measured in the current study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abasins 3aburning 3acarbon 3acell membranes 3achemical reactions 3acooking 3adiesel engines 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3agasoline 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3ameat 3amodels 3aoils 3aparticulates 3arespiratory system 3asmoke 3asummer 3atoxicology 3awinter 3awood 3aCalifornia1 aKleeman, Michael J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2011 Aug., v. 45, no. 24 p.3988-3995dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2011.04.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245009800170300001600268520165900284536006901943592002802012650001502040650002402055650001802079650001602097650001702113650001902130650002602149650001702175650001302192650002502205650002602230650001902256650001202275650001302287650002002300650001402320650001202334650001902346650001202365653001702377653001402394653003102408653001302439700001902452700001902471700002002490700002502510773013202535856008002667852000902747655001202756IND60616351920221119071542.0181016e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061635192DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387145472582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmermann, Vanessa10aImpact of antigenic diversity on laboratory diagnosis of Avian bornavirus infections in birds  ap. 769-777.  aAvian bornaviruses (ABVs) are a group of genetically diverse viruses within the Bornaviridae family that can infect numerous avian species and represent the causative agents of proventricular dilatation disease, an often fatal disease that is widely distributed in captive populations of parrots and related species. The current study was designed to assess the antigenic variability of the family Bornaviridae and to determine its impact on ABV diagnosis by employing fluorescent antibody assays. It was shown that polyclonal rabbit sera directed against recombinant bornavirus nucleoprotein, X protein, phosphoprotein, and matrix protein provided sufficient cross-reactivity for the detection of viral antigen from a broad range of bornavirus genotypes grown in cell culture. In contrast, a rabbit anti-glycoprotein serum and 2 monoclonal antibodies directed against nucleoprotein and phosphoprotein proteins reacted more specifically. Antibodies were readily detected in sera from avian patients infected with known ABV genotypes if cells persistently infected with a variety of different bornavirus genotypes were used for analysis. For all sera, calculated antibody titers were highest when the homologous or a closely related target virus was used for the assay. Cross-reactivity with more distantly related genotypes of other phylogenetic groups was usually reduced, resulting in titer reduction of up to 3 log units. The presented results contribute to a better understanding of the antigenic diversity of family Bornaviridae and further emphasize the importance of choosing appropriate diagnostic tools for sensitive detection of ABV infections.  aFunding All work was funded directly by the institutes involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBornavirus 3aantigenic variation 3abird diseases 3ablood serum 3acell culture 3across reaction 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence 3agenotype 3alaboratory diagnosis 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anucleoproteins 3aparrots 3apatients 3aphosphoproteins 3aphylogeny 3arabbits 3aviral antigens 3aviruses 0aBornaviridae 0adiagnosis 0afluorescent antibody tests 0aserology1 aRinder, Monika1 aKaspers, Bernd1 aStaeheli, Peter1 aRubbenstroth, Dennis0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 26, no. 6 p.769-777dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387145472583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014200167300001600309520228000325592002802605650002202633650002002655650002902675650003002704650001902734650002502753650002302778650002602801650001202827650001902839650002902858650002102887650001302908650001102921650001402932650002002946651001002966700001902976700001702995700002703012773013403039856008103173852000903254655001203263IND60481590020221118025946.0160207e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048159002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-014-9581-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Shouzhang10aRestoration and conservation potential of destroyed Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) forests in the Qilian Mountains of northwest China  ap. 153-165.  aEach of the last three decades has seen the Earth’s surface get progressively warmer more than any preceding decade since the 1850s. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have been scientifically demonstrated as the primary cause of the observed global climate change. The reduction of greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere has deserved international attention. Aside from strategies to reduce emissions, increasing carbon storage by restoring and protecting destroyed forests has become an alternative method to lower carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels. Therefore, effective restoration/conservation plans for deforested lands are urgently needed. The current work focuses on the restoration and conservation potential of destroyed Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia) forests in the Qilian Mountains of northwest China and provides a reasonable approach for drafting effective restoration/conservation plans for deforested lands. We first estimated habitat suitability of the Qinghai spruce using a habitat suitability model based on the relationships among the three most influential/significant environmental variables: average annual precipitation (P), average air temperature in July (T), and solar radiation (R) and the corresponding occurrence frequency of Qinghai spruce in the niche space. We then calculated the index of habitat suitability (IHS) for Qinghai spruce by applying a model in the study area. We finally used field data to classify the IHS map and identified the prior restoration and conservation areas for Qinghai spruce. The results show that (1) the optimal combination of T, P, and R for Qinghai spruce is 11.5 °C, 380 mm, and 2 × 10³ kWh/m², respectively; (2) these forests have potential for restoration; (3) areas with priority restoration and conservation potential are about 43 and 56.65 km². The results of this study will help decision-makers develop and implement effective restoration/conservation strategies in the Qilian Mountains. This study presents a useful approach for helping decision-makers in other regions of the world draft effective restoration/conservation plans for deforested lands. The implementation of these plans will reduce CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere, in turn, may retard global warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea crassifolia 3aair temperature 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric precipitation 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amountains 3asolar radiation 3aChina1 aZhao, Chuanyan1 aXu, Zhonglin1 aAshiq, Muhammad Waseem0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2016 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.153-165dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-014-9581-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013400166520145900300592002801759650000801787650001501795650001501810650001601825650002001841650002101861650000901882650003301891650001401924650001301938650001701951650001301968650001601981650002201997653002302019653002202042653002702064653002502091700001502116700001702131700001602148700001402164773011202178856008302290852000902373655001202382IND60675612820221120073438.0200103e20200115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067561282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1118312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Zhipeng10aHighly sensitive and simultaneous detection of microRNAs in serum using stir-bar assisted magnetic DNA nanospheres-encoded probes  aThere are critical interests in the detection of microRNA (miRNA) because it can be a blood-borne biomarker, but analytical strategies are still limited by its small size, high sequence homology among family members and low abundance. In this work, three-dimensional magnetic DNA nanospheres were synthesized and immobilized on a gold stir-bar as encoded probes for miRNA capture and signal amplification. Electrochemical tags-labeled DNAs were immobilized on gold coated magnetic nanospheres via a hyperbranched hybridization chain reaction (HHCR). Subsequently, the magnetic DNA nanospheres were immobilized on the gold stir-bar as encoded probes. Target miRNAs were captured on the surface of the stir-bar by replacing the magnetic DNA nanospheres-encoded probes, and the probes were magnetically enriched for highly sensitive and selective electrochemical detection. The gold stir-bar assisted magnetic DNA nanospheres-encoded probes possess dual functions: They are as a nanocarrier to increase the loading amounts of HHCR products, and they are also a platform for efficient electrochemical signal amplification via magnetic enrichment. The method was successfully applied for the detection of miRNA21 and miRNA155 in a wide linear range of 5 fM to 2 nM, and with detection limits of 1.5 fM and 1.8 fM, respectively. The preliminary application of the method suggests that it has great potential in the detection of miRNAs in serum samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3agold 3ahybridization chain reaction 3amagnetism 3amicroRNA 3ananocarriers 3ananogold 3ananospheres 3asequence homology 0aMicroRNA detection 0aDNA self-assembly 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aSignal amplification1 aHe, Liyong1 aWang, Wenhai1 aTan, Lėĭ,1 aGan, Ning0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2020 Jan. 15, v. 148 p.111831-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1118313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245010400156300001600260520052400276592002800800650002500828650004400853650001300897650002200910650002000932650002000952700001900972700002200991700002101013773015301034856007501187852000901262655001201271IND60549464220221119214727.0160908e20150227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054946422DNAL7 a10.1021/np500441r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yi-Shan10aTetrahydropyran- and Tetrahydrofuran-Containing Diarylheptanoids from Hedychium coronarium Rhizomes  ap. 181-187.  aSeven new diarylheptanoids (1–7) were isolated from the n-BuOH-soluble fraction of the rhizome of Hedychium coronarium.

Integrated coal gasification solid oxide fuel cell hybrid power plants have the potential to achieve high power plant efficiencies and enable opportunities for the efficient capture of CO2. The investigation of such power plants is the subject of this publication. The developed systems are based on conventional integrated coal gasification combined cycle technology and integrated with solid oxide fuel cells preceding the combined cycle process. The state of development of the selected solid oxide fuel cell technology is similar to that of integrated coal gasification combined cycles. Along with the base case, several other concepts with and without CO2 capture are developed using various process technologies. Fundamental system and sensitivity analyses are performed using simplified sub-processes to obtain general statements and trends as well as to calculate optimal boundary conditions for the overall systems. The simulations show that the preparation of process gas using a water gas shift reactor before entering the solid oxide fuel cells is beneficial for the overall efficiency. If a CO2 capture process is included, 11–16% lower net efficiencies are achieved. The level of specific CO2 emissions is significantly influenced by the net efficiency of the power plants and the portion of carbon bound as CO2 at the beginning of the CO2 capture process. Here, the combination of CO2 capture and water gas shift reactor upstream of the solid oxide fuel cells is the preferred concept regarding efficiency and CO2 emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aelectricity 3afuel cells 3agasification 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apower plants 0aHybrid power plants 0aIGFC 0aFuel cell 0aCoal gas 0aCO2 capture 0aWGSR0 tApplied energy.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 250 p.19-31dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.1933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001600158245015600174300001600330520182600346592002802172650002102200650001602221650002102237650002002258650001902278650001402297650001202311650003302323650005602356650002302412650000902435650003802444650002202482650003502504700001402539700002802553700001502581700001502596700001502611700001502626773012202641856007302763852000902836655001202845IND50074012620221122092539.0150206e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007401262DNAL7 a244799502pmid7 a10.1111/rda.122702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonthier, J10aConcentration, Activity and Biochemical Characterization of Myeloperoxidase in Fresh and Post‐Thaw Equine Semen and their Implication on Freezability  ap. 285-291.  aMyeloperoxidase (MPO) is a pro‐oxidant enzyme associated with decreased motility in thawed equine semen. This study aimed to describe MPO concentration, activity and subunits in raw and thawed semen and to correlate these data with motilities in raw and thawed semen. Semen samples from five stallions were collected four times. Motilities were assessed in raw and thawed semen. MPO assays were performed in raw seminal plasma, raw sperm‐rich pellet and thawed semen. Total and active MPO concentrations were, respectively, assayed by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and specific immunological extraction followed by enzymatic detection. MPO subunits present in semen were characterized by Western blot. Purified active MPO was added in saline solution and freezing extender to control its activity during freezing procedure. Differences between medians were determined using Kruskal–Wallis test, and correlations were determined using Spearman's test for nonparametric data. Active MPO concentration was low in seminal plasma and thawed semen, but high in pellet (p = 0.0058), as the opposite relation was observed for total MPO concentration (p < 0.0001). In seminal plasma and post‐thaw semen, inactive 86‐kDa MPO precursor was mainly observed. Purified MPO activity was decreased in the extender (p = 0.0286). MPO activity in pellet was highly correlated with thawed progressive motility (r = −0.5576, p = 0.0086). Inactive MPO precursor and unknown low molecular weight inactive MPO precursor subunits explain low MPO activity in semen. Major MPO activity was observed in pellet, and post‐thaw loss of activity is partially explained by MPO inactivation in extender. Thawed semen motility was negatively correlated with MPO activity in pellet, becoming a potential freezability predictor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acorrelation 3amolecular weight 3amyeloperoxidase 3aseminal plasma 3astallions 2aAnimals 2aCryopreservationxveterinary 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxphysiology 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aMale 2aPeroxidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSemenxenzymology 2aSemen Preservationxveterinary1 aFranck, T1 aParrilla‐Hernandez, S1 aNiesten, A1 aRebiere, G1 aSerteyn, D1 aDeleuze, S0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.285-291dP.

The process was performed with a speed of 10–40 rpm and a water circulating temperature of 35–70°C. The results showed that adding FFSF causes decreases (P≤0.05) in cooking time, cooking weight, intensity and hue characteristics. However, the cooking loss and saturation of spaghetti increased (P≤0.05). The temperature and speed of the extruder had no significant effect on the cooking and color attributes. Interaction between them and the components, however, had a slight synergistic effect on characteristics. Also, interaction between the components and the water temperature has a negative effect on the color and cooking loss. Data analysis showed that the cooking and color characteristics were optimized when 56.9 g/100 g wheat flour, 12.1 g/100 g FFSF and 31.0 g/100 g water content at a screw speed of 40 rpm and a temperature of 35°C were applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aextrusion 3anutrition 3apasta 3asoy flour 3asynergism 3awater content 3awater temperature 3awheat flour 0aFunctional spaghetti 0acooking characteristics 0aimage analysis 0aprocessing variables1 aMortazavi, S.

Here we propose a green and continuous wet-spinning assembly approach to continuously spin flexible graphene oxide (GO) fibres. Highly stable aqueous GO suspensions up to 40 mg mL⁻¹ are achieved and GO fibres are spun from highly oriented liquid crystals through a customized continuous fibre production line. As-spun GO fibres with specific ultimate tensile strength of 7 N/tex show strain to failure (%) of 10%; subsequent NaBH₄ chemical reduction gives graphene fibres with electrical conductivity of 214 S cm⁻¹.

However, the obstacles in activity, selectivity and SO2/H2O tolerance still remained. In this paper, titanate nanotubes (TNTs) were used to tune the property of Mn-Ce composite oxides and led to an outstanding catalytic performance in selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 within middle temperature region. Compared with conventional MnCe/TiO2 and V2O5/TiO2 nanoparticle catalysts, a higher NO conversion with good SO2/H2O tolerance could be observed at 200–300°C over the prepared MnCe/TNTs catalyst. More interestingly, much lower N2O concentration was detected in the SCR reaction over this catalyst. Characterization results revealed that MnCe/TNTs had larger BET surface area and greatly enhanced NH3 adsorption, which were beneficial to SCR activity. Moreover, the growth of MnO2 was improved and the redox property of the catalyst was tuned in the nano-confined space of TNTs. Thus the oxidative abstraction of hydrogen from ammonia was suppressed, resulting in less N2O production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3ahydrogen 3amanganese dioxide 3ananoparticles 3ananotubes 3anitric oxide 3anitrous oxide 3asurface area 3atemperature 0aNOx emission control 0aSelective catalytic reduction of NO 0adeNOx catalysts1 aWang, Penglu1 aFang, Ping1 aRen, Tingyan1 aLiu, Ying1 aCen, Chaoping1 aWang, Haiqiang1 aWu, Zhongbiao0 tFuel processing technology.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 167 p.221-228dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2017.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013300169300001800302520140400320592002801724650001601752650002701768650001301795650001501808650001901823650001501842650002001857650002401877650001301901650002201914650001101936650001401947650004401961650001902005650001502024651001102039653000802050653000802058653000702066653000802073653000702081653001102088653000902099653000902108653000902117653000802126653000802134653000802142653000802150653000802158653000802166653000702174653000702181653000802188653000702196653000702203653000902210653000902219653000902228653001002237653001102247653004502258653002102303653002202324653001602346653002602362653002102388700002502409700002502434700002002459700002302479773012202502856008502624852000902709655001202718IND60581905520221116170223.0180905e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058190552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbapap.2017.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBooth, Valerie10aRecent progress on the application of 2H solid-state NMR to probe the interaction of antimicrobial peptides with intact bacteria  ap. 1500-1511.  aDiscoveries relating to innate immunity and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) granted Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann a Nobel prize in medicine in 2011, and opened up new avenues for the development of therapies against infections, and even cancers. The mechanisms by which AMPs interact with, and ultimately disrupt, bacterial cell membranes is still, to a large extent, incompletely understood. Up until recently, this mechanism was studied using model lipid membranes that failed to reproduce the complexity of molecular interactions present in real cells comprising lipids but also membrane proteins, a cell wall containing peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharides, and other molecules. In this review, we focus on recent attempts to study, at the molecular level, the interaction between cationic AMPs and intact bacteria, by ²H solid-state NMR. Specifically-labeled lipids allow us to focus on the interaction of AMPs with the heart of the bacterial membrane, and measure the lipid order and its variation upon interaction with various peptides. We will review the important parameters to consider in such a study, and summarize the results obtained in the past 5years on various peptides, in particular aurein 1.2, caerin 1.1, MSI-78 and CA(1-8)M(1-10).

In addition, liquid formulations face stability challenges which is why currently around half of all biologics are freeze dried for preservation. The environmental impact of the fill and finish processes to produce a freeze dried biopharmaceutical (infliximab) was evaluated from two perspectives: (i) considering only process-specific needs and (ii) calculating the overall site needs. An Exergetic Life Cycle Assessment was conducted using both a bottom-up and top-down approach. The process-specific and overall site needs are 6.5 and 39.6MJex/vial, respectively. These results reveal that 84% of the cumulative exergy entering the manufacturing plant is non-process-specific. Electricity consumption is the highest footprint driver (86%), dominated by the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system running during non-production hours and/or supporting non-production related areas. If resource efficiency is pursued, the focal target might need to shift towards non-process-specific needs which are not essential for the product functionality/quality (e.g. full HVAC regime during non-production hours). It should be kept in mind that Good Manufacturing Practices conditions always have to be maintained. Currently performed energy saving measures addressing HVAC systems could potentially reduce the overall site needs calculated in this study by up to 16.5MJex/vial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3abiopharmaceutical industry 3abiopharmaceuticals 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenergy conservation 3aenvironmental impact 3aexergy 3afreeze drying 3agood manufacturing practices 3aheat 3aheating systems 3alife cycle assessment 3aliquids 3aventilation systems 0aBiopharma 0aLCA 0aFreeze drying 0aNon-process-specific needs 0aConditioning1 aDewulf, Jo1 aDe Soete, Wouter1 aHeirman, Bert1 aDahlin, Philip1 aJurisch, Christian1 aKrebser, Urs1 aDe Meester, Steven0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2019 Sept., v. 117 p.213-223dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2019.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245007900177300001600256500001900272520136500291592002801656650002301684650001401707650002501721650003401746650001701780653000901797653001001806653001801816653001601834700002501850700002301875700002301898700002501921700002601946700003001972773014702002856008102149852000902230655001202239IND60689327020221120091851.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068932702DNAL7 a10.1080/096374809028103382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanagiotakos, Demosthenes10aValidation of the MedDietScore via the determination of plasma fatty acids  ap. 168-180.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBackground The purpose of the present work was to validate the MedDietScore by means of plasma fatty acid levels. Methods The study sample consisted of 189 men (44±13 years old) and 185 women (40±15 years old), randomly selected from the ATTICA study database. All participants completed a food frequency questionnaire (the EPIC-Greek FFQ), and a modified version of the MedDietScore (using weights) was then calculated to evaluate the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Plasma and dietary fatty acids were measured. Results Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive relationship between the MedDietScore, monounsaturated fatty acids (P <0.001), monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (P <0.001), docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3) (P <0.05) and n-3 fatty acids (P <0.001), and inverse correlations between the diet score and polyunsaturated fatty acids (comprised of the sum of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids) (P <0.001), saturated fatty acids (P <0.01), and total n-6 fatty acids (P <0.001). The effect size of the relationships between the weighted-MedDietScore and fatty acids was better than the relationships with the initial version of the diet score. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the modified MedDietScore is a valid measure of various plasma fatty acids, and may prove a useful tool in assessing diet quality of adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3adatabases 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood quality 0aDiet 0aindex 0aMediterranean 0afatty acids1 aKalogeropoulos, Nick1 aPitsavos, Christos1 aRoussinou, Georgia1 aPalliou, Konstantina1 aChrysohoou, Christina1 aStefanadis, Christodoulos0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2009 Jan. 1, v. 60, no. sup5 p.168-180dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096374809028103383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03580naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245007200179300001800251520232300269592002802592650002002620650001702640650001302657650001802670650001002688650004102698650001202739650001102751650001302762650001102775650001402786650001102800650000902811650001602820650001802836650001202854650002702866700002202893773009702915856009003012990002303102852000903125655001203134IND60095813320221122181222.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009581332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbone, Francesco14aThe structure of toluene-doped counterflow gaseous diffusion flames  ap. 3040-3055.  aThe structure of gaseous counterflow diffusion flames perturbed with the addition of hundreds of ppm of prevaporized toluene is studied in two distinct flame environments: a blue methane flame stabilized on the fuel side of the gas stagnation plane and an incipiently sooting ethylene flame stabilized on the oxidizer side. The goal is to provide a well-defined testbed in terms of temperature–time history, major species and part of the radical pool, for the examination of reference fuels that are critical components of practical fuel blends. Gas samples are extracted from the flame with fused silica microprobes for subsequent GC/MS analysis and thermocouples and thin filament pyrometry are used to characterize the temperature field. Profiles of critical toluene pyrolysis products and stable soot precursors are compared with computational models using two semi-detailed chemical mechanisms. Results show that in the methane flame some oxygen containing radicals like O and OH are contributing early on to the toluene destruction path. In the incipiently sooting ethylene flame, the primary attack is from H alone. This finding confirms the different challenges that such flames pose to the validation of a chemical kinetic mechanism. The onset of toluene decay in these flames begins at relatively modest temperatures, on the order of 800K. This reactivity is captured reasonably well by both chemical mechanisms in the methane flame, in the absence of reactants larger than C2, but not so in the ethylene flame, in the presence of a richer, more complex mixture. The aromatic ring opening mechanisms are not adequately modeled in either case. This discrepancy has implications for the modeling of practically relevant fuel blends with both aliphatic and aromatic compounds. The dominant species larger than toluene in the doped methane flame is ethylbenzene, which at least one of the mechanisms reproduces quite well. The largest measured species in the incipiently sooting flame is indene, whose concentration increase due to toluene addition is properly captured by one of the models. The experimental dataset reported here may help identifying future improvements to chemical kinetic mechanisms and complement other reactor datasets lacking the coupling of kinetics and transport of flame environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aethylbenzene 3aethylene 3afree radicals 3afuels 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amethane 3amodels 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3apyrolysis 3asilica 3asoot 3atemperature 3athermocouples 3atoluene 3atumor necrosis factors1 aGomez, Alessandro0 tCombustion and Flame.g2012 Oct., v. 159, no. 10 p.3040-3055dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.05.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013400159300002000293520172300313592002802036650002102064650002302085650001502108650001902123650002102142650001502163650002402178700001302202700001802215700001702233700001902250700001802269773010102287856007502388852000902463655001202472IND60576615520221117230419.0170806e20120807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057661552DNAL7 a10.1021/la300810q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Hae-Woong10aStudy of the Air–Water Interfacial Properties of Biodegradable Polyesters and Their Block Copolymers with Poly(ethylene glycol)  ap. 11555-11566.  aIt has been reported that the surface pressure–area isotherm of poly(d,l-lactic acid-ran-glycolic acid) (PLGA) at the air–water interface exhibits several interesting features: (1) a plateau at intermediate compression levels, (2) a sharp rise in surface pressure upon further compression, and (3) marked surface pressure–area hysteresis during compression–expansion cycles. To investigate the molecular origin of this behavior, we conducted an extensive set of surface pressure and AFM imaging measurements with PLGA materials having several different molecular weights and also a poly(d,l-lactic acid-ran-glycolic acid-ran-caprolactone) (PLGACL) material in which the caprolactone monomers were incorporated as a plasticizing component. The results suggest that (i) the plateau in the surface pressure–area isotherm of PLGA (or PLGACL) occurs because of the formation (and collapse) of a continuous monolayer of the polymer under continuous compression; (ii) the PLGA monolayer becomes significantly resistant to compression at high compression because under that condition the collapsed domains become large enough to become glassy (such behavior was not observed in the nonglassy PLGACL sample); and (iii) the isotherm hysteresis is due to a coarsening of the collapsed domains that occurs under high-compression conditions. We also investigated the monolayer properties of PEG-PLGA and PEG-PLGACL diblock copolymers. The results demonstrate that the tendency of PLGA (or PLGACL) to spread on water allows the polymer to be used as an anchoring block to form a smooth biodegradable monolayer of block copolymers at the air–water interface. These diblock copolymer monolayers exhibit protein resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3acomposite polymers 3ahysteresis 3aimage analysis 3amolecular weight 3apolyesters 3apolyethylene glycol1 aChoi, Je1 aOhn, Kimberly1 aLee, Hyunsuk1 aKim, Jin Woong1 aWon, You-Yeon0 tLangmuir.g2012 Aug. 07, v. 28, no. 31 p.11555-11566dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla300810q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03886naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007500147245013900222300001800361520174400379592002802123596007502151596007502226596007502301596008302376596008302459650002502542650001302567650002002580650001102600650002002611650001002631650002502641650001602666650004302682650005202725650001002777650001202787650003202799700006702831700007202898700007002970700006403040700007303104773012403177856008203301852000903383655001203392IND60613517520221120125143.0190722e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061351752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-018-4281-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToscano, João Henrique Barbosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5501-609910aIdentification of appropriate reference genes for local immune-related studies in Morada Nova sheep infected with Haemonchus contortus  ap. 1253-1262.  aDue to the great economic impact of Haemonchus contortus on sheep farming, there is an increasing number of studies addressing host resistance against this nematode, including identification of directly related immune mechanisms. In this context, relative gene expression by RT-qPCR have been largely used, due to its rapidity, high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Although, appropriate reference gene selection is crucial for accurate interpretation of results. In this study, five reference genes (GAPDH, G6PDH, YWHAZ, ACTB, and B2M) were tested for expression stability in abomasum (fundic and pyloric regions) and abomasal lymph nodes of Morada Nova sheep classified as resistant (n = 5) or susceptible (n = 5) to H. contortus infection in a flock of 151 animals. GAPDH combined with YWHAZ were selected as reference genes for abomasal fundic region and abomasal lymph nodes, whereas YWHAZ was the most stable gene for abomasal pyloric region. These genes presented the lowest intra- and inter-group variations and, consequently, highest stability. In contrast, expression of G6PDH was the least stable in all tissues. The impact of reference gene selection was demonstrated by relative quantification of a pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNFα) in abomasal fundic region. Significant differences in TNFα expression levels between resistant and susceptible groups were only observed when the most stable genes (GAPDH combined with YWHAZ) or GAPDH were used as reference genes, whereas no significant differences were observed when other tested reference genes were used. It was demonstrated that normalization of expression data using inappropriate reference genes may significantly influence interpretation results.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017/01626-1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/00373-2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2017/24289-0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a122027/2017-5cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a118297/2015-5cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aHaemonchus contortus 3aabomasum 3aeconomic impact 3aflocks 3agene expression 3agenes 3alivestock production 3alymph nodes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asheep 3atissues 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aLopes, Louyse Gabrielli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7693-09041 aGiraldelo, Luciana Aparecida1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8696-37101 ada Silva, Matheus Henrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0119-24301 aOkino, Cintia Hiromi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3692-39021 ade Souza Chagas, Ana Carolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3939-00880 tMolecular biology reports.g2018 Oct., v. 45, no. 5 p.1253-1262dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-018-4281-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014200169300001600311520105900327592002801386650001901414650002201433650002501455650001601480650001801496650001601514650001701530650001101547650001701558650003301575650001001608650001301618650001101631653001901642653001701661653002801678653002301706653003001729700002201759700001901781700001901800700002601819700001801845700002101863773010801884856008501992852000902077655001202086IND60544311620221120220546.0190415e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054431162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2015.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaulidiani, M.10aDifferentiation of Nigella sativa seeds from four different origins and their bioactivity correlations based on NMR-metabolomics approach  ap. 308-318.  aAuthenticity and quality coherence are the major elements in ensuring the consistency of the expected beneficial outcomes from the use of traditional or herbal remedies. Metabolomics offers the possibility of addressing these issues. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to select the best solvent system for sample extraction. Partial Least Square (PLS) regression analysis was found useful in evaluating the relationship between Nigella sativa seeds from four different origins on the basis of their metabolite profiles. In this study, different bioactivities were displayed by different samples with the Qasemi and Syrian samples exhibited high α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, which was correlated to the high fatty acid contents based on the PLS model. The Ethiopian sample exhibited high DPPH radical scavenging and nitric oxide (NO) inhibition activities, which may be related to the presence of high levels of thymoquinone and thymol. The method was also successfully used to classify “new test” samples into their proper groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNigella sativa 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abioactive properties 3afatty acids 3aleast squares 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aprincipal component analysis 3aseeds 3asolvents 3athymol 0aNigella sativa 0aMetabolomics 0aNitric oxide inhibition 0aRadical scavenging 0aα-Glucosidase inhibition1 aSheikh, Bassem Y.1 aMediani, Ahmed1 aWei, Leong Sze1 aIsmail, Intan Safinar1 aAbas, Faridah1 aLajis, Nordin H.0 tPhytochemistry letters.g2015 Sept., v. 13 p.308-318dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000131x1874-39007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytol.2015.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245015900216500001900375520146300394592002801857650001701885650002901902650001701931650001901948650001701967650001301984650001101997650001402008650001802022650001702040650001702057653002202074653002102096653003002117653002202147700002202169700002102191700001702212773009702229856009002326852000902416655001202425IND60724109220221120194231.0210312e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072410922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1058302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDušeková, Aneta1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9898-150210aDerivatisation of metronidazole enhances cytotoxic effect against Acanthamoeba genotype T4 isolates and leads to cytomorphological changes in trophozoites  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAmoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are worldwide distributed causative agents of serious human infections such as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) and Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK). To date, treatment of these infections is non-uniform and frequently unsuccessful. Recently, the phosphonium salts were studied for their high levels of antimicrobial activity. This work was aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effect of metronidazole and two phosphonium salts (PS1, PS2) on two clinical Acanthamoeba isolates. The isolates showed distinctly higher susceptibility to both phosphonium salts than to metronidazole. The highest susceptibility was noted to PS1 after 48 h of incubation. Metronidazole derivate PS2 showed higher susceptibility than metronidazole. The values of EC₅₀ of PS2 were approximately twenty times lower than EC₅₀ of metronidazole for Acanthamoeba lugdunensis strain and sixteen times lower for Acanthamoeba quina strain after 48 h. Although the therapeutic effect of metronidazole in Acanthamoeba infections is usually insufficient, its derivatisation can result in a significantly higher amoebicidal effect. Cytomorphological changes of trophozoites after exposure to tested compounds included rounding up of the cells, damage of membrane integrity, presence of pathological protrusions, elongation of the cells or pseudocyst-like stages. Obtained results indicate possible therapeutic potential of studied phosphonium salts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthamoeba 3aantimicrobial properties 3acytotoxicity 3aderivatization 3aencephalitis 3agenotype 3ahumans 3akeratitis 3ametronidazole 3atherapeutics 3atrophozoites 0aPhosphonium salts 0aCytotoxic effect 0aCytomorphological changes 0aChemotherapeutics1 aGarajová, Mária1 aLukáč, Miloš,1 aMrva, Martin0 tActa tropica.g2021 Apr., v. 216 p.105830-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1058303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010700193300001600300500002000316520145800336592002801794650001501822650002001837650002701857650000901884650001501893650002001908700002101928700002201949700002001971700002301991700002302014700001802037700002302055700002302078700002602101773012602127852000902253856008902262961001202351655001202363IND4438374720221119122115.0210101e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443837472DNAL7 a215650732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02831.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTALLMON, DAVID A.10aWhen are genetic methods useful for estimating contemporary abundance and detecting population trends?  ap. 684-692.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe utility of microsatellite markers for inferring population size and trend has not been rigorously examined, even though these markers are commonly used to monitor the demography of natural populations. We assessed the ability of a linkage disequilibrium estimator of effective population size (Nₑ) and a simple capture‐recapture estimator of abundance (N) to quantify the size and trend of stable or declining populations (true N = 100–10,000), using simulated Wright–Fisher populations. Neither method accurately or precisely estimated abundance at sample sizes of S = 30 individuals, regardless of true N. However, if larger samples of S = 60 or 120 individuals were collected, these methods provided useful insights into abundance and trends for populations of N = 100–500. At small population sizes (N = 100 or 250), precision of the Nₑ estimates was improved slightly more by a doubling of loci sampled than by a doubling of individuals sampled. In general, monitoring Nₑ proved a more robust means of identifying stable and declining populations than monitoring N over most of the parameter space we explored, and performance of the Nₑ estimator is further enhanced if the Nₑ/N ratio is low. However, at the largest population size (N = 10,000), N estimation outperformed Nₑ. Both methods generally required ≥ 5 generations to pass between sampling events to correctly identify population trend.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademography 3agenetic markers 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amonitoring 3apopulation size1 aGregovich, Dave,1 aWAPLES, ROBIN S. 1 aSCOTT BAKER, C.1 aJackson, Jennifer,1 aTAYLOR, BARBARA L.1 aArcher, Eric,1 aMartien, Karen K.,1 aALLENDORF, FRED W.1 aSchwartz, Michael K.,0 tMolecular ecology resources.g2010 July, v. 10, no. 4 p.684-692dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02831.x3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02607naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010700166300001600273520144300289592002801732650002401760650001101784650001301795650002001808650001901828650002101847650001301868650001501881650001301896650001601909650000901925650002001934650002301954650001101977650001101988650001601999700002102015773009202036856004802128852000902176655001202185IND4474823020221121013353.0120416e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447482302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-012-9708-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratt, Nathan L.10aTiming of breeding in Ochrotomys nuttalli and Peromyscus leucopus is related to a latitudinal isotherm  ap. 599-610.  aPrevious comparative studies on patterns of reproduction in small-mammal species focus primarily on latitudinal differences in average litter size. Few studies compare reproductive patterns among northern and southern populations at the landscape scale. Our study compares differences in seasonal patterns of reproduction in northern and southern populations of the golden mouse, Ochrotomys nuttalli, and the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. These are remarkably similar species with regard to bioenergetics, body mass, feeding behavior, home-range size, natural history, nest-site preference, and periods of activity. Both species also exhibit very similar intraspecific seasonal patterns of reproduction across their respective geographic ranges. We found that O. nuttalli and P. leucopus switch from a summer breeding season, extending from late spring through early autumn in the north to a winter breeding season extending from late autumn through early spring in the south, near the isotherm where mean annual temperature is 15.6°C (60°F), or approximately 35° N latitude. This latitudinal isotherm provides a geographic benchmark to address future changes in patterns of reproduction attributed to climate change.

Plant species outside of this host range mount nonhost disease resistance to attempted colonization by the, in this case, non-adapted pathogen. The underlying mechanism of nonhost immunity and host immunity involves the same non-self detection systems, the combined action of nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins and pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Here we hypothesize that the relative contribution of NB-LRR- and PRR-triggered immunity to nonhost resistance changes as a function of phylogenetic divergence time between host and nonhost. Similarly, changes in pathogen host range, e.g. host range expansions, appear to be driven by variation in pathogen effector repertoires, in turn leading to reproductive isolation and subsequent pathogen speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunity 3ahost range 3adisease resistance 3areceptors 3areproductive isolation 3apathogens 2aArabidopsisximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aBacteriaxpathogenicity 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFungixpathogenicity 2aGenetic Speciation 2aHost Specificityxgenetics 2aPlant Immunityxgenetics 2aPlantsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Immunologicxmetabolism 0aproteins1 aPanstruga, Ralph0 tTrends in plant science.g2011 Mar., v. 16, no. 3 p.117-125dElsevier Ltdx1360-13857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2011.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015100169300001600320520211300336592002802449650001502477650002102492650001802513650002202531650001002553650003702563650000902600650001702609650000902626650002302635650001902658650002502677650002002702650002202722650001302744650002502757650001802782650001002800650001302810651001002823773009302833856008102926852000903007655001203016IND60081824720221121003549.0150224e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008182472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10144-014-0445-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanco, Guillermo10aCan livestock carrion availability influence diet of wintering red kites? Implications of sanitary policies in ecosystem services and conservation  ap. 593-604.  aThe diet of wintering red kites Milvus milvus over the last decade in central Spain was recorded to evaluate the influence of sanitary policies on carcasses use. The results show major differences in diet composition of red kites wintering in areas with and without availability of livestock carcasses. In the area without livestock carcasses (north-western Madrid province), red kites fed on a similarly large proportion of wild lagomorphs across the study period. In the area with livestock farming (Segovia province), red kites exploited carcasses from different livestock schemes (stabled livestock—primarily swine—versus free-ranging ruminants) depending on changing sanitary regulations as consequence of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or ‘mad cow’ crisis initiated in 2001. During the period of restrictive sanitary legislation (after the ‘mad cow’ crisis) that greatly limited the use of animal by-products from ruminants as food for avian scavengers, kites mostly predated on common voles and scavenged on swine carcasses. After the implementation of the less restrictive regulations (since 2011; regulations CE1069/2009, CE142/2011) that again permitted the abandonment of extensive livestock remains in the countryside and in feeding stations, the proportion of ruminants in the kites’ diet increased while the proportion of swine carrion decreased. Carcass dumps acted as temporally and spatially predictable sources of abundant food from stabled livestock before and even just after the mad-cow crisis, but become relatively unpredictable foraging places afterwards due to the generalized carrion destruction in authorized plants, primarily of swine considered as non-risk for the transmission of the bovine encephalopathy. This illustrates the deep and sometimes unexpected consequences that sanitary policies can impose on the composition and availability of food resources for scavenger wildlife. Much effort is still required to reconcile sanitary and environmental policies in order to ensure the conservation of avian scavengers and the provision of ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagomorpha 3aMicrotus arvalis 3aMilvus milvus 3aanimal byproducts 3abirds 3abovine spongiform encephalopathy 3acows 3adead animals 3adiet 3aecosystem services 3aencephalopathy 3aenvironmental policy 3afarming systems 3afood availability 3aforaging 3alaws and regulations 3apig carcasses 3aswine 3awildlife 3aSpain0 tPopulation ecology.g2014 Oct., v. 56, no. 4 p.593-604dSpringer-Verlagx1438-38967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-014-0445-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245013800178300001800316520185300334592002802187650001202215650001502227650001402242650002102256650001102277650001302288650001502301650003502316650001302351650001202364653001502376653003702391653002102428653003502449653003102484653002602515700001902541700002002560700002302580773010402603856008702707852000902794655001202803IND60545659120221120174046.0160902e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054565912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKucharska, Agnieszka10aNon-invasive biomonitoring for PFRs and PBDEs: New insights in analysis of human hair externally exposed to selected flame retardants  ap. 1062-1071.  aIn this study, we investigated the hypothesis whether externally adsorbed and internally deposited flame retardants (FRs) in hair could be distinguished. To this extent, hair samples collected from one volunteer were exposed under controlled conditions to phosphate FR (PFR) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) standards to mimic external contamination. Afterwards, suitable washing procedures to selectively remove contaminants from the hair surface were investigated. The samples were measured by GC–(ECNI)–MS for PBDEs and LC–(ESI+)–MS/MS for PFRs. All investigated compounds were transferred onto the hair surface. One of the most important finding was that dust particles are not mandatory to transfer compounds on the hair surface and to be able to measure high levels of compounds in human hair. To assess different protocols to selectively remove external contamination, the exposed hair samples were washed in different media before analysis: water, methanol, hexane:dichloromethane (1:1, v/v), acetone and shampoo. Results indicated that there is no washing medium able to entirely and exclusively remove external contamination. Among investigated media, methanol removed a meaningful part of the external contamination (42–105%), but the removal efficiencies differed among compounds. We therefore concluded that hair should not be washed prior to analysis and in case of visible contamination (e.g. with cosmetic products), water would be the recommended agent. Organic solvents should not be used for the washing step. Although it is impossible to distinguish external from internal exposure, hair samples may be used as valuable biomarker of human exposure, providing a measure of integral exposure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which has used externally exposed hair samples to PBDEs and PFRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3abiomarkers 3acosmetics 3aflame retardants 3ahumans 3amethanol 3aphosphates 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3asolvents 3awashing 0aHuman hair 0aNon-invasive human biomonitoring 0aFlame retardants 0aPolybrominated diphenyl ethers 0aPhosphate flame retardants 0aHuman exposure to FRs1 aCovaci, Adrian1 aVanermen, Guido1 aVoorspoels, Stefan0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 505 p.1062-1071dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006200169300001400231520075300245592002800998650001801026650002101044650001601065650002201081650003001103650002001133650002401153650001301177650001401190650001501204653002401219653001501243653002001258653000901278653000701287653000901294653000701303653001001310653000901320653001201329653000901341653000701350653000801357653000901365653000701374653001201381653000901393653001101402700003001413700001701443700001901460700002501479773015801504856008501662852000901747655001201756IND60654536320221120151941.0210720e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065453632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2019.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasques, João10aNutritional support in cirrhotic patients with sarcopenia  ap. 12-17.  aSarcopenia has been linked to oncologic and chronic diseases such as liver cirrhosis.

Here, quantum dot (QD) pulsed-DC vaccines integrating with tumor-associated macrophage polarization are developed for amplified anti-tumor immunity. Semiconductor QDs are engineered with diverse functions to act as fluorescence nanoprobes, immunomodulatory adjuvants, and nanocarriers to load tumor antigens and Toll-like receptor 9 agonists. The QD-pulsed DC vaccines enable spatiotemporal tracking of lymphatic drainage and efficacy evaluation of DC immunotherapy, and trigger potent immunoactivation. Specifically, designer DC vaccine plus macrophage polarization elicits potent immune response to stimulate innate and adaptive antitumor immunity and ameliorate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. As a new combination therapy, this strategy greatly boosts antigen-specific T-cell immunity and thus strongly inhibits local tumor growth and tumor metastasis in vivo. This study may provide an applicable treatment for cancer immunotherapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptor 9 3abiocompatible materials 3adendritic cells 3afluorescence 3aimmune response 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunotherapy 3amacrophages 3ametastasis 3ananocarriers 3aneoplasms 3anew combination 3aquantum dots 3asemiconductors 3avaccines 0aCancer therapy 0aMacrophage polarization 0aTherapeutic cancer vaccines1 aSun, Junlin1 aYu, Wenqian1 aJiang, Qunying1 aPan, Min1 aXu, Zhen1 aMo, Fengye1 aLiu, Xiaoqing0 tBiomaterials.g2020 June, v. 242 p.119928-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1199283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245010700215300001600322520188200338592002802220596007302248650003002321650001502351650002002366650001502386650001102401650001302412650002002425650001402445650001702459650001902476650001802495650001202513650002002525650001802545650001402563650001102577650001902588650001102607650001302618650001602631651001102647700002802658700002802686700003102714773013402745856008202879852000902961655001202970IND60710571320221122064651.0200912e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071057132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-020-02089-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Rafaele Regina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5884-479710aComparative epidemiology of three Colletotrichum species complex causing Glomerella leaf spot on apple  ap. 473-484.  aGlomerella leaf spot (GLS) is an apple disease that is causing concern to growers in Brazil due to the increases in severity over the years and the difficulties in control. To date there are few studies on the temporal progress of this disease specially comparing species of Colletotrichum. In Brasil the main species is C. fructicola followed by C. nymphaeae. It is not known the contribution of each species to the more or less aggressive behavior of the epidemic related to the different regions of apple production in Brazil. This study aimed to evaluate the temporal progress of GLS and to compare epidemiological differences between Colletotrichum species in two apple cultivars. After modeling disease progress in two plots of experiments assessing the curve for each leaf (300 curves/plot, 30 twigs with 10 leaves each), we recommend the use of the non-linear logistic model with random effects. The simulated temperature range of different producing regions in Brazil (under growth chamber) did not influence the severity of the disease caused by each species studied: C. nymphaeae, C. fructicola or C. karstii. Under controlled conditions of temperature and also in an experimental orchard, C. karstii did not cause GLS symptoms in ‘Eva’ and was less severe in ‘Gala’ when compared to C. nymphaeae and C. fructicola. Incubation period and latent period in ‘Gala’ were similar between C. nymphaeae and C. fructicola and greater when leaves were inoculated with C. karstii. In this study we demonstrated differences in GLS severity among species and between apple cultivars. We showed that the infection period and latent period are similar between C. fructicola and C. nymphaeae and they were equally severe at the same inoculation conditions. Cultivar Eva, classified as resistant to Colletotrichum spp., can be infected by C. fructicola and C. nymphaeae.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aColletotrichum fructicola 3aGlomerella 3aMalus domestica 3aaggression 3aapples 3abranches 3acrop production 3acultivars 3aepidemiology 3afruit diseases 3afruit growing 3agrowers 3agrowth chambers 3alatent period 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3aorchards 3atemperature 3aBrazil1 aBergamin Filho, Armando1 aZeviani, Walmes Marques1 aMay De Mio, Louise Larissa0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2020 Oct., v. 158, no. 2 p.473-484dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-020-02089-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245016800215300001200383500001900395520110100414592002801515596008301543596008601626650000801712650001101720650001601731650002001747650001901767650001201786650001901798650003301817650000701850650001901857650001301876650002301889650002201912650001601934650001001950700003501960700002501995700002802020700003402048773014102082856008302223852000902306655001202315IND60700415720221120204500.0200724e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070041572DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04680-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemos, Valfredo Azevedo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6029-321812aA New Simple and Fast Method for Determination of Cobalt in Vitamin B12 and Water Samples Using Dispersive Liquid-Liquid Microextraction and Digital Image Analysis  ap. 334.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, a simple and fast method for the determination of cobalt in vitamin B12 and water samples was developed. The procedure is based on the preconcentration of the element using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and subsequent detection by digital image colorimetry. DLLME was performed with trichloroethylene (extraction solvent) and ethanol (dispersive solvent). The element was extracted in the form of its complex with 2-(2-thiazolylazo)-p-cresol (TAC). The optimal working conditions were obtained through univariate optimization. The variables studied were pH, the volume of extraction solvent, and the volume of dispersive solvent. Under optimal conditions, the method presented a limit of detection of 0.9 μg L⁻¹ and precision (relative standard deviation) of 4.0%, for 25.0 μg L⁻¹ cobalt solutions. The procedure was applied to the determination of cobalt in vitamin B12 and water samples. The method presents a simple, fast, and low-cost procedure, presenting itself as an excellent alternative to the determination of cobalt in the samples analyzed.  aPublisher supplied data  a311419/2018-6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aFinance Code 001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aair 3acobalt 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3adigital images 3aethanol 3aimage analysis 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3apH 3asoil pollution 3asolvents 3astandard deviation 3atrichloroethylene 3avitamin B12 3awater1 aJunior, Ivanilson Vieira Souza1 aSantos, Luana Bastos1 aBarreto, Jeferson Alves1 aFerreira, Sérgio Luís Costa0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 July, v. 231, no. 7 p.334-334dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04680-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03893naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009500172300001600267520197700283592002802260650001202288650001902300650001802319650001102337650001402348650001802362650001102380650002202391650002902413650001902442650001602461650002602477650002602503650002302529650002502552650001102577650001402588650001802602650002102620650001102641650002502652651001102677653001802688653002202706653002102728653002002749653002602769700001502795700002302810700002402833700001802857700005602875700002002931700003602951700006002987773011303047856008603160852000903246655001203255IND60607355220221119180250.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060735522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlík, Zbyšek10aEnergy-efficient thermal treatment of sewage sludge for its application in blended cements  ap. 409-419.  aAlthough landfilling and disposal into the ocean present still the most common methods used in the sewage sludge management, the share of recycling and reuse based on drying and incineration procedures continuously increases during the last decades. In this paper, an energy-efficient thermal treatment of sewage sludge is proposed, aimed at its use in blended cements. A practical application of the designed treatment is performed for the sewage sludge obtained from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in Patras, Greece. The material characterization shows that the sludge thermally treated at 700 °C has significant amounts of silica, alumina, calcium oxide and iron oxide, while the content of amorphous phase is 41%, which results in a good pozzolanic activity. The mechanical properties of hardened cement pastes prepared using blended Portland cement-thermally treated sewage sludge binders are after the 28-days curing period not satisfactory yet, indicating that a substantial part of the sludge acts still as filler only. This discrepancy between the pozzolanic activity and mechanical tests can be explained by too coarse sludge particles which slow down the pozzolanic reaction. The results of chemical tests show that the safe limit for the practical use of sewage sludge as partial Portland cement replacement is 10%, which is mainly due to the relatively high content of chlorides and alkalis. This limit can though be increased by the removal of soluble salts from the raw sludge using water treatment. The life cycle assessment analysis of the blended cements shows that the decrease in energy consumption is nearly 10% for each 10% of sewage sludge in the blend. The emission of greenhouse gases during the thermal treatment of the sludge is found almost twenty times lower than in the Portland cement production. The cost analysis reveals substantial economical benefits related to the application of sewage sludge as partial cement replacement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalis 3aaluminum oxide 3acalcium oxide 3acement 3achlorides 3acost analysis 3adrying 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat treatment 3airon oxides 3alife cycle assessment 3amechanical properties 3amechanical testing 3amunicipal wastewater 3apastes 3arecycling 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3asilica 3awastewater treatment 3aGreece 0aSewage sludge 0aThermal treatment 0aCharacterization 0aBlended cements 0aMechanical properties1 aFořt, Jan1 aZáleská, Martina1 aPavlíková, Milena1 aTrník, Anton1 aMedved, Igor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5847-26981 aKeppert, Martin1 aKoutsoukos, P.

Although it has been the focus of many biological studies, more in-depth knowledge of plankton and their linkage with environmental variables is lacking. The main objective of this study was to analyse the spatio-temporal variations in mesozooplankton assemblages of Ushuaia Bay, an ecologically and economically relevant area in the middle Beagle Channel, on the basis of samples collected during summer (March), autumn (June), winter (September) and spring (December) 2012 from environmentally different sites. Mesozooplankton composition and abundance exhibited strong seasonal variations, closely associated with the late winter–springphytoplankton bloom. The appendicularian Fritillaria borealis and the cyclopoid copepod Oithona similis were the dominant species during summer and autumn, whereas meroplanktonic larvae and the cladocerans Evadne nordmanni and Podon leuckarti dominated during late winter and spring, respectively. Mesozooplankton abundance was lower at coastal sites receiving freshwater and sewage discharges. Contrary to data reported a decade earlier, small-sized omnivorous species were dominant in Ushuaia Bay in 2012. The increased abundance of these species and decrease in the abundance of calanoids (e.g. Drepanopus forcipatus and Eurytemora americana) may reflect the natural year-to-year variability in phytoplankton structure and water physico-chemical properties. However, since this bay suffers from chronic pollution, other explanations, such as the influence of eutrophication on plankton structure, should also be considered. This study provides a baseline for future research on the effects of natural and anthropogenic environmental change on the Beagle Channel, thereby expanding our knowledge of plankton in subantarctic fjords.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aEurytemora 3aFritillaria 3aautumn 3adominant species 3aenvironmental factors 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3alarvae 3amarine science 3aomnivores 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphytoplankton 3apollution 3aseasonal variation 3asewage 3aspatial variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aArgentina 0aMesozooplankton structure 0aSpatio-temporal pattern 0aSubantarctic bay 0aSouth American fjords1 aCapitanio, Fabiana Lía1 aHoffmeyer, Mónica Susana0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2019 Apr., v. 28 p.100546-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1005463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245009800157300001800255500002000273520144700293592002801740650002001768650002001788650001901808650001601827650002001843650001201863650001701875650001301892650001201905650001201917650001601929650002201945650001401967651001901981700001702000773009202017856007202109852000902181655001202190IND60571238020221118232031.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057123802DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.16032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReneker, J. L.10aClimate change increases the production of female hatchlings at a northern sea turtle rookery  ap. 3257-3264.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe most recent climate change projections show a global increase in temperatures, along with major adjustments to precipitation, throughout the 21st century. Species exhibiting temperature‐dependent sex determination are highly susceptible to such changes since the incubation environment influences critical offspring characteristics such as survival and sex ratio. Here we show that the mean incubation duration of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nests from a high‐density nesting beach on Bald Head Island, North Carolina, USA has decreased significantly over the past 25 yr. This decrease in incubation duration is significantly positively correlated with mean air temperature and negatively correlated with mean precipitation during the nesting season. Additionally, although no change in hatching success was detected during this same period, a potentially detrimental consequence of shorter incubation durations is that they lead to the production of primarily female offspring. Given that global temperatures are predicted to increase by as much as 4°C over the next century, the mass feminization of sea turtle hatchlings is a high‐priority concern. While presently limited in number, studies using long‐term data sets to examine the temporal correlation between offspring characteristics and climatic trends are essential for understanding the scope and direction of climate change effects on species persistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaretta caretta 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3afemales 3afeminization 3ahatching 3anesting 3aprogeny 3asea turtles 3asex determination 3asex ratio 3aNorth Carolina1 aKamel, S.

Normally, prediction of joint mixture toxicity depends on toxicological data of constituent compounds, although lack of information on dose-response of chemical mixture raises serious concerns on human health. Component-based approaches mainly use dose-addition or response-addition method to assess mixture toxicity risk exposure. Several models based on theoretical concepts of concentration/dose addition and independent/response action were also developed but these models do not address chemical interactions in mixture, and were mostly used to assess ecological risk exposure with limited or no information on human health risk assessment. This paper reviews available models to predict joint toxicity of chemical mixtures, and most applicable one to address human health risk exposure was identified. United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) weight-of-evidence hazard index (HI) based approach seems to be most appropriate to predict joint toxicity of chemical mixtures, and applicability of model is explained using emerging contaminants as an example. The review also identified challenges in implementing the interaction-based EPA approach and highlighted the need for necessary future research actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3adose response 3aenvironmental protection 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3amodels 3aprediction 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aweight-of-evidence 0aMixture models 0aJoint toxicity 0aChemicals 0aExposure 0aDose-response relationship 0aHuman health1 aKumar, Arun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8558-68100 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2020 Sept., v. 143 p.111458-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2020.1114583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03799naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245013500168520183800303592002802141650002502169650001302194650001302207650002402220650002002244650003302264650002502297650002502322650002002347650002602367650003102393650002402424650002002448650001902468650002502487650003002512650004302542650005202585650001902637650002202656650001802678650002602696650001802722650002002740650001702760650001202777650001302789650002202802653002302824653002702847700001402874700001502888700001702903700001802920700001402938700001102952773009902963856009003062852000903152655001203161IND60675468820221117235120.0200210e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067546882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7346602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBo, Zhao10aPelodiscus sinensis embryos infected with Aeromonas hydrophila show higher survival rates than infected Mauremys reevesiis embryos  aEmydidae and Trionychidae used different strategies to adapt to the environmental condition. However, the differences in the immune responses are not yet fully understood. In this study, Pelodiscus sinensis (P. sinensis) embryos infected with Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) showed significantly higher survival rates than infected Mauremys reevesiis (M. reevesiis) embryos. Transcriptomic profiles of infected and non-infected M. reevesiis and P. sinensis embryos were explored. In total, 8,358 differentially expressed unigenes were detected, of which 3,294 and 5,064 genes were considered to be up- and down-regulated in P. sinensis compared to those in M. reevesiis. Six differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were randomly selected for further validation by qRT-PCR, and the results agreed with the RNA-seq data. Analysing the transcriptome data, eight significantly up/down-regulated immune genes (basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3); patched domain containing 1 (PTCHD1); Sep (O-phosphoserine) tRNA: Sec (selenocysteine) tRNA synthase (SEPSECS); zinc finger FYVE-type containing 16 (ZFYVE16); EF-hand domain family member D2 (EFHD2); zinc finger MYM-type containing 4 (ZMYM4); histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9); interleukin 10 receptor subunit beta (IL-10RB)) were found. Expression patterns of eight selected genes after A. hydrophila injection were detected via qRT-PCR. In the early developmental stages of infected embryos, HDAC9 and IL-10RB significantly up-regulated which play a key role in the activation of NK cells and Th cells in P. sinensis, while M. reevesiis up-regulated BTF3 and ZFYVE16 first to start proliferation of B-lymphoid cells. We provide new insights into the immunity difference between Emydidae and Trionychidae, facilitating the development of new methods to treat bacterial infections in turtles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aEmydidae 3aMauremys 3aPelodiscus sinensis 3aanimal diseases 3abacterial diseases of plants 3abacterial infections 3adevelopmental stages 3aembryo (animal) 3aenvironmental factors 3agene expression regulation 3ahistone deacetylase 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3anatural killer cells 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aselenocysteine 3asequence analysis 3asurvival rate 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atransfer RNA 3aturtles 3aunigenes 3azinc finger motif 0aMauremys reevesiis 0aAntibacterial immunity1 aYang, Gao1 aQibin, Yao1 aXiaoxin, Dai1 aZhangjie, Chu1 aZhen, Tao1 aYi, Mu0 tAquaculture.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 518 p.734660-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7346603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009900211300001600310520194600326592002802272650002302300650000902323650001502332650001402347650000802361650002202369650001702391650002602408650001302434650001302447650001402460650002002474650001202494650002402506650001302530650001002543650001102553650001802564650001402582650001902596650001002615650002102625650001202646650001102658650001302669700001702682700002002699700001602719700003102735700002602766700002202792773013402814856008202948961001303030852000903043655001203052IND60710571820221122064751.0200912e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071057182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-020-02096-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattarai, Gehendra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2381-162910aDetached leaf inoculation assay for evaluating resistance to the spinach downy mildew pathogen  ap. 511-520.  aDowny mildew, caused by the obligate oomycete Peronospora effusa (Pfs), is the most economically important disease of spinach. In recent years, numerous new races of the pathogen have overcome the resistance used in newly released cultivars. Resistance to Pfs in spinach is predominantly governed by dominant major resistance genes (RPFs) that are widely used in commercial spinach hybrid cultivars. Currently, a labor and resource-intensive inoculation test of whole plants, in a large tray format, in a temperature-controlled growth chamber and dew chamber, is employed to evaluate the resistance of spinach germplasm and to characterize races of the downy mildew pathogen. The objective of this work was to evaluate, standardize, and validate a more efficient detached leaf inoculation method to differentiate resistant and susceptible spinach genotypes and characterize Pfs races on a standardized set of spinach differential genotypes. Detached leaves and cotyledons of standard host differentials commonly used for race differentiation were placed on water agar in closed Petri dishes and inoculated by spraying the leaves with a spore suspension of Pfs inoculum. Disease incidence and severity on detached leaves and cotyledons were compared to the response of the corresponding cultivars in the standard whole-plant assay. There was a complete match between the disease reaction on whole plants and the disease reaction on detached leaves for all three races of Pfs examined. Furthermore, the obligate pathogen could infect, sporulate, and maintain pathogenicity by propagation solely on detached leaves. The detached leaf assay could facilitate advances in breeding for Pfs by evaluating resistance, pathogen race identification, and studies on epidemiology and genetics of the pathogen as the tests are less labor, resource-intensive than the whole-plant assay format, and environmental variables can be more accurately controlled.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPeronospora effusa 3aagar 3acotyledons 3acultivars 3adew 3adisease incidence 3adowny mildew 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetics 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3agrowth chambers 3ahybrids 3ainoculation methods 3ainoculum 3alabor 3aleaves 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aplant breeding 3araces 3aresistance genes 3aspinach 3aspores 3aspraying1 aFeng, Chunda1 aDhillon, Braham1 aShi, Ainong1 aVillarroel-Zeballos, Maria1 aKlosterman, Steven J.1 aCorrell, James C.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2020 Oct., v. 158, no. 2 p.511-520dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-020-02096-53Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016500156300002000321520106500341592002801406650002501434650001501459650001501474650002101489650002001510650002101530650001501551650002201566650002001588650001901608650001901627650001301646700001701659700001701676700001501693700001801708773012401726856007401850852000901924655001201933IND60642127720221122154022.0190506e20171121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064212772DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08226f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yanping10aAcetylcholinesterase biosensor based on electrochemically inducing 3D graphene oxide network/multi-walled carbon nanotube composites for detection of pesticides  ap. 53570-53577.  aA sensitive electrochemical biosensor for determining organophosphates (OPs) and carbamate pesticides has been achieved by immobilizing acetylcholinesterase (AChE) on electrochemically inducing 3D graphene oxide network/multi-walled carbon nanotube composites (e-GON–MWCNTs). The nanocomposites of e-GON–MWCNTs can provide a favorable environment for the immobilized AChE and improve the electron transfer speed between the analyte and electrode surface. The fabricated AChE biosensors show a favorable affinity to acetylthiocholine chloride (ATCl) with a Michaelis–Menten constant of 0.43 mmol L⁻¹. In the optimal conditions, the biosensor exhibits a linear range of 0.03–0.81 ng mL⁻¹ for detecting carbofuran, and two linear ranges of 0.05–1 ng mL⁻¹ and 1–104 ng mL⁻¹ for detecting paraoxon. Furthermore, the detection limits for carbofuran and paraoxon can reach 0.015 and 0.025 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. The AChE biosensor exhibits good reproducibility and high stability, which demonstrates good efficiency in real sample analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abiosensors 3acarbofuran 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenzyme kinetics 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3aparaoxon1 aZhao, Ruixia1 aShi, Lingyun1 aHan, Gaoyi1 aXiao, Yaoming0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 21, v. 7, no. 84 p.53570-53577dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08226f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245007600174300001600250500001500266520055100281592002800832650001200860650002200872650001500894650001100909650002400920650001500944653001000959773010300969856005501072852000901127655001201136IND50064966220221120233014.0130413e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006496622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2012.00888.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuken, James O.10aLong‐Term Outcomes of Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) Establishment  ap. 669-670.  a2019-12-06  aDetermining the success or failure of rare plant establishment requires long‐term monitoring, but such monitoring is seldom conducted.

Two analytes, along with hesperidin as an internal standard, were determined by multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) operated in the positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. Chromatographic separation was performed on an Agilent ZORBAX Extend-C18 column (100mm×2.10mm, 3.5μm) with a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid solution and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.6mL/min. The calibration curves showed good linearity (r≥0.9974) with the concentration ranges of 2.000–2000ngmL⁻¹ for baicalin and baicalein 6-O-glucopyranuronoside. The inter- and intra-day accuracies (relative error, RE%) were between −6.62% and 6.75%, and the precisions (relative standard deviation, RSD%) were less than 9.09% for quality control samples (QCs). The method also possessed good selectivity, recovery and stability, and was successfully applied to a comparative pharmacokinetic study of baicalin and baicalein 6-O-glucopyranuronoside in normal and febrile rats after oral administration of baicalin and Chaiqin Qingning capsule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abaicalin 3aformic acid 3ahesperidin 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionization 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3aquality control 3arats 3astatistical analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aPharmacokinetic 0aBaicalin 0aChaiqin Qingning capsule 0aFebrile rats1 aWang, Bo1 aZheng, Lu1 aCong, Hai-Jian1 aXiang, Ting1 aWang, Shu-mei1 aSun, Cheng-peng1 aWang, Chao1 aZhang, Lin1 aDeng, Sa1 aWu, Bin1 aMa, Xiao-Chi0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 1059 p.14-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013600165300001600301520141700317592002801734650001201762650001901774650002201793650002301815650002001838650002601858650002801884650001001912650001901922650001501941650003001956650001401986650001302000650004302013650001802056650000902074650001102083700001602094700001902110700002002129700002502149773013402174856008202308852000902390655001202399IND60710571920221122064745.0200912e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071057192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-020-02097-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuzhinji, N.10aDevelopment of a TaqMan PCR assay for specific detection and quantification of Pectobacterium brasiliense in potato tubers and soil  ap. 521-532.  aPectobacterium brasiliense (Pb) is one of the causal agents of soft rot and blackleg diseases and has become a pathogen of economic importance in many potato production regions worldwide. Accurate, sensitive and timely identification of Pb is critical for improved management of the pathogen to mitigate yield losses. This study describes the development and validation of a TaqMan probe-based quantitative real-time PCR assay for rapid and specific detection of Pb in plant material and soil. A primer-pair that amplifies a 125-bp fragment was designed from the 16-23 s intergenic spacer region ribosomal RNA and the tRNA-Glu gene region. The specificity of the assay was evaluated with 24 isolates representative of nine different Pectobacterium and Dickeya species associated with soft rot and blackleg of potatoes. The designed Pb species-specific primers and FAM-labelled TaqMan probe were specific for detection of Pb in all the assays performed and it did not detect other Pectobacterium and Dickeya species. The TaqMan PCR assay could detect Pb DNA quantities as low as 10 fg/µl and DNA from a concentration of cells as low as 10³ colony forming units/ml. The assay was capable of identifying and quantifying Pb in potato tubers and in field soils without the interference of inhibitors.

This study integrates data mining techniques to develop a clustering preprocessing framework for the subannual calibration of hydrological models to simulate seasonal dynamic behaviors. The proposed framework aims to solve the problems caused by missing processes and deficiencies of hydrological models, providing guidance for future model development. A set of climatic‐land surface indices is provided and preprocessed using the maximal information coefficient and the principal component analysis. Two clustering operations are performed based on the preprocessed climatic index and land‐surface index systems. Hydrological data are clustered into subannual periods for calibration. The parameters are independently optimized for each subperiod using a modified parallel calibration scheme and are then combined to generate a continuous simulation. The framework is applied in calibrating the TOPMODEL. The results show that the performance of the model with a clustering preprocessing framework in the middle‐ and low‐flow conditions is significantly improved without reducing the simulation accuracy for high flows. The transposability of the model parameters from the calibration to validation period has been improved significantly as well. The anomalous parameter values may be attributed in part to the convergence problem when using an optimization algorithm. Though well applied in the TOPMODEL, the framework has the potential to be used in other hydrological models.  aPublisher supplied data  a51779279cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a51809294cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a2017KJ12cOpen research foundation of Dynamics and the associated process control key laboratory in the pearl river estuary of ministry of water resources  a42150001cBaiqianwan project's young talents plan of special support program in Guangdong Province  a51822908cExcellent Young Scientist Foundation of NSFC  cDynamics and the associated process control key laboratory in the pearl river estuary of ministry of water resources  cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFC0405900cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aalgorithms 3ahydrologic data 3ahydrologic models 3amodel validation 3aprincipal component analysis 3aresearch 3awater 3awatersheds1 aLin, K.

GA or its metabolites may reach aquatic ecosystems due to incomplete or inadequate treatment of wastewaters. Data about GA effects at lethal and a sub lethal level to non-target organisms is needed so that a risk assessment to aquatic ecosystems can be done. Thus, in this work a battery of toxicity tests with primary producers, primary consumers and secondary consumers were performed and a species sensitive distribution (SSD) for GA was built. Moreover, effects on biomarkers (catalase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione-S-transferase, and cholinesterase) were measured in Danio rerio embryos and adults. Primary consumers (Thamnocephalus platyurus 24h — EC50=3.6mg/l; Daphnia magna 48h — EC50=6.6mg/l) and D. rerio adults (96h — LC50=5.5mg/l) were slightly more sensitive to GA than D. rerio embryos (96h — LC50=22.2mg/l) and primary producers (Lemna minor 168h — EC50=73.8mg/l; Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata 72h — EC50=12.3mg/l; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 72h — EC50=14.6mg/l; Chlorella vulgaris 72h — EC50=31.3mg/l). However, no significant differences between the trophic levels were found and general HC5 and HC50 values of 0.6 and 11.4mg/l were respectively estimated. Despite the low GA toxicity to D. rerio embryos, hatching delay and malformations were found (96h — EC50=11.9mg/l). For biomarkers, an inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase activity was observed in embryos whereas an inhibition in catalase, lactate dehydrogenase and glutathione-S-transferase activities was observed in adults. Thus, GA is moderately toxic (doses>1mg/l) to aquatic organisms, independently of the trophic level. However, considering the varied range of effects depending on the life stage and organism tested and relatively low HC5 value of 0.6mg/l, mesocosm and chronic toxicity tests seem to be the next step in direction of more realistic scenarios of GA risk assessment in aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aDanio rerio 3aDaphnia magna 3aLemna minor 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic organisms 3abacteria 3abiocides 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3acholinesterase 3achronic toxicity 3adisinfectants 3aglutaraldehyde 3aglutathione transferase 3ahatching 3alactate dehydrogenase 3ametabolites 3anontarget organisms 3arisk assessment 3asterilizing 3atoxicity testing 3atrophic levels 3aveterinary clinics 3aviruses 3awastewater 0aPrimary producers 0aPrimary consumers 0aDanio rerio 0aBiomarkers 0aSpecies sensitivity distribution 0aBiocides1 aOliveira, Rhaul1 aCoelho, Sônia,1 aMusso, Carolina1 aSoares, Amadeu M.V.M.1 aDomingues, Inês1 aNogueira, António J.A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 470-471 p.147-158dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.09.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009400169300001600263520132500279592002801604650001701632650001501649650002601664650001401690650002301704650002101727650002401748650001301772650001901785650000901804650001001813700005901823700001801882700002001900700005901920700002801979700005502007700002002062700006802082773008702150856008502237852000902322655001202331IND60622568920221121200540.0210114e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062256892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMosconi, Dario10aArene C[sbnd]H insertion catalyzed by ferrocene covalently heterogenized on graphene acid  ap. 318-328.  aThe heterogenation of molecular catalysts on solid supports is a viable route for the preparation of hybrid materials that combine the high selectivity and activity of homogeneous active species with the enhanced stability and recyclability imparted by the heterogeneous nature of the support. In this work we describe the covalent functionalization with ferrocene (Fc) of two graphene derivatives: graphene acid (GA), a graphene layer whose basal plane is modified with COOH groups, and graphene oxide (GO). The surface modification is performed exploiting the carbodiimide chemistry, which allows introducing up to 3.6% at. of iron in the GA-based material. Compared to GO, GA owns a superior functionalization degree, which is attributed to its controlled surface chemistry. Both Fc-modified materials are tested as catalysts in the CH insertion of diazonium salts employing arene substrates. The materials are active, versatile and recyclable catalysts that show a catalytic performance comparable to or even better than molecular Fc, together with a 100% recyclability which does not alter the catalytic performance. The GA-based hybrid catalyst results more active than that based on GO due to the presence of more extended aromatic domains that facilitate the adsorption of the reagents close to the active sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3adiazonium compounds 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3airon 3asalts1 aBlanco, Matías1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7323-81491 aGatti, Teresa1 aCalvillo, Laura1 aOtyepka, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1066-56771 aBakandritsos, Aristides1 aMenna, Enzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9448-47761 aAgnoli, Stefano1 aGranozzi, G.q(Gaetano),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9509-61420 tCarbon.g2019 Mar., v. 143 p.318-328dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014000166300001400306520152400320592002801844650002201872650001001894650001401904650001001918650001201928650002601940650001001966650002401976650002102000650001602021650000902037650000902046650002002055650001102075650001202086650002902098650002402127650001202151650002102163651001002184653004302194653002102237653002102258653002402279653001502303700001402318700001802332700001602350700001802366700001302384700001802397700001702415700001802432773010902450856008502559852000902644655001202653IND60612286020221119031312.0180905e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061228602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Yuan10aStudy on pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of Vonoprazan pyroglutamate in rats by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 56-65.  aVonoprazan Fumarate (TAK-438F) is a new and effective drug approved in Japan in 2014 for treatment and prevention of acid-related diseases (ARDs), which exhibits many advantages compared with traditional proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, the clinical applications of TAK0-438F suffers limitation due to the lack of injection dosage form. Efforts to overcome this limitation lead to the systhesis of Vonoprazan pyroglutamate (TAK-438P) for its high water solubility and more potent antisecretory effect. This was the first report to establish and validate a reliable and sensitive LC–MS/MS method for the quantification of TAK-438P in rat plasma and tissues (heart, liver, spleen, liver, kidney, rain, stomach and small intestine). All the features of the developed method suggested it was within bioanalytical criteria recommended by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the developed method was applied to the exploration of the bioequivalence between TAK-438P and TAK-438F, as well as the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of TAK-438P. The results showed that there was no significant differences between TAK-438P and TAK-438F after oral administration of the same dose. Besides, TAK-438P was rapidly absorbed and eliminated in rat plasma. And it was widely distributed and there was no long-term accumulation in most tissues. Notably, more than 2000ng/mL was observed in stomach 12h after oral administration. The high accumulation revealed that stomach was likely to be the target organs of TAK-438P.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3afumarates 3aheart 3akidneys 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3aproton pump 3arain 3arats 3asmall intestine 3aspleen 3astomach 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissue distribution 3atissues 3awater solubility 3aJapan 0aVonoprazan pyroglutamate (TAK-438 P) 0aWater solubility 0aPharmacokinetics 0aTissue distribution 0aLC–MS/MS1 aZhao, Jun1 aYue, Xuanfeng1 aZhang, Yang1 aZhang, Ruitao1 aXu, Yuan1 aTang, Xiuling1 aLiu, Xueying1 aWang, Qingwei0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 1059 p.56-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03896naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002600123024003300149040001800182100002300200245011400223300001800337500002000355506002800375506003000403520197400433592002802407596004402435596004502479596004602524506003702570650001202607650001102619650002602630650002202656650001502678650002002693650001202713650001602725650001302741650002302754650002602777650001902803650001902822650001302841650001802854650001302872650002702885650000902912650002702921650001802948650002202966650001002988650003702998700002503035773010703060856007203167903002203239852000903261655001203270IND60571238420221207095511.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057123842DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.15952chorus7 a10.1002/ecy.15952doi7 a10.1002/ecy.15952chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMidgley, Meghan G.10aResource stoichiometry and the biogeochemical consequences of nitrogen deposition in a mixed deciduous forest  ap. 3369-3378.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aEcosystems often show differential sensitivity to chronic nitrogen (N) deposition; hence, a critical challenge is to improve our understanding of how and why site‐specific factors mediate biogeochemical responses to N enrichment. We examined the extent to which N impacts on soil carbon (C) and N dynamics depend on microbial resource stoichiometry. We added N to forest plots dominated by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees, which have litter and soil pools rich in organic N and relatively wide C:N ratios, and adjacent forest plots dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees, which have litter and soil pools rich in inorganic N and relatively narrow C:N ratios. While microbes in both plot types exhibited fairly strict biomass homeostasis, microbes in AM‐ and ECM‐dominated plots differed in their physiological responses to N addition. Microbes in ECM plots responded to N enrichment by decreasing their investment in N‐acquisition enzymes (relative to C‐acquisition enzymes) and increasing N mineralization rates (relative to C mineralization rates), suggesting that N addition alleviated microbial N demand. In contrast, heterotrophic microbial activities in AM plots were unaffected by N addition, most likely as a result of N‐induced increases in net nitrification (60% increase relative to control plots) and nitrate mobilization (e.g., sixfold increases in mobilization relative to control plots). Combined, our findings suggest the stoichiometric differences between AM and ECM soils are the primary drivers of the observed responses. Plant and microbial communities characterized by wide C:N are more susceptible to N‐induced changes in decomposition and soil C dynamics, whereas communities characterized by narrow C:N are more susceptible to N‐induced nitrate leaching losses. Hence, the biogeochemical consequences of N deposition in temperate forests may be driven by the stoichiometry of the dominant trees and their associated microbes.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSDOEdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000150 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystems 3aectomycorrhizae 3aenzymes 3ahomeostasis 3aleaching 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amicroorganisms 3amineralization 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aphysiological response 3asoil 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3astoichiometry 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aPhillips, Richard P.0 tEcology.g2016 Dec., v. 97, no. 12 p.3369-3378dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27815x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.15953Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245011100176300001600287520116800303592002801471650001501499650001801514650002301532650001401555650001601569650002201585650000701607650001501614650001801629650001701647650002001664650002101684653002101705653001601726653003001742653001801772653002401790653003801814700002401852700002101876700002401897773010601921856008702027852000902114655001202123IND60545493720221118225850.0160902e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054549372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.09.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatchu, Sudha Rani10aPhotodegradation of antibiotics under simulated solar radiation: Implications for their environmental fate  ap. 299-310.  aRoxithromycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole are frequently detected antibiotics in environmental waters. Direct and indirect photolysis of these problematic antibiotics were investigated in pure and natural waters (fresh and salt water) under irradiation of different light sources. Fundamental photolysis parameters such as molar absorption coefficient, quantum yield and first order rate constants are reported and discussed. The antibiotics are degraded fastest under ultraviolet 254nm, followed by 350nm and simulated solar radiation. The composition of the matrix (pH, dissolved organic content, chloride ion concentration) played a significant role in the observed photodegradation. Under simulated solar radiation, ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole degrade relatively quickly with half-lives of 0.5 and 1.5h, respectively. However, roxithromycin and erythromycin, macrolides are persistent (half-life: 2.4–10days) under solar simulation. The transformation products (15) of the targeted antibiotics produced under irradiation experiments were identified using high resolution mass spectrometry and degradation pathways were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aciprofloxacin 3aenvironmental fate 3ahalf life 3airradiation 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aroxithromycin 3asaline water 3asolar radiation 3asulfamethoxazole 0aPhotodegradation 0aAntibiotics 0aSimulated solar radiation 0aIntermediates 0aPhotolysis products 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry1 aPanditi, Venkata R.1 aO'Shea, Kevin E.1 aGardinali, Piero R.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 470-471 p.299-310dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.09.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010500172300001500277500001400292520104500306592002801351650001301379650002801392650001901420650001501439650002601454650001101480650001401491650001701505650001001522650001601532650001601548653002201564653002601586653002601612653002401638653003401662700001701696700003201713773009801745856008501843852000901928655001201937IND60719925520221117191413.0210201e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071992552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElguezabal, Borja10aStudy of Astroloy powder compaction at high temperature under hydrostatic load using finite elements  ap. 92-100.  aNAL-light  aThe results of existing constitutive models describing the behaviour of metal powder during compaction processes are very different. This reveals the high sensitivity of the mechanical behaviour of porous materials to the shape, arrangement and distribution of particles and pores.In order to clarify these discrepancies, the compaction behaviour under hydrostatic loads and high temperatures for a Nickel-based superalloy has been characterized. For this characterization, a numerical optimization procedure has been defined. In parallel, finite element models at a mesoscopic level have been built with the aim of estimating the parameters that define the mechanical behaviour of metallic powder under hydrostatic loads. Then a homogenization procedure has been used to compute the macroscopic behaviour of the powder.The results of both the experimental characterization and the mesoscopic models emphasize the limits of the analysed literature constitutive models to reproduce the compaction behaviour of the considered Astroloy powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3afinite element analysis 3ahomogenization 3aliterature 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aparticles 3aporous media 3ashape 3asuperalloys 3atemperature 0aPowder compaction 0aFinite element method 0aHydrostatic behaviour 0aMesoscopic analysis 0aExperimental characterization1 aAlkorta, Jon1 aMartínez-Esnaola, José M.0 tPowder technology.g2021 Mar., v. 381 p.92-100dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010400169300001600273520157100289592002801860650001201888650001201900650002101912650002601933650002201959650001001981650001101991650001402002650001402016650001502030650001102045650001102056650001002067650002002077650001402097650001202111650001002123650002202133651001002155651001102165653002502176653002402201653001902225653003102244653002502275700001602300700001802316700001602334773010602350856008702456852000902543655001202552IND60545493820221118225114.0160902e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054549382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.09.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVarrica, D.10aTrace elements in scalp hair of children chronically exposed to volcanic activity (Mt. Etna, Italy)  ap. 117-126.  aThe aim of this survey was to use scalp hair as a biomonitor to evaluate the environmental exposure to metals and metalloids of schoolchildren living around the Mt. Etna area, and to verify whether the degree of human exposure to trace elements is subject to changes in local environmental factors.Twenty trace elements were determined in 376 samples of scalp hair from schoolboys (11–13years old) of both genders, living in ten towns located around the volcanic area of Mt. Etna (Sicily). The results were compared with those (215 samples) from children living in areas of Sicily characterized by a different geological setting (reference site). As, U and V showed much higher concentrations at the volcanic site whereas Sr was particularly more abundant at the reference site. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) indicated an Etna factor, made up of V, U and Mn, and a second factor, concerning the reference site, characterized by Ni and Sr, and to a lesser extent by Mo and Cd. Significant differences in element concentrations were also observed among three different sectors of Mt. Etna area. Young people living in the Mt. Etna area are naturally exposed to enhanced intakes of some metals (V, U, Mn) and non-metals (e.g., As) than individuals of the same age residing in other areas of Sicily, characterized by different lithologies and not influenced by volcanic activity. The petrographic nature of local rocks and the dispersion of the volcanic plume explain the differences, with ingestion of water and local food as the most probable exposure pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achronic exposure 3adiscriminant analysis 3aexposure pathways 3ahairs 3ahumans 3aingestion 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3apeople 3arocks 3aschool children 3astrontium 3asurveys 3atowns 3avolcanic activity 3aItaly 3aSicily 0aMetals in human hair 0aHuman biomonitoring 0aTrace elements 0aEnvironmental geochemistry 0aChemometric analysis1 aTamburo, E.1 aDongarrà, G.1 aSposito, F.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 470-471 p.117-126dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.09.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245009200175500001900267520102200286592002801308650001501336650002801351650001501379650001701394650003301411650002601444653001001470653002601480653001801506653001201524653002201536700001701558700001801575700001601593700002001609700001701629700001301646700001501659700001401674700002001688773009301708856009001801852000901891655001201900IND60686505920221118001955.0200318e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068650592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1199382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bingling10aSTORM imaging of mitochondrial dynamics using a vicinal-dithiol-proteins-targeted probe  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aStochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) is a promising method for the visualization of ultra-fine mitochondrial structures. However, this approach is limited to monitoring dynamic intracellular events owing to its low temporal resolution. We developed a new strategy to capture mitochondrial dynamics using a compressed sensing STORM algorithm following raw data pre-treatments by a noise-corrected principal component analysis and K-factor image factorization. Using STORM microscopy with a vicinal-dithiol-proteins targeting probe, visualizing mitochondrial dynamics was attainable with spatial and temporal resolutions of 45 nm and 0.8 s, notably, dynamic mitochondrial tubulation retraction of ~746 nm in 1.2 s was monitored. The labeled conjugate was observed as clusters (radii, ~90 nm) distributed on the outer mitochondrial membranes, not yet reported as far as we know. This strategy is promising for the quantitative analysis of intracellular behaviors below the optical diffraction limit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiocompatible materials 3amicroscopy 3amitochondria 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative analysis 0aSTORM 0aMitochondrial imaging 0aVDP Targeting 0aCyanine 0aLive cell imaging1 aGong, Wanjun1 aYang, Zhigang1 aPan, Wenhui1 aVerwilst, Peter1 aShin, Jinwoo1 aYan, Wei1 aLiu, Liwei1 aQu, Junle1 aKim, Jong Seung0 tBiomaterials.g2020 June, v. 243 p.119938-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.1199383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006700169300001600236500001400252520138900266592002801655650001301683650001201696650001301708650000901721650001301730650001101743650001401754650001501768653002201783653002201805653001801827653003101845653002101876700002501897700001801922700002501940773009901965856008502064852000902149655001202158IND60719925620221117191407.0210201e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071992562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadeem, Humair10aCharacterization of intruder particle motion in a bladed mixer  ap. 440-450.  aNAL-light  aGranular mixing is important to many industries, but the mixing process is still poorly understood. In this study, motion of a single intruder particle introduced in a shallow bed of native particles was investigated. A parametric investigation was carried out to quantify the effects of initial intruder particle location, blade speed, and density difference between similarly sized native and intruder particles on the motion of the intruder particle during the mixing process. Intruder particles were color-tagged and videos were obtained from the top free surface of the shallow bed throughout the mixing duration. Additional experiments were performed to investigate the effect of density ratio between the intruder and native particles on the mean radial location (MRL) of the intruder particle. In the shallow bed system, all particles were found to be consistently under the direct influence of the blade and moved in discrete tracks unless randomly excited by the blade or neighboring particles. Intruder particles that were denser than the native particles were found to rotate closer to the hub with a smaller mean radial location, whereas less dense intruders were found to be further away from the mixer center on average. Initial location was important only for the first few rotations, and the blade speed had a negligible impact on the intruder particle flow behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3adensity 3aduration 3aflow 3aindustry 3amixing 3aparticles 3atechnology 0aParticle tracking 0aIntruder particle 0aGranular flow 0aDensity driven segregation 0aAngular momentum1 aSubramaniam, Shankar1 aSinha, Kushal1 aHeindel, Theodore J.0 tPowder technology.g2021 Mar., v. 381 p.440-450dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2020.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015900168520094400327592002801271650002901299650001601328650001101344650002001355650001801375650002201393650001501415650001901430650001101449650002401460650001401484650001901498650001901517650002401536700001801560700001601578700006201594700002301656700002101679700002501700700002301725700002001748700001801768700003101786700006001817700001901877700002001896700002601916700005901942700005502001773011502056856008302171852000902254655001202263IND60634310220221120213516.0190516e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063431022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1005592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilmi, Nathalie10aSocio-economic tools to mitigate the impacts of ocean acidification on economies and communities reliant on coral reefs — a framework for prioritization  aCoral reef preservation is a challenge for the whole of humanity, not just for the estimated three billion people that directly depend upon coral reefs for their livelihoods and food security. Ocean acidification combined with rising sea surface temperatures, and an array of other anthropogenic influences such as pollution, sedimentation, over fishing, and coral mining represent the key threats currently facing coral reef survival. Here we summarize a list of agreements, policies, and socio-economic tools and instruments that can be used by global, national and local decision-makers to address ocean acidification and associated threats, as identified during an expert workshop in October 2017. We then discuss these tools and instruments at a global level and identify the key tasks for raising decision makers’ awareness. Finally, we suggest ways of prioritizing between different actions or tools for mitigation and adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adecision making 3afood security 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amarine science 3amining 3aocean acidification 3apollution 3aprioritization 3asocioeconomics 3asurface temperature1 aOsborn, David1 aAcar, Sevil1 aBambridge, Tamatoa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5463-46021 aChlous, Frederique1 aÇinar, E.

Preparing catalytic experiments and process engineering calculations are inevitable for selecting the most technically and economically appropriate process. There is limited information in the free literature about the complex approach of hydrotreating processes that deal with both the catalytic and process issues. This paper summarizes the results of an engineering study to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of different types of hydrotreating processes for producing high quality gas oil blending components from heavy gas oil fraction. Hydrotreatment of feed in one-stage on nickel(Ni) molybdenum(Mo)/alumina and in two-stage on NiMo/alumina followed by on platinum(Pt) palladium(Pd)/zeolite catalysts were investigated. In one stage hydroprocessing sulphur and polyaromatic contents of the products met the requirements of the standard only if strict process parameters were applied (temperature > 370 °C and Liquid Hourly Space Velocity < 1.5h⁻¹) which resulted in operation problems and product loss, moreover the advantageous process parameters of hydrodesulphurization and hydrodearomatization did not coincide. In two-stage hydrotreating results showed that the advantageous process parameters for reduction of sulphur and aromatics coincided. Advantageous process parameters to produce gas oil of quality meeting the requirement of the standard were determined. Based on the experimental results model for both alternatives was prepared, and heat and material balances were determined. By applying two step hydrotreating, the yield of gas oil having low sulphur and aromatic content was 6.2% higher than that obtained in one step. Heat exchanger network analysis and sizing of main equipments were accomplished. Operating and investment costs were estimated for both processes, which showed that all the cost elements were higher for the two-stage process. But it provides the following advantages in comparison to one-stage process: higher yield of gas oil, better product quality allowing the application of low value hydrocarbon streams in higher quantity at the blending, the lower density of products would be the source of extra profit due to diesel fuels are sold on volume basis at the petrol stations. Estimation of emission potential of feed and products was prepared, too. This showed that the hydrotreating of heavy gas oil contributes to significant reduction in emission of particulate matter, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, but the effect on the emission of nitrogen oxides was scarce. Product of two-stage process provided considerably greater decrease in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions comparing to the one-stage alternative (52% vs. 14% and 54% vs. 14%). Consequently, the estimation of emission potential of hydrotreated products can be used as one of the parameters for selecting between various process alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aengineering 3afuel oils 3agasoline 3aheat 3aheat exchangers 3ahydrocarbons 3aliquids 3amixing 3amodels 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3apalladium 3aparticulates 3aplatinum 3aproduct quality 3asulfur 3atemperature 0aHeavy gas oil 0aHydrodesulphurization 0aHydrodearomatization 0aProcess modelling 0aEconomic evaluation 0aEmission estimation1 aEller, Zoltán1 aHancsók, Jenő0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 16, v. 111 p.108-116dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01474naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014100172300001600313520048200329592002800811650001500839650002500854650002800879653001200907653002400919653003300943773011300976856008601089852000901175655001201184IND60607356420221119180102.0181208e20160116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060735642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoscardo, Gianna10aBuilding Excellence in Sustainable Tourism: 15 years of Building Excellence in Sustainable Tourism Education Network (BEST EN) practice  ap. 538-539.  aThis note from the field describes the Building Excellence in Sustainable Tourism Education Network (BEST EN) group and uses its 15 year history to explore the evolution of education and research to support changes in practice related to tourism and sustainability.

Such spatially and temporally extensive datasets have been lacking for freshwater systems in comparison to terrestrial ones. MAIN TYPES OF VARIABLES CONTAINED: The database includes 11,386 time‐series of riverine fish community catch data, including 646,270 species‐specific abundance records, together with metadata related to the geographical location and sampling methodology of each time‐series. SPATIAL LOCATION AND GRAIN: The database contains 11,072 unique sampling locations (stream reach), spanning 19 countries, five biogeographical realms and 402 hydrographical basins world‐wide. TIME PERIOD AND GRAIN: The database encompasses the period 1951–2019. Each time‐series is composed of a minimum of two yearly surveys (mean = 8 years) and represents a minimum time span of 10 years (mean = 19 years). MAJOR TAXA AND LEVEL OF MEASUREMENT: The database includes 944 species of ray‐finned fishes (Class Actinopterygii). SOFTWARE FORMAT: csv. MAIN CONCLUSION: Our collective effort provides the most comprehensive long‐term community database of riverine fishes to date. This unique database should interest ecologists who seek to understand the impacts of human activities on riverine fish biodiversity and to model and predict how fish communities will respond to future environmental change. Together, we hope it will promote advances in macroecological research in the freshwater realm.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Forest Foundation  cNC Division of Water Quality  cZ.

The nanometer-sized helical structures that make up such a material are formed by introducing periodic SDs in graphite or it's associated boron nitride hybrids. The system behaves as a collection of individual, closely packed nano-solenoids, which generate magnetic field when a current flows through them. Systems based solely on carbon or hybrid carbon–boron nitride are analyzed comparatively, assessing their stability and potential in generating strong magnetic fields. Our results show that the magnetic field produced by HG structures is not only tunable but may also surpass the typical values obtained in rare-earth magnets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron nitride 3agraphene 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3arare earth elements1 aNemnes, G.

Moreover, adsorbed Gly coating induces metal-insulator transition and concomitantly increases the solar absorbance of pristine graphene more than three times.

The differences can be attributed to the disturbance induced by T1 construction. Based upon closed-form plasticity solutions for an unloading cylindrical cavity, this study employs subsurface settlement troughs to determine the shear modulus change during twin-tunnelling. Observations of 1 g model tests for twin-tunnelling in overconsolidated kaolin clay are interpreted from literature. After T1 construction, for positions with different radial distances but a constant angle with respect to the vertical line above the tunnel center, the graph of radial displacement/tunnel radius versus tunnel radius/radial distance exhibits good linearity. Further analyses demonstrate that the shear stiffness decreases as the angle increases. In comparison, during T2 construction, the shear modulus of soils close to T1 degrades, while the other side increases. In light of the observations of combined axial–torsional tests, the tendency of shear modulus change can be attributed to the rotation of principal stress axes. The findings can explain the differential settlements over closely spaced twin tunnels in clayey ground.  aPublisher supplied data  a41807512cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51878267cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51938005cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aclay 3akaolin 3amodulus of elasticity 3aplasticity1 aChen, Ren-peng1 aWu, Huai-na1 aCheng, Hong-zhan0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2020 July, v. 79, no. 13 p.326-326dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09087-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011800167300001600285520131200301592002801613596006001641596006001701650000801761650001201769650001101781650001701792650001601809650001601825650002501841650000701866650001401873650003001887650001401917650001801931650001401949650002201963650002001985650001602005650001202021651001602033700001902049773010902068856008202177852000902259655001202268IND60555725520221122022527.0181129e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055572552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-016-1103-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Seonghyeon10aOceanisphaera aquimarina sp. nov., Isolated from Oil-Contaminated Sediment of Ocean Coastal Area from South Korea  ap. 618-623.  aStrain S33ᵀ was isolated from oil-contaminated sediment of Tae-an coastal region of South Korea. Cells are aerobic, motile, Gram staining-negative, and coccoid shaped. Strain S33ᵀ grew optimally at the temperature of 25 °C (range of 4–40 °C), pH 6.0 (range of pH 6.0–10.0), and in the presence of 1 % (w/v) NaCl (range of 0–10 %). Ubiquinone-8 was the predominant respiratory quinone. C₁₆:₀, summed feature 3 (comprising C₁₆:₁ω7c/C₁₆:₁ω6c) and C₁₈:₁ω7c were the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and diphosphatidylglycerol. Strain S33ᵀ showed the ability to degrade benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene after 3 days incubation. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the strain S33ᵀ was most closely related to Oceanisphaera sediminis TW92ᵀ (97.3 %), Oceanisphaera profunda SM1222ᵀ (97.2 %), and Oceanisphaera ostreae T-w6ᵀ (97.1 %) and <97 % with other members of the genus Oceanisphaera. The genomic DNA G+C mol% content of strain S33ᵀ was 51.0 mol%. Based on distinct phenotypic, genotypic, and phylogenetic analysis, strain S33ᵀ was proposed to represent a novel species in the genus Oceanisphaera as Oceanisphaera aquimarina sp. nov.

However, the mechanisms of the associated neuroinvasion are still debated. To determine potential sites for prion neuroinvasion inside the ovine pharyngeal tonsil, the topography of heavy (200 kDa) and light (70 kDa) neurofilaments and of glial fibrillar acidic protein has been semi-quantitatively analysed inside the various compartments of the tonsil. The results show that the most innervated areas are the interfollicular area and the connective tissue located beneath the respiratory epithelium. The existence of rare synapses between follicular dendritic cells and nerve fibres inside the germinal centre indicates that this mechanism of neuroinvasion is possible but, since germinal centres of lymphoid follicles are poorly innervated, other routes of neuroinvasion are likely. The host PRNP genotype does not influence the pattern of innervation in these various tonsil compartments, unlike ageing during which an increase of nerve endings occurs in a zone of high trafficking cells beneath the respiratory epithelium. A minimal age-related increase of innervation inside the lymphoid follicles has also been observed. An increase in nerve fibre density around the lymphoid follicles, in an area rich in mobile cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells capable of capturing and conveying pathogen prion protein (PrPd), might ensure more efficient infectivity, not in the early phase but in the advanced phase of lymphoinvasion after the amplification of PrPd; alternatively, this area might even act as a direct site of entry during neuroinvasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3adendritic cells 3agenotype 3ainnervation 3amacrophages 3anerve endings 3anerve fibers 3anerve tissue 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aprions 3arespiratory mucosa 3asheep 3atonsils 3atopography 2aAdenoidsximmunologyxinnervation. 2aAgingxpathology 2aAnimals 2aCryoultramicrotomy 2aDendritic Cells, Follicularximmunologyxpathology. 2aGenotype 2aGerminal Centerxmetabolismxpathology. 2aGlial Fibrillary Acidic Proteinxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aNerve Fibersxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNervous Systemximmunologyxpathology. 2aNeurofilament Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPrionsxmetabolism 2aScrapieximmunologyxpathology. 2aSheep, Domesticximmunology1 aPiret, Joelle1 aKirschvink, Nathalie1 aLantier, Frederic1 aLantier, Isabelle1 aBerthon, Patricia1 aDaube, Georges1 aMassart, Laurent1 aGrobet, Luc1 aAntoine, Nadine0 tCell and tissue research.g2012 Apr., v. 348, no. 1 p.167-176dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1376-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01779naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014100158300001600299520087300315592002801188650001101216650001401227650002001241650001901261650001301280700002001293773009301313856007401406852000901480655001201489IND60480297920221119171748.0160126e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048029792DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.278912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrappitz, Tim10aComparative study on post‐polymerization modification of C1 poly(benzyl 2‐ylidene‐acetate) and its C2 analog poly(benzyl acrylate)  ap. 686-691.  aThe present study investigates the challenging approach of post‐polymerization modification on polymers with a sterically demanding reaction center. Therefore, the general possibility to functionalize polymethylene moieties was investigated. Poly(benzyl 2‐ylidene‐acetate) was synthesized by polymerization of benzyl 2‐diazoacetate utilizing [(L‐prolinate)Rhᴵ(1,5‐dimethyl‐1,5‐cyclooctadiene)] as a catalyst. Subsequently, the modification of C1 polymerized poly(benzyl 2‐ylidene‐acetate) with amines was analyzed and the obtained data set was compared with experimental data derived for the C2 analog poly(benzyl acrylate). This is the first study on post‐polymerization modification utilizing densely functionalized polymethylenes as starting materials. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

The distribution and size of Au nanoparticles on the surface of WO₃ cross-linked nanodomes are controlled by varying the thickness of the initial Au film. The responses of Au-decorated WO₃ cross-linked nanodomes to various gases such as NO₂, CH₃COCH₃, C₂H₅OH, NH₃, CO, H₂, and C₆H₆ are at least 5 times higher than those of bare WO₃ cross-linked nanodomes. The response enhancement by Au decoration is dependent on the target gas, which is attributed to an interplay between electronic and chemical sensitizations. In particular, the Au-decorated WO₃ cross-linked nanodomes exhibit extremely high sensitivities and selectivities, and ppt-level detection limits to NO₂ and C₂H₅OH at 250 °C and 450 °C, respectively. These results suggest that Au-decorated WO₃ cross-linked nanodomes are very promising for use in breath analysers to diagnose both asthma and lung cancer from exhaled human breath.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aasthma 3acarbon monoxide 3acrosslinking 3adetection limit 3aethanol 3agases 3agold 3ahydrogen 3alung neoplasms 3ananogold 3anitrogen dioxide 3apolystyrenes 3atungsten oxide1 aMoon, Hi Gyu1 aKim, Do-Hong,1 aZhang, Lihua1 aYun, Sŏk-chin,1 aYoon, Young Soo1 aKang, Chong-Yun1 aJang, Ho Won0 tRSC advances.g2013 June 10, v. 3, no. 26 p.10452-10459dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra41331d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007300169300001800242520086800260592002801128650002501156650001501181650002301196650002301219650003601242650001101278650001201289650001101301650001601312650003501328650002701363650001101390653002501401653002601426653002101452653002301473653002901496700001901525700001801544700001801562700001901580700002101599700001601620700001901636700001601655773008001671856008101751852000901832655001201841IND60565720020221120150743.0170710e20170511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056572002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2017.03.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiep, Nguyen Tuan10aNeuroprotective constituents from the fruits of Maclura tricuspidata  ap. 2747-2759.  aCudraisoflavone L − T (1–11), cudradihydrochalcone A (12), and cudrabibenzyl A (13), together with 41 known constituents, were isolated from the fruits of Maclura tricuspidata (formerly known as Cudrania tricuspidata).

The water they provide is the basis for the existence and sustainable socioeconomic development of those oases. As a result of unsustainable use of the water conservation forest until the 1980s, the oasis ecosystems of the Hexi region were seriously damaged, and the oasis areas experienced deterioration of their ecological environment. In this paper, Landsat images were used to monitor the temporal and spatial changes in area of water conservation in Qilian Mountains of Chinaâs Gansu province and to assess the effect on water conservation by analyzed relationship between water conservation forest area, climatic data and hydrological data. The results showed that the forest covered 15.1% of the study area in 2007 and has followed different trends during the study period. From 1978 to 1990, the forest area decreased; however, from 1990 to 2007, the forest area increased, with a faster rate of increase from 1990 to 2000, and the rate of increase averaged 2,733.89Â ha per year since 1990. The water conservation forest appears to play an important role in flood control, runoff regulation, the prevention of soil erosion, and water conservation; and these benefits increase with an increasing area of forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aecosystems 3aflood control 3aforests 3ahydrologic data 3amountains 3aoases 3arunoff 3asocioeconomic development 3asoil erosion 3awater conservation 3aChina1 aYan, Changzhen1 aXie, Jiali1 aLi, Sen0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2012 Aug., v. 66, no. 8 p.2441-2448dSpringer-Verlagx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-1468-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012900158300002000287520089300307592002801200650001501228650002101243650001401264650002301278650001101301650002501312650001301337650001301350650001801363650001301381650001101394700001801405700001901423700001801442700001301460700001701473700001701490773012301507856007401630852000901704655001201713IND60664505920221121054957.0190912e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066450592DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra41335g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Haiqiang10aVapor-phase hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate over a CNTs–Cu–SiO₂ hybrid catalyst with enhanced activity and stability  ap. 11782-11789.  aHybrids containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted considerable attention in heterogeneous catalysis. In this study, a CNTs–Cu–SiO₂ hybrid fabricated by urea-assisted gelation is disclosed to display excellent activity and outstanding long-term stability in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO). Appropriate hybridization of CNTs with Cu–SiO₂ results in enhanced Cu dispersion, which is suggested to be one of the key factors in determining the catalytic performance of copper catalysts. Furthermore, the growth of Cu nanoparticles (NPs) during the catalyst activation, DMO hydrogenation and severe aging tests is distinctively inhibited by incorporating CNTs into Cu–SiO₂, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic stability. The adsorption and activation of hydrogen on this particular hybrid catalyst are also influenced by the CNTs introduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3agelation 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3aoxalates 3asilica1 aDuan, Xinping1 aZheng, Jianwei1 aZheng, Xinlei1 aHe, Ping1 aYuan, Youzhu1 aYang, Yanhui0 tRSC advances.g2013 July 1, v. 3, no. 29 p.11782-11789dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra41335g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001800285520101100303592002801314650001101342650001501353650001701368650001001385650003801395650001001433650001101443650001701454650001301471650002601484650002301510650001301533700002401546700001901570700002101589700002401610700001801634700002301652700002001675700002001695700002001715773011801735856008101853852000901934655001201943IND60081822220221120210300.0141014e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008182222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-014-7944-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRieger, Martin12aA new ELISA for the quantification of equine procalcitonin in plasma as potential inflammation biomarker in horses  ap. 5507-5512.  aIn human medicine, procalcitonin (PCT) is a very common and well-established biomarker for sepsis. Even though sepsis is also a leading cause of death in foals and adult horses, up to now, no data about the role of equine PCT in septic horses has been available. Based on monoclonal antibodies targeted against human PCT, we report here the development of a sandwich ELISA for the quantification of equine PCT in equine plasma samples. The ELISA was characterized for intra- and interassay variance and a working range from 25 to 1,000 ng mL⁻¹ was defined as within this range; both intra- and interassay variances were below 15 %. The target recovery ranged between 73 and 106 %. The ELISA was used to determine the equine PCT concentration in 24 healthy and 5 septic horses to show the potential for clinical evaluation of equine PCT. Significantly different (P = 0.0006) mean equine PCT concentrations were found for the healthy control group and the sepsis group (47 and 8,450 ng mL⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiomarkers 3ablood plasma 3adeath 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afoals 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amedicine 3amonoclonal antibodies 3asepsis (infection) 3avariance1 aKochleus, Christian1 aTeschner, Dana1 aRascher, Daniela1 aBarton, Ann Kristin1 aGeerlof, Arie1 aKremmer, Elisabeth1 aSchmid, Michael1 aHartmann, Anton1 aGehlen, Heidrun0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 Sept., v. 406, no. 22 p.5507-5512dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-7944-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009500168300001400263500001400277520119200291536010801483592002801591596002001619650001201639650002701651650001001678650001701688650002201705650001301727650001401740650001301754650001801767650002501785650001801810650001101828650001101839653001001850653001101860653001101871653000901882653002001891700001901911700002101930700001601951700001601967700001701983773010202000856008502102852000902187655001202196IND60724106420221122001405.0210120e20201207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072410642DNAL7 a10.1080/07409710.2021.18603222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSupski, Sian14aThe ineffable allure of sugar – Hammer cake, That Sugar Film and contradictory pleasures  ap. 44-65.  aNAL-light  aThis article explores the complicated place of sugar in the display of family connectedness and health in a white, middle class Australian family. In the context of heightened anxiety about childhood obesity, we present the Baker family as a case study to explore the pleasures and tensions that sugar consumption produces in families. On their birthdays, each child has a luxurious “Hammer Cake” coated in chocolate studded with sweets; simultaneously the family members have also been influenced by the documentary That Sugar Film and check the sugar contents on packages as they shop. We analyze how these pleasures and pressures are balanced: how anxieties about sugar are negotiated and managed in food practices and in the making of family through rituals of celebration. We argue that the concept of “contradictory pleasures,” where certain foods are seen as “excess,” but mobilized for celebration, offers a nuanced and valuable framework to illuminate simultaneously negative and positive attitudes toward certain foods in family food practices and how families navigate multiple influences on these practices, including popular culture and public health discourses.  aThis project was funded by the Australian Research Council Discovery Projects scheme (ARC DP160100257).  aPublisher supplied data  aARC DP160100257 3aanxiety 3aattitudes and opinions 3acakes 3acase studies 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3achocolate 3afoodways 3apublic health 3asocioeconomic status 3asugar content 3asugars 3asweets 0aSugar 0afamily 0aritual 0acake 0aThat Sugar Film1 aTanner, Claire1 aMaher, JaneMaree1 aWright, Jan1 aLindsay, Jo1 aLeahy, Deana0 tFood & foodways.g2020 Dec. 7, v. 29, no. 1 p.44-65dRoutledgewJournal:jnl38994x1542-34847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07409710.2021.18603223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011200164300001600276520129100292592002801583650001601611650002201627650001601649650002101665650001901686700002001705700001801725700002101743773009301764856007401857852000901931655001201940IND60480298220221119171603.0160126e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048029822DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.239112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRóżański, Artur,10aPhysical state of the amorphous phase of polypropylene‐influence on free volume and cavitation phenomenon  ap. 531-543.  aModel polypropylene and polypropylene/low molecular weight modifier systems with identical crystalline structure but of different physical state of noncrystalline regions were analyzed. The deformation of reference material was accompanied by a cavitation phenomenon while the deformation of the polypropylene/modifier systems occurred in non‐cavitating manner. Based on X‐ray and PALS measurements the observed change of the intensity of the cavitation phenomenon during the deformation of the analyzed systems was explained. Additionally, the change of interlamellar distance (induced by introducing the modifier molecules and uniaxial stretching) was correlated with the change of average size of the free volume pores of the amorphous phase—this analysis was performed based on experimental data and theoretical estimations. It was proven that the presence of modifier reduce significantly the average size of free volume pores in relation to the system with similar interlamellar distance.

The cytotoxic effect of CuNPs on HepG2 cells was markedly enhanced by the ZnONPs, the largest ZnONPs causing the highest increase in toxicity. However, CuNPs cytotoxicity was not affected by co-incubation with medium containing only zinc ions, indicating the increase in toxicity might be attributed to the particle form of ZnONPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of CuNPs and ZnONPs inside the cells co-exposed to both types of NP and outflow of cytoplasm through the damaged cell membrane. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) determined an increase in the concentration of zinc and a decrease in that of copper in co-exposed cells. On the basis of these results, we propose that accumulation of large numbers of ZnONPs in the cells alters cellular membranes and the cytotoxicity of CuNPs is increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acell membranes 3acopper 3acytoplasm 3acytotoxicity 3ahepatoma 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3aions 3ananoparticles 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aZnONPs 0aCuNPs 0aHepG2 0aPotentiation effect 0aCytotoxicity assays1 aFernández-Cruz, María Luisa1 aConnolly, Mona1 aConde, Estefanía1 aFernández, Marta,1 aSchuster, Michael1 aNavas, José María0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 505 p.253-260dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245015500170300001600325520166800341592002802009650001502037650001402052650001102066650002102077650001502098651001002113653000902123653000802132653000702140653000902147653000702156653000702163653001102170653001202181653001302193653000802206653000802214653000802222653004202230653003002272653002502302653003102327653002902358653002402387700001302411700001302424700001702437700001402454700001402468700001802482700001402500773010502514856008602619852000902705655001202714IND60592776520221119150111.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059277652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jingwen10aAssessing the weighted multi-objective adaptive surrogate model optimization to derive large-scale reservoir operating rules with sensitivity analysis  ap. 613-627.  aThe optimization of large-scale reservoir system is time-consuming due to its intrinsic characteristics of non-commensurable objectives and high dimensionality. One way to solve the problem is to employ an efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm in the derivation of large-scale reservoir operating rules. In this study, the Weighted Multi-Objective Adaptive Surrogate Model Optimization (WMO-ASMO) algorithm is used. It consists of three steps: (1) simplifying the large-scale reservoir operating rules by the aggregation-decomposition model, (2) identifying the most sensitive parameters through multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) for dimensional reduction, and (3) reducing computational cost and speeding the searching process by WMO-ASMO, embedded with weighted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (WNSGAII). The intercomparison of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII), WNSGAII and WMO-ASMO are conducted in the large-scale reservoir system of Xijiang river basin in China. Results indicate that: (1) WNSGAII surpasses NSGAII in the median of annual power generation, increased by 1.03% (from 523.29 to 528.67billionkWh), and the median of ecological index, optimized by 3.87% (from 1.879 to 1.809) with 500 simulations, because of the weighted crowding distance and (2) WMO-ASMO outperforms NSGAII and WNSGAII in terms of better solutions (annual power generation (530.032billionkWh) and ecological index (1.675)) with 1000 simulations and computational time reduced by 25% (from 10h to 8h) with 500 simulations. Therefore, the proposed method is proved to be more efficient and could provide better Pareto frontier.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ahydrology 3amodels 3apower generation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aAGDP 0aCOR 0aSA 0aMARS 0aLH 0aMC 0aNSGAII 0aWNSGAII 0aWMO-ASMO 0aGLP 0aRGS 0aGPR 0aLarge-scale reservoir operating rules 0aAggregation-decomposition 0aSensitivity analysis 0aWeighted crowding distance 0aAdaptive surrogate model 0aXijiang river basin1 aWang, Xu1 aLiu, Pan1 aLei, Xiaohui1 aLi, Zejun1 aGong, Wei1 aDuan, Qingyun1 aWang, Hao0 tJournal of hydrology.g2017 Jan., v. 544 p.613-627dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009100168300001600259520058800275592002800863650001700891650002500908650002100933650001600954650001500970650001300985650001100998650001901009650001801028651001201046700001701058773012101075856008101196852000901277655001201286IND60520689820221118071509.0160522e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052068982DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-012-0033-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelkhiri, Lazhar10aHydrochemical analysis and evaluation of groundwater quality in El Eulma area, Algeria  ap. 127-133.  aThe groundwater sources in the El Elma plain have been evaluated for their chemical composition and suitability for irrigation uses.

Whether or not P. regalis is able to select the sediment ingested by size is the question of this study. For this purpose, a comparison between grain size distributions of the seabed sediments and the digestive contents of sea cucumbers were carried out. We performed the comparisons among sediment distributions through the median diameter D50 and the granulometric dispersion D84∕D16. The results showed that the size of the sediment within the holothurians was significantly smaller and more uniform than the ones in the seabed. Evidence showed that P. regalis select sediment by particle size during feeding, choosing the smaller particles. This finding reports novel information on the feeding behavior of this species, a fishery resource of local interest and importance in the Western Mediterranean region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolothuria 3afeeding behavior 3afisheries 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3asediments 3aMediterranean Sea 3aMediterranean region 0aHolothurian 0aFeeding 0aGrain size selection1 aSimarro, Gonzalo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6420-59751 aGalimany, Eve1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1493-29441 aLleonart i Aliberas, Jordi,0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2019 Sept., v. 31 p.100763-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1007633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001600187245006400203300001800267506007600285520037100361592002800732506003700760650001200797650002500809650002300834650002400857650001100881650002500892700002200917700002400939773012700963856008001090852000901170655001201179IND60117621120221207080527.0141126e20130228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011762112DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00052-122doi7 aPMC35693652pmcid7 a234053612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Binbin10aDraft Genome Sequences of Five Strains in the Genus Thauera  ap. e00052-12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThauera species are members of the betaproteobacteria and are most noted for their ability to metabolize aromatic compounds under anoxic conditions.

The kitten died before treatment could be instituted. On gross and histopathological examination, there was severe interstitial pneumonia and large numbers of A. abstrusus eggs and larvae were present in alveoli, together with fewer adult nematodes in small bronchioles. The mucosa of the small intestine was invaded by large numbers of A. abstrusus larvae.

However, relatively little information is often available with regard to their possible biotic and abiotic transformation products (TPs). This lack of knowledge has resulted in a substantial amount of ongoing effort to develop methods and approaches that would assess their occurrence, degradability potential elimination mechanisms and efficiencies in sewage treatment plants as well as environmental and human health risks. In this article, an extensive literature survey was performed in order to present the current stage of knowledge and progress made in the occurrence of TPs of PPCPs and IDs in raw and treated wastewaters. Apart from the TPs resulting from structural transformations of the parent compound in the aquatic environment or in technological treatment facilities (e.g. sewage and drinking water treatment plants), free metabolites and drug conjugates formed during human metabolism have also been included in this review as they are also released into the aquatic environment through wastewaters. Their concentration levels were reported in influents and effluents of WWTPs, hospital effluents and their removals in the treatment plants were discussed. Finally, information on the toxicity of TPs has been compiled when available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic organisms 3aeffluents 3aenvironmental impact 3ahospitals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aillicit drugs 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3apersonal care products 3arisk 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3awastewater 3awater treatment 0aOH-THC 0a14-OH-COD 0a14-OH-CODN 0aCl2MeP 0aClMeP 0aCBX-IBU 0aCOD 0aE2-3S 0aE1-3S 0aOH-IBU 0aISO-NPN 0aNPN 0aDP 0aDiOH-CBZ 0a10-OH-CBZ 0a10-OH-AMTP 0aTHC-COOH 0a16αOHE1 0aAMDOPH 0aAMPH 0aEDDP 0a2-OH-CBZ 0a2′-OH-IBU 0a2-N-gluc-LMTG 0a3′-OH-COT 0a3′-OH-COT 0a3-OH-CBZ 0a3-OH-DZP 0aPDP 0a4,6-Cl-TCS 0a4-Cl-TCS 0a4-AA 0a4-DAA 0a4′-OH-ACF 0a4-OH-DCF 0a4OHE1 0a4-MAA 0a6-Cl-TCS 0a5-OH-DCF 0a6-AM 0a9ac 0aACD 0aACDN 0aAEC 0aAME 0aBE 0aCBZ-Ep 0aCLF 0aEBE 0aCOT 0aDES-Me-CTL 0aDES-Me-DLZ 0aDES-Me-SER 0aDES-Me-VNF 0aDES-Me-CTL 0aDIC 0aDXN 0aECG 0aEME 0aOH-BBP 0aERY-H2O 0aFEN acid 0aGUA 0aOH-BBP 0aMe-TCS 0aMETR-OH 0aClMeP 0aMOR-3â-d-gluc 0aN-DES-Me-VNF 0a4-FAA 0aN-F-NOR-COT 0aNBE 0aNCO 0aNOR-COD 0aNOR-FLX 0aNOR-LSD 0aNOR-MOR 0aNOR-TRP 0aNOR-VRP 0ao-DES-Me-VNF 0ao-OH-ATV 0aOSL-CAR 0aOXZ 0aOXC 0ap-OH-ATV 0aRLT acid 0aSA 0aSMV hydroxy acid 0aTransformation products 0aPPCPs 0aIllicit drugs 0aOccurrence 0aRemoval 0aWastewaters1 aKonstantinou, Ioannis K.1 aLambropoulou, Dimitra A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 505 p.905-926dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002800148245014600176300001600322520255600338592002802894650002002922650001602942650001702958650001802975650000902993650001703002650001303019650002503032650001503057650002603072650002603098650001603124650001403140650001503154650001103169650001903180650002103199650003303220650001003253700001803263700001903281773010503300856008403405852000903489655001203498IND4447623820221120074129.0141111e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444762382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2010.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrbanek Krajnc, Andreja10aApplication of salicylic acid induces antioxidant defense responses in the phloem of Picea abies and inhibits colonization by Ips typographus  ap. 416-426.  aThe adaptive plasticity of Norway spruce (Picea abies) against attack by Ips typographus depends on systemic acquired resistance which involves salicylic acid (SA), and an antioxidant system both recognized as valuable stress markers in ecophysiological studies. In the presented field experiment, 100mM SA was applied to the bark sections of Norway spruce prior to being attacked by bark beetles, in order to study interactions with antioxidants and its significance for mediating stress-tolerance under natural conditions. SA-treatments significantly elevated the total SA levels over the whole sampling period. Total glutathione (tGSH) and total cysteine (tCys) increased by 167% and 80%, respectively, two weeks after treatment, in comparison with controls. In contrast, SA-treatment caused an initial deterioration in total ascorbic acid (tASC) and enhanced the percentage of dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), but activated tASC levels over later sampling dates. The initial bark beetle attack was characterized by a significant decline in total SA levels, which was accompanied by a transient degradation and oxidation of their ascorbate-glutathione system. This initial reaction was significantly alleviated by SA-application and characterized by 175% higher tGSH contents, when compared to moderately-affected untreated trees. One month after pheromone dispensers were placed on trees, an intensification of ascorbate-glutathione system occurred within moderately-affected bark, but to a greater extent after SA-treatment. Total SA levels within SA-treated moderately-affected trees remained at the control level until June. In contrast, strong attack was characterized by a successive increase in total SA up to 252% following SA-treatment in June, whereas a 110% increase of SA was determined within severely affected control-bark. A strong attack was further characterized by a degradation of tGSH and total phenolics (tPH), a moderate increase in tASC and an oxidation of the ascorbate-glutathione pool within untreated bark. In the SA-treated trees the redox state was unaffected by severe colonization and the degradation of antioxidants was significantly alleviated. In addition, SA-treated bark had significantly less entrance holes and exhibited fewer and shorter maternal galleries than control-bark. From this perspective, exogenous SA was successfully implicated as an activator of systemic acquired resistance in Norway spruce, providing tolerance against the complex interactive effects of bark beetle attack and environmental factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIps typographus 3aPicea abies 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abark 3abark beetles 3acysteine 3adehydroascorbic acid 3adispensers 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3aglutathione 3aoxidation 3apheromones 3aphloem 3asalicylic acid 3astress tolerance 3asystemic acquired resistance 3atrees1 aKristl, Janja1 aIvancic, Anton0 tForest ecology and management.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 261, no. 3 p.416-426dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2010.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009200164300001600256520155500272592002801827650001901855650001801874650000901892650001101901650001401912650001401926650003101940650001301971650001301984650001901997650002102016650001702037650002402054650001502078653001002093653001402103653000902117653001202126653000802138653000702146653001002153653002302163653001302186653002302199653001702222700001902239700001202258700001602270700001902286773007502305856008202380852000902462655001202471IND60552415220221121025846.0161021e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055241522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2014.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Runrun10aDifferentiated expression of microRNAs may regulate genotype-dependent traits in cotton  ap. 233-238.  amiRNA is an exogenous non-coding RNA with 21–24nt in length, which plays a crucial role in almost all biological processes. In plants, miRNAs regulate organ development, phase change, signal transduction and response to different biotic and abiotic stresses at the post-transcriptional levels. Although there are many studies on plant miRNAs, no studies have been focused on the genotype dependence. Genotype-dependent traits may be controlled by the differential expression of certain miRNAs. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the expression profile patterns of 11 selected miRNAs in 5 different organs in 5 different cotton cultivars and their implication on plant development. Our results demonstrate that miRNAs have different expression patterns in different plant organs in different genotypes, which implicate their different traits, including early flowering. miR172 is a miRNA controlling floral development and phase change; our results show that miR172 has a higher expression level in the flower bud than in any other organ, our results also show that Baimian cultivars have a higher expression of miR172 than TM-1. This suggests that Baimian cultivars have an earlier transition from vegetable growth to reproductive growth, which is confirmed by our development data on floral branch development. Our result also shows that several miRNAs, including miR159 and miR162, were highly expressed in Baimian cultivars. The results obtained in this study would provide new insight for improving cotton using miRNA-based biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3abiotechnology 3abuds 3acotton 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agene expression regulation 3agenotype 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aphase transition 3aplant organs 3asignal transduction 3avegetables 0amiRNA 0apre-miRNA 0aRISC 0aqRT-PCR 0aSBP 0aFM 0amiRNA 0aExpression profile 0aGenotype 0aFloral development 0aPhage change1 aWang, Qinglian1 aMa, Jun1 aHe, Qiuling1 aZhang, Baohong0 tGene.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 547 p.233-238dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.06.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100002400185245011000209300001400319500001500333520168100348592002802029650001302057650002202070650001902092650002002111650001702131650003102148650001602179650001402195650001402209650001902223650003502242650003602277650002102313650003202334650001302366650002002379650000902399650002202408650002002430650001802450650001102468650002602479650001702505653002302522653001702545653001802562653001802580653002802598653002202626653001902648700002602667700002402693700002402717773012102741856008102862852000902943655001202952IND60602169220221120172706.0180709e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060216922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.01.0242doi7 a10.1016/j.abb.2015.01.0242chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContreras, Telma C.10a(−)-Epicatechin in the prevention of tumor necrosis alpha-induced loss of Caco-2 cell barrier integrity  ap. 84-91.  a2019-12-06  aAn increased permeability of the intestinal barrier is proposed as a major event in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Tumor necrosis alpha (TNFα) plays a central role in IBD pathogenesis, in part promoting tight function (TJ) barrier dysfunction. Food extracts enriched in (−)-epicatechin (EC) prevent the development or improve the progression of IBD in animal models. This study investigated the capacity of EC to inhibit TNFα-induced permeabilization of Caco-2 cell monolayers, characterizing the underlying mechanisms. Caco-2 cells differentiated into intestinal epithelial cells were incubated in the absence/presence of TNFα, with or without the addition of 0.5–5μM EC. TNFα triggered cell monolayer permeabilization, decreasing transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and increasing the paracellular transport of fluorescein sulfonic acid. The permeabilizing effects of TNFα were not due to Caco-2 cell apoptosis as evaluated by DNA fragmentation, caspase 3 and 9 activation, and cell morphology. EC prevented TNFα-triggered Caco-2 monolayer permeabilization and acted inhibiting the associated: (i) NADPH oxidase (NOX)-mediated increased oxidant production, (ii) NF-κB (IκBα phosphorylation, p50 and RelA nuclear transport, and nuclear NF-κB-DNA binding) and ERK1/2 activation, (iii) increased myosin light kinase expression, and decreased TJ protein ZO-1 levels. In summary, EC prevented TNFα-mediated Caco-2 cell barrier permeabilization in part through the inhibition of NOX/NF-κB activation and downstream TJ disruption. Diets rich in EC could contribute to ameliorate IBD-associated increased intestinal permeability.  aPublisher supplied data 3anecrosis 3aintestinal mucosa 3asulfonic acids 3aphosphorylation 3apathogenesis 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3afluorescein 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3aIKappaB kinase 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3ahuman cell lines 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aoxidants 3apathophysiology 3adiet 3aDNA fragmentation 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aanimal models 3amyosin 3aelectrical resistance 3apermeability 0aIntestinal barrier 0aInflammation 0aNADPH oxidase 0asulfonic acid 0aIntestinal permeability 0a(−)-Epicatechin 0aTight junction1 aRicciardi, Elisabetta1 aCremonini, Eleonora1 aOteiza, Patricia I.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2015 May 01, v. 573 p.84-91dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2015.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012800167300001600295520129200311592002801603650001401631650001601645650001901661650000901680650002601689650001101715650000901726650001101735650001101746650001301757650000901770650003701779650002401816650001301840650001801853650001901871650001401890650002101904653001501925653001501940653001901955653002701974700001702001700001402018700001602032700001502048700001902063700001702082773010802099856005102207852000902258655001202267IND50075849520221120032936.0140410e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007584952DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2010.5313922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzoyem, J.P.10aPhytotoxic, antifungal activities and acute toxicity studies of the crude extract and compounds from Diospyros canaliculata  ap. 741-749.  aIn vitro biological activities including phytotoxic, antifungal activities as well as acute toxicity of the methanol extract, fractions and/or isolated compounds from the stem bark of Diospyros canaliculata were investigated. Well agar diffusion and macrodilution assays were used for investigating the antifungal activity. A phytotoxicity assay was performed against Lemna minor while an acute toxicity assay was performed in mice via oral administration. As a result, plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphtoquinone) and two known pentacyclic triterpenes (lupeol and lupenone) were isolated from the extract. With regards the antifungal activities, the inhibition zones varied from 16.51 to 24.86 mm and from 20.50 to 25.10 mm for the extract and plumbagin, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the extract and plumbagin ranged between 12.5–25 and 0.78–1.56 µg mL⁻¹, respectively. At 50 µg mL⁻¹, the hexane fraction showed phytotoxic activities similar to paraquat, the standard phytotoxic inhibitor. The extract was found to be non-toxic to mice after administration per os. Based on the current findings, we can conclude that this extract is non toxic, with significant phytotoxic and antifungal properties due to the presence of plumbagin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiospyros 3aLemna minor 3aacute toxicity 3aagar 3aantifungal properties 3aassays 3abark 3ahexane 3alupeol 3amethanol 3amice 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoral administration 3aparaquat 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant extracts 3aplumbagin 3atoxicity testing 0aphytotoxic 0aantifungal 0aacute toxicity 0aDiospyros canaliculata1 aKechia, F.A.1 aKuete, V.1 aPieme, A.C.1 aAkak, C.M.1 aTangmouo, J.G.1 aLohoue, P.J.0 tNatural product research.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 25, no. 7 p.741-749dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2010.531392  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012900175300001600304520152200320592002801842650002501870650001101895650001101906650001301917650001101930650001401941650002301955650001801978650001101996650001402007650002502021651001102046653001302057653002002070653001402090653001402104653002002118653002702138700001702165773011302182856008602295852000902381655001202390IND60607353320221119232527.0180831e20160120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060735332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnuaguluchi, Obinna10aReusing copper tailings in concrete: corrosion performance and socioeconomic implications for the Lefke-Xeros area of Cyprus  ap. 420-429.  aCopper mining and processing activities at an abandoned mine in the Lefke-Xeros area of Cyprus have created a huge environmental contamination problem in the locality. As an alternative mitigation and management measure, we reported in previous studies that these tailings could be used as a concrete making material. In this paper, results of an experimental investigation of the reinforcement corrosion performance and cost efficiency of 0.57 and 0.50 w/b ratio concrete containing copper tailings either as a cement replacement or an additive material are presented. The time to initiation of corrosion and half-cell potential (HCP) of reinforcements were measured. Actual corrosion status of extracted reinforcement bars was also verified by visual inspection. Results showed that while early corrosion initiation occurred in some samples containing tailings as a cement replacement material, delayed corrosion initiation was observed in all samples containing copper tailings as an additive. Although HCP values became slightly more electronegative as tailings content of samples increased, no substantial reinforcement corrosion was observed. Based on corrosion performance and cost efficiency analyses, utilization of 5% pre-wetted tailings either as a cement replacement or an additive material is the best tailings reuse approach. Increased tourism-related businesses associated with reduced pollution of the Lefke-Xeros coastal area would have a positive impact on the socioeconomic status of the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acement 3acoasts 3aconcrete 3acopper 3acorrosion 3acost effectiveness 3amine tailings 3amining 3apollution 3asocioeconomic status 3aCyprus 0aConcrete 0aCopper tailings 0aRecycling 0aCorrosion 0aCost efficiency 0aSocioeconomic benefits1 aEren, Özgur0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2016 Jan. 20, v. 112 p.420-429dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.09.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03893naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245011100162300001300273500002000286520237800306592002802684650002002712650002002732650001802752650001002770650002202780650001202802650001002814650001902824650001002843650001402853650001502867650001602882650001902898650001502917650001702932650001802949650002302967651001502990700001803005700001703023700002403040700002503064700001903089700003903108700001903147773009203166856007203258961001203330852000903342655001203351IND60571236220221118232439.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057123622DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.15772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStavros, E. Natasha10aUnprecedented remote sensing data over King and Rim megafires in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California  ap. 3244.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMegafires have lasting social, ecological, and economic impacts and are increasing in the western contiguous United States. Because of their infrequent nature, there is a limited sample of megafires to investigate their unique behavior, drivers, and relationship to forest management practices. One approach is to characterize critical information pre‐, during, and post‐fire using remote sensing. In August 2013, the Rim Fire burned 104,131 ha and in September 2014, the King Fire burned 39,545 ha. Both fires occurred in California's Sierra Nevada. The areas burned by these fires were fortuitously surveyed by airborne campaigns, which provided the most recent remote sensing technologies not currently available from satellite. Technologies include an imaging spectrometer spanning the visible to shortwave infrared (0.38–2.5 μm), a multispectral, high‐spatial resolution thermal infrared (3.5–13 μm) spectroradiometer, and Light Detection and Ranging that provide spatial resolutions of pixels from 1 × 1 m to 35 × 35 m. Because of the unique information inherently derived from these technologies before the fires, the areas were subsequently surveyed after the fires. We processed and provide free dissemination of these airborne datasets as products of surface reflectance, spectral metrics and forest structural metrics (http://dx.doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1288). These data products provide a unique opportunity to study relationships among and between remote sensing observations and fuel and fire characteristics (e.g., fuel type, condition, structure, and fire severity). The novelty of these data is not only in the unprecedented types of information available from them before, during, and after two megafires, but also in the synergistic use of multiple state of the art technologies for characterizing the environment. The synergy of these data can provide novel information that can improve maps of fuel type, structure, abundance, and condition that may improve predictions of megafire behavior and effects, thus aiding management before, during, and after such events. Key questions that these data could address include: What drives, extinguishes, and results from megafires? How does megafire behavior relate to fire and fuel management? How does the size and severity of a megafire affect the ecological recovery of the system?  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aeconomic impact 3afire severity 3afires 3aforest management 3aforests 3afuels 3aimage analysis 3alidar 3amountains 3aprediction 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspatial data 3aspectrometers 3aspectroradiometers 3aCalifornia1 aTane, Zachary1 aKane, Van R.1 aVeraverbeke, Sander1 aMcGaughey, Robert J.1 aLutz, James A.1 aRamirez Villamarin, Carlos Andres,1 aSchimel, David0 tEcology.g2016 Nov., v. 97, no. 11 p.3244-3244dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.15773Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245016700163300001800330500001900348520157100367592002801938650004401966650001602010650002102026650001402047650002802061650002102089650001502110650001102125650003702136650001502173650001902188650003702207650001602244700001602260700001602276700005702292773011202349856008302461852000902544655001202553IND60700413820221120225029.0210213e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070041382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-020-03199-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiajia, Wu10aFabrication of flexible polyindole/carbon nanotube/bacterial cellulose nanofiber nonwoven electrode doped by D-tartaric acid with high electrochemical performance  ap. 6353-6366.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe flexible polyindole/carbon nanotube/bacterial cellulose (PIn/CNT/BC) nanofiber nonwoven electrode is prepared by a two-step method combination of ‘electrospinning and electrospray’ process and potentiostatic polymerization.

To evaluate the electrochemical properties of PIn/CNT/BC electrode, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests are performed. The unique structure ensures that the flexible PIn/CNT/BC nanofiber nonwoven electrode exhibits larger specific capacitance up to 552.6 F g⁻¹, longer operation life with 95.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, better conductivity with a fitting value of charge-transfer resistance of 9.87 Ω, outstanding flexibility and stability with specific capacitance retention over 96.4% after 1500 bending cycles. The remarkable electrochemical performance of PIn/CNT/BC nanofiber nonwoven electrode offer promising applications as flexible energy storage device for wearable and smart electronic components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acapacitance 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ananofibers 3apolymerization 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avoltammetry1 aZhanwen, Du1 aPing, Xiong1 aZhijiang, Cai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3290-04520 tCellulose.g2020 July, v. 27, no. 11 p.6353-6366dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-03199-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008800164300001600252520060100268592002800869650003900897650001500936650002100951650001100972650001600983650000900999650004401008650001401052653002701066653001301093653002901106653002601135653001101161700002001172700001701192700002001209700001801229700001401247700001801261700001501279700001601294700002101310700001501331700001701346700002101363700001701384700001601401700001201417700001501429700001701444773010801461856008501569852000901654655001201663IND60544309420221119135414.0190415e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054430942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2015.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Long10aPhenylethanoid and secoiridoid glycosides from the leaves of Ligustrum purpurascens  ap. 177-181.  aA new phenylethanoid glycoside (2) and a new secoiridoid glycoside (16) were isolated from the leaves of Ligustrum purpurascens together with fourteen known compounds (1 and 3–15).

Work focuses on quantum dots capped by hexadecylamine and trioctylphosphine oxide with no ligand exchange or other intermediate processing steps involved. The polymers studied include poly(methyl–methacrylate) (PMMA), polystyrene and acrylic polymers incorporating long alkyl chains, which are expected to promote the compatibility of the quantum dot ligands to that of the polymer chains. In this approach, the variation of photoluminescence properties of the nanocomposite thin films is measured versus increased concentration of the quantum dots, so as to evaluate the suitability of each polymer structure as an efficient host. Furthermore, the refractive index of the quantum dots/polymer nanocomposite thin films are also estimated using white light reflectance spectroscopy data, as appropriate for the integration of photonic devices. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An experimental study is performed to analyze the influence of distinct parameters of the hindrance promoters on heat transfer and friction factor in SWH. The distinct parameters of the upstream delta-winglets imposed on both sides of the copper strip inserted into the absorber tube, are pitch ratio (PRd) the blockage ratio (BRd), angle of attack (αw) and spacer length (Sw). The PRd varies as 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0, the BRd varies as 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.25, αw varies as 15°, 30°, 45° and 60°, Sw varies as 0, 200, 400 and 600 mm and Reynolds number (Re) ranges from 200 to 1800. The experimental outcomes show that hindrance promoter with parameter PRd=0.5, BRd=0.2, αw= and Sw=0mm affect Nuw and fw substantially. The improvement obtained in Nusselt number (Nuw) is 4.56 times higher than smooth tube. The thermo-hydraulic performance (ηw) of 2.62 is obtained using hindrance promoter having parameters PRd=0.5, BRd=0.2, αw= and Sw=0mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3afriction 3aheat transfer 3asolar heaters 0aSolar water heater 0aUpstream delta winglet 0aNusselt number 0aFriction factor 0aThermo hydraulic performance1 aKumar, Sushil1 aKumar, Raj0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Jan., v. 163 p.1356-1369dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.08.1463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011900170300001600289520118100305592002801486650001001514650001401524650001101538650002501549650002201574650001801596650001601614653002801630653001401658653002501672653003201697653001701729700002301746700002801769700002401797773012101821856008101942852000902023655001202032IND60592776720221119150002.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059277672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2017.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSisay, Mulugeta T.10aResidence time distribution and flow pattern of reduced-gluten wheat-based formulations in a twin–screw extruder  ap. 213-222.  aResidence time distribution (RTD) and flow pattern in a co-rotating twin screw extruder were evaluated using a color tracer method. A reduced-gluten formulation was prepared by mixing wheat flour, sesame protein concentrates and Tef flour in the proportion of 50:20:30, respectively. The effects of screw speed (150, 180 and 220 rpm), feed moisture content (17, 19 and 21 g/100 g wet basis) and feed rate (40 and 90 g/min) on RTD and flow pattern were investigated. All tested conditions were found to have a significant (P < 0.05) effect on the mean residence time and other RTD parameters. Higher screw speed, higher moisture content and higher feed rate resulted in shorter mean residence times and lower RTD spread due to enhanced barrel fill, mass flow rate and system pressure. A dispersion number was used to define the level of axial mixing in the extruder and, as defined, the axial mixing was more influenced by the feed rate than screw speed.

It was shown that the balance between the π–π stacking of the P3HT and microphase separation of the copolymer could be dynamically controlled and shifted by solvent blending. Depending on the mixed solvent ratio (i.e., chloroform/methanol, anisole/chloroform, or anisole/methanol), the copolymer chains experienced different kinetic pathways, yielding a series of nanostructures such as disordered wormlike pattern, densely packed nanofibrils, and isolated nanofibrils. With the varying solvent selectivity, the P3HT‐b‐PEO chains displayed a hybrid photophysical property depending on the competition between intrachain and interchain excitonic coupling, resulting in the transformation between J‐ and H‐aggregation. Overall, this work offered an effective way to demonstrate the correlation and transformation between π–π stacking of P3HT and microphase separation, and how the conformation of P3HT chains influenced the photophysical properties of the copolymer during solvent blending. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The maintenance dredging, carried out to keep navigational channel navigable, incurs a high annual cost. In this study, an attempt has been made to simulate the annual morphological changes that occur within Mumbai port limits, using a process-based hydrodynamic and morphological model, developed using Delft3D numerical scheme. The tidal levels and currents of the numerical model are validated with in-situ measurements, carried out at three different locations near the main navigational channel. Adopting the concepts of the morphological tide and acceleration techniques, a total quantity of siltation of more than 3.98 Million m3 is estimated to be deposited annually in the main navigation channel, if no dredging is carried out. The modeling results also revealed that a siltation rate up to 1 m/year is observed in the harbor basin and entrance channel to the docks. It is demonstrated that the developed numerical model can qualitatively capture the morphological trends near Mumbai Port region.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3adredging 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3astreams 3aIndia 0aMumbai harbor 0aSiltation 0aMorfac 0aMorphological tide 0aNavigation channel 0aMorphodynamic1 aPratap Singh, Niraj1 aJeyaraj, Satheeshkumar0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2019 Sept., v. 31 p.100765-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1007653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245012200213300001800335520150600353592002801859650001501887650001001902650001401912650001101926650001601937700002001953700006501973773010702038856008202145852000902227655001202236IND60646297020221119032355.0190606e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064629702DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-10-18-1718-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Ponte, Emerson M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4398-409X10aEvaluation of App-Embedded Disease Scales for Aiding Visual Severity Estimation of Cercospora Leaf Spot of Table Beet  ap. 1347-1356.  aTwo diagrammatic ordinal scales are available in the Estimate app (2017 version) for Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) severity on table beet: 10% linear (linear-based diagrammatic scale [LIN]) and logarithmic based (Horsfall–Barratt [HB]). These allow for estimating severity data of four types depending on the system used. A group of 30 raters assigned percentage severity on 30 photographs of diseased table beet leaves during five rounds first without an aid and then using each of the four rating systems in Estimate. In two, the perceived ordinal score of the HB or LIN scale was assigned where severity of the subject fit best. HB2 and LIN2 involved a second choice of unitary severity within the perceived score interval. There was large variation in unaided ability of raters to estimate severity: 13% were accurate (Lin’s concordance correlation [LCC] > 0.9), 23% were inaccurate (LCC < 0.7), and the remaining had moderate accuracy. Larger disparities between assigned and actual ordinal scores (mostly overestimates) occurred using the LIN compared with the HB. The LIN2 produced the most accurate estimates (Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, ρc = 0.96; generalized bias parameter, Cb = 0.99; Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.95) and the greatest interrater reliability (overall concordance correlation coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.93). The two-step process using the 10% linear scale is recommended for severity estimates of CLS in table beet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercospora 3abeets 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3aphotographs1 aNelson, Scot C.1 aPethybridge, Sarah J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3864-42930 tPlant disease.g2019 June, v. 103, no. 6 p.1347-1356dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-18-1718-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013400162300001600296520203300312592002802345650002502373650002702398650002302425650002302448650002002471650001202491650002402503650002802527650001202555650001802567650001002585650001702595650002202612650001902634650001302653650001102666651001102677700001502688700001602703773009702719856008102816852000902897655001202906IND60080159120221120232834.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008015912DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-014-0219-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, M D10aCommunities of Social Bees (Apidae: Meliponini) in Trap-Nests: the Spatial Dynamics of Reproduction in an Area of Atlantic Forest  ap. 307-313.  aAs most stingless bee species depend on preexisting cavities, principally tree hollows, nesting site availability may represent an important restriction in the structuring of their forest communities. The present study examined the spatial dynamics of stingless bee communities in an area of Atlantic Forest by evaluating their swarming to trap-nests. The field work was performed in the Michelin Ecological Reserve (MER) on the southeastern coast of the state of Bahia, Brazil. Seven hundred and twenty trap-nests were distributed within two forest habitats in advanced and initial stages of regeneration. The trap-nests were monitored between September 2009 and March 2011. Twenty-five trap-nests were occupied by five bee species, resulting in a capture ratio of 0.035 swarms/trap (approximately 0.14 swarms/ha), corresponding to 10 swarms/year (0.056 swarms/ha/year). According to previous study at MER, the most abundant species in natural nests were also the most common in trap-nests in the two forest habitats examined, with the exception of Melipona scutellaris Latreille. Swarms of higher numbers of species were captured in initial regeneration stage forests than in advanced regeneration stage areas, and differences in species compositions were significant between both habitats (p = 0.03); these apparent differences were not consistent, however, when considering richness (p = 0.14) and total abundance (p = 0.08). The present study suggests the existence of a minimum cavity size threshold of approximately 1 L for most local species of stingless bees and sustains the hypothesis of a mass effect of Tetragonisca angustula Latreille populations from surrounding disturbed habitats on the MER forest community in terms of propagule (swarm) pressure. Examining swarm densities with trap-nests can be a promising technique for comparative analyses of the carrying capacities of forest habitats for stingless bee colonies, as long as size thresholds of cavities for nesting are taken into consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelipona scutellaris 3aTetragonisca angustula 3aconservation areas 3aforest communities 3aforest habitats 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ainterspecific variation 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3areproduction 3aspecies diversity 3astingless bees 3aswarming 3aswarms 3aBrazil1 aRamalho, M1 aMonteiro, D0 tNeotropical entomology.g2014 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.307-313dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-014-0219-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04119naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245008400177300001600261520192200277592002802199650002002227650001902247650001602266650002102282650002102303650001002324650001502334650002002349650001102369650003502380650001502415650003002430650001902460650002402479650001202503650001002515651001102525653001002536653000802546653001002554653000802564653000802572653001202580653000802592653000902600653000702609653001302616653001002629653000902639653000802648653001302656653000902669653002802678653003002706653001202736653000702748653000702755653002102762653002002783653002402803653001402827653001602841653001202857700002302869700002402892700002402916700002802940700002302968700002002991700002203011700002603033700002003059773010203079856008703181852000903268655001203277IND60545657220221123021358.0160902e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054565722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesvignes, Virginie10aStudy on polychlorobiphenyl serum levels in French consumers of freshwater fish  ap. 623-632.  aPolychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) are persistent pollutants that are widespread in the environment and in foodstuffs, particularly in freshwater fish, which frequently exceed the maximum levels set by European regulations.First, we describe the consumption of freshwater fish and serum PCB levels in French anglers, a population expected to have the highest level of dietary PCB exposure. Second, we investigated whether there is a statistical relationship between serum PCB levels and the angler consumption of freshwater fish with high PCB bioaccumulation potential (PCB-BP+ freshwater fish) in order to make recommendations with regard to safe consumption of freshwater fish.We conducted a survey of anglers from six sites with contrasting PCB contamination levels. The survey included a food consumption frequency questionnaire and blood samples were taken to assess serum PCB levels. We used a regression model to determine the main factors contributing to serum PCB levels.Consumption of PCB-BP+ freshwater fish was relatively infrequent. Serum PCB levels of the study population and of women of childbearing age were in the same range as those observed in the French population and in neighbouring European countries, but higher than in the North American population.The two factors with the highest positive association with serum PCB levels were age (R2=61%) and the consumption of PCB-BP+ freshwater fish (R2=2%). Using the regression model, we calculated, for several scenarios depending on the age and gender of the population, the maximum annual frequencies for PCB-BP+ freshwater fish consumption that do not exceed the critical body burden threshold.Following the results of this study, the French agency for food, environmental and occupational health and safety (ANSES) issued an opinion and recommended some specific maximum freshwater fish consumption frequencies to protect the French general population.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3afish consumption 3afood consumption 3afoods 3afreshwater 3afreshwater fish 3agender 3aoccupational health and safety 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awomen 3aEurope 0aAFSSA 0aAIC 0aANSES 0aBMI 0aDHA 0aDL-PCBs 0aEPA 0aFNPF 0aGL 0aICAR-PCB 0aINCA2 0aInVS 0aLOQ 0aNDL-PCBs 0aPCBs 0aPCB-BP+ freshwater fish 0aPCB-BP− freshwater fish 0aPCDD/Fs 0aR2 0aUS 0aFish consumption 0aFreshwater fish 0aPolychlorobiphenyls 0aPredictor 0aSerum level 0aAnglers1 aVolatier, Jean-Luc1 ade Bels, Frédéric1 aZeghnoun, Abdelkrim1 aFavrot, Marie-Christine1 aMarchand, Philippe1 aLe Bizec, Bruno1 aRivière, Gilles,1 aLeblanc, Jean-Charles1 aMerlo, Mathilde0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 505 p.623-632dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100003000183245007000213300001600283500002400299500002400323520105200347650001501399650001501414650001701429650001201446650001801458650004401476650001301520650001501533650002001548650001001568650001001578650001901588650001901607650002301626650001201649650001601661650001401677650002501691650001201716650002901728650001801757650001801775650004501793653002301838653002101861653002001882700002601902700002601928700002301954700002601977700002202003700002502025773011602050852000902166856008602175930003302261945002502294946001302319655001202332IND4439315920221119125137.0100702e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443931592DNAL7 a206085462pmid7 a10.1637/9010-080309-Case.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL840 0aP0501 aMaluenda, Ana Carolina H.10aRhabdomyosarcoma in a Yellow-Headed Caracara (Milvago chimachima)  ap. 951-954.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aRhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor originating from rhabdomyoblasts that is rarely reported in domestic animals or in free-living and pet birds. This paper presents a case of rhabdomyosarcoma in a free-ranging yellow-headed caracara (Milvago chimachima), originating from the muscle region of proximal left humerus, with metastases in the left pectoral muscles, heart, lungs, and proventriculus. The cytology was suggestive of rhabdomyosarcoma because of malignant features and cytoplasmic cross-striations in cells. The histopathologic examination revealed neoplastic proliferation composed of spindle cells arranged in irregular sheets or bundles with marked cellular pleomorphism, moderate mitotic ratio, and multinucleated giant cells. Some neoplastic cells also presented evidence of scant cytoplasmic cross-striations visible at histologic sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin and phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin. Immunohistochemically, tumors cells were positive for desmin and negative for α-smooth muscle actin and S100 protein. 3aFalconidae 3awild birds 3acase studies 3asarcoma 3abird diseases 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3amyocytes 3ametastasis 3askeletal muscle 3aheart 3alungs 3aproventriculus 3ahistopathology 3acell proliferation 3amitosis 3agiant cells 3acytoplasm 3aimmunohistochemistry 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxpathology 2aFalconiformes 2aFatal Outcome 2aRhabdomyosarcomaxpathologyxveterinary. 0aMilvago chimachima 0arhabdomyosarcoma 0arhabdomyoblasts1 aCasagrande, Renata A.1 aKanamura, Cristina T.1 aTorres, Luciana N.1 aQuagglia Neto, Fausto1 aGomes, Marcelo S.1 aMatushima, Eliana R.0 tAvian diseases.g2010 June, v. 54, no. 2 p.951-954dAmerican Association of Avian Pathologistsx0005-20867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/9010-080309-Case.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/08/11  aOther US 7aarticle03073naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245014900212300001400361520115400375592002801529650001301557650001601570650002001586650001101606650000901617650001501626650001101641650001101652650001001663650001201673650001701685650001101702650001001713650002001723650001401743650001101757650001701768650001101785650002001796651001001816653001001826653001001836653001401846653001301860653001201873653001001885653001001895653002001905653002701925700006301952700001902015700001802034700002202052700005902074700006002133700001702193773012002210856008402330852000902414655001202423IND60634307820221121064416.0190321e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063430782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsaakidou, Valasia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0358-317910aFrom texts to teeth: A multi-isotope study of sheep and goat herding practices in the Late Bronze Age (‘Mycenaean’) polity of Knossos, Crete  ap. 36-56.  aLinear B administrative documents of the late second millennium BC from urban Knossos, Crete, reveal that spatially extensive and centrally monitored sheep flocks and wool production played a fundamental role in Mycenaean palatial economy. Here we employ multi-isotope (δ13C, δ18O, 87Sr/86Sr) analysis of sequentially sampled sheep and goat tooth enamel bioapatite to explore life histories of animals consumed at Knossos. Interpretation of isotopic results incorporates new baseline data on 87Sr/86Sr ratios of bioavailable Sr from modern Cretan plants collected in relevant zones. Results reveal a variety of herding regimes, including seasonal (‘wet/winter’ to ‘dry/summer’) vertical movement of sheep from lowland to highland locations, more restricted mobility for goats in lowland to mid-altitude territories, possible input of fodder to goat diet, and exploitation of a range of plant ecosystems. Results broadly match documentary evidence and ethnographic/ecological expectations for sheep and goat herding at varying scales and underline the role of Knossos in mobilising resources from a range of herding systems and territories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aarchaeology 3abioavailability 3acarbon 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aflocks 3aforage 3agoats 3aherding 3alife history 3aoxygen 3asheep 3astable isotopes 3astrontium 3asummer 3atooth enamel 3awinter 3awool production 3aCrete 0aδ13C 0aδ18O 0a87Sr/86Sr 0aLinear B 0aKnossos 0aSheep 0aGoats 0aAnimal mobility 0a‘Palatial’ economy1 aStyring, Amy Keita,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1158-13011 aHalstead, Paul1 aNitsch, Erika1 aStroud, Elizabeth1 ale Roux, Petrus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5930-49951 aLee-Thorp, Julia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3291-02581 aBogaard, Amy0 tJournal of archaeological science: Reports.g2019 Feb., v. 23 p.36-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:26843x2352-409X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2018.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04344naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245021000170520242500380592002802805650002202833650001802855650002402873650002102897650001402918650002002932650002102952650003702973650001303010650001203023650001403035650001203049650002303061650001903084650001903103650002003122650002103142650001703163650001503180650003303195650001603228650001303244651001103257653002703268653001203295653001003307653001803317653001803335653002003353700002803373700001903401700002303420700002803443700003203471773013303503856008503636852000903721655001203730IND60719923020221117191444.0211017e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071992302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1101562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIniesto, Miguel10aSoft tissue histology of insect larvae decayed in laboratory experiments using microbial mats: Taphonomic comparison with Cretaceous fossil insects from the exceptionally preserved biota of Araripe, Brazil  aExperimental taphonomy using microbial mats offers new insights into the mechanisms involved in the decay of organisms and their preservation as fossils. In this paper, the experimental decay products of soft-bodied insect larvae (the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, and the mealworm, Tenebrio molitor) in microbial mats have been described and compared with those of grylloid fossils derived from the Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil. This novel approach characterises the decay and mineralisation of different tissues (cuticle, gut tract, silk gland, trachea, and fat body tissues) using transverse histological sections. Multivariate seriation statistics using histology indicate a significant non-random process, in which the two species show the same general decay sequence, namely: decay of fat bodies and muscles on Day 11, digestive degradation and occurrence of endogenous bacteria on approximately Day 30, and degradation of cuticles and tracheal networks (the most perdurable) on Days 60 and 120, respectively. Principal component analysis, based on the qualitative features of the decaying state of tissues, showed that the greatest alterations occurred between Days 60 and 180 in the controls without mats; however, in the microbial mat experiments, larvae showed better preservation overall. Based on scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, mineralisation of the larvae extends outside the cuticle and inner tissues. The predominance of certain anions (sulfate, chloride, and phosphate) is associated with the microbial activity of the mat community and the composition of water. The organic mesh of exopolymeric substances and cyanobacteria enriched in elements (e.g., Na and Mg) formed an amorphous crust that covered the larval body. This crust is similar to the massive crystallised external film found on the grylloid fossils derived from the Crato Formation of Brazil. The minerals were found to vary with location and time, with sulfates appearing mostly internally and for longer periods. Sulfurisation is discussed as the principal preservation process and is rapid in the early stages of organic matter decay. This comparison between the outcomes produced by taphonomic experiments using actual microbial mats and exceptionally preserved fossils can provide valuable information to understand more about the formation of numerous Konservat-Lagerstätten.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aCyanobacteria 3aGalleria mellonella 3aTenebrio molitor 3achlorides 3acrystallization 3adigestive system 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afat body 3afossils 3ahistology 3ainsects 3amicrobial activity 3amineralization 3aorganic matter 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aphosphates 3aprincipal component analysis 3asilk glands 3asulfates 3aBrazil 0aExperimental taphonomy 0aInsects 0aDecay 0aFossilisation 0aSulfurization 0aCrato Formation1 aGutiérrez-Silva, Paula1 aDias, Jaime J.1 aCarvalho, Ismar S.1 aBuscalioni, Ángela D.,1 aLópez-Archilla, Ana Isabel0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 564 p.110156-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1101563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245015200178520153300330592002801863650001901891650002901910650002701939650001601966650001501982650001801997650001302015650001102028650001802039650001502057650001302072650001302085650001102098650001802109700002502127700002502152700001802177700002202195700002102217773009902238856009002337852000902427655001202436IND60675467120221121230203.0200405e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067546712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7346502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, Réjean,10aImproving scallop (Pecten maximus and Placopecten magellanicus) spat production by initial larvae size and hydrodynamic cues used in nursery system  aThere are several factors affecting scallops during the metamorphosis process that could explain the relatively low post-larvae yield observed in hatcheries. Competent bivalve larvae respond to different settlement cues to undergo metamorphosis and without adequate cues, larvae delay their metamorphosis. The objective of this study is to improve the settlement ratio of the two scallop species, Placopecten magellanicus and Pecten maximus by physical cues associated with hydrodynamic conditions, stocking density in settlement units and larval size at time of transfer to settling units. For each treatment, physiological condition was determined by fatty acid analysis to determine the energetic reserves and structural lipids. We observed similar results for the two important commercial pectinid species and validate the hypothesis on the positive effect of increased flow rate and larval size after transfer to settlement systems on settlement success. Increasing flow rate also affects positively the physiological condition of settled post-larvae by a higher accumulation of total fatty acids in neutral lipid fractions. Furthermore, no effect of larval stocking density until 90 larvae cm⁻² in the downwelling sieves was observed. To our knowledge this study is the first to characterize the effect of seawater flow rate on settlement success of different pectinid species cultured under similar conditions. The experiments were performed in a close to commercial scale and thus are relevant to industry situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPecten maximus 3aPlacopecten magellanicus 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3ahatcheries 3ahydrodynamics 3aindustry 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3apostlarvae 3ascallops 3aseawater 3asieves 3astocking rate1 aChristophersen, Gyda1 aNadalini, Jean-Bruno1 aRedjah, Iften1 aMagnesen, Thorolf1 aAndersen, Sissel0 tAquaculture.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 516 p.734650-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7346503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009500154300002000249520106800269592002801337650001501365650001201380650000901392650001301401650001601414650001201430650002701442650001701469650001201486700001501498700002401513700002201537773012401559856007401683852000901757655001201766IND60664506920221121054947.0190912e20130610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066450692DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra41348a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qin10aFabrication of ordered nanoring arrays via the footprint of a polymer nanosphere monolayer  ap. 10301-10308.  aThis work presents a simple and versatile method to fabricate large areas of nanoring arrays by using polymer nanosphere monolayers as templates. The method is based on the observation that arrays of residual ring-shaped footprints would be left on the silicon substrate by directly peeling off the polystyrene nanosphere monolayer. This is proposed to be related to the migration and accumulation of the relaxed polymer molecules from the surface of each nanosphere to the substrate. This process was found to be drastically enhanced by treating the monolayers with an ethanol solution of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), since APTES can promote the adsorption of the relaxed surface molecules onto the substrate. The dependence of the final nanoring morphology on treatment time, APTES concentration and size of the template nanospheres has been studied. In addition, this nanoring array fabrication method also works with gold substrates as well as poly (methyl methacrylate) nanosphere templates, implying extendibility to alternative material systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aethanol 3agold 3ananogold 3ananospheres 3apeeling 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3apolystyrenes 3asilicon1 aLeng, Bing1 aWu, Linda Yong Ling1 aWong, Chee Cheong0 tRSC advances.g2013 June 10, v. 3, no. 26 p.10301-10308dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra41348a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010700161300001600268520072900284592002801013650002101041650001701062650002001079650002501099650002801124650001901152650000901171650001901180650001801199650001301217650001001230650002201240650001701262650001701279653002401296653001901320653001401339653001401353653002801367700002001395700001601415700001501431700001401446700002001460773010801480856004801588852000901636655001201645IND50075849820221120045712.0140410e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007584982DNAL7 a10.1080/147864109028339482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Qian10aTwo new compounds from Semen celosiae and their protective effects against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity  ap. 772-780.  aTwo new oleanolic acid saponins, namely celosin A (1) and celosin B (2), together with six known compounds, stigmasterol (3), β-sitosterol (4), β-daucosterol (5), hexacosoic acid (6), palmitic acid (7) and stearic acid (8), were isolated from the ethanolic extract of Semen celosiae.

Predation by domestic cats remains a topic of considerable social and scientific debate and warrants attention using improved methods. Predation is likely a function of cat behavior, opportunity to hunt, and local habitat. Previous predation studies relied on homeowner reports of wildlife captures from prey returns to the household and other indirect means. We investigated hunting of wildlife by owned, free-roaming cats in a suburban area of the southeastern USA. Specific research goals included: (1) quantifying the frequency of cat interactions with native wildlife, (2) identifying common prey species of suburban cats, and (3) examining predictors of outdoor behavior. We monitored 55 cats during a 1-year period (November 2010–October 2011) using KittyCam video cameras. Participating cats wore a video camera for 7–10 total days and all outdoor activity was recorded for analysis. We collected an average of 38h of footage from each project cat. Forty-four percent of free-roaming cats hunted wildlife, of which reptiles, mammals, and invertebrates constituted the majority of prey. Successful hunting cats captured an average of 2.4 prey items during 7days of roaming, with Carolina anoles (Anolis carolinensis) being the most common prey species. Most wildlife captures (85%) occurred during the warm season (March–November in the southern USA). Twenty-three percent of cat prey items were returned to households; 49% of items were left at the site of capture, and 28% were consumed. Our results suggest that previous studies of pet cat predation on wildlife using owner surveys significantly underestimated capture rates of hunting cats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnolis carolinensis 3acats 3ahabitats 3ahomeowners 3ahouseholds 3ainvertebrates 3apredation 3apredators 3areptiles 3asuburban areas 3asurveys 3avideo cameras 3awarm season 3awildlife 3aUnited States 0aDomestic cats 0aFree-roaming cat predation 0aCat-wildlife interactions 0aCrittercam 0aKittyCam 0aSuburban wildlife1 aHernandez, Sonia M.1 aCarroll, John P.1 aAbernathy, Kyler J.1 aMarshall, Greg J.0 tBiological conservation.g2013 Apr., v. 160 p.183-189dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017000154300002000324520119300344592002801537650003701565650001501602650001401617650002801631650002201659650002301681650001401704650002201718650003301740650001701773650002201790650002301812650002201835650001001857650001901867650003701886650001601923700001601939700001201955700001901967700001701986700001402003700001402017700001202031700001902043700001702062773012502079856007402204852000902278655001202287IND60642125820221120054126.0190506e20170905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064212582DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08170g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Yue10aInhibition of mild steel corrosion in hydrochloric acid using two novel pyridine Schiff base derivatives: a comparative study of experimental and theoretical results  ap. 43014-43029.  aTwo novel pyridine Schiff base derivatives, namely 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde-4-phenyl thiosemicarbazide (3-PCPTC) and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde-4-phenylthiosemicarbazide (4-PCPTC), were synthesized and their corrosion inhibition properties on mild steel in 1.0 M HCl were studied through experimental and theoretical measurements. Weight loss, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization results indicate that both compounds exhibit a good inhibition effect and that 3-PCPTC shows better inhibition efficiency than 4-PCPTC. Meanwhile, the adsorption process obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, and thermodynamic parameters were calculated and discussed. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirm the adsorption and protective abilities of the two studied inhibitors on mild steel in HCl. UV-vis spectroscopic studies show that the corrosion inhibitors interact with mild steel in HCl solution to form Fe-inhibitor complexes. Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations were performed. According to the experimental and theoretical results, the inhibition mechanism was deduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3ahydrochloric acid 3amolecular dynamics 3apyridines 3aquantum mechanics 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aschiff bases 3asimulation models 3asorption isotherms 3aspectral analysis 3asteel 3athermodynamics 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aweight loss1 aNing, Wenbo1 aXu, Bin1 aYang, Wenzhong1 aZhang, Kegui1 aChen, Yun1 aLi, Lihua1 aLiu, Xi1 aZheng, Jinhong1 aZhang, Yimin0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 05, v. 7, no. 68 p.43014-43029dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08170g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245012000181300001600301520118100317592002801498650002801526650002201554650002301576650001601599650001101615650002401626650001501650650001201665650001101677650001401688700002301702700002001725773012401745856005501869852000901924655001201933IND4483877320221121154648.0120423e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448387732DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0307.2012.00828.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAKGÃL, FATMA BETÃL11aAModelling study on skimmed milk lactose hydrolysis and Î²âgalactosidase stability using three reactor types  ap. 217-231.  aThe hydrolysis of lactose in skimmed milk and Î²âgalactosidase inactivation studies were carried out in three different devices â bioreactor, sonicator and homogeniser â to evaluate the performance of such reactors that have different operational systems. The experiments were carried out using Î²âgalactosidase produced from Kluyveromyces marxianus lactis. At the optimum process conditions obtained from the experiments performed in bioreactor, sonicator and homogeniser, 89%, 90% and 54% of lactose were hydrolysed and the enzyme lost its activity by 14%, 13% and 24%, respectively, at the end of the processing time of 30âmin. The commercial milk lactose content (1âg/L lactose) was reached at 60âmin for bioreactor and sonicator. After evaluation of the data, it was found that the kinetics of hydrolysis and enzyme inactivation could be represented by a firstâorder kinetic model and a singleâstep nonâfirstâorder enzyme inactivation kinetic model, respectively, for all process conditions applied.

The influence of the phenomena on PV modules performance is ambiguous. In this paper, the authors have performed a series of tests on 20 polycrystalline modules, which have been operating in a moderate, intermediate climate for over 3 years, to evaluate the snail tracks impact. Besides commonly used techniques like visual inspection, electroluminescence, illuminated thermography and current-voltage characteristic determination, dark thermography was also applied. The analysis of uncertainty and the statistical approach were used to obtain reliable results. The visual inspection and electroluminescence tests confirmed in case of 96% of snail tracks that they are strongly correlated with micro cracks. In addition, a novel classification of snail tracks is proposed. There is no evidence that presence and number of snail tracks influence photovoltaic module power. Furthermore, illuminated and dark thermography revealed no clear relation between temperature field and snail tracks occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3arenewable energy sources 3asnails 3asolar collectors 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3athermography 3auncertainty 3aPoland 0aSnail track 0aPV module 0aElectroluminescence 0aDark thermography1 aBugaj, Marcin1 aChaja, Patryk0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Jan., v. 163 p.504-516dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245009500157300001800252500002000270520220000290592002802490650001302518650000902531650001902540650001502559650001002574650001402584650001402598650001402612650001702626650000902643650002602652650001302678650001002691700001902701700001902720773009202739856007202831852000902903655001202912IND60571236620221118232420.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057123662DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.15432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamaguchi, Aya10aContacts with large, active individuals intensify the predation risk of small conspecifics  ap. 3206-3218.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSize variation within a population can influence the structure of ecosystem interactions, because ecological performance differs between individuals of different sizes. Although the impact of size variation in a predator species on the structure of interactions is well understood, our knowledge about how size variation in a prey species might modify the interactions between predators and prey is very limited. Here, by examining the interactions between predatory Hynobius retardatus salamander larvae and their prey, Rana pirica frog tadpoles, we investigated how large prey individuals affect the predation mortality of small prey conspecifics. First, in an experiment conducted in a field pond in which we manipulated the presence of salamanders and large tadpoles (i.e., large enough to protect them against salamander predation) with small tadpoles, we showed that in the presence of large tadpoles the mortality of small tadpoles from salamander predation was increased. On the basis of our observations of the activity of individuals, we hypothesized that active large tadpoles caused physical disturbances, which in turn caused the small tadpoles to move, and thus increased their encounter frequency with the predatory salamanders. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a laboratory experiment in small tanks with three players (i.e., one salamander as predator, one small tadpole as focal prey, and either a small or a large tadpole as the prospective movement inducer). In each tank, we manipulated the presence or absence of a movement inducer, and, when present, its size (large or small) and access (caged or uncaged) to the focal prey. In the presence of a large, uncaged movement inducer, the focal prey was more active and suffered from higher predation mortality compared with the other treatments, because the large movement inducer (unlike a small movement inducer) moved actively and, when uncaged, could stimulate movement of the focal prey through direct contact. The results indicated that high activity of large prey individuals and the resulting behavioral interactions with small conspecifics via direct contact indirectly increased the mortality of the small prey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHynobius 3aRana 3adirect contact 3aecosystems 3afrogs 3amortality 3apredation 3apredators 3aprey species 3arisk 3asalamanders and newts 3atadpoles 3atanks1 aTakatsu, Kunio1 aKishida, Osamu0 tEcology.g2016 Nov., v. 97, no. 11 p.3206-3218dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.15433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009100164300002000255520145500275592002801730650002301758650002201781650003701803650001301840650001501853650001701868650001001885650000901895650001001904650001401914650001101928650001101939650001901950650001501969650002201984650003302006650001702039650003702056650000902093650001502102700002702117700001702144700001502161700002702176773012502203856007402328852000902402655001202411IND60642125920221122175048.0190506e20170905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064212592DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08172c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, K. V.

The optical, morphological, and structural properties were studied using Raman, UV-DRS, SEM, TEM, XPS, and powder XRD techniques. The average crystallite sizes of Zn₁₋ₓMnₓO (1, 2, 3, 4), which are around 30–60 nm, were confirmed via powder X-ray diffraction studies, whereas transmission electron microscopy studies confirmed the formation of a ZnO wurtzite crystal phase. Scanning electron microscopy indicated the spherical morphology of the samples. Raman spectroscopy studies confirmed a decrease in oxygen vacancies with increasing Mn content, whereas confirmation of the doping of Mn ions into the ZnO lattice was obtained using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The band gap energies of samples were calculated using UV-DRS spectroscopy, whereas BET surface area measurements confirmed the surface area. The visible light activity of Zn₁₋ₓMnₓO (1, 2, 3, 4) was identified through studies of phenol degradation and Cr(vi) reduction under visible light photocatalysis, which highlight that Zn₀.₈Mn₀.₂O (2) shows the best activity. Typical degradation profiles indicated that the simultaneous degradation of pollutants is more effective than the removal of individual pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achromium 3acombustion 3acrystallites 3afuels 3aions 3alight 3amanganese 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3apollutants 3apollution control 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aurea 3azinc oxide1 aAmanchi, Srinivasa Rao1 aSreedhar, B.1 aGhosal, P.1 aSubrahmanyaṃ, Cuncu,0 tRSC advances.g2017 Sept. 05, v. 7, no. 68 p.43030-43039dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra08172c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014600163520148100309592002801790650002001818650001601838650001401854650001201868650002201880650002201902650001801924650002001942650000901962650001301971650001501984650001901999650002002018650000902038650001002047651001302057653002202070653002102092653001502113653002302128653002402151653002402175700005702199700001602256700005402272700005502326700001702381700001702398700001502415700001402430773011502444856008302559852000902642655001202651IND60634308020221121064323.0190328e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063430802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1005312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChande, M.10aAssessment of the impacts of artisanal fishing gears on nearshore fish stocks along coastal waters off the Kilwa–Mafia seascape in Tanzania  aSmall-scale fisheries (SSF) in many parts of the worlds are known to support the livelihoods of millions of coastal communities. Also, SSF are characterized by being multispecies and multi-gear, a fact that poses management and conservation challenges to this critical natural capital. Little is known about the catch composition and the impact of the artisanal fishing gears to the fishery in Tanzania. The current study assessed catch composition and effects of three major fishing gears namely handlines, gillnets, and traps using data collected from 2008 to 2011 along the Kilwa–Mafia seascape in Tanzania. A total of 214 species, belonging to 46 families, were recorded of which 15 species accounted for 82% of the catch in all gears combined. The most common species recorded were halfbeaks (Hemiramphus far), marbled parrotfish (Leptoscarus vaigiensis), sky emperor (Lethrinus mahsena), pink ear emperor (Lethrinus lentjan) and shoemaker spinefoot (Siganus sutor). Lethrinidae was the overall dominant group, contributing to more than 30% of the total catches. The findings suggest the presence of gear selectivity on individual species, particularly Leptoscarus vaigiensis (20.4%), H. far (59.53%) and L. mahsena (31.8%) which dominated catches from traps, gillnets, and handlines, respectively. Furthermore, productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA) indicates that L. lentjan is at high risk of depletion, suggesting a gear-based management approach is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHemiramphus far 3aLeptoscarus 3aLethrinus 3aSiganus 3aartisanal fishing 3acatch composition 3acoastal water 3adata collection 3afish 3agillnets 3alivelihood 3amarine science 3anatural capital 3arisk 3atraps 3aTanzania 0aArtisanal fishery 0aGear selectivity 0aLivelihood 0aMean trophic level 0aSpecies composition 0aTropical ecosystems1 aKimirei, I.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1101-52621 aIgulu, M.M.1 aKuguru, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6226-88281 aKayanda, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6085-12671 aMwakosya, C.1 aKangwe, S.J.1 aSululu, J.1 aUlotu, E.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2019 Mar., v. 27 p.100531-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2019.1005313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245013300199300001800332500001100350520144700361592002801808596004401836650001901880650001301899650001501912650002801927650001001955651001401965700005501979700005102034700005202085700005402137700002702191700005502218773012702273856007702400852000902477655001202486IND60788012120221121144536.0220811e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078801212DNAL7 a10.1029/2017WR0224372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheffield, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2400-063010aSatellite Remote Sensing for Water Resources Management: Potential for Supporting Sustainable Development in Data‐Poor Regions  ap. 9724-9758.  aREVIEW  aWater resources management (WRM) for sustainable development presents many challenges in areas with sparse in situ monitoring networks. The exponential growth of satellite based information over the past decade provides unprecedented opportunities to support and improve WRM. Furthermore, traditional barriers to the access and usage of satellite data are lowering as technological innovations provide opportunities to manage and deliver this wealth of information to a wider audience. We review data needs for WRM and the role that satellite remote sensing can play to fill gaps and enhance WRM, focusing on the Latin American and Caribbean as an example of a region with potential to further develop its resources and mitigate the impacts of hydrological hazards. We review the state‐of‐the‐art for relevant variables, current satellite missions, and products, how they are being used currently by national agencies across the Latin American and Caribbean region, and the challenges to improving their utility. We discuss the potential of recently launched, upcoming, and proposed missions that are likely to further enhance and transform assessment and monitoring of water resources. Ongoing challenges of accuracy, sampling, and continuity still need to be addressed, and further challenges related to the massive amounts of new data need to be overcome to best leverage the utility of satellite based information for improving WRM.  aPublisher supplied data  cInter‐American Development Bank (IDB) 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asatellites 3asustainable development 3awater 3aCaribbean1 aWood, E.

Accurate quantification of soil respiration is essential for robust projection of future climate variation and for reliable estimation of paleoatmospheric CO₂ levels using soil carbonates. Soil-respired CO₂, which is the most uncertain factor in estimating atmospheric CO₂ concentration, has been calculated from modern observations of surface soils and from proxy indicators of paleosols formed during time periods of known atmospheric CO₂. However, these estimations provide a wide range of S(z) values from past to present. To directly compare modern observation with past estimation, here we first monitored soil CO₂ profiles in a Holocene profile on the western Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) for two years, providing direct measurements of soil-respired CO₂ at the depth where carbonate nodules likely formed. We then collected carbonate nodules below last interglacial paleosol (S1) from two N-S-aligned transects across the CLP to back-calculate soil-respired CO₂. The mean back-calculated S(z) from S1 carbonate nodules vary from 539 ± 87 ppm to 848 ± 170 ppm in the sections on the northwestern and southeastern CLP, respectively. The mean value of directly measured soil-respired CO₂ on the western CLP is 572 ± 273 ppm before the onset of summer monsoon, consistent with the back-calculated S(z) in northwestern sections. Our results suggest that spatial S(z) variations are mainly controlled by monsoonal precipitation during the summer season on the CLP. To better constrain the high end of S(z), more monitoring work is needed in higher precipitation areas on the southeastern CLP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aclimatic factors 3amonsoon season 3apalaeogeography 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3apaleosolic soil types 3asoil respiration 3asummer 3aChina 0aChinese Loess Plateau 0aS(z) 0aMonitoring soil respiration 0aLast interglacial paleosol (S1)1 aMa, Long1 aNie, Junsheng1 aChen, Shengyun1 aSun, Youbin1 aBreecker, Dan O.,0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 562 p.110158-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.1101583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245015600173300001600329520149300345592002801838650002501866650002001891650002201911650000901933650002301942650001601965650002101981650003002002650002302032650000902055650002902064651001002093653001002103653000902113653000802122653000802130653000702138653001002145653000802155653000802163653000802171653000802179653000702187653000802194653002302202653003002225653001402255653002102269700001802290700001902308700002102327700001602348700001902364700001802383700001402401773010202415856008702517852000902604655001202613IND60545657420221121144404.0160902e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054565742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bing-Ling10aLevels of polychlorinated biphenyls in settled house dust from urban dwellings in China and their neurodevelopmental effects on preschool-aged children  ap. 402-408.  aWe investigated the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in settled house dust (SHD) from urban dwellings with resident preschool-aged children in Nanjing, China. The possible neurodevelopmental effects of house-dust PCBs were also explored. SHD was collected from 114 urban houses. The levels of 39 PCB congeners were measured by gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The Child Behavior Checklist and the Gesell Development Inventory were used to evaluate the child's development. All 39 target congeners measured were detected. The mass percentage of di-PCBs was the highest at 47.8%, followed by tetra- and tri-PCBs at 16.8% and 13.0%, respectively. Spearman's rho correlation showed that di-, tri-, hexa-, hepta-, nona- and total PCBs were positively associated with somatic, thought problem and total problem scores (0.24<r<0.36). After dichotomization at the 75th percentile PCB concentration, we found that the higher PCB3, 6, 12, 25, 44, 71, 174 and 203 might increase the risk of certain behavior problems. Moreover, among the lower-chlorinated PCBs, PCB3 and PCB4 showed some risk of adaptive and gross motor abnormality, respectively. In conclusion, PCBs (especially lower-chlorinated PCBs) are ubiquitous in urban SHD in Nanjing and may carry a risk of certain developmental abnormalities. The potential adverse effects of postnatal exposure to PCBs on the behavior and neurodevelopment of preschool-aged children need to be studied in larger follow-up studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aadverse effects 3abehavior problems 3adust 3agas chromatography 3ainventories 3aneurodevelopment 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apreschool children 3arisk 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aChina 0aSVOCs 0aPCBs 0aSHD 0aSRM 0aDQ 0aGFAAS 0aRSD 0aIDL 0aS/N 0aMDL 0aGM 0aGSD 0aSettled house dust 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls 0aPreschool 0aNeurodevelopment1 aPang, Shu-Tao1 aSun, Jian-Ping1 aZhang, Xiao-Ling1 aLi, Xi-Ling1 aSun, Yong-Gang1 aLu, Xiao Mei,1 aZhang, Qi0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Feb. 01, v. 505 p.402-408dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008500164300001600249520149800265592002801763650001501791650001401806650002101820650001401841650001201855650001701867650003001884650001401914650001101928650001901939650001701958650001101975650001501986650001602001650001002017650001002027650001302037651001002050700001902060700002002079700001602099700001502115773009702130856008102227852000902308655001202317IND60080159420221120192751.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008015942DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-014-0222-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoligui, R N10aInsect Pests Occurring on Dacryodes edulis (Burseraceae) in Rural Areas in Gabon  ap. 322-334.  aThe inventory of pests occurring on Dacryodes edulis (Burseraceae) was carried out in rural areas in Gabon during 2009 and 2010. Yellow traps and visual observations were used to record weekly pests during the tree flowering stage, in five villages. Catches from yellow traps rose to 7,296 and 1,722 insect pests in 2009 and 2010, respectively, whereas records from visual observations corresponded to 1,812 and 171 insect pests in 2009 and 2010, respectively. During both years, abundance from traps and visual monitoring was significantly different between sampling sites (p < 0.05). The difference in pests’ diversity between sampling sites was not significant (p > 0.05) according to traps, but significant (p ≤ 0.04) according to visual observations in 2010. Mecocorynus loripes Chevrolat (Coleoptera: Cucurlionidae) attacked the stem of D. edulis, while Oligotrophus sp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), Pseudophacopteron serrifer Malenovsky and Burckhardt (Hemiptera: Phacopteronidae), and Selenothrips rubrocinctus Giard (Thysanopera: Thripidae) attacked leaves. Pseudonoorda edulis Maes and Poligui (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Lobesia aeolopa Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) infested fruits and inflorescences, respectively. These insects are specifically linked to plant patterns, and their identification provided the first basic information for developing suitable strategies to control pests of D. edulis in Gabon, as well as in neighboring central African countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColeoptera 3aCrambidae 3aDacryodes edulis 3aHemiptera 3aLobesia 3aOligotrophus 3aSelenothrips rubrocinctus 3aflowering 3afruits 3ainflorescences 3ainsect pests 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3arural areas 3atraps 3atrees 3avillages 3aGabon1 aMouaragadja, I1 aVandereycken, A1 aHaubruge, E1 aFrancis, F0 tNeotropical entomology.g2014 Aug., v. 43, no. 4 p.322-334dSpringer-Verlagx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-014-0222-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245010600186300001800292520149400310592002801804650001801832650002401850650002801874650001401902650002401916650001701940650001401957650001601971650002901987650005802016650003902074650001102113650001802124650003302142650004202175650001602217650005002233651001002283651001002293700001802303700001302321700001802334700001902352773011202371856008702483852000902570655001202579IND4466852120221123000700.0141112e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446685212DNAL7 a213763702pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Guoxing10aDoes temperature enhance acute mortality effects of ambient particle pollution in Tianjin City, China  ap. 1811-1817.  aOnly a few epidemiological studies have explored whether there were interactive effects between temperature and particulate matter <10μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM₁₀) on mortality, especially in Asian countries. The present study used time-series analysis to explore the modification effects of temperature on the association between PM₁₀ and the cause-specific mortality for cardiovascular, respiratory, cardiopulmonary, stroke and ischemic heart diseases (IHD), as well as non-accidental mortality in Tianjin between 2007 and 2009. Results showed that the PM₁₀ effects were stronger on high temperature level days than that on low temperature level days. The interactions between PM₁₀ and temperature were statistically significant on cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, and IHD mortalities. The effect estimates per 10-μg/m³ increase in PM₁₀ concentrations at the moving average of lags 0 and 1day in high temperature level were 0.62% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27, 0.97) for non-accidental, 0.92% (0.47, 1.36) for cardiovascular, 0.74% (−0.33, 1.82) for respiratory, 0.89% (0.47, 1.32) for cardiopulmonary, 0.65% (0.00, 1.31) for stroke and 1.20% (0.63, 1.78) for IHD mortalities. In addition, the PM₁₀ effects on high temperature level days were stronger on older (≥65years) compared with younger subjects (<65years). This suggests that the modifying effects of the temperature should be considered when analyzing health impacts of ambient PM₁₀.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute effects 3aconfidence interval 3aepidemiological studies 3amortality 3amyocardial ischemia 3aparticulates 3apollution 3atemperature 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aAir Pollutionxanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxmortality 2aHumans 2aParticle Size 2aParticulate Matterxanalysis 2aRespiratory Tract Diseasesxmortality 2aTemperature 2aUrban Populationxstatistics & numerical data 3aChina 0aChina1 aZhou, Maigeng1 aCai, Yue1 aZhang, Yajuan1 aPan, Xiaochuan0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 409, no. 10 p.1811-1817dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009100168300001400259520077500273592002801048650000901076650001301085650001901098650001801117650001501135650001101150650001801161650001501179650001301194650001701207653001001224653002201234653001801256653002601274700001801300773013801318856008601456852000901542655001201551IND60724107620221120174050.0210812e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072410762DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2020.17249692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, In-Chul10aSuppressive effects of aloin on polyphosphate-mediated vascular inflammatory responses  ap. 89-99.  aHuman endothelial cells-derived polyphosphate (PolyP) is one of the pro-inflammatory mediators as suggested by the previous reports.

Aloin inhibits PolyP-mediated barrier disruption, the expressions of cell adhesion molecules, and adhesion/migration of leukocyte to HUVEC. PolyP-induced NF-κB activation and the productions of TNF-α and IL-6 were inhibited by aloin in HUVECs. These anti-inflammatory functions of aloin were confirmed in PolyP-injected mice. In conclusion, based on the anti-inflammatory effects of aloin in PolyP-mediated septic response, aloin has therapeutic potential for various systemic inflammatory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe 3aadhesion 3aanthraquinones 3acell adhesion 3aglycosides 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3aleukocytes 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 0aAloin 0abarrier integrity 0apolyphosphate 0avascular permeability1 aBae, Jong-Sup0 tJournal of Asian natural products research.g2021 Jan. 2, v. 23, no. 1 p.89-99dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000098x1477-22137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10286020.2020.17249693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03217naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011000170300001400280520193000294592002802224650001302252650001502265650001802280650001402298650001802312650000902330650001902339650001402358650001402372650001102386650001702397651001102414653001302425653001502438653001002453653001102463653001102474653001302485700001802498700001702516700001902533773009902552856008702651852000902738655001202747IND60108227520221119015047.0161027e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010822752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMäkinen, L.14aThe effects of recovering fibre and fine materials on sludge dewatering properties at a deinked pulp mill  ap. 11-16.  aThe manufacture of deinked pulp generates large amounts of waste for disposal. The yield loss in the production of recycled paper can be up to 25%. The use of landfills for waste disposal is very expensive and will be prohibited in Europe in the next few years. Thus, there is a great pressure to improve the material efficiency and to reduce the amount of waste that is produced at deinked pulp mills. However, the issue is complex because an improvement of the material efficiency at one process unit may deteriorate the performance of other stages. For example, the attempts to increase the fibre yield in the deinking processes can lead to poor sludge dewatering properties, resulting in that there are no added advantages for the mill anymore.This work aims to determine the limitations between the sludge dewatering properties and the improvements in material efficiency at a deinked pulp mill by investigating the dewatering properties of sludge samples that contained variable amounts of fine screening and flotation froth rejects. The results show that the deinked pulp mill material efficiency can be increased without weakening the sludge dewatering properties if the fibre content is not reduced below a certain limit. The material efficiency can be increased either by (1) recovering fibres at an acceptable quantity where the fibre content does not decrease below the limiting point or by (2) recovering fine materials simultaneously with fibres in a way that maintains the fibre content above a limiting point. The first method provides an opportunity for deinking mills to increase the yield, even though the increase is less than 2 percentage units. With the simultaneous recovery of fibres and fine materials using the second method, it would be possible to improve the material efficiency at the deinked pulp mill by approximately 5 percentage units without affecting the dewatering of the combined sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeinking 3adewatering 3afiber content 3alandfills 3amanufacturing 3apulp 3arecycled paper 3arecycling 3ascreening 3asludge 3aunit process 3aEurope 0aDeinking 0aDewatering 0aFibre 0aReject 0aSludge 0aRecovery1 aÄmmälä, A.1 aKörkkö, M.1 aNiinimäki, J.0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 Apr., v. 73 p.11-16dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009200167300001800259520114100277592002801418650002301446650000901469650001901478650001701497650001201514700001801526700002401544700001601568700002301584773008401607856008501691990002301776852000901799655001201808IND60105694920221120185433.0141108e20120322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010569492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2012.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhenke10aOne-pot synthesis of hyperbranched polymers using small molecule and macro RAFT inimers  ap. 1429-1436.  aTwo novel RAFT inimers, small molecule inimer 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl 4-cyano-4-(phenylcarbonothioylthio)pentanoate (MAE-CPP) and macro inimer PMMA-MAE-CPP were synthesized and used to prepare hyperbranched polymers via RAFT polymerization without the use of a divinyl cross-linker.

The spectroscopic characteristics and polymerization kinetics of these RAFT polymers obtained under different polymerization conditions were systematically studied and the results compared with those obtained from the corresponding linear RAFT polymerizations as well as from hyperbranched polymerizations performed in the presence of a divinyl cross-linker which are reported in literature.

The as-synthesized TOAC exhibited a remarkable capability for trace Cr(VI) removal from an aqueous solution, where the concentration of Cr(VI) could be decreased to a level below 0.05mg/L within 1h. We have systematically investigated the factors that influenced the adsorption of Cr(VI), for example, the pH value of the solution, and the contact time of TOAC with Cr(VI). We found that the adsorption of Cr(VI) was strongly pH-dependent. The adsorption behavior of Cr(VI) onto TOAC fitted well the Langmuir isotherm and a maximum adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) as 25.7mg/g was achieved. The adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, which implied that the adsorption was composed of two steps: the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions onto TOAC followed by the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by Ag nanoparticles. Our results revealed that TOAC with high capacity of Cr(VI) removal had promising potential for wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achromium 3aions 3amodels 3ananosilver 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atitanium 3awastewater treatment1 aChen, Yong Zhou1 aDe Zhang, Li1 aHua, Guo Min1 aXu, Wei1 aLi, Nian1 aZhang, Ye0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 June 15, v. 190, no. 1-3 p.723-728dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.03.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008800168300001600256520115000272592002801422650001501450650001501465650002301480650001901503650002001522650002201542650001001564650001201574650002001586650002201606650001501628650001901643650003001662700002501692700001901717700001501736773009801751856008101849990002301930852000901953655001201962IND60108542220221117034509.0141108e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010854222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTashkhourian, J.12aA novel photometric glucose biosensor based on decolorizing of silver nanoparticles  ap. 185-189.  aA novel glucose biosensor based on chromophore (silver nanoparticles) decolorizing for the photometric determination of glucose was developed. Silver nanoparticles are directly synthesized in the sol–gel matrix by a one-step method based on the reduction of the inorganic precursor AgNO₃ and were used for the preparation, characterization and calibration of a highly sensitive and cost-effective localized surface plasmon resonance-based glucose biosensor. In the presence of glucose oxidase (GOx) and due to the enzyme–substrate (glucose) reaction, H₂O₂ was produced and silver nanoparticles in the sol–gel glass have the ability for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Due to the degradation of silver nanoparticles a remarkable change in the localized surface plasmon resonance absorbance strength could be observed which have been monitored as a suitable signal for determination of substrate concentration. Beer's law is obeyed in the range from 50 to 800mg/L glucose and the limit of detection is 23mg/L. The proposed optical biosensor has been successfully applied to the determination of glucose in various real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abiosensors 3acost effectiveness 3adecolorization 3adetection limit 3aenzyme substrates 3aglass 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananosilver 3asilver nitrate 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aHormozi-Nezhad, M.R.1 aKhodaveisi, J.1 aDashti, R.0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 158, no. 1 p.185-189dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009600163300001600259520124600275592002801521650002101549650002201570650001401592650001701606650002401623650002001647650001901667650001701686650001601703700001601719700001601735700001501751700001501766773010301781856008201884852000901966655001201975IND60110648820221118104645.0141109e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011064882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2010.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Haiyan10aRecent developments in the detection of singlet oxygen with molecular spectroscopic methods  ap. 133-141.  aSinglet oxygen is a unique reactive oxygen species, as its chemical reactivity derives from its characteristic electronically-excited state. The involvement of singlet oxygen in many important atmospheric, physical, chemical, biological, and therapeutic processes has attracted intense research interest in recent years. The detection and the quantification of singlet oxygen are very important for understanding its mechanism of action in various processes. Due to its highly reactive nature, singlet oxygen has very few direct methods of determination. Only molecular phosphorescence at 1270nm has been utilized. Indirect methods using spectrophotometric, fluorescent or chemiluminescent probes have therefore been extensively studied. This review reflects recent developments in singlet-oxygen detection with molecular spectroscopic methods. We begin with a brief introduction of the basic properties, the production and the applications of singlet oxygen. With this background information, we review the four molecular spectroscopic methods (i.e., emission, spectrophotometry, fluorescence and chemiluminescence). We pay special attention to attractive chemical probes with high selectivity and sensitivity in quantifying singlet oxygen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth atmosphere 3achemiluminescence 3aelectrons 3afluorescence 3amechanism of action 3aphosphorescence 3asinglet oxygen 3aspectroscopy 3awavelengths1 aSong, Qijun1 aRan, Guoxia1 aLu, Xiaomu1 aXu, Baoguo0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.133-141dElsevier B.V.x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2010.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009500172300001400267520129800281592002801579650002301607650001701630650002301647650001101670650000901681650001101690650001301701650001801714650001801732700002201750700002001772700002001792773009401812856008201906852000901988655001201997IND60100273020221119104336.0141105e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010027302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2011.08.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrodersen, Simon H.10aUnderstanding the catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles through multi-scale simulations  ap. 34-41.  aWe investigate how the chemical reactivity of gold nanoparticles depends on the cluster size and shape using a combination of simulation techniques at different length scales, enabling us to model at the atomic level the shapes of clusters in the size range relevant for catalysis. The detailed atomic configuration of a nanoparticle with a given number of atoms is calculated by first finding overall cluster shapes with low energy and approximately the right size, and then using Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations to identify the detailed atomic configuration. The equilibrium number of low-coordinated active sites is found, and their reactivities are extracted from models based on Density Functional Theory calculations. This enables us to determine the chemical activity of clusters in the same range of particle sizes that is accessible experimentally. The variation of reactivity with particle size is in excellent agreement with experiments, and we conclude that the experimentally observed trends are mostly explained by the high reactivity of under-coordinated corner atoms on the gold clusters. Other effects, such as the effect of the substrate, may influence the reactivities significantly, but the presence of under-coordinated atoms is sufficient to explain the overall trend.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aactive sites 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3agold 3amodels 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size1 aGrønbjerg, Ulrik1 aHvolbæk, Britt1 aSchiøtz, Jakob0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 284, no. 1 p.34-41dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2011.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245006700166300001600233520115800249592002801407650002501435650001801460650001701478650002201495650002201517650001701539650001501556650002201571650000901593650001501602650001701617650001501634650002101649650001801670700002401688700002101712773011901733856008401852852000901936655001201945IND4487708220221118054141.0141110e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448770822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2011.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaravanan VS,10aGlobal change, wastewater and health in fast growing economies  ap. 461-466.  aIt is well known that water and sanitation are important to address major water-related diseases. Less known is the impact of continuous exposure to poor water quality on human health in fast growing economies comprising about half of the world's population. Crucial questions persist â Does the economic success of emerging countries translate into improved water management and better human health, or pose additional risks? How does population growth, development of agriculture, industrialisation and urbanisation affect human health in poverty-stricken and undernourished regions? Though science has contributed significantly in addressing the threat from water-related diseases, solutions to these complex problems are still sought in a simple, one-dimensional âcause-effect remedyâ context. This paper calls for scientific and policy initiatives to move beyond this stage to understand the complex links between water and health. In addition, it urges the international community to establish a scientific monitoring and research platform to spearhead the efforts and spread information on improving water quality and human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aglobal change 3ahuman health 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3amonitoring 3apopulation growth 3arisk 3asanitation 3aurbanization 3awastewater 3awater management 3awater quality1 aMollinga, Peter P.,1 aBogardi, Janos J0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2011 Dec., v. 3, no. 6 p.461-466dElsevier B.V.x1877-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2011.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012800169300001600297520136000313592002801673650004401701650002301745650002101768650001401789650001201803650000901815650001901824650001601843700001501859700001701874700002001891700001601911773010901927856008602036990002302122852000902145655001202154IND60102294420221117181742.0141106e20110131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010229442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2010.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaibarac, M.10aHybrid organic–inorganic materials based on poly(o-phenylenediamine) and polyoxometallate functionalized carbon nanotubes  ap. 211-218.  aThe chemical polymerization of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the presence of phosphomolybdic acid (H₃PMo₁₂O₄₀xH₂O) has been studied by surface enhanced resonant Raman scattering (SERRS) spectroscopy. One demonstrates that an organic–inorganic hybrid composite of the type poly(o-phenylenediamine)/polyoxometallate-functionalized SWCNTs is produced by the chemical interaction between polyoxometallate-functionalized SWCNTs and poly(o-phenylenediamine) (POPD) doped with [H₂PMo₁₂O₄₀]⁻ ions. According to TEM investigations, a result of the chemical interaction of SWCNT with H₃PMo₁₂O₄₀xH₂O is the formation into the composite mass of tube fragments of shorter length, which behave like closed shell fullerenes since Raman fingerprint is given by lines situated at 240–275 and 1450–1472cm⁻¹. The chemical polymerization of OPD on SWCNTs achieved in the absence of H₃PMo₁₂O₄₀xH₂O leads to a covalent functionalization of the wall side of the tubes, which is revealed in Raman spectra, recorded at the excitation wavelength of 514nm, by an enhancement of the lines associated with the tangential vibrational modes of SWCNTs. Using FTIR spectroscopy, significant hindrance steric effects are evidenced in the POPD/polyoxometallate-functionalized SWCNT composite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acarbon nanotubes 3afullerene 3ahybrids 3aions 3apolymerization 3awavelengths1 aBaltog, I.1 aSmaranda, I.1 aScocioreanu, M.1 aLefrant, S.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2011 Jan. 31, v. 985, no. 2-3 p.211-218dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2010.10.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011100172300001400283520110000297592002801397650001201425650001601437650001601453650002201469650001601491650002601507650001101533651001901544700002301563700003101586773008901617856008501706990002301791852000901814655001201823IND60101802220221122171236.0141106e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010180222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2012.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmoker, Claire10aPlanktonic biomass variability during a late winter bloom in the subtropical waters off the Canary Islands  ap. 24-31.  aPlanktonic biomass from heterotrophic prokaryotes to mesozooplankton was assessed in the Canary Island waters in order to study the characteristic late winter bloom of subtropical waters. Weekly sampling was performed between January and August 2005 at 6 stations around the island of Gran Canaria. The bloom observed in this study showed the common increase in chlorophyll in February–March. However, the study of the biomass of different components of the planktonic community unveils a succession of peaks of monthly periodicity. The bloom started with an increase in large primary producers and was followed by several alternating peaks of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, microplankton and mesozooplankton. During the period studied, mesozooplankton, autotrophic picoplankton and heterotrophic prokaryotes showed similar trends, whereas nano- and microplankton depicted an inverse pattern. Our results show that the late winter bloom in subtropical waters is much more complex than that inferred from the simple increase in chlorophyll associated with the drop of temperature during winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aperiodicity 3aprokaryotic cells 3atemperature 3atrophic relationships 3awinter 3aCanary Islands1 aArístegui, Javier1 aHernández-León, Santiago0 tJournal of marine systems.g2012 July, v. 95 p.24-31dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2012.01.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011500170300001600285520195900301592002802260650000802288650002102296650002402317650001502341650001302356650001902369650001602388650001602404650001102420650001702431650002102448650002002469650001502489650002602504650001902530650002102549700001902570700002302589700002002612700001502632773012102647856008302768990002302851852000902874655001202883IND60103021120221119221500.0141106e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010302112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2010.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakatsuka, Shogo10aGeneration of a panel of monoclonal antibodies against atypical chemokine receptor CCX-CKR by DNA immunization  ap. 250-257.  aINTRODUCTION: Chemokines are regulated by a family of ‘atypical’ chemokine receptors, D6, DARC and CCX-CKR, each of which efficiently internalizes its cognate chemokine ligands. Development of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that would recognize CCX-CKR on the cell surface will be helpful to identify primary CCX-CKR-expressing cell types and analyze the fate of CCX-CKR after ligand binding to the receptor. METHODS: We generated IgG MAbs recognizing the cell-surface CCX-CKR by DNA immunization using a molecular adjuvant, and analyzed the epitope recognized by the MAbs. Then, the reactivities of the MAbs with CCX-CKR-transfected cells, and also hepatocytes and hepatic tumor lines were evaluated. Finally, we also tested the ligand-like activities of the MAbs, namely, induction of internalization of CCX-CKR by the MAbs. RESULTS: A panel of MAbs reacting with CCX-CKR expressed on the cell surface was prepared. The panel was a small one, consisting of only ten MAbs, but was rich in terms of diversity of the Ig isotypes and of the epitopes. Epitope analyses revealed that all the 10 MAbs recognized at least three different, although very close, peptide structures of the N-terminal domain. Three MAbs, namely, 2F11, 13E11 and 14F10, were selected to represent the panel. All of the MAbs were applicable for flow cytometry and immunoflurescent assays and immunoprecipitation. The reactivity of the 2F11 MAb was also confirmed by western blotting. Endogenous expression of CCX-CKR on human hepatocytes and hepatic tumor cell lines was demonstrated using the 13E11 MAb. Interestingly, binding of the 13E11 MAb with B300-19 cells expressing CCX-CKR resulted in induction of CCX-CKR internalization. DISCUSSION: This panel of MAbs may be expected to prove valuable for further study of the functions of this silent chemokine receptor, including those related to the homeostasis of lymphoid cells, and to the growth and metastasis of hepatic cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3achemokine receptors 3achemokines 3aepitopes 3aflow cytometry 3ahepatocytes 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aliver neoplasms 3ametastasis 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasm cells 3aprecipitin tests1 aSekiguchi, Aya1 aTokunaga, Masayuki1 aFujimoto, Akira1 aChiba, Joe0 tJournal of pharmacological and toxicological methods.g2011 , v. 63, no. 3 p.250-257dElsevier Inc.x1056-87197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2010.12.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009500174300001400269520171900283592002802002650002602030650001402056650001702070650001202087650002002099650004002119650002702159650002502186651001402211651001102225651001002236651001302246653003402259653001902293653003902312653002102351653001002372700002302382700002202405700002302427773009902450856008502549852000902634655001202643IND60111601120221118190648.0190415e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011160112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZscheischler, Jakob10aDetection and attribution of large spatiotemporal extreme events in Earth observation data  ap. 66-73.  aLatest climate projections suggest that both frequency and intensity of climate extremes will be substantially modified over the course of the coming decades. As a consequence, we need to understand to what extent and via which pathways climate extremes affect the state and functionality of terrestrial ecosystems and the associated biogeochemical cycles on a global scale. So far the impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial biosphere were mainly investigated on the basis of case studies, while global assessments are widely lacking. In order to facilitate global analysis of this kind, we present a methodological framework that firstly detects spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in Earth observations, and secondly infers the likely pathway of the preceding climate anomaly. The approach does not require long time series, is computationally fast, and easily applicable to a variety of data sets with different spatial and temporal resolutions. The key element of our analysis strategy is to directly search in the relevant observations for spatiotemporally connected components exceeding a certain percentile threshold. We also put an emphasis on characterization of extreme event distribution, and scrutinize the attribution issue. We exemplify the analysis strategy by exploring the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) from 1982 to 2011. Our results suggest that the hot spots of extremes in fAPAR lie in Northeastern Brazil, Southeastern Australia, Kenya and Tanzania. Moreover, we demonstrate that the size distribution of extremes follow a distinct power law. The attribution framework reveals that extremes in fAPAR are primarily driven by phases of water scarcity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiosphere 3acase studies 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atime series analysis 3aAustralia 3aBrazil 3aKenya 3aTanzania 0aSpatiotemporal extreme events 0aClimate change 0aBiosphere–atmosphere interaction 0aScaling behavior 0afAPAR1 aMahecha, Miguel D.1 aHarmeling, Stefan1 aReichstein, Markus0 tEcological informatics.g2013 May, v. 15 p.66-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010800169300001300277520108200290592002801372650004401400650002201444650001701466650001701483650001301500700001601513700002501529700002701554700002301581700001601604700002401620773008601644856008101730852000901811655001201820IND60110269220221119113610.0141109e20120910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011026922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2012.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandita, Surya D.10aSimultaneous DSC-FTIR spectroscopy: Comparison of cross-linking kinetics of an epoxy/amine resin system  ap. 9-17.  aThe top-cover of a conventional differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was modified to accommodate two custom-made fibre-optic probes. The function of the probes was to illuminate the sample and reference compartments of the DSC and to return the reflected light from the DSC pans to a fibre-coupled Fourier transform near-infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The cross-linking kinetics of a commercially available epoxy/amine resin system were studied using the conventional and modified DSC along with conventional transmission FTIR spectroscopy. The cross-linking kinetics and the activation energies for the epoxy/amine resin system obtained via the conventional DSC and simultaneous DSC/FTIR were similar (60.22–60.97 kJ mol⁻¹). However, the activation energy obtained for the cuvette-based conventional transmission FTIR experiments was found to be lower (54.66 kJ mol⁻¹). This may be attributed to the temperature-control attained within the cuvette holder. The feasibility of using a simple fibre-optic probe to link the DSC to the FTIR spectrometer was demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3acalorimeters 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides1 aWang, Liwei1 aMahendran, Ramani S.1 aMachavaram, Venkata R.1 aIrfan, Muhammad S.1 aHarris, Dee1 aFernando, Gerard F.0 tThermochimica acta.g2012 Sept. 10, v. 543 p.9-17dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2012.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016100173300001600334500001500350520154200365592002801907650001901935650003001954650001101984650001301995650002102008650001802029650001502047650001002062650002302072650001202095650003402107650003002141650002002171650001602191650001902207650001802226650001002244653003202254653002502286653002502311700001902336700002602355700002402381700002102405700002302426700002202449700001902471773008202490856008502572852000902657655001202666IND60110993120221118022359.0141109e20110129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011099312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.11.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonofrio, Gaetano10aSwine adipose stromal cells loaded with recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 virions expressing a foreign antigen induce potent humoral immune responses in pigs  ap. 867-872.  a2019-12-04  aIncreasingly effective vaccination strategies are needed to counteract the high incidence of contagious diseases associated with intensive swine breeding. Recombinant viral vaccines are a promising new avenue in this direction. Key features of viral vectors suitable for immunoprophylaxis are safety, ease of manipulation and the ability to replicate in a variety of hosts. Most of the above requirements are met by bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4), a non-pathogenic dsDNA virus capable of infecting a broad range of cell types in vitro. Here we report the results of an exploratory study using an engineered BoHV-4 virus (eBoHV-4) expressing two unrelated glycoprotein antigens from bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), to assess the potential of recombinant BoHV-4 as a self-adjuvanted immunogen in pigs. Free eBoHV-4 virions and virions preloaded into homologous swine adipose-derived stromal cells (SADSC) were tested. Neither virus formulation elicited neutralizing anti-BoHV-4 antibodies, nor any disease symptom, yet both induced specific immune responses against the heterologous antigens. However, a much earlier (18 vs 28 days post-infection) and more robust neutralizing response against BVDV and BoHV-1 viruses was elicited by eBoHV-4-preinfected SADSCs compared to free virions. The data validate BoHV-4 as a safe and effective heterologous antigen carrier/producer and identify SADSCs as helpful tools for the formulation of increasingly efficacious recombinant immunogens for pig vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutralization 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3avirion 3aantigens 3ahumoral immunity 3astromal cells 3aantibodies 3ahosts 3alivestock breeding 3aviruses 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aBovine gammaherpesvirus 4 3aimmune response 3avaccination 3aviral vaccines 3aglycoproteins 3aswine 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0aBovine herpesvirus 41 aTaddei, Simone1 aFranceschi, Valentina1 aCapocefalo, Antonio1 aCavirani, Sandro1 aMartinelli, Nicola1 aOttonello, Simone1 aFerrari, Maura0 tVaccine.g2011 Jan. 29, v. 29, no. 5 p.867-872dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.11.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014100166300001600307520186200323592002802185650001102213650002302224650001102247650001102258650000902269650001102278650001702289650001302306700001402319773011302333856008502446990002302531852000902554655001202563IND60102286320221121014244.0141106e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010228632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcata.2013.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lizi10aMechanism of gold (I)-catalyzed double migration-benzannulation cascade toward naphthalenes: Deprotonation/protonation mediated by water  ap. 197-206.  aThe mechanisms of the gold (I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization of propargylic esters leading to unsymmetrically substituted naphthalenes have been investigated using density functional theory calculations done at the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) (SDD for Au) level of theory. Solvent effects on these reactions have been explored by calculations that included a polarizable continuum model (PCM) for the solvent (CH₂Cl₂). Three possible pathways which lead to forming 1,3-diene, allene or carbenoid intermediate via an unprecedented tandem sequence of [1,3]- and [1,2]-migration of two different migrating groups were proposed. Calculations suggest that the [1,3]-rearrangement is a two-step process with activation free energies below 11.0kcal/mol for both steps. The following of [1,2]-migration reaction is also easy with an activation free energy of 20.4kcal/mol in CH₂Cl₂. The next step in the catalytic cycle is a [1,2]-hydride shift, and this step is the rate-limiting step (with a calculated activation free energy of 23.2kcal/mol) without water. In the presence of water, the direct [1,2]-hydride shift has been changed into a deprotonation/protonation process with an activation free energy of 9.7kcal/mol. The higher activation free energies for the intramolecular 6π electrocyclic ring closure process indicate that this step became the rate-determining one. Calculations show that a water-catalyzed [1,2]-hydrogen shift adopts a proton-transport catalysis strategy, in which the acetoxy group in the substrate is critical because it acts as either a proton acceptor when one water molecule or a water cluster is involved in catalysis. Our calculated results are consistent with the experimental observations of Gevorgyan et al. for the gold (I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization of propargylic esters leading to unsymmetrically substituted naphthalenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallene 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3aesters 3agold 3amodels 3anaphthalenes 3asolvents1 aFang, Ran0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

In this study, the synthetic utility of the 1,3-oxazinan-6-one is expanded to include the diastereoselective synthesis of cyclic β2,3-amino acids. Enolate chemistry is used to first alkylate the 4-vinyl, 4-allyl, and 4-butenyl oxazinan-6-ones with various alkenyl electrophiles, in high dr. The resulting 4,5-bis-alkene adducts are then transformed into 4,5-cyclic-1,3-oxazinan-6-ones utilizing the ring closing metathesis reaction. The metathesis products are subsequently converted into a variety of five-, six-, and seven-membered cyclic β2,3-amino acids.

The aim was to pharmacologically characterise the expression of endothelin receptors in human liver, hepatic artery and portal vein. MAIN METHODS: Immunofluorescence staining, receptor autoradiography and competition binding assays were used to localise and quantify ET receptors on hepatic parenchyma, hepatic artery and portal vein in human cirrhotic or normal liver. Additional experiments were performed to determine the affinity and selectivity of ET antagonists for liver ET endothelin receptors. An endothelial cell ETB knockout murine model was used to examine the function of sinusoid endothelial ETB receptors. KEY FINDINGS: ETB receptors predominated in normal human liver and displayed the highest ratio (ETB:ETA 63:47) compared with other peripheral tissues. In two patients examined, liver ETB expression was up-regulated in cirrhosis (ETB:ETA 83:17). Both sub-types localised to the media of normal portal vein but ETB receptors were downregulated fivefold in the media of cirrhotic portal vein. Sinusoid diameter was fourfold smaller in endothelial cell ETB knockout mice. The liver morphology of ETB knockout mice was markedly different to normal murine liver, with loss of the wide spread sinusoidal pattern. In the knockout mice, sinusoids were reduced in both number and absolute diameter, while large intrahepatic veins were congested with red blood cells. SIGNIFICANCE: These data support a role for the ET system in cirrhosis of the liver and suggest that endothelial ETB blockade may cause sinusoidal constriction which may contribute to hepatotoxicity associated with some endothelin antagonists.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver cirrhosis 3ahepatic artery 3aendothelial cells 3aautoradiography 3ahumans 3aantagonists 3aliver 3aportal vein 3aerythrocytes 3amice 3aanimal models 3apatients 3aportal hypertension 3areceptors 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahepatotoxicity 0aparenchyma1 aKuc, Rhoda E.1 aMaguire, Janet J.1 aDavie, Neil J.1 aWebb, David J.1 aGibbs, Paul1 aAlexander, Graeme J.M.1 aDavenport, Anthony P.0 tLife sciences.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 91, no. 13-14 p.716-722dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2012.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01640naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245021100171300001800382520062800400592002801028650002301056650002301079650001101102700002001113700001901133700001901152773008901171856008101260852000901341655001201350IND60109557820221122054400.0141109e20121125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010955782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.08.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuoka, Shin-ichi10aSequential one-pot and three-component reactions of an N-heterocyclic carbene to form 4-(1,2,4-triazol-5-ylidene)pyrrolidine-2,5-diones: a tandem umpolung/annulation sequence via deoxy-Breslow intermediates  ap. 9836-9841.  aThe tandem sequence of the umpolung of α,β-unsaturated esters by an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) followed by annulation is demonstrated.

The intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ) is therefore an important readout in neurotoxicological and neuropharmacological studies. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for high-throughput measurements of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ, e.g. using multi-well microplate readers, in hazard characterization, human risk assessment and drug development. However, changes in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ are highly dynamic, thereby creating challenges for high-throughput measurements. Nonetheless, several protocols are now available for real-time kinetic measurement of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ in plate reader systems, though the results of such plate reader-based measurements have been questioned. In view of the increasing use of plate reader systems for measurements of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ a careful evaluation of current technologies is warranted. We therefore performed an extensive set of experiments, using two cell lines (PC12 and B35) and two fluorescent calcium-sensitive dyes (Fluo-4 and Fura-2), for comparison of a linear plate reader system with single cell fluorescence microscopy. Our data demonstrate that the use of plate reader systems for high-throughput real-time kinetic measurements of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ is associated with many pitfalls and limitations, including erroneous sustained increases in fluorescence, limited sensitivity and lack of single cell resolution. Additionally, our data demonstrate that probenecid, which is often used to prevent dye leakage, effectively inhibits the depolarization-evoked increase in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ. Overall, the data indicate that the use of current plate reader-based strategies for high-throughput real-time kinetic measurements of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ is associated with caveats and limitations that require further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adrugs 3adyes 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahazard characterization 3ahumans1 aWesterink, Remco H.S.0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 255, no. 1 p.1-8dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2011.05.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245017700175300001400352520111000366592002801476650002201504650001001526650002301536650002301559650001101582650001101593650002301604650002201627650001501649650001101664650004401675650001701719650000901736700002901745700001601774700002001790773011101810856008501921990002302006852000902029655001202038IND60102286520221121014240.0141106e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010228652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcata.2013.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Divya Pratap10aSynthesis, characterization and catalytic application of some novel binuclear transition metal complexes of bis-(2-acetylthiophene) oxaloyldihydrazone for CN bond formation  ap. 21-29.  aIn the present work, synthesis, characterization and catalytic properties of some novel complexes derived from a Schiff base bis-(2-acetylthiophene) oxaloyldihydrazone with various transition metal ions and precursors have been reported.

We studied two groups of rats: RHRSP and normal controls. Blood flow velocity of middle cerebral artery was monitored by TCD and arterial blood pressure was recorded in right femoral artery to compute the ZFP. The value of LLCA was determined as the difference between MABP and ZFP and validated by the value determined by blood withdrawal-induced cerebral autoregulation. In normal rats, the LLCA derived from the new method was 69.8 ± 8.7 mm Hg, from the change of blood velocity was 69.4 ± 9.8 mmHg and from blood volume flow after blood withdrawal was 68.8 ± 9.7 mmHg. In the RHRSP group, the corresponding values of LLCA were 109.1 ± 17.2 mm Hg, 110.0 ± 18.0 mm Hg and 109.0 ± 19.3 mm Hg, respectively. In each group, there was no statistically significant difference among the three values. LLCA in RHRSP began to increase 6 weeks after hypertension-induced operation, significantly higher than controls (p < 0.05), and stabilized at 110 mm Hg, 10 weeks after operation. The increase of LLCA was positively correlated with MABP, following an “S” curve, demonstrating that the change of LLCA was more obvious in the middle range of MABP in RHRSP (R² = 0.8848, p < 0.05). In conclusion, TCD is a valid and noninvasive method for determination of LLCA compared with the classic method in rats. Our data demonstrated that the change of LLCA may be correlated with MABP, following an “S” curve relationship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoregulation 3ablood 3ablood flow 3ablood pressure 3ablood volume 3acorrelation 3amethodology 3arats1 aFu, Xian1 aChen, Xiang Yan1 aZeng, Jin Sheng1 aHuang, Ru Xun0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2012 July, v. 38, no. 7 p.1244-1250dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.03.0063Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01189naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013500161300001800296520023700314592002800551650002300579650002300602650001600625650001700641700001800658700001800676700001400694773008900708856008100797852000900878655001200887IND60109558020221122054434.0141109e20121125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010955802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.08.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lijun10aAcid-catalyzed regioselective sulfamination of γ-amino–alkenes and stereoselective rearrangement of pyrrolidines to piperidines  ap. 9853-9859.  aThis paper describes efficient acid-catalyzed regioselective sulfamination of γ-amino–alkenes to form pyrrolidines and stereoselective rearrangement of pyrrolidines to piperidines.

But a great resurgence of interest in biogas capture – hence methane capture – has occurred in recent years due to the rapidly growing spectre of global warming. Anthropogenic causes which directly or indirectly release methane into the atmosphere, are responsible for as much as a third of the overall additional global warming that is occurring at present. Hence the dual advantage of methane capture – generating energy while controlling global warming – have come to the fore. This paper presents an overview of the natural and the anthropogenic sources that contribute methane to the atmosphere. In this context it underscores the urgency with which the world must develop and enforce methods and practices to enhance methane capture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3amethane1 aTauseef, S.M.1 aAbbasi, S.A.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 June, v. 16, no. 5 p.3228-3242dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.02.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03168naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012200166300001400288520170000302592002802002650001702030650002502047650001502072650001702087650001602104650001102120650001702131650001602148650001902164650002202183650002202205650001602227651001902243653001302262653001802275653002902293653002902322653001602351653001902367700001602386700001402402700001802416700001702434700001702451773010002468856008502568852000902653655001202662IND60111601520221118190651.0190415e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011160152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Bangyi10aInfluence of bio-optical parameter variability on the reflectance peak position in the red band of algal bloom waters  ap. 17-24.  aOn the basis of field measurements, the quantitatively different relationships of peak position in the red band of the remote sensing reflectance vs. Chl concentration are found in the bloom waters of the diatom Skeletonema costatum and the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum donghaiense in coastal areas of the East China Sea. Model simulations of remote sensing reflectance, Rrs, accounting for the influence of variations in the bio-optical parameters such as chlorophyll fluorescence quantum efficiency, Φ, and specific absorption coefficient, aph⁎, are carried out to analyze the characteristics of this spectral peak. The strong effect of fluorescence on the magnitude of Rrs results in the inhibition of the shift of the peak to longer wavelengths, increasing Φ enhances this effect. Increasing aph⁎, specifically in the red-wavelength band, causes a sharper shift in the red peak position by decreasing the effect of the fluorescence. The dominant parameter governing the slope of the shift is aph⁎. The analysis indicates that the higher aph⁎ of S. costatum in the red region is primarily responsible for the much higher slope of the peak shift than for that of P. donghaiense. We show that the relationship between the peak position and Chl concentration may be useful for discriminating S. costatum blooms from those due to P. donghaiense, although information about chlorophyll fluorescence quantum efficiency should be included. Finally, we show that using the band ratio Rrs(708nm)/Rrs(665nm) instead of Chl in the relationship with peak position can be useful for the practical identification of S. costatum blooms from hyperspectral measurements of remote sensing reflectance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProrocentrum 3aSkeletonema costatum 3aabsorbance 3aalgal blooms 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3afluorescence 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asimulation models 3aspectral analysis 3awavelengths 3aEast China Sea 0aRed band 0aPeak position 0aPhytoplankton absorption 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aAlgal bloom 0aRemote sensing1 aMao, Zhihua1 aPan, Delu1 aShen, Yuzhang1 aZhu, Qiankun1 aChen, Jianyu0 tEcological informatics.g2013 July, v. 16 p.17-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2190x1574-95417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2013.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01427naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008400167300001600251520031300267592002800580650001400608650001300622650001400635650001400649650002300663650001200686650001400698650001400712700002300726700001400749700001700763700001300780700001800793773011300811856008500924990002301009852000901032655001201041IND60102286620221120233343.0141106e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010228662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcata.2013.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKishore, R.10aPd/Mg–La mixed oxide catalyzed oxidative sp² CH bond acylation with alcohols  ap. 213-218.  aPd/Mg–La mixed oxide is used as an efficient catalyst for the oxidative direct acylation of arene sp² CH bonds with alcohols.

Cardiomyocytes derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells are a robust model for the study of early cardiomyogenesis. Here, we evaluated the effects of TCDD at key stages during the differentiation of mouse ES cells into cardiomyocytes analysing: (i) the transcription of lineage differentiation (Brachyury, Nkx-2.5, Actc-1), cardiac-specific (Alpk3, cTnT, cTnI, cTnC) and detoxification phase I (Cyp1A1, Cyp1A2 and Cyp1B1) and phase II (Nqo1, Gsta1 and Ugt1a6) genes; (ii) the global gene expression; (iii) the ultrastructure of ES-derived cardiomyocytes; (iv) level of ATP production and (v) the immunolocalisation of sarcomeric α-actinin, β-myosin heavy chain and cTnT proteins. We show that TCDD affects the differentiation of ES cells into cardiomyocytes at several levels: (1) induces the expression of phase I genes; (2) down-regulates a group of heart-specific genes, some involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway; (3) reduces the efficiency of differentiation; (4) alters the arrangement of mitochondria, that show twisted and disrupted cristae, and of some sarcomeres, with misalignement or disarrangement of the myofibrillar organisation and (5) reduces ATP production. This study provides novel evidences that TCDD impairs cardiomyocyte differentiation. Sarcomeres and mitochondria could be a target for dioxin toxicity, their disruption representing a possible mechanism developing cardiac injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3asarcomeres 3amodels 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aadenosine triphosphate 3agene expression 3amice 3agenes 3aembryonic stem cells 3amitochondria 3atoxicity 3aultrastructure 3agene expression regulation 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 0acardiomyocytes 0aheart1 aMerico, Valeria1 aFiordaliso, Fabio1 aSalio, Monica1 aRebuzzini, Paola1 aSacchi, Lucia1 aBellazzi, Riccardo1 aRedi, Carlo Alberto1 aZuccotti, Maurizio1 aGaragna, Silvia0 tToxicology letters.g2011 May 10, v. 202, no. 3 p.226-236dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.02.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006300166300001800229520071900247592002800966650002300994650002301017650001701040650001501057650001501072650001201087700001701099700001901116700002201135700002601157700002301183773009701206856008401303852000901387655001201396IND60110028520221118233926.0141109e20121212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011002852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoons, Nico10aFused derivatives of (iso)steviol via pericyclic reactions  ap. 6806-6809.  aRecently, the diterpenoids steviol and isosteviol, respectively the aglycone and its rearrangement product of the steviol glycosides, have gained a growing interest.

The results indicated that the fly ashes mainly consisted of hematite, magnetite, cyanite, spinel, coesite and amorphous materials. The concentrations of Zn and Pb were much higher than that of other materials. After Zn and Pb, Ni was present in the highest concentration, followed by Cu, Cr and Cd. Each heavy metal was distributed differently in fly ashes. The levels of Zn, Cd and Pb in the active fraction were very high, and ranged from 64.83 to 81.96%, 34.48 to 82.4% and 6.92 to 79.65% respectively, while Cu, Cr and Ni were mainly present in the residual fraction. The risk assessment code (RAC) values of fly ashes showed that the Zn and Cd present in the H3 sample presented a very high risk, with RAC values greater than 50%. The Cu present in the H3 sample, Cd in the H2 sample and Zn in the H4 and H5 samples presented a high risk. The Pb present in the H2 sample, Cd in the H4 sample, Ni in the H1 and H5 samples, and Zn in the H1 sample presented a medium risk. A low risk was presented by the Cu present in the H1, H2, H4 and H5 samples, the Pb in the H1, H3 and H5 samples, the Cd in the H1 and H5 samples, and the Ni in the H2 sample. No risk was presented by Cr in any sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3abags 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3afly ash 3aheavy metals 3ahematite 3alead 3amagnetite 3anickel 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3azinc 0aWaste filter bag 0aHeavy metal 0aEnvironmental risk assessment 0aBCR 0aSteel plant1 aNing, Xun-an1 aLiao, Xikai1 aLin, Meiqing1 aLiu, Jingyong1 aWang, Jianghui0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 Sept. 01, v. 95 p.130-136dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100003100192245011300223300001400336506007600350520198400426592002802410506003702438650003102475650001302506650001802519650001402537650001602551650000902567650001102576650001702587650001302604650002002617650002102637650001202658650003302670650001302703650001302716650001202729700002302741700001902764700001602783700002602799773010402825856008502929852000903014655001203023IND60101070820221207095723.0141105e20130410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010107082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.01.0072doi7 aPMC37128332pmcid7 a233212742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChennamaneni, Srinivas Rao10aDevelopment of a novel bioerodible dexamethasone implant for uveitis and postoperative cataract inflammation  ap. 53-59.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDelivery of anti-inflammatory steroids concurrently to both anterior and posterior segments of the eye is a challenge. The anterior ocular structures limit topical delivery. Injection can be disproportionately and repeatedly invasive and selective for only one ocular hemisphere. We developed a novel implant that can compensate for the limited conveyance of topical medicine and reduce the repetitive invasiveness of injection from the capsular bag allowing dexamethasone (DXM) delivery to both the anterior and posterior chambers. To establish proof of concept, microparticles were prepared with PLGA [poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide), 50:50, MW. 7000–17000], hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and DXM by oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation technique. Zeatsizer Nano and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) results showed microspheres in the range of 8±1µm. The target load of DXM in the microparticles was ~20.0% with a % recovery of 99.9% (w/w). Dose related pharmacokinetics with near zero order kinetics was observed for up to 6weeks in rabbits with intracapsular bag implants. DXM flow was bidirectional from the endocapsular space and significant concentrations were found in the anterior and posterior chambers after up to 6weeks. Whereas, with topical drops the exposure was minimal in all the ocular tissues with greater systemic exposure. Intraocular pressure was normal in all of the study groups; slit lamp biomicroscopy examinations revealed that no cells or fibrin formation in the anterior and posterior chamber with implants but flare, cells and fibrin was present in the topical drops group. Histological examination revealed normal tissues and no signs of inflammation in all the groups. The implant did not migrate to the center of the eye or obstruct the visual axis. We believe these findings demonstrate the feasibility of drug delivery from the capsular bag to the anterior and posterior segments effectively compared to topical alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acataract 3adexamethasone 3aemulsions 3aevaporation 3aeyes 3afibrin 3ainflammation 3amedicine 3amethylcellulose 3apharmacokinetics 3arabbits 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asteroids 3atissues1 aMamalis, Christina1 aArcher, Bonnie1 aOakey, Zack1 aAmbati, Balamurali K.0 tJournal of controlled release.g2013 Apr. 10, v. 167, no. 1 p.53-59dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01878naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245007600215300001400291520084200305592002801147650001001175650001401185650001501199650002801214650001701242650001201259650002901271700002301300773009201323856008101415990002301496852000901519655001201528IND60110736120221120092856.0141109e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011073612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tcb.2011.10.0042doi7 aPMC32988162pmcid7 a221540772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarostina, Natalia G.10aMultiple degradation pathways regulate versatile CIP/KIP CDK inhibitors  ap. 33-41.  aThe mammalian CIP/KIP family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (CKIs) comprises three proteins – p21Cⁱᵖ¹/ᵂᴬF¹, p27ᴷⁱᵖ¹, and p57ᴷⁱᵖ² – that bind and inhibit cyclin–CDK complexes, which are key regulators of the cell cycle. CIP/KIP CKIs have additional independent functions in regulating transcription, apoptosis and actin cytoskeletal dynamics. These divergent functions are performed in distinct cellular compartments and contribute to the seemingly contradictory observation that the CKIs can both suppress and promote cancer. Multiple ubiquitin ligases (E3s) direct the proteasome-mediated degradation of p21, p27 and p57. This review analyzes recent data highlighting our current understanding of how distinct E3 pathways regulate subpopulations of the CKIs to control their diverse functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acytoskeleton 3amammals 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aKipreos, Edward T.0 tTrends in cell biology.g2012 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.33-41dElsevier Ltdx0962-89247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcb.2011.10.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01638naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006700166300001800233520070300251592002800954650001200982650001300994650002301007650002301030650001101053650002001064650001301084650001801097700001801115773008901133856008101222852000901303655001201312IND60109483720221118091339.0141109e20120422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010948372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.02.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedotti, Sonia10aMild hydrolytic cleavage of α-ferrocenylalkyl-O-methyl ethers  ap. 3300-3305.  aThe conversion of α-ferrocenylalkyl-O-methyl ethers into the corresponding alcohols was successfully achieved by solvolysis in water/acetone mixtures.

The present study was designed to observe the gender-dependent difference of GSH antioxidant system and its influence on hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid (HPA) isoline-induced liver injury. Lower activities and protein expressions of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were found in male mice livers than in female. Isoline is a natural HPA, our further results showed that male mice demonstrated more higher serum ALT/AST levels, less GSH amounts, lower GCL and GPx activities and proteins induced by isoline as compared to female. N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), which is the precursor of cellular GSH biosynthesis, ameliorated liver injury induced by isoline. l-Buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO) and mercaptosuccinic acid (MA), inhibitors of GCL and GPx, both augmented isoline-induced cytotoxicity in cultured mice hepatocytes. BSO and MA also increased other natural HPAs clivorine and senecionine-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results demonstrated the higher GCL and GPx activities in female mice, which indicated their crucial roles in regulating the resistance of liver injury induced by hepatotoxins in female. Meanwhile, our results also revealed the female-resistant liver injury induced by HPAs for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcysteine 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiosynthesis 3ablood serum 3acytotoxicity 3aglutamate-cysteine ligase 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahepatotoxins 3aliver 3amice 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3atoxicology1 aSheng, Yuchen1 aJiang, Ping1 aJi, Lili1 aXia, Yuye1 aMin, Yang1 aWang, Zhengtao0 tToxicology.g2011 Feb. 4, v. 280, no. 1-2 p.61-69dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0300-483X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2010.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012000168300001400288520202400302592002802326650001802354650001802372650001902390650001902409650001002428650001202438650001802450650001802468650002502486650001202511650002502523650004302548650000902591700001502600700002002615700002402635700002302659700002202682700002202704773011902726856008302845990002302928852000902951655001202960IND60103019120221119223238.0141106e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010301912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2010.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeague, Joanne10aReversibility of hyperglycaemia and islet abnormalities in the high fat-fed female ZDF rat model of type 2 diabetes  ap. 15-23.  aINTRODUCTION: We characterised the development of Type 2 diabetes and associated changes in islet appearance in female ZDF rats and explored its suitability for studies with novel therapeutic agents. METHODS: Female ZDF rats were either chow or high fat (60%) fed for up to 36days and blood glucose and plasma insulin concentration measured. Additionally, we restored two groups of rats back to chow diet after ten and nineteen days of high fat feeding to determine the reversibility. Finally, two other groups of high fat-fed animals were dosed either orally with drug vehicle or had a minipump implanted subcutaneously to determine the effect of dosing method upon the progression of this disease model. The beta cell mass and morphology were assessed by immunohistochemistry for insulin. RESULTS: High fat feeding elevated blood glucose compared to chow-fed controls which peaked by 15days, and maintained throughout the study. Plasma insulin reached a maximum after 8days, but declined over the remaining 4weeks. Assessment of islets revealed marked disruption, dispersion and weaker insulin staining. The area and percentage β-cells were higher in high fat-fed animals. High fat diet treatment reversal when animals were moderately hyperglycaemic, when plasma insulin was still elevated, reversed the hyperglycaemia and maintained islet morphology similar to that of chow-fed animals. In contrast, dietary reversal when plasma insulin was declining, did not prevent continual decline in plasma insulin, β-cell mass or islet disruption. Oral dosing tended to increase blood glucose and decrease plasma insulin whereas administration by minipump lowered blood glucose. DISCUSSION: The obese female ZDF rat offers the opportunity for preclinical evaluation of novel therapies directed towards improving pancreatic function, provided treatment is initiated prior to the precipitous decline in insulin production. Caution should be exercised in comparison of compounds administered by different dosing routes however.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3ablood glucose 3adisease course 3adisease models 3adrugs 3afemales 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperglycemia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsulin 3aislets of Langerhans 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3arats1 aGyte, Amie1 aPeel, Joanne E.1 aYoung, Kimberley C.1 aLoxham, Susan J.G.1 aMayers, Rachel M.1 aPoucher, Simon M.0 tJournal of pharmacological and toxicological methods.g2011 , v. 63, no. 1 p.15-23dElsevier Inc.x1056-87197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vascn.2010.04.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015500168300001800323520072200341592002801063650002301091650001301114650001801127650002201145700002401167700002301191700002001214773008901234856008101323852000901404655001201413IND60109483820221118091308.0141109e20120422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010948382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2012.02.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMargetic, Davor,12aA cascade thermal isomerisation of cyclobutane di-(carbomethoxy) Δ²-1,2,3-triazolines with intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloreversion as the key step  ap. 3306-3318.  aUnprecedented thermal isomerisation of the strained Δ²-1,2,3-triazolines led to the formation of products possessing a novel 1,2,7-triaza-[3.3.0]octa-2-ene ring system incorporated in a norbornane framework.

The normal-phase gradient separation, which is based on an adsorption–desorption mechanism, uses a multi-step gradient of dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH) on a bare silica column as stationary phase. Applicability of the developed multi-step gradient allows separating CAs within the DS-range DS = 1.5–2.9, which is the target DS-range for most CA applications. To the best of our knowledge the developed method for the first time allows determination of the DS-distribution of intact CA chains over a wide DS-range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acellulose 3achromatography 3amethanol 3amethylene chloride 3apolymers 3asilica1 aRadke, Wolfgang0 tPolymer.g2013 May 9, v. 54, no. 11 p.2632-2638dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.03.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01725naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010400168300001800272520068700290592002800977650002101005650002301026650002301049650001901072650002201091650001301113650001801126650001701144700001901161700001701180773009701197856008401294852000901378655001201387IND60110028720221118233518.0141109e20121212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011002872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamous, Mazen10aDOTA-tris(OPp ester) as a bifunctional prochelator for the preparation of DOTA–peptide conjugates  ap. 6810-6814.  aPeptides containing the chelator DOTA have gained importance for molecular imaging and therapy with radionuclides. However, all synthons described for the convergent solid phase synthesis of DOTA–peptide conjugates show windows of stability that are too narrow to allow a clean and convergent deprotection process. The synthesis of the new prochelator DOTA-tris(OPp ester) starting from cyclen is reported. Using this prochelator for the synthesis of several DOTA peptide conjugates revealed that its cleavage—in contrast to the cleavage of DOTA-tris(tBu ester) conjugates—does not require an extended deprotection time, and therefore results in clean and homogenous products.  aPublisher supplied data 3achelating agents 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aimage analysis 3aorganic compounds 3apeptides 3aradionuclides 3atherapeutics1 aHaberkorn, Uwe1 aMier, Walter0 tTetrahedron letters.g2012 Dec. 12, v. 53, no. 50 p.6810-6814dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245005000165300001600215520107100231592002801302650002201330650002001352650002301372650001501395650001701410700001301427700001601440773011501456856008201571852000901653655001201662IND60100812820221121230615.0141105e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010081282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRisović, D.14aThe Structure of Percolating Lipid Monolayers  ap. 116-121.  aThe lattice structure and in plane molecular organization of Langmuir monolayer of amphiphilic material is usually determined from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) or neutron reflectivity. Here we present results of a different approach for determination of monolayer lattice structure based on application of fractal analysis and percolation theory in combination with Brewster angle microscopy. The considerations of compressibility modulus and fractal dimension dynamics provide information on percolation threshold and consequently by application of percolation theory on the lattice structure of a monolayer. We have applied this approach to determine the monolayer lattice structures of single chain and double chain lipids. The compressibility moduli were determined from measured π-A isotherms and fractal dimensions from corresponding BAM images. The monolayer lattice structures of stearic acid, 1-hexadecanol, DPPC and DPPA, obtained in this way conform to the corresponding lattice structures determined previously by other authors using GIXD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acompressibility 3afractal dimensions 3amicroscopy 3astearic acid1 aFrka, S.1 aKozarac, Z.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 May 1, v. 373, no. 1 p.116-121dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014200173300001600315520093900331592002801270650002101298650002201319650002401341650001101365650002001376650001701396650001401413650001601427650002501443700002201468700001701490700002201507700002601529773008101555856008401636852000901720655001201729IND60108136120221122095328.0141108e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010813612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2012.12.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavinato, Cristina10aMesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic co-digestion of waste activated sludge and source sorted biowaste in pilot- and full-scale reactors  ap. 260-265.  aThe paper presents the results of a pilot- and full-scale experimental campaign on the anaerobic co-digestion of waste activated sludge and biowaste both in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The study demonstrated the possibility to increase the specific biogas production from 0.34 to 0.49 m³/kgTVS and the gas production rate from 0.53 to 0.78 m³per m³ of reactor per day changing the reactor temperature from the mesophilic (37 °C) to the thermophilic (55 °C) range. The experimental work was carried out at pilot-scale, and the results match the full-scale behaviour. Ammonia nitrogen recycled from the anaerobic digestion section to the wastewater treatment plant accounted for about 4% of the total nitrogen loading. Digestate characteristics in terms of biological stability and heavy metals content suggested the opportunity of a short time post-aerobic stabilisation, leading to a high quality compost product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3acompost quality 3aheavy metals 3arecycling 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment1 aBolzonella, David1 aPavan, Paolo1 aFatone, Francesco1 aCecchi, F.q(Franco),0 tRenewable energy.g2013 July, v. 55 p.260-265dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2012.12.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245018600170300001600356520129800372592002801670650001601698650002001714650001801734650001701752650001401769650001401783650003401797653000801831653001001839653001401849700002301863700002701886700001501913700001901928700002001947773011301967856008102080852000902161655001202170IND60104645220221119092824.0161020e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010464522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMijiddorj, Tselmeg10aProlonged stimulation with thyrotropin-releasing hormone and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide desensitize their receptor functions in prolactin-producing GH3 cells  ap. 139-145.  aWe used somatolactotroph GH3 cells to examine changes in response to stimulation with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) after sustained treatment with these peptides. TRH and PACAP increased prolactin promoter activity in mock- and PACAP type 1 receptor (PAC1R)-transfected cells. When the cells were pretreated with TRH for 48h, the response of the prolactin promoter to both TRH and PACAP was diminished. Similarly, in PAC1R-transfected GH3 cells pretreated with PACAP, the effects of TRH and PACAP on the prolactin promoter were eliminated. The stimulation of prolactin mRNA expression by TRH and PACAP was eliminated by prolonged pretreatment with these peptides in PAC1R-transfected cells. Both the serum response element (SRE) promoters and cAMP response element (CRE) promoters were activated by TRH and PACAP in either mock- or PAC1R-transfected cells. Pretreatment for 48h with TRH also eliminated the effects of TRH and PACAP on the SRE and CRE promoters, and pretreatment of PAC1R-transfected cells with PACAP for 48h reduced the responses of the SRE and CRE promoters to TRH and PACAP. These observations demonstrated that sustained stimulation with TRH and PACAP desensitizes their own and each other’s receptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3apolypeptides 3aprolactin 3areceptors 3athyrotropin-releasing hormone 0aTRH 0aPACAP 0aProlactin1 aKanasaki, Haruhiko1 aUnurjargal, Sukhbaatar1 aOride, Aki1 aPurwana, Indri1 aMiyazaki, Kohji0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 365 p.139-145dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001400188245009000202300001400292506007600306520117600382592002801558506003701586650002201623650001201645650002201657650003101679650001601710650001401726650002301740650001601763650002701779650003601806650002201842650003101864650002601895650005701921650002501978650002302003700001902026700001402045700001302059700001902072773010102091856008102192852000902273655001202282IND60102097920221207141912.0141106e20110805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010209792DNAL7 a215548882pmid7 aPMC31711992pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Ning10aCrucial Points within the Pore as Determinants of K⁺ Channel Conductance and Gating  ap. 27-35.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWhile selective for K⁺, K⁺ channels vary significantly among their rate of ion permeation. Here, we probe the effect of steric hindrance and electrostatics within the ion conduction pathway on K⁺ permeation in the MthK K⁺ channel using structure-based mutagenesis combined with single-channel electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. We demonstrate that changes in side-chain size and polarity at Ala88, which forms the constriction point of the open MthK pore, have profound effects on single-channel conductance as well as open probability. We also reveal that the negatively charged Glu92s at the intracellular entrance of the open pore form an electrostatic trap, which stabilizes a hydrated K⁺ and facilitates ion permeation. This electrostatic attraction is also responsible for intracellular divalent blockage, which renders the channel inward rectified in the presence of Ca²⁺. In light of the high structural conservation of the selectivity filter, the size and chemical environment differences within the portion of the ion conduction pathway other than the filter are likely the determinants for the conductance variations among K⁺ channels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalcium 3aelectrophysiology 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amutagenesis 3apotassium 3apotassium channels 3aprobability 2aCrystallography, X-Ray 2aMethanobacteriaceaexenzymology 2aModels, Molecular 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aPotassium Channelsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Conformation 2aStatic Electricity1 aZeng, Weizhong1 aYe, Sheng1 aLi, Yang1 aJiang, Youxing0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 Aug. 5, v. 411, no. 1 p.27-35dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.04.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013800166300001600304520075400320592002801074650001101102650001301113650001601126650001201142650001301154700002001167700001601187773008801203856008401291990002301375852000901398655001201407IND60104024420221120183425.0141107e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010402442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Wenquan10aSegregation driven by collision and coagulation of minor droplets in Al–Bi immiscible alloys under aerodynamic levitation condition  ap. 340-343.  aThe effect of collision and coagulation of minor droplets in Al–Bi immiscible alloys under aerodynamic levitation condition on the segregation structure was investigated. It was shown that the minor droplets were dominated by Marangoni motion at the initial stage of the liquid phase separation, while the centrifugal and Stokes motions were strengthened gradually with increasing the droplets radius. Analysis reveals that three segregation morphologies with Al/Bi core–shell structures can be obtained by controlling the cooling rate under aerodynamic levitation. The dimensionless average droplet radius, which characterizes the coagulation degree of minor droplets, increases rapidly with time and dramatically with the minor droplet radius.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3acoagulation 3acooling 3adroplets1 aZhang, Shuguang1 aLi, Jianguo0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 107 p.340-343dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2013.06.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013100166300001600297520077200313592002801085650001601113650001101129650001401140650003801154650001301192650002301205650002601228650001101254650004401265650001701309650001901326650002001345700002001365700002001385700002101405700002101426773009701447856008201544852000901626655001201635IND60100271720221119104447.0141105e20111027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010027172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2011.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckmann, Udo10aNickel(II) catalysed co-polymerisation of CO and ethene: Formation of polyketone vs. polyethylene – The role of co-catalysts  ap. 143-148.  aThe square planar Ni complex (SP-4-3)-[Ni(2-tol)(PPh₃)(N,O)] (N,O=(Z)-4,4,5,5,6,6,6-heptafluoro-3-oxo-2-(pyrrolidine-2-ylidene)-hexanenitrile) is an active catalyst for the co-polymerisation of CO and ethene yielding aliphatic polyketone.

Previous purification methods from prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems were challenged by low protein solubility accompanied by multi purification steps resulting in poor protein recovery. The full-length VDR and its ligand binding domain (LBD) were mostly (>90%) insoluble even when expressed at low temperatures in the bacterial system. We describe a one-step procedure that results in the purification of rat VDR and LBD proteins in high-yield from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. The heterologously expressed protein constructs retained full function as demonstrated by ligand binding and DNA binding assays. Furthermore, we describe an efficient strategy for labeling these proteins with ²H, ¹³C, and ¹⁵N for structural and functional studies by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This efficient production system will facilitate future studies on the mechanism of vitamin D action including characterization of the large number of synthetic vitamin D analogs that have been developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3acalcium phosphates 3adeuterium 3ahomeostasis 3ainclusion bodies 3aisotope labeling 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotein solubility 3aproteins 3apurification methods 3arats 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3avitamin D1 aRao, Hongyu1 aTonelli, Marco1 aWestler, William M.1 aSingarapu, Kiran K.1 aMarkley, John L.1 aDeLuca, Hector F.1 aAssadi-Porter, Fariba M.0 tProtein expression and purification.g2012 Sept., v. 85, no. 1 p.25-31dElsevier Inc.x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2012.06.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002500191245006400216300001600280506007600296520105900372592002801431506003701459650001801496650002001514650003201534650002101566700002501587773008301612856008401695852000901779655001201788IND60104797420221207134718.0161023e20131226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010479742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2013.10.0202doi7 aPMC38771862pmcid7 a242685792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeeles, Joseph T.P.10aDynamics of Leading-Strand Lesion Skipping by the Replisome  ap. 855-865.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe E. coli replisome stalls transiently when it encounters a lesion in the leading-strand template, skipping over the damage by reinitiating replication at a new primer synthesized downstream by the primase. We report here that template unwinding and lagging-strand synthesis continue downstream of the lesion at a reduced rate after replisome stalling, that one replisome is capable of skipping multiple lesions, and that the rate-limiting steps of replication restart involve the synthesis and activation of the new primer downstream. We also find little support for the concept that polymerase uncoupling, where extensive lagging-strand synthesis proceeds downstream in the absence of leading-strand synthesis, involves physical separation of the leading-strand polymerase from the replisome. Instead, our data indicate that extensive uncoupled replication likely results from a failure of the leading-strand polymerase still associated with the DNA helicase and the lagging-strand polymerase that are proceeding downstream to reinitiate synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA helicases 3aDNA replication 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aEscherichia coli1 aMarians, Kenneth J.0 tMolecular cell.g2013 Dec. 26, v. 52 p.855-865dElsevier Inc.x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2013.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245005300170300001600223520113000239592002801369650001001397650001701407650001801424650001701442700002401459700001901483700001901502773010601521856008501627852000901712655001201721IND60101043720221122223036.0141105e20120720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010104372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuhmann, Tessa10aBone targeting for the treatment of osteoporosis  ap. 198-213.  aOsteoporosis represents a major public health burden especially considering the aging populations worldwide. Drug targeting will be important to better meet these challenges and direct the full therapeutic potential of therapeutics to their intended site of action. This review has been organized in modules, such that scientists working in the field can easily gain specific insight in the field of bone targeting for the drug class they are interested in. We review currently approved and emerging treatment options for osteoporosis and discuss these in light of the benefit these would gain from advanced targeting. In addition, established targeting strategies are reviewed and novel opportunities as well as promising areas are presented along with pharmaceutical strategies how to render novel composites consisting of a drug and a targeting moiety responsive to bone-specific or disease-specific environmental stimuli. Successful implementation of these principles into drug development programs for osteoporosis will substantially contribute to the clinical success of anti-catabolic and anabolic drugs of the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aosteoporosis 3apublic health 3atherapeutics1 aGermershaus, Oliver1 aGroll, Jürgen1 aMeinel, Lorenz0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 July 20, v. 161, no. 2 p.198-213dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100002000189245006800209300001600277520105000293592002801343650002501371650001101396650001201407650001501419650003401434650002301468650002401491650001701515700001601532700002101548700002001569700002801589773010401617856008201721990002301803852000901826655001201835IND60107394420221119121516.0141108e20110507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010739442DNAL7 a213157332pmid7 aPMC32357652pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatts, Margaret10aSlow variable dominance and phase resetting in phantom bursting  ap. 218-228.  aBursting oscillations are common in neurons and endocrine cells. One type of bursting model with two slow variables has been called ‘phantom bursting’ since the burst period is a blend of the time constants of the slow variables. A phantom bursting model can produce bursting with a wide range of periods: fast (short period), medium, and slow (long period). We describe a measure, which we call the ‘dominance factor’, of the relative contributions of the two slow variables to the bursting produced by a simple phantom bursting model. Using this tool, we demonstrate how the control of different phases of the burst can be shifted from one slow variable to another by changing a model parameter. We then show that the dominance curves obtained as a parameter is varied can be useful in making predictions about the resetting properties of the model cells. Finally, we demonstrate two mechanisms by which phase-independent resetting of a burst can be achieved, as has been shown to occur in the electrical activity of pancreatic islets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aislets of Langerhans 3amodels 3aneurons 3aprediction 2aAction Potentialsxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aNeuronsxphysiology 2aTime Factors1 aTabak, Joel1 aZimliki, Charles1 aSherman, Arthur1 aBertram, R.q(Richard),0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 May 7, v. 276, no. 1 p.218-228dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.01.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011500177300001800292520081100310592002801121650001301149650002501162650001701187650002201204650001701226650001001243650001001253650001601263650001301279700001801292700002901310700003501339700003601374700002901410700002101439700002301460773008701483856008601570990002301656852000901679655001201688IND60109074320221118190941.0141109e20131220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010907432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.steroids.2013.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Syed Adnan Ali10aBiotransformation of 17α-ethynyl substituted steroidal drugs with microbial and plant cell cultures: A review  ap. 1312-1324.  aStructural modification of steroids through whole-cell biocatalysis is an invaluable procedure for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and key intermediates.

Emission spectrum is simpler than in ICP-AES, the resonance lines are the most intense, so that a microspectrometer with FWHM of at least 1.5nm is satisfactory for the record. The deviation from the Boltzmann distribution for Fe I has demonstrated the departure from the LTE in plasma. The non-spectral matrix effects of Li, Na, K, Ca and Mg on analytes emission are depressive and depend on matrix volatility, ionization potential of the interferent and analyte excitation energy. The detection limits (μgmL⁻¹) are in the range 0.003 (Li) and 1.5 (Mn). The use of the standard additions method allowed the simultaneous determination of elements in environmental certified reference materials with overall recovery of 95±10% and relative standard deviation of 1.7–8.2%. Compared to the traditional ICP, the microtorch has a simple construction, runs at low argon flow and can be integrated in a portable system suitable for in-situ simultaneous determination of elements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acalcium 3adetection limit 3aenergy 3aionization 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3apotassium 3asodium1 aPetreus, Dorin1 aSenila, Marin1 aMihaltan, Alin I.1 aDarvasi, Eugen1 aPonta, Michaela1 aPlaian, Emil1 aCordos, Emil A.0 tMicrochemical Journal.g2011 Mar., v. 97, no. 2 p.188-195dElsevier B.V.x0026-265X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2010.09.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010700167300001400274520083400288592002801122650002301150650002201173650001501195650001701210650002101227700001901248700001901267700001701286773008401303856008401387990002301471852000901494655001201503IND60103865520221118035055.0141107e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010386552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKao, Li-Heng10aElectrospun hierarchical cancellous-bone-like microstructures composed of a crystalline TiO₂ nanonet  ap. 64-66.  aUnique hierarchical cancellous-bone-like microstructures, composed of a TiO₂ nanonet (nanofiber network), have been fabricated by a facile and cost-effective process that combines the electrospinning technique with the template method.

In this paper, the mechanism of stabilization of Fe ions in βI-Al₂O₃ and magnetoplumbite-type Fe-substituted Ba hexaaluminates was proposed at the molecule level on the basis of X-ray diffraction, Rietveld refinement, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Fe³⁺ ions originated from oxidic entities dispersed on Ba-modified γ-Al₂O₃ mainly entered into the sites in the loosely packed mirror plane of the hexaaluminates. In particular, Fe³⁺ ions at low concentration preferentially occupied the tetrahedral Al(5) sites of the βI-Al₂O₃ phase, while Fe³⁺ ions at high concentration mainly occupied the trigonal bipyramidal Al(5) and octahedral Al(3) sites in the magnetoplumbite phase. Meanwhile, tetrahedral Fe³⁺ ions in the intermediate spinel-type BaAl₂O₄ phase preferentially entered into the tetrahedral Al(2) sites in the spinel block of hexaaluminates. Fe ions in the Al(5) sites of βI-Al₂O₃ and the Al(3) sites of magnetoplumbite phase were highly active for N₂O decomposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3airon 3aspectroscopy 3aaluminum 3abarium 3acatalytic activity 3ametal ions 3anitrous oxide 0aions1 aWang, Xiaodong1 aWang, Aiqin1 aWu, Guotao1 aWang, Junhu1 aZhang, Tao0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Oct. 27, v. 283, no. 2 p.149-160dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245020300173300001600376520101700392592002801409650004401437650001501481650002201496650001601518650001701534650000901551650001801560650001201578773010001590856008501690852000901775655001201784IND60101411620221117222158.0141106e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010141162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRakhshaee, Roohan10aRule of Fe⁰ nano-particles and biopolymer structures in kinds of the connected pairs to remove Acid Yellow 17 from aqueous solution: Simultaneous removal of dye in two paths and by four mechanisms  ap. 144-152.  aIn this study, cyclohexane 1,3,5-tericarboxylic acid (CHA) and β-isopropylglutaric acid (IPA) were used to obtain the cross-linked forms of the extracted pectin from orange skin (PO), viz.

These agents were used to stabilize the synthesized Fe⁰ nano-particles (Fe⁰ NPs) viz. the preparation of Fe⁰-PO, Fe⁰-PO-CHA and Fe⁰-PO-IPA, to compare their ability for the removal of Acid yellow 17 (AY 17) from aqueous solution. FT-IR spectra specified that bidentate bridging and monodentate interaction were the primary mechanisms for binding PO-CHA and PO-IPA molecules to Fe⁰ NPs, respectively. The removal percent of AY 17 was determined 97.8, 92.8, 84.1, 79.6, 72.8, 61.5 and 45.6 by Fe⁰-PO-CHA, Fe⁰-PO-IPA, Fe⁰-PO, PO-CHA, PO-IPA, PO and Fe⁰ NPs, respectively, for the dye initial concentration of 200ppm, at the optimized conditions. In these agents, Fe⁰ nano-particles performed the reduction process of AY 17, while the organic polymers performed its adsorption process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiopolymers 3acrosslinking 3airon 3ananoparticles 3apectins0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 197 p.144-152dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01198naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006300170300001600233520037800249592002800627650001100655650001400666650001200680700002600692773008600718856008400804990002300888852000900911655001200920IND60103791720221119053731.0141106e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010379172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.11.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasoumi, Mohsen10aEffect of Sr on the texture of rolled Mg–Mn-based alloys  ap. 104-107.  aMg–1wt.%Mn–xwt.%Sr (MJ) alloys have been synthesized with Sr additions in the range of 0–1wt.%.

However, the respiratory tract provides substantial barriers that need to be overcome for successful pulmonary application. In this regard, micro- and nano-sized particles offer novel concepts for the development of optimized therapeutic tools in pulmonary research. Polymeric nano-carriers are generally preferred as controlled pulmonary delivery systems due to prolonged retention in the lung. Specific manipulation of nano-carrier characteristics enables the design of “intelligent” carriers specific for modulation of the duration and intensity of pharmacological effects. New formulations should be tested for pulmonary absorption and distribution using more advanced ex vivo and in vivo models. The delivery of nano-carriers to the air-space enables a detailed characterization of the interaction between the carrier vehicle and the natural pulmonary environment. In summary, polymeric nanoparticles seem to be especially promising as controlled delivery systems and represent a solid basis for future advancement for pulmonary delivery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adrugs 3agenes 3amodels 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3arespiratory system1 aMerkel, Olivia M.1 aKissel, Thomas0 tJournal of controlled release.g2012 July 20, v. 161, no. 2 p.214-224dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2011.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02105naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013000164300001600294520115500310592002801465650001501493650001401508650001301522650001901535650001201554700001601566700001701582700001501599773008401614856008401698852000901782655001201791IND60106096220221118005342.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010609622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2013.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan10aPreparation and electromagnetic properties of graphene-supported Ni₀.₈Zn₀.₂Ce₀.₀₆Fe₁.₉₄O₄ nanocomposite  ap. 304-308.  aThe graphene supported Ni₀.₈Zn₀.₂Ce₀.₀₆Fe₁.₉₄O₄ nanocomposite was prepared by a deoxidation technique. The structure, morphology and electromagnetic properties of the composites were characterized by various instruments. The Ni₀.₈Zn₀.₂Ce₀.₀₆Fe₁.₉₄O₄ powders could be distributed on the graphene sheets (GNS). The as-prepared Ni₀.₈Zn₀.₂Ce₀.₀₆Fe₁.₉₄O₄/GNS nanocomposite exhibits a saturated magnetization of 50.42emu/g. The electromagnetic parameters of Ni₀.₈Zn₀.₂Ce₀.₀₆Fe₁.₉₄O₄/GNS nanocomposite were investigated in the 2–18GHz range. The composite Ni₀.₈Zn₀.₂Ce₀.₀₆Fe₁.₉₄O₄/GNS exhibits better microwave absorbing properties than Ni₀.₈Zn₀.₂Ce₀.₀₆Fe₁.₉₄O₄. The minimum loss value of Ni₀.₈Zn₀.₂Ce₀.₀₆Fe₁.₉₄O₄/GNS nanocomposite is −37.4dB at 12.3GHz and a broad peak with a bandwidth lower than −10dB is at 10.7–15.2GHz.

Toxic concentrations of Se (45–341μgL⁻¹) were present in groundwater (76m deep) of Jainpur and Barwa villages in Punjab. Selenium enrichments were also found in top soil layers (0–15cm) of Jainpur (2.3–11.6mgkg⁻¹) and Barwa (3.1mgkg⁻¹). Mineralogical analyses confirmed silicates and phyllosilicates as main components of these soils, also reflected by the high content of SiO₂ (40–62wt.%), Al₂O₃ (9–21wt.%) and K₂O (2.2–3.2wt.%). Prevailing intensive irrigation practices in Punjab with Se enriched groundwater may be the cause of Se accumulation in soils. Sequential extraction revealed >50% Se bioavailability in Jainpur soils. Appearance of selenite was observed in some of the batch assays with soil slurries under reducing conditions. Although safe Se concentrations were found in Hisar, Haryana, yet high levels of As, Mo and U present in groundwater indicated its unsuitability for drinking purposes. Detailed biogeochemical studies of Se in sediments or groundwater of Punjab are not available so far; intensive investigations should be started for better understanding of the problem of Se toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3aarsenic 3abioavailability 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3airrigation rates 3amolybdenum 3asediments 3aselenium 3asilica 3asilicates 3aslurries 3atopsoil 3atoxicity 3avillages 3aIndia1 aEiche, Elisabeth1 aNeumann, Thomas1 aWinter, J.q(Josef),1 aGallert, Claudia0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 30, v. 189, no. 3 p.640-646dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.01.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001300192245010200205300001600307506007600323520132000399592002801719506003701747650002801784650001801812650002301830650001401853650002001867650002001887650002801907650002101935650002101956650000901977650001601986650001602002650001302018653002802031653000902059653001202068653002702080653002202107700001702129700002602146700001602172700002102188700002702209700002202236700002002258773009602278856008602374852000902460655001202469IND60111256520221207090514.0190319e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011125652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.0082doi7 aPMC35575242pmcid7 a231534422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Lin10aAcinetobacter baumannii rOmpA vaccine dose alters immune polarization and immunodominant epitopes  ap. 313-318.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe rOmpA vaccine has been shown to protect mice from lethal infection caused by extreme-drug-resistant (XDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. The role of dose in immunology of the rOmpA vaccine was explored.Mice were vaccinated with various doses of rOmpA plus aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) adjuvant. The impact of dose on antibody titers, cytokine production, and immunodominant epitopes was defined.Anti-rOmpA IgG and IgG subtype titers were higher at larger vaccine doses (30 and 100μg vs. 3μg). The 3μg dose induced a balanced IFN-γ–IL-4 immune response while the 100μg dose induced a polarized IL-4/Type 2 response. Epitope mapping revealed distinct T cell epitopes that activated IFN-γ-, IL-4-, and IL-17-producing splenocytes. Vaccination with the 100μg dose caused epitope spreading among IL-4-producing splenocytes, while it induced fewer reactive epitopes among IFN-γ-producing splenocytes.Vaccine dose escalation resulted in an enhanced Type 2 immune response, accompanied by substantial IL-4-inducing T cell epitope spreading and restricted IFN-γ-inducing epitopes.

The predicted drag reduction at Reτ = 180 is approximately 30%, which concurs with results obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). An important implication of the present finding is that the near-wall turbulence structures are modified with streamwise slip velocity. In addition, a noticeable effect on the turbulence structure occurs when the slip length is greater than a certain value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3afriction 3ahydrophobicity 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3aturbulent flow1 aSEKHAVAT, Setareh1 aMOFIDI, Alireza0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2012 July 1, v. 24, no. 3 p.458-466dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60267-93Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002100168245005900189300001600248520098700264592002801251650002001279650002001299650001901319650001601338650002701354650001901381650001201400650001401412650001201426650001301438650001001451650001001461650002601471650005501497650003901552650004801591650001101639650001101650650002001661650002701681650003801708650006001746700001801806700001901824700001801843773009401861856008301955990002302038852000902061655001202070IND60102596620221123042432.0141106e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010259662DNAL7 a225040992pmid7 a10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Lauren E.10aNeonatal Benzodiazepines Exposure during Breastfeeding  ap. 448-451.  aOBJECTIVE: To assess central nervous system depression and other adverse effects in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. STUDY DESIGN: A prospectively recruited, retrospectively assessed cohort study of mothers who contacted the Motherisk program regarding the safety of benzodiazepines and were invited to participate in a follow-up program regarding the effects of these medications on their infants during lactation. RESULTS: A total of 124 consenting women participated. Adverse outcomes, specifically sedation, was identified in only 1.6% (2 of 124) of infants and was not associated with benzodiazepine dose, number of hours breastfed, or any demographic trait. Mothers reporting adverse outcomes in themselves (26% [32 of 124]) were more likely to be taking concomitantly a greater number of central nervous system depressants. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the continued recommendation to initiate breastfeeding while taking benzodiazepines postpartum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abenzodiazepines 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3acentral nervous system 3acohort studies 3ainfants 3alactation 3amothers 3asedation 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAnxietyxdrug therapy 2aBenzodiazepinesxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aBreast Feedingxcontraindications. 2aConsciousness Disordersxchemically induced 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aPuerperal Disordersxdrug therapy 2aTranquilizing Agentsxadverse effectsxtherapeutic use.1 aPoon, Shirley1 aMadadi, Parvaz1 aKoren, Gideon0 tJournal of pediatrics.g2012 Sept., v. 161, no. 3 p.448-451dMosby, Inc.x0022-34767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01840naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009500166300001600261520081500277592002801092650002201120650001301142650002601155650001001181650001901191650001601210700001401226700001501240700001501255700001601270773008801286856008401374990002301458852000901481655001201490IND60104024820221121083644.0141107e20130915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010402482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2013.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ping10aLow-temperature sintering and microwave dielectric properties of Li₂ZnTi₃O₈ ceramics  ap. 351-353.  aThe Li₂ZnTi₃O₈ ceramics with MgO–B₂O₃–SiO₂ (MBS) addictive have been prepared by the conventional solid-state ceramic route.

The X-ray diffraction results showed that Li₂ZnTi₃O₈ doped with MBS glass was a single-phase without forming secondary phase. It was found that the addition of MBS to the Li₂ZnTi₃O₈ ceramics effectively lowered the sintering temperature from 1075°C to 900°C while maintaining good microwave dielectric properties.

The enhanced fluorescence of fluorescent labeled-marker proteins, cy5-streptavidin (SA), excited by irradiation light from the rear panel of the chip was measured. To obtain the maximum fluorescence enhancement by excitation under an electric field enhanced by grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance from the rear irradiation, the optimal silver thickness was studied and found to be 30–35nm. A directional fluorescence due to re-coupling between fluorescence and plasmon polaritons was also observed on the plasmonic chips and enhanced fluorescence 90 times compared with that on glass slides was superior to the others reported. The limit of detection (LOD) studied here was improved up to 50pM after 10-min incubation and dynamic range was also extended by 2 order, compared with that on glass slides. The irradiation from the rear panel demonstrated advantage in the surface-selective detection of cy5-SA at 100nM concentration. Our plasmonic chip has great potential in biosensing application due to its advantages of rapid detection, simple operation, high sensitivity (wide dynamic range), surface selectivity, and suppression of non-specific adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectric field 3afluorescence 3aglass 3airradiation 3aproteins 3asilica 3asilver 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aYokota, Yoshiki1 aKintaka, Kenji1 aNishii, Junji1 aNakaoki, Takahiko0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Oct. 20, v. 157, no. 2 p.703-709dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.04.0863Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245020200173300001400375520104800389592002801437650002201465650001201487650001701499650002101516650001301537650001501550650001701565650001701582650001601599700001801615700002101633700001901654700002501673700001801698700002601716773009801742856008601840990002301926852000901949655001201958IND60102510920221120095018.0141106e20131105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010251092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKundu, Subhasish10aSyntheses, structures and properties of cadmium(II) carboxylates containing polyamine/Schiff base: Variation of coordination numbers, and molecular and crystalline architectures by changing ligands  ap. 41-48.  aOne-pot synthesis of the building components in methanol at room temperature affords two dinuclear compounds [Cd₂(L1)₂(μ-tp)](ClO₄)₂ (1) and [Cd₂(L2)₂(μ-ap)(OH₂)₂](ClO₄)₂⋅2H₂O⋅CH₃OH (2) [L1=N,N′-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,2-ethanediamine, L2=N,N′-(bis(pyridin-2-yl)benzylidene)-1,3-propanediamine, tp=terephthalate dianion, ap=adipate dianion].

However, growing evidence suggests that this regulatory approach is not appropriate. Clinical and non-clinical studies have shown that intended copy preparations of nanoparticle iron medicinal products can differ substantially from the originator product in their efficacy and potentially in their safety profile. An adapted regulatory pathway (separate from the standard generic approach) with defined data requirements is needed for approval of intended copies of iron medicinal products. Here, we discuss the difficulties involved in assessing therapeutic equivalence of nanoparticle iron medicinal products and suggest key concepts of a regulatory approach. Standardized non-clinical comparative studies are necessary but, as demonstrated in the reported clinical data, they may not be sufficient to demonstrate a comparable efficacy and safety profile. Validated, prospective, comparative clinical studies might be needed, in addition to non-clinical studies, in order to enable appropriate assessment of therapeutic equivalence. Furthermore, including brand names in addition to the International Non-proprietary Names (INNs) in safety reports could enable effective safety monitoring of intended copies and originator products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3aclinical trials 3adrugs 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3apharmacokinetics1 aFlühmann, Beat1 aMühlebach, Stefan0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 2 p.324-328dElsevier Inc.x0273-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2012.08.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009500176300001600271520116500287592002801452650001301480650001201493650001401505650001701519650001401536650000701550650002001557650001401577650000901591650001501600650001101615700002801626773010601654856008501760852000901845655001201854IND60101341920221119132133.0141106e20110530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010134192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouture, Raoul-Marie10aReassessing the role of sulfur geochemistry on arsenic speciation in reducing environments  ap. 647-652.  aRecent evidence suggests that the oxidation of arsenite by zero-valent sulfur (S(0)) may produce stable aqueous arsenate species under highly reducing conditions. The speciation of arsenic (As) in reducing soils, sediments and aquifers may therefore be far more complex than previously thought. We illustrate this by presenting updated Eₕ–pH diagrams of As speciation in sulfidic waters that include the most recently reported formation constants for sulfide complexes of As(III) and As(V). The results show that the stability fields of As(III) and As(V) (oxy)thioanions cover a large pH range, from pH 5 to 10. In particular, As(V)–S(–II) complexes significantly enhance the predicted solubility of As under reducing conditions. Equilibrium calculations further show that, under conditions representative of sulfidic pore waters and in the presence of solid-phase elemental sulfur, the S⁰ ₍ₐq₎/HS⁻ couple yields a redox potential (Eₕ)∼0.1V higher than the SO₄ ²⁻/HS⁻ couple. S(0) may thus help stabilize aqueous As(V) not only by providing an electron acceptor for As(III) but also by contributing to a more oxidizing redox state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3ageochemistry 3aoxidation 3apH 3aredox potential 3asediments 3asoil 3asolubility 3asulfur1 aVan Cappellen, Philippe0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 30, v. 189, no. 3 p.647-652dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002500192245009400217300001800311506007600329520228100405592002802686506003702714650002402751650001202775650002402787650001102811650001502822650001302837650001502850650002402865650000902889650001602898650001302914700003202927700001202959700001302971700001502984700002202999700002103021773008603042856008503128852000903213655001203222IND60111100720221207073124.0141109e20110916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011110072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.07.0322doi7 aPMC31689652pmcid7 a217841172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDexheimer, Judith W.12aA computerized pneumococcal vaccination reminder system in the adult emergency department  ap. 7035-7041.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Pneumococcal vaccination is an effective strategy to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease in the elderly. Emergency department (ED) visits present an underutilized opportunity to increase vaccination rates; however, designing a sustainable vaccination program in an ED is challenging. We examined whether an information technology supported approach would provide a feasible and sustainable method to increase vaccination rates in an adult ED. METHODS: During a 1-year period we prospectively evaluated a team-oriented, workflow-embedded reminder system that integrated four different information systems. The computerized triage application screened all patients 65 years and older for pneumococcal vaccine eligibility with information from the electronic patient record. For eligible patients the computerized provider order entry system reminded clinicians to place a vaccination order, which was passed to the order tracking application. Documentation of vaccine administration was then added to the longitudinal electronic patient record. The primary outcome was the vaccine administration rate in the ED. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals, representing the overall relative risks of ED workload related variables associated with vaccination rate. RESULTS: Among 3371 patients 65 years old and older screened at triage 1309 (38.8%) were up-to-date with pneumococcal vaccination and 2062 (61.2%) were eligible for vaccination. Of the eligible patients, 621 (30.1%) consented to receive the vaccination during their ED visit. Physicians received prompts for 428 (68.9%) patients. When prompted, physicians declined to order the vaccine in 192 (30.9%) patients, while 222 (10.8%) of eligible patients actually received the vaccine. The computerized reminder system increased vaccination rate from a baseline of 38.8% to 45.4%. Vaccination during the ED visit was associated younger age (OR: 0.972, CI: 0.953–0.991), Caucasian race (OR: 0.329, CI: 0.241–0.448), and longer ED boarding times (OR: 1.039, CI: 1.013–1.065). CONCLUSION: The integrated informatics solution seems to be a feasible and sustainable model to increase vaccination rates in a challenging ED environment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3ainformation systems 3amodels 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aphysicians 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3avaccination 3avaccines1 aTalbot, Thomas R., IIIcIII1 aYe, Fei1 aShyr, Yu1 aJones, Ian1 aGregg, William M.1 aAronsky, Dominik0 tVaccine.g2011 Sept. 16, v. 29, no. 40 p.7035-7041dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01290naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245014700173300001600320520031500336592002800651650000800679650001300687650002600700650001100726650002600737773011700763856008800880990002300968852000900991655001201000IND60107290520221121202319.0141108e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010729052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeyman, Azadeh10aDielectric properties of tissues; variation with age and their relevance in exposure of children to electromagnetic fields; state of knowledge  ap. 434-438.  aThis paper reviews and summarises the state of knowledge on dielectric properties of tissues; in particular those obtained as a function of age.

Additionally, the prevalence of Bartonella species DNA was investigated in the fleas found parasitizing the subject cats. For this purpose, blood samples were obtained from all cats, and DNA extraction was performed on the blood, and blood clotted samples, as well as on pools of fleas obtained from them. Antibodies for B henselae were detected on serum samples. Bartonella species DNA was detected in 17 cats, whereas serum reactivity for B henselae was found in 19. A total of 20 cats were flea-infested and nine of these 20 had Bartonella species DNA in their blood. In four of the 20 flea-infested cats, Bartonella species DNA was detected in the fleas obtained from those cats, but only one of these four cats had Bartonella species DNA in its blood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBartonella henselae 3aDNA 3aSiphonaptera 3aantibodies 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acats 3ainsect infestations 3aparasitism 3aBrazil1 aFavacho, Alexsandra1 aGershony, Liza1 aMendes-de-Almeida, Flavya1 aGomes, Raphael1 aMares-Guia, Angélica1 aRozental, Tatiana1 aBarreira, Jairo1 aLemos, Elba1 aLabarthe, Norma0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2011 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.149-151dElsevier Ltdx1098-612X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2010.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01518naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010500174300001600279520062600295592002800921650002100949650001900970650001000989650000900999650001801008700002501026773008401051856008401135852000901219655001201228IND60106096420221118005235.0141108e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010609642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2013.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirimonte, Rossella10aDesign criteria for homogeneous fluidization of Geldart's class b solids upward through a packed bed  ap. 316-322.  aAn extended investigation of homogeneous fluidization of Geldart's group B solids was conducted in two packed columns (5 and 10cm OD) whose packing spheres were either 0.41cm lead shots or 1.1cm glass beads.

The presence of oxygen groups on the imidazolium cation reduces the toxicity of ionic liquids 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide or octylsulfate anions and simultaneously decreases the value of their octanol–water partition coefficient. The presence of ester functions renders the ionic liquids more easily biodegradable, especially for long alkyl side-chains in the cation but leads to hydrolysis with the formation of reaction products that accumulate. The imidazolium ring is resistant to biodegradability and to abiotic degradation. The oxygen functionalised ionic liquids are more soluble in water and, diffuse more slowly in this medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3abiodegradability 3acations 3adiffusivity 3aenvironmental impact 3ahydrolysis 3aionic liquids 3aoxygen 3asolubility 3atoxicity1 aBesse-Hoggan, Pascale1 aSancelme, Martine1 aDelort, Anne-Marie1 aHusson, Pascale1 aCosta Gomes, Margarida F.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Dec. 30, v. 198 p.165-174dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04637naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002400168245013800192300001800330520236500348592002802713650002202741650001802763650001602781650001102797650001202808650001802820650001202838650002502850650001502875650001202890650001802902650001502920650001802935650001402953650002302967650001102990650001403001650001803015650001703033650002303050650001303073650001303086650001503099650002603114650001303140650002003153650002903173650001303202650002903215650004003244650000903284650004803293650004003341650003603381650005103417650002703468650002403495650003103519650002403550650007703574700003203651700002803683773010003711856008303811852000903894655001203903IND60103157820221117231142.0141106e20111118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010315782DNAL7 a217570402pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNawrocki, Arkadiusz10aQuantitative proteomics by 2DE and MALDI MS/MS uncover the effects of organic and conventional cropping methods on vegetable products  ap. 2810-2825.  aOrganic farming aims to be environmentally sound, but the question as to whether organic cropping brings more nutritional benefits to farmers and consumers than the conventional cropping needs still to be answered. To gain insights into the molecular effects of organic farming we used proteome analysis to analyze cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var ‘capitata’) and carrot (Daucus carota var. ‘sativus’) Our aim was to identify the metabolic pathways that are affected by different cropping regimes and thus, may have an effect on quality, storability and pathogen resistance of crops. By means of two dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI tandem mass spectrometry we compared proteomes of cabbage and carrot root, obtained in the first growth season, cropped under three different schemes. These included a conventional scheme (C) and two organic schemes, O1, in which nutrients were delivered in a form of slurry, in accordance to regulations of organic farming and O2, in which nutrient supply was based mainly on autumn green manures. Proteins were extracted from lyophilized plant tissues into a buffer containing high concentrations of urea/thiourea, two detergents and reducing agent. This approach allowed short handling times of fresh plant materials. In the case of cabbage samples, the abundance levels of 58 out of more than 1300 quantified protein spots varied significantly between conventional farming and any of the organic cropping systems. Proteome profiles were also very similar between carrot root samples, where 68 out of 1800 resolved protein spots varied significantly. Proteins of the glycolytic pathway and Krebs cycle as well as several proteins related to amino acid and protein metabolism were overexpressed in organically farmed cabbage. Proteins related to detoxification processes were overexpressed in conventionally grown cabbage. Proteins involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, polypeptides and secondary metabolites were affected by different cropping regimes in carrots. The proteomes of conventionally grown vegetables varied from organically grown vegetables to a larger extent than the two organic cropping schemes varied from each other. In conclusion, this proteomics platform is suitable and useful for systematic studies of the effects of organic and conventional farming techniques on plant metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea 3aDaucus carota 3aamino acids 3aautumn 3acabbage 3acarbohydrates 3acarrots 3aconventional farming 3adetergents 3afarmers 3afreeze drying 3aglycolysis 3agreen manures 3anutrients 3aorganic production 3aoxygen 3apathogens 3aplant tissues 3apolypeptides 3aprotein metabolism 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asecondary metabolites 3aslurries 3astorage quality 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athiourea 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3aurea 2aBrassicaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxphysiology 2aCrops, Agriculturalxmetabolism 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensionalxmethods 2aGlycolysisxphysiology 2aOrganic Agriculture 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionizationxmethods1 aThorup-Kristensen, Kristian1 aJensen, Ole Nørregaard0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Nov. 18, v. 74, no. 12 p.2810-2825dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245014000176300001600316500001500332520147100347592002801818650001501846650005001861650001901911650001801930650001901948650001201967650001501979650001701994650000802011650002602019650001402045650002002059650001402079650002102093651001002114651001202124651001502136653002802151700003302179700002702212700002202239773011102261856008302372990002302455852000902478655001202487IND60107814520221120033106.0141108e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010781452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yrtph.2012.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErraguntla, Neeraja K.13aAn updated inhalation unit risk factor for arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds based on a combined analysis of epidemiology studies  ap. 329-341.  a2019-12-04  aThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) developed an inhalation unit risk factor (URF) of 4.3E-03 per μg/m³ for arsenic in 1984 for excess lung cancer mortality based on epidemiological studies of workers at two smelters: the Asarco smelter in Tacoma, Washington and the Anaconda smelter in Montana. Since the USEPA assessment, new studies have been published and exposure estimates were updated at the Asarco and Anaconda smelters and additional years of follow-up evaluated. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) has developed an inhalation URF for lung cancer mortality from exposures to arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds based on a newer epidemiology study of Swedish workers and the updates of the Asarco and Anaconda epidemiology studies. Using a combined analysis approach, the TCEQ weighted the individual URFs from these three epidemiology cohort studies, to calculate a final inhalation URF of 1.5E-04 per μg/m³. In addition, the TCEQ also conducted a sensitivity analysis, in which they calculated a URF based on a type of meta-analysis, and these results compared well with the results of the combined analysis. The no significant concentration level (i.e., air concentration at 1 in 100,000 excess lung cancer mortality) is 0.067μg/m³. This value will be used to evaluate ambient air monitoring data so the general public in Texas is protected against adverse health effects from chronic exposure to arsenic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenicals 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3alung neoplasms 3ameta-analysis 3acohort studies 3aarsenic 3amonitoring 3arisk factors 3aair 3aenvironmental quality 3amortality 3aadverse effects 3abreathing 3achronic exposure 3aTexas 3aMontana 0aWashington 0aepidemiological studies1 aSielken, Robert L., Jr.cJr.1 aValdez-Flores, Ciriaco1 aGrant, Roberta L.0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology.g2012 Nov., v. 64, no. 2 p.329-341dElsevier Inc.x0273-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2012.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012900170300001600299520134200315592002801657650001601685650000901701650001501710650001601725650002601741650001501767700001701782700001401799700001801813700001801831773009401849856008401943852000902027655001202036IND60105945520221122014750.0141108e20110410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010594552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2010.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCong, Xingliang10aExperimental research of flow patterns and pressure signals in horizontal dense phase pneumatic conveying of pulverized coal  ap. 600-609.  aUnderstanding flow patterns and their variability is important for optimal design and trouble free dense phase pneumatic conveying of pulverized coal in a horizontal tube. Employing the electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), six flow patterns were identified and utilized for quantitative analysis based on the value and distribution of cross-sectional solid concentration. The dense-phase flow patterns in the horizontal tube of the pneumatic conveying system were somehow variable even when the operating conditions were unchanged. The probability calculation results suggest changing multiple flow patterns with one or two dominant flow for each of the seven sets of experimental conveying conditions and that a finite change in the dominant flow pattern would occur with an increasing superficial gas velocity. The power spectral density (PSD) function and the Hurst exponent of the pressure signals of the pulverized coal were well correlated with its flow patterns in a horizontal tube. The PSD functions and probability density functions (PDFs) of the void fraction signals from ECT are found to be related with flow patterns and can be used to quantitatively identify flow regimes. The ECT data may therefore be utilized for monitoring the flow patterns in a horizontal tube employed for pneumatic conveying of pulverized coal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acoal 3amonitoring 3aprobability 3aquantitative analysis 3atomography1 aGuo, Xiaolei1 aGong Xin,1 aLü, Haifeng,1 aDong, Weibing0 tPowder technology.g2011 Apr. 10, v. 208, no. 3 p.600-609dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2010.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100003300167245004700200300001400247520090400261592002801165650001601193650002401209650001501233650007901248650002501327650002401352650002201376650001101398650002601409650002301435650001501458700002601473773009601499856008201595990002301677852000901700655001201709IND60107472620221123040910.0141108e20130307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010747262DNAL7 a232382802pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez-Vargas, Esteban A.10aModeling the three stages in HIV infection  ap. 33-40.  aA typical HIV infection response consists of three stages: an initial acute infection, a long asymptomatic period and a final increase in viral load with simultaneous collapse in healthy CD4+T cell counts. The majority of existing mathematical models give a good representation of either the first two stages or the last stage of the infection. Using macrophages as a long-term active reservoir, a deterministic model is proposed to explain the three stages of the infection including the progression to AIDS. Simulation results illustrate how chronic infected macrophages can explain the progression to AIDS provoking viral explosion. Further simulation studies suggest that the proposed model retains its key properties even under moderately large parameter variations. This model provides important insights on how macrophages might play a crucial role in the long term behavior of HIV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3amacrophages 3amathematical models 3aviral load 2aAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndromexmetabolismxphysiopathologyxvirology. 2aCD4 Lymphocyte Count 2aDisease Progression 2aHIV-1xmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMacrophagesxvirology 2aModels, Biological 2aViral Load1 aMiddleton, Richard H.0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2013 Mar. 7, v. 320 p.33-40dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.11.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008800162300001400250500001500264520108500279592002801364650002101392650001401413650001501427650000901442650001201451650001201463650001501475650002801490650000901518650001201527650003401539650001501573650001901588650001301607650002201620650001101642653001801653653002201671653001701693653002401710653002101734700002101755700001601776700002001792700001201812700001401824700001801838700001501856700001401871700001801885773007601903856008101979852000902060655001202069IND50061655020221118111129.0160511e20121227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006165502DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-012-0125-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiao10aComparative study of four rice cultivars with different levels of cadmium tolerance  ap. 74-81.  a2019-12-04  aCadmium (Cd) has been identified as a significant pollutant due to its high solubility in water and soil and high toxicity to plants and animals. Rice, as one of the most important food crops, is grown in soils with variable levels of Cd and therefore, is important to discriminate the Cd tolerance of different rice cultivars to determine their suitability for cultivation in Cd-contaminated soils. This study investigates the primary mechanisms employed by four rice cultivars in attaining Cd tolerance. HA63 cultivar reduces Cd uptake by increasing Fe absorption through activation of phytosiderophores. T3028 cultivar accumulates the highest level of Cd in leaves while also activating its reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system, including antioxidant enzymes and phytochelatins. In some rice cultivars (such as HA63), a cyanide-resistant respiration mechanism, important in Cd detoxification, was also promoted under the Cd stress. In conclusion, different rice cultivars may adopt different biochemical strategies and respond with different efficiency to Cd stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater solubility 3acultivars 3afood crops 3arice 3aanimals 3aenzymes 3aabsorption 3areactive oxygen species 3airon 3acadmium 3acyanide-resistant respiration 3asoil water 3aphytochelatins 3atoxicity 3aphytosiderophores 3aleaves 0aphytochelatin 0acadmium tolerance 0aantioxidants 0aantioxidant enzymes 0aphytosiderophore1 aZhang, Zhong-Wei1 aTu, Shi-Hua1 aFeng, Wen-Qiang1 aXu, Fei1 aZhu, Feng1 aZhang, Da-Wei1 aDu, Jun-Bo1 aYuan, Shu1 aLin, Hong-Hui0 tBiologia.g2012 Dec. 27, v. 68, no. 1 p.74-81dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-012-0125-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245018400175300001800359500001500377520170000392592002802092650000902120650001402129650001302143650002502156650001202181650001302193650002002206650001902226650002402245650001002269650001202279653003202291700002002323700001702343773008602360856008502446852000902531655001202540IND60111100820221116165207.0141109e20110916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011110082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernstein, David I.12aA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2a study of the safety and immunogenicity of a live, attenuated human parainfluenza virus type 3 vaccine in healthy infants  ap. 7042-7048.  a2019-12-04  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and viral shedding profiles of a recombinant, live, attenuated human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) vaccine, rHPIV3cp45, in healthy HPIV3-seronegative infants 6 to <12 months of age. METHODS: In this double-blind, multicenter study, subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive a 10⁵TCID₅₀ dose of rHPIV3cp45 (n=20) or placebo (n=10) at enrollment and at 2 and 4 months after the first dose. Blood for evaluation of antibody to HPIV3 was collected at baseline and approximately 1 month after each dose. Solicited adverse events (SEs) and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were collected on days 0–28 after each dose. Nasal wash samples for vaccine virus shedding were collected 3 times after each dose (7–10, 12–18, and 28–34 days post dose) and at unscheduled illness visits. Subjects were followed for 180 days after the last dose. RESULTS: Vaccine virus was shed by 85% of vaccine recipients after dose 1, by 1 subject after dose 2, and was not shed by any subject after dose 3. The highest titer of shed virus was detected on day 7 after dose 1. The attenuation phenotype and the genotype of the vaccine virus were stable in shed virus. Seroresponse (≥4-fold rise in HPIV3 antibody from baseline) occurred in 61% of subjects after dose 1 and in 77% after dose 3. Either seroresponse or shedding occurred in 95% of vaccine subjects. Adverse events were similar in vaccine and placebo recipients. CONCLUSION: The safety, shedding, and immunogenicity profiles of rHPIV3cp45 in HPIV3-seronegative infants 6 to <12 months of age support further development of this vaccine.

We investigated whether additional minocycline pleurodesis after simple aspiration and drainage reduces the rate of recurrence. METHODS: In our open-label, parallel-group, prospective, randomised, controlled trial at two hospitals in Taiwan, patients were aged 15–40 years and had a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax with a rim of air greater than 2 cm on chest radiographs, complete lung expansion without air leakage after pigtail catheter drainage, adequate haematological function, and normal renal and hepatic function. After simple aspiration and drainage via a pigtail catheter, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 300 mg of minocycline pleurodesis or no further treatment (control group). Randomisation was by computer-generated random numbers in sealed envelopes. Our primary endpoint was rate of pneumothorax recurrence at 1 year. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00418392). FINDINGS: Between Dec 31, 2006, and June 30, 2012, 214 patients were randomly assigned—106 to the minocycline group and 108 to the control group (intention-to-treat population). Treatment was unsuccessful within 7 days of randomisation in 14 patients in the minocycline group and 20 patients in the control group. At 1 year, pneumothoraces had recurred in 31 of 106 (29·2%) patients in the minocycline group compared with 53 of 108 (49·1%) in the control group (p=0·003). We noted no procedure-related complications in either group. INTERPRETATION: Simple aspiration and drainage followed by minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and more effective treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax than is simple aspiration and drainage only. Minocycline pleurodesis should be an adjunct to standard treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

The as-synthesized precursor and the resulting calcined product are characterized by XRD and TG/DTA. The result shows that the reaction between Cu₂(OH)₂CO₃ and H₂C₂O₄·2H₂O is complete after 15min of milling and the precursors are of the crystalline sizes between 17 and 37nm. The Cu₂O is obtained with crystallite sizes of 15–21nm after the ball-milled precursors is calcined at 310°C for a certain time. The XRD also shows that the ball-milling time and the calcining time influence the crystallite sizes of the products to a certain extent. The average crystallite sizes of Cu₂O decreases gradually with the increase of ball milling time, while they increase gradually with the increase of calcining time. In addition, the prepared Cu₂O exhibits a high catalytic activity for the photodegradation of methyl orange under visible light irradiation, and the photocatalytic degradation ratio of methyl orange reaches to 88.7% after 2h of irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3acatalytic activity 3airradiation 3amethyl orange 3amilling 3ananocrystals 3aphotolysis1 aZhang, Wenxing1 aFeng, Chen1 aLuan, Xiaowen1 aJiang, Jian1 aJing, Qinghe,0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Sept. 15, v. 107 p.123-125dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2013.05.1293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016900165300001600334520120900350592002801559650001501587650002201602650002501624650001901649650001701668650001201685650001701697650001901714650002001733650001301753650002001766650001201786700001901798700001601817700003401833700001801867700001801885700002701903700001501930700001301945700001701958700002101975773010101996856008402097852000902181655001202190IND60101952020221121071257.0141106e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010195202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2012.08.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yang10aSynthesis of robust and high-performance aquaporin-based biomimetic membranes by interfacial polymerization-membrane preparation and RO performance characterization  ap. 422-428.  aAquaporins are water channel proteins with excellent water permeability and solute rejection, which makes them promising for preparing high-performance biomimetic membranes. Despite the growing interest in aquaporin-based biomimetic membranes (ABMs), it is challenging to produce robust and defect-free ABMs that can be easily scaled up. In the current study, a thin film composite (TFC) ABM was prepared by the interfacial polymerization method, where AquaporinZ-containing proteoliposomes were added to the m-phenylene-diamine aqueous solution. Control membranes, either without aquaporins or with inactive (mutant) aquaporins, were also similarly prepared. The separation performance of these membranes was evaluated by cross-flow reverse osmosis (RO) tests. Compared to the controls, the active ABM achieved significantly higher water permeability (∼4L/m²hbar) with comparable NaCl rejection (∼97%) at an applied pressure of 5bar. Its permeability was ∼40% higher compared to a commercial brackish water RO membrane (BW30) and an order of magnitude higher compared to a seawater RO membrane (SW30HR), which clearly demonstrates the great potential of the TFC ABM for desalination applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaporins 3aaqueous solutions 3aartificial membranes 3abrackish water 3adesalination 3amutants 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3areverse osmosis 3aseawater 3asodium chloride 3asolutes1 aQiu, Changquan1 aLi, Xuesong1 aVararattanavech, Ardcharaporn1 aShen, Wenming1 aTorres, Jaume1 aHélix-Nielsen, Claus,1 aWang, Rong1 aHu, Xiao1 aFane, A.

We investigated the effects of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) on birth registration, vaccination uptake, and school attendance in children in Zimbabwe. METHODS: We did a matched, cluster-randomised controlled trial in ten sites in Manicaland, Zimbabwe. We divided each study site into three clusters. After a baseline survey between July, and September, 2009, clusters in each site were randomly assigned to UCT, CCT, or control, by drawing of lots from a hat. Eligible households contained children younger than 18 years and satisfied at least one other criteria: head of household was younger than 18 years; household cared for at least one orphan younger than 18 years, a disabled person, or an individual who was chronically ill; or household was in poorest wealth quintile. Between January, 2010, and January, 2011, households in UCT clusters collected payments every 2 months. Households in CCT clusters could receive the same amount but were monitored for compliance with several conditions related to child wellbeing. Eligible households in all clusters, including control clusters, had access to parenting skills classes and received maize seed and fertiliser in December, 2009, and August, 2010. Households and individuals delivering the intervention were not masked, but data analysts were. The primary endpoints were proportion of children younger than 5 years with a birth certificate, proportion younger than 5 years with up-to-date vaccinations, and proportion aged 6–12 years attending school at least 80% of the time. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00966849. FINDINGS: 1199 eligible households were allocated to the control group, 1525 to the UCT group, and 1319 to the CCT group. Compared with control clusters, the proportion of children aged 0–4 years with birth certificates had increased by 1·5% (95% CI −7·1 to 10·1) in the UCT group and by 16·4% (7·8–25·0) in the CCT group by the end of the intervention period. The proportions of children aged 0–4 years with complete vaccination records was 3·1% (−3·8 to 9·9) greater in the UCT group and 1·8% (−5·0 to 8·7) greater in the CCT group than in the control group. The proportions of children aged 6–12 years who attended school at least 80% of the time was 7·2% (0·8–13·7) higher in the UCT group and 7·6% (1·2–14·1) in the CCT group than in the control group. INTERPRETATION: Our results support strategies to integrate cash transfers into social welfare programming in sub-Saharan Africa, but further evidence is needed for the comparative effectiveness of UCT and CCT programmes in this region.

The reactor was operated for 160 days at different chemical oxygen demand (COD)/sulfate ratios, hydraulic retention times (HRT), pH, and metal concentrations to study the robustness of the process. The last compartment of the reactor was aerated at different rates to study the bio-oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur. The highest sulfate reduction efficiency (88%) was obtained with a feed sulfate concentration of 3.5gL⁻¹, COD/sulfate mass ratio of 0.737, feed pH of 3.0 and HRT of 2 days without aeration in the 4th compartment. The corresponding COD removal efficiency was about 92%. The alkalinity produced in the sulfidogenic ethanol oxidation neutralized the acidic mine water from pH 3.0–4.5 to pH 7.0–8.0. Effluent soluble and total heavy metal concentrations were substantially reduced with removal efficiencies generally higher than 99%, except for Mn (25–77%). Limited aeration in the 4th compartment of ABR promoted incomplete oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur rather than complete oxidation to sulfate. Depending on the aeration rate and HRT, 32–74% of produced sulfide was oxidized to elemental sulfur. This study demonstrates that by optimizing operating conditions, sulfate reduction, metal removal, alkalinity generation, and excess sulfide oxidation can be achieved in a single ABR treating AMD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aaeration 3aalkalinity 3achemical oxygen demand 3acobalt 3acopper 3aethanol 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amanganese 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apH 3asulfur 3azinc1 aUcar, Deniz1 aKaksonen, Anna H.1 aSahinkaya, Erkan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 30, v. 189, no. 3 p.670-676dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.01.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010200168300001600270520132600286592002801612650001501640650001301655650001701668650001701685650001001702650001601712650003701728650001601765700001801781700002201799700002401821700002501845773007101870856008201941990002302023852000902046655001202055IND60102853520221120055241.0141106e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010285352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkert, Alfons10aFormaldehyde LIF detection with background subtraction around single igniting GTL diesel droplets  ap. 384-392.  aFormaldehyde is an important combustion intermediate, which is often used for the analysis of turbulent flames, internal combustion engines or droplet/spray ignition processes. Due to its high concentration in hydrocarbon fuel combustion, laser induced fluorescence (LIF) of formaldehyde can easily be excited (e.g. 339, 343, 353 and 355nm) and measured (360–550nm). However, it is often superimposed by background emission from other combustion intermediates as, e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We present formaldehyde LIF excitation spectra obtained with a XeF excimer laser in combination with a spectrometer and an ICCD camera in dependence of pressure (50mbar to 20bar). For formaldehyde LIF and background excitation, we selected the wavelengths 353.373 and 353.386nm, respectively. LIF measurements at the background wavelength contain a rising formaldehyde contribution with increasing pressure. We present a novel method for the calculation of the real background. This method is applied to the ignition of single gas-to-liquid (GTL) diesel droplets. However, the method can also be applied to other fuels. In the case of a GTL diesel ignition experiment (628K, 3bar) the real background amounted to only 30% of the emission which was measured at the background excitation wavelength (353.386nm).  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3adroplets 3afluorescence 3aformaldehyde 3afuels 3amethodology 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3awavelengths1 aPaa, Wolfgang1 aReimert, Manfredo1 aKlinkov, Konstantin1 aEigenbrod, Christian0 tFuel.g2013 Sept., v. 111 p.384-392dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.03.0413Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007800169300001600247520191100263592002802174650002202202650001102224650000902235650001602244650001902260650002002279650002002299650002202319650001002341650001302351650001102364650001202375650001802387650001202405650001602417650001302433650001402446650001402460651001102474700002002485700001802505700002202523700001902545700001902564700002102583700001802604700001902622773010702641856008302748990002302831852000902854655001202863IND60104801420221122034059.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010480142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.06.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chih-Chao10aRapid progressive course of later-onset Pompe disease in Chinese patients  ap. 284-288.  aBACKGROUND: Pompe disease presents with a wide variety of phenotypes ranging from a fatal disease in infancy (the infantile-onset form) to other milder later-onset forms. Currently, the clinical manifestations in Chinese patients with later-onset Pompe disease are still not well understood. METHODS: Fifteen Chinese patients who were clinically diagnosed with Pompe disease at later than one year of age at the National Taiwan University Hospital from 1993 to 2009 were included in this study. Confirmatory diagnosis included both biochemical and molecular tests. Patient outcomes after recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (GAA) therapy were also evaluated by assessing the percentage of predicted forced vital capacity in the upright position, hours of daily ventilator use, and the functional status change using Walton Gardner Medwin Scale. RESULTS: The median age at symptom onset was 15 (12–35)years, and the median age at diagnosis was 21 (10–38)years. At the time of diagnosis or shortly after, 8 patients (53%) required mechanical ventilation. A quadriceps muscle biopsy from a 13-year-old boy already showed extensive glycogen storage and muscle fiber destruction. Mutation analysis revealed that the two dual mutations in the GAA gene c.[1935C>A; 1726G>A] (p.[D645E; G576S]) and c.[2238G>C; 1726G>A] (p.[W746C; G576S]) represented 66.5% of the mutated chromosomes. Using mutagenesis, we showed that the p.G576S pseudodeficiency mutation significantly decreased the residual enzyme activity of p.W746C. Most patients responded poorly to recombinant human GAA. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese patients with later-onset Pompe disease often showed onset of symptoms in their second decade of life with rapid disease progression, which is probably due to a specific pattern of GAA gene mutation. Therefore, early diagnosis and early treatment would be necessary to improve the prognosis of these patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abiopsy 3aboys 3achromosomes 3adisease course 3aearly diagnosis 3aenzyme activity 3afunctional status 3agenes 3aglycogen 3ahumans 3ainfancy 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3amutagenesis 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprognosis 3aTaiwan1 aChien, Yin-Hsiu1 aLee, Ni-Chung1 aChiang, Shu-Chuan1 aLin, Shuan-Pei1 aKuo, Yung-Ting1 aChen, Shun-Sheng1 aJong, Yuh-Jyh1 aHwu, Wuh-Liang0 tMolecular genetics and metabolism.g2011 Nov., v. 104, no. 3 p.284-288dElsevier Inc.x1096-71927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.06.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02462naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013000168300001600298520121100314592002801525650001501553650001501568650001501583650001301598650001301611650004101624650001701665650001301682650001701695650003001712650002001742651001201762700001401774700001401788700001601802700001501818773009101833856008401924990002302008852000902031655001202040IND60105381120221120142202.0141108e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010538112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.patbio.2009.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenmoussa, A.10aJAK2-V617F mutation in Moroccan patients with myeloproliferative disorders: Contribution, diagnosis and therapeutic prospects  ap. e89-e92.  aAIMS: The JAK2 V617F is a recent discovery. The implication of this mutation in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) is currently confirmed. Our study is the first to be interested in the status of the JAK2 V617F mutation among myeloproliferative disorders patients in Morocco. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our study focused on 70 non-CML MPD patients, attending several departments of hematology and internal medicine across Morocco. The mutation was detected by allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). RESULTS: The V617F JAK2 mutation incidence in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis are respectively 89.47%, 62.5% and 33.33%. The V617F JAK2 mutation was absent within the patients with secondary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis. We also found that the patients carrying the mutation displayed a leucocytosis and higher levels of haemoglobin and hematocrit than mutation-negative patients. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to assess the status of the JAK2 V617F mutation in patients with MPDs in Morocco. However, our data seem to confirm that the JAK2 V617F mutation is rather uncommon in myeloid malignancies other than the classical BCR/ABL MPD negative.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahematocrit 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3amedicine 3amutation 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apolycythemia 3apolymerase chain reaction 3athrombocythemia 3aMorocco1 aDehbi, H.1 aFehri, S.1 aQuessar, A.1 aNadifi, S.0 tPathologie biologie.g2011 Aug., v. 59, no. 4 p.e89-e92dElsevier SASx0369-81147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patbio.2009.06.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014600171300001600317520133800333592002801671650001301699650001101712650001801723650002201741650001701763650002101780650001701801650002101818650003701839650001401876700002301890700002201913700002201935773010101957856008602058990002302144852000902167655001202176IND60102430520221119003008.0141106e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010243052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaber, Mohamed10aCu(II) complexes of monobasic bi- or tridentate (NO, NNO) azo dye ligands: Synthesis, characterization, and interaction with Cu-nanoparticles  ap. 185-194.  aA series of copper(II) azo complexes having the formula [CuL¹–⁴(nH₂O)]·OAc·xH₂O where (n=1–2) and (x=0–1) have been synthesized using azo dyes containing the triazol and thiadiazole moieties. The azodyes and their metal complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, IR, electronic, mass, ESR spectra, magnetic moment measurements, and thermal analyses. IR spectra showed that the ligands having triazole moiety were coordinated with the copper(II) ion in a tridentate manner with ONN donor sites of the naphthyl OH, N-atoms of azo group, and triazole moiety while azodyes having thiadiazole moiety were coordinated with the copper(II) ion in a bidentate manner with ON donor sites of the naphthyl OH and the N-atom of the group. The thermodynamic activation parameters such as ΔE*, ΔH*, ΔS*, and ΔG* were calculated from the TG curves. Prepared spherical copper nanoparticles were characterized using UV–Vis spectroscopy and transition electron microscope (TEM). The spectral data showed the formation of surface complex between azo-dye ligands and colloidal copper nanoparticles through (OH) anchoring group. The stability constant of the prepared copper nanoparticles complexes is higher compared with the corresponding bulk ones due to the larger surface area of copper nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3acopper 3ananoparticles 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3asuperoxide anion 3asurface area 3athermal analysis 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atriazoles1 aEl-Sayed, Yusif S.1 aEl-Baradie, Kamal1 aFahmy, Rowaida M.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 1032 p.185-194dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.07.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02546naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245009800209300001600307506007600323520114500399592002801544506003701572650001501609650001001624650002101634650001801655650002301673650000901696650001201705700003101717700002001748700002201768700002201790700002201812700001901834700002101853700002601874773010601900856008502006852000902091655001202100IND60101044320221207071056.0141105e20120810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010104432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2012.05.0352doi7 aPMC34129042pmcid7 a226340922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErster, Oran10aSite-specific targeting of antibody activity in vivo mediated by disease-associated proteases  ap. 804-812.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs a general strategy to selectively target antibody activity in vivo, a molecular architecture was designed to render binding activity dependent upon proteases in disease tissues. A protease-activated antibody (pro-antibody) targeting vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), a marker of atherosclerotic plaques, was constructed by tethering a binding site-masking peptide to the antibody via a matrix metalloprotease (MMP) susceptible linker. Pro-antibody activation in vitro by MMP-1 yielded a 200-fold increase in binding affinity and restored anti-VCAM-1 binding in tissue sections from ApoE(–/–) mice ex vivo. The pro-antibody was efficiently activated by native proteases in aorta tissue extracts from ApoE(−/−), but not from normal mice, and accumulated in aortic plaques in vivo with enhanced selectivity when compared to the unmodified antibody. Pro-antibody accumulation in aortic plaques was MMP-dependent, and significantly inhibited by a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor. These results demonstrate that the activity of disease-associated proteases can be exploited to site-specifically target antibody activity in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibodies 3aaorta 3abinding capacity 3acell adhesion 3ametalloproteinases 3amice 3atissues1 aThomas, J.

More recently, an avian influenza strain, designated H5N1, has been identified as having the potential to cause a zoogenic pandemic in humans, and a current outbreak of a new H1N1 influenza variant hypothesized to be of swine origin is of considerable concern. In order to facilitate surveillance and the rapid assessment and comparison of vaccination efforts, a high-throughput assay is highly desirable to supplement standard methods, which require high biosafety-level facilities. In this paper, we describe the design, production, and preliminary evaluation of an antigen array incorporating a panel of hemagglutinins as a platform for the detection and rapid quantification of influenza-specific antibodies in human serum by Arrayed Imaging Reflectometry (AIR), a label-free optical biosensor.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adisease surveillance 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aimmune response 3apandemic 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3areflectometry 3avaccination 3aviral antibodies 3aviral antigens 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralximmunology 2aBiosensing Techniquesxinstrumentation 2aCross Reactions 2aFemale 2aHemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virusximmunology 2aHumans 2aInfluenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtypeximmunology 2aInfluenza Vaccinesximmunology 2aMice 2aMicroarray Analysisxmethods1 aTopham, David J.1 aMosmann, T.

Their optical (linear and first hyperpolarizability), electrochemical, and thermal properties have been examined. Optimized ground-state molecular geometries and estimates of the lowest energy single electron vertical excitation energies in dioxane solutions were obtained using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level. Hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) in dioxane solutions using a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm was employed to evaluate their second-order nonlinear optical properties. Of these systems, the benzothiazol-2-yl-diazenes 5–6 exhibit the largest first hyperpolarizabilities (β=460–660×10⁻³⁰ esu, T convention) compared to benzothiazol-6-yl-diazenes 7 (β=360–485×10⁻³⁰ esu, T convention). Good to excellent thermal stabilities were also obtained for all azo dyes (235–317 °C). This multidisciplinary study showed that modulation of the optical and electronic properties can be achieved by introduction of the benzothiazole acceptor group in the thienylpyrrole system through position 2 or 6 of the benzothiazole heterocycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aazo dyes 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adioxane 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aoptical properties 3asalts 3athermal properties 3awavelengths1 aCastro, M.

With a hybrid grid based on Navier-Stokes (N-S) and bubble dynamics equations, some recent validation results are presented in this paper in the predictions of the thrust, the torque and the vapor volume fraction on the back side of propeller blade for a uniform inflow. The numerical predictions of the hydrodynamic performance and the sheet cavitation under several operating conditions for two propellers agree with the corresponding measured data in general. The thrust and the torque are plotted with respect to the advance rate and the cavitation number. The cavitation performance breakdown is closely related to the strong sheet cavitation around propellers. The models with parameters modified are shown to predict the propeller cavitation well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3amodels 3aprediction 3atorque 3avapors1 aFANG, Shi-liang0 tJournal of Hydrodynamics, Ser.B.g2012 July 1, v. 24, no. 3 p.347-353dElsevier Ltdx1001-60587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60254-03Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245008100158300001600239520100200255592002801257650001501285650001401300650001101314700001401325700001901339700001701358773009801375856008101473990002301554852000901577655001201586IND60108541220221117033555.0141108e20111020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010854122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAi, Ye10aIonic current rectification in a conical nanofluidic field effect transistor  ap. 742-751.  aA conical nanofluidic field effect transistor (FET) refers to a conical nanopore embedded with an electrically controllable gate electrode. The surface potential of the nanopore can be effectively regulated by manipulating the gate potential applied to the gate electrode, which in turn controls the ionic current through the nanopore. The field effect on the ionic current rectification (ICR) in the conical nanofluidic FET is comprehensively investigated using a continuum model, composed of Nernst–Planck equations for the ionic concentrations, Poisson equation for the electric potential, and Navier–Stokes equations for the flow field. Under the conditions of a low ionic concentration, a low surface charge density of the nanopore, and a high permittivity of the dielectric nanopore, regulation of ICR by FET is significant. The field effect on the ICR with the gate electrode located in the middle region is opposite to that with the gate electrode located near the tip of the nanopore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aequations 3amodels1 aLiu, Jing1 aZhang, Bingkai1 aQian, Shizhi0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Oct. 20, v. 157, no. 2 p.742-751dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.05.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01971naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245010300170300001400273520098600287592002801273650001101301650001801312650001401330653001201344653001101356653001701367653002401384653001901408700002301427773009901450856008701549852000901636655001201645IND60108226920221119014841.0161027e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010822692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPontikes, Y.10aBauxite residue in cement and cementitious applications: Current status and a possible way forward  ap. 53-63.  aUtilisation of Bayer's process bauxite residue, BR, aka red mud, takes place in a very small fraction worldwide, most probably <5wt.%. A success story in terms of industrial implementation is utilisation of BR as a raw material in cement production. The use of BR as a pozzolanic material has also been reported, with promising results in laboratory scale. This work aims to present an in depth review of these cases by providing a critical overview of the on-going research over the last forty years. To facilitate the transition from laboratory to industrial scale, a barriers and drivers analysis is also presented for the case of BR addition in the raw meal of cement clinker, following both BR and cement producers’ perspective. It is demonstrated that tangible results can be achieved with present-day technology and that one of the major barrier is economic. A number of clear actions are suggested to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable management of BR.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3araw materials 3arecycling 0aRed mud 0aCement 0aRaw material 0aPozzolanic material 0aSustainability1 aAngelopoulos, G.N.0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 Apr., v. 73 p.53-63dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04902naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245016400174300001800338520287800356592002803234650001203262650002403274650001003298650002503308650001603333650001503349650002003364650001803384650001003402650002503412650001303437650002803450650001303478650001303491650001503504650002003519650003003539650002503569650001003594651001203604651001903616700001603635700001803651700001803669700001903687700002103706700002303727700001403750700001903764700002003783700002103803700002403824700002403848700002003872700002103892700002003913700002303933700001803956700002503974773008803999856008504087990002304172852000904195655001204204IND60103460520221118011547.0141106e20130413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010346052DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62127-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalmud, Philippa J10aUse of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol gene score to distinguish patients with polygenic and monogenic familial hypercholesterolaemia: a case-control study  ap. 1293-1301.  aBACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a common autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations in three known genes. DNA-based cascade testing is recommended by UK guidelines to identify affected relatives; however, about 60% of patients are mutation-negative. We assessed the hypothesis that familial hypercholesterolaemia can also be caused by an accumulation of common small-effect LDL-C-raising alleles. METHODS: In November, 2011, we assembled a sample of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia from three UK-based sources and compared them with a healthy control sample from the UK Whitehall II (WHII) study. We also studied patients from a Belgian lipid clinic (Hôpital de Jolimont, Haine St-Paul, Belgium) for validation analyses. We genotyped participants for 12 common LDL-C-raising alleles identified by the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium and constructed a weighted LDL-C-raising gene score. We compared the gene score distribution among patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia with no confirmed mutation, those with an identified mutation, and controls from WHII. FINDINGS: We recruited 321 mutation-negative UK patients (451 Belgian), 319 mutation-positive UK patients (273 Belgian), and 3020 controls from WHII. The mean weighted LDL-C gene score of the WHII participants (0·90 [SD 0·23]) was strongly associated with LDL-C concentration (p=1·4 × 10⁻⁷⁷; R²=0·11). Mutation-negative UK patients had a significantly higher mean weighted LDL-C score (1·0 [SD 0·21]) than did WHII controls (p=4·5 × 10⁻¹⁶), as did the mutation-negative Belgian patients (0·99 [0·19]; p=5·2 × 10⁻²⁰). The score was also higher in UK (0·95 [0·20]; p=1·6 × 10⁻⁵) and Belgian (0·92 [0·20]; p=0·04) mutation-positive patients than in WHII controls. 167 (52%) of 321 mutation-negative UK patients had a score within the top three deciles of the WHII weighted LDL-C gene score distribution, and only 35 (11%) fell within the lowest three deciles. INTERPRETATION: In a substantial proportion of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia without a known mutation, their raised LDL-C concentrations might have a polygenic cause, which could compromise the efficiency of cascade testing. In patients with a detected mutation, a substantial polygenic contribution might add to the variable penetrance of the disease.

The reactor has been operated at the theoretical stoichiometric ethanol/sulphate ratio. Complete oxidation of ethanol has been achieved through complete oxidation of the intermediately, microbially produced acetate. This is mainly attributed to the presence of Desulfobacter postgatei species which dominated the sulphate-reducing community in the reactor. The reduction of sulphate was limited to about 85%. Quantitative precipitation of the soluble metal ions has been achieved. XRD and SEM–EDS analyses performed on samples of the produced sludge showed poorly crystalline phases of marcasite, covellite and wurtzite as well as several mixed metal sulphides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesulfobacter postgatei 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetates 3abioreactors 3acopper 3aethanol 3airon 3ametal ions 3anickel 3aoxidation 3apH 3asludge 3asulfides 3azinc1 aRemoundaki, Emmanouela1 aHatzikioseyian, Artin1 aBattaglia-Brunet, Fabienne1 aJoulian, Catherine1 aKousteni, Vassiliki1 aTsezos, Marios0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 May 30, v. 189, no. 3 p.677-684dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.01.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008600167300001600253520137800269592002801647650001201675650001901687650001801706650001801724650004401742650000901786650001301795650001501808650001301823650001601836700001601852700001801868700001601886700001901902700001501921700002801936773011001964856008202074852000902156655001202165IND60100893820221120152141.0141105e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010089382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.12.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGun’ko, V.M.10aInterfacial behavior of silicone oils interacting with nanosilica and silica gels  ap. 467-474.  aThe interfacial behavior of silicone oils Oxane 1000 and Oxane 5700 (polydimethylsiloxanes, PDMS) interacting with dried or hydrated (hydration h=0.005 or 0.1g/g) silica gels Si-60 and Si-100 or nanosilica A-400 was studied using low-temperature ¹H NMR spectroscopy over the 210–310K range. Broadening of the melting temperature range toward both sides from the freezing point is observed for silicone oils confined in mesopores (2–15nm in radius) of silica gel particles (0.2–0.5mm in size) or voids (1–100nm) between silica nanoparticles (5–10nm in size) in their aggregates. This effect is a consequence of the phase state heterogeneity, since both liquid and solid-like fractions of adsorbed PDMS are observed over a large temperature range. The adsorbed PDMS heterogeneity depends on the pore size distribution (confined space effect), and it is lower for silica gel Si-100 possessing broader pores than Si-60. An increase in the amounts of adsorbed polymer and water diminishes the effects of confined space on PDMS because a fraction of the polymers is located in broader pores or out of pores (voids). This leads to relative decrease in interactions of PDMS with the silica surface. ¹H NMR spectra of PDMS and n-decane bound to silica gels reveal much stronger heterogenization of adsorbed PDMS (depending on the polymer length) than that of the alkane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3afreezing point 3amelting point 3ananoparticles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3aporosity 3asilica gel 3asilicone 3atemperature1 aTurov, V.V.1 aKrupska, T.V.1 aRuban, A.N.1 aKazanets, A.I.1 aLeboda, R.1 aSkubiszewska-Zięba, J.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2013 Mar. 15, v. 394 p.467-474dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.12.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245008000173300001600253520105400269592002801323650002701351650002501378650001601403650001001419650001501429650001901444650002001463650001201483650001401495700001701509700002001526700001901546700001801565700001801583773010301601856008801704990002301792852000901815655001201824IND60105553120221118140444.0141108e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010555312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sun Hong10aMyeloid differentiation 2 as a therapeutic target of inflammatory disorders  ap. 291-298.  aLipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin of Gram-negative bacteria, activates the innate immunity system through a receptor complex of myeloid differentiation 2 (MD-2) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). MD-2 directly recognizes the lipid A domain of LPS, which triggers MD-2/TLR4-mediated cellular response aimed at eliminating the invaded pathogen. However, excess production of inflammatory mediators is harmful to host tissue and this can cause septic death in extreme cases. MD-2 represents an attractive therapeutic target of inflammatory and immune diseases in human. In particular, eritoran is a synthetic tetraacylated lipid A that binds directly to MD-2 and antagonizes LPS binding to the same site, and it ameliorates various inflammatory conditions due to infection or sterile organ injury. In this review, we outline the recent advances in the structure biology of ligand interaction with MD-2/TLR4, and highlight the MD-2-directed LPS antagonists, which are natural and synthetic chemicals, under development to treat inflammatory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aantagonists 3adeath 3aendotoxins 3ahuman diseases 3ainnate immunity 3alipid A 3apathogens1 aKim, Nam Doo1 aJung, Jae-Kyung1 aLee, Chong-Kil1 aHan, Sang-Bae1 aKim, Youngsoo0 tPharmacology and therapeutics.g2012 Mar., v. 133, no. 3 p.291-298dElsevier Inc.x0163-72587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.11.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012700163300001600290520166600306592002801972650002202000650001602022650001302038650001602051650001102067650001602078650001202094650001402106650002602120650001302146700001502159700001902174700001702193700002102210773011102231856008202342990002302424852000902447655001202456IND60110420120221117230316.0141109e20110801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011042012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2011.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, GuoQi10aMPTP-meditated hippocampal dopamine deprivation modulates synaptic transmission and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity  ap. 332-341.  aParkinson's disease (PD)-like symptoms including learning deficits are inducible by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Therefore, it is possible that MPTP may disturb hippocampal memory processing by modulation of dopamine (DA)- and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate here that intraperitoneal (i.p.) MPTP injection reduces the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) within 7days. Subsequently, the TH expression level in SN and hippocampus and the amount of DA and its metabolite DOPAC in striatum and hippocampus decrease. DA depletion does not alter basal synaptic transmission and changes pair-pulse facilitation (PPF) of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) only at the 30ms inter-pulse interval. In addition, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) is impaired whereas the duration of long-term depression (LTD) becomes prolonged. Since both LTP and LTD depend critically on activation of NMDA and DA receptors, we also tested the effect of DA depletion on NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Seven days after MPTP injection, the NMDA receptor-mediated fEPSPs are decreased by about 23%. Blocking the NMDA receptor-mediated fEPSP does not mimic the MPTP-LTP. Only co-application of D1/D5 and NMDA receptor antagonists during tetanization resembled the time course of fEPSP potentiation as observed 7days after i.p. MPTP injection. Together, our data demonstrate that MPTP-induced degeneration of DA neurons and the subsequent hippocampal DA depletion alter NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aantagonists 3adopamine 3ahippocampus 3amemory 3ametabolites 3aneurons 3areceptors 3asynaptic transmission 3atyrosine1 aChen, Ying1 aHuang, Yuying,1 aLi, Qinglin,1 aBehnisch, Thomas0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 254, no. 3 p.332-341dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2011.05.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010600169300001600275520190600291592002802197650001702225650001202242650001602254650001102270650000902281650001802290650002202308650001102330650001102341650001302352650001402365650001502379650001802394650001602412650001902428650001302447650003002460651001102490700001502501700002202516700001802538700001602556700001602572700001602588773009202604856008502696990002302781852000902804655001202813IND60101801320221122143422.0141106e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010180132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaitsos, D.E.10aAssessing chlorophyll variability in relation to the environmental regime in Pagasitikos Gulf, Greece  ap. S16-S22.  aPagasitikos Gulf (Greece), presents an interesting area as it depicts strongly non-linear ecosystem characteristics. It is a shallow coastal area where the marine ecosystem picture is strongly influenced by non-linear hydrodynamic interactions and instabilities. In this study, we explore and assess the major influential variables of the surface phytoplankton biomass (Chlorophyll-a). Several different physical and biogeochemical parameters were used (sea surface temperature [SST], mixed layer depth [MLD], salinity, phosphates and nitrates) to identify which variables control or significantly affect the surface Chl-a of Pagasitikos Gulf for the period of 2001–2005. The variables were derived from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model and remotely sensed data from SeaWiFS and AVHRR sensor. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) were used to examine the relationships between Chlorophyll-a and the environmental regime. GAM analysis showed that the combined effects of the variables used, explained 71% of the surface chlorophyll variation. The order of importance of the variables (based on GAM probability) is p=0.01 (for both phosphate and nitrate), MLD: p=0.0197, salinity: p=0.022, and SST: p=0.046. The results clearly indicated the importance of deep mixing for Pagasitikos Gulf, as the surface phytoplankton blooms appeared to be favoured by cold, nutrient rich, well mixed and higher salinity waters. GAMs indicated that SST plays a significant role having a strong negative relationship with Chl-a, where the highest concentration is reached at 12–15°C and minimum at 22–26°C. Chl-a ceases to increase after 37.9‰ of salinity and 40m of MLD, while minimum concentration is found at 10m of MLD, with a subsequent increase as the waters become more mixed. Phosphate and nitrates appeared to be of equal importance with Chl-a exhibiting an increase along with the nutrients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3acold 3ahydrodynamics 3amarine ecosystems 3amixing 3amodels 3anitrates 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphytoplankton 3aprobability 3aremote sensing 3asalinity 3asurface water temperature 3aGreece1 aKorres, G.1 aTriantafyllou, G.1 aPetihakis, G.1 aPantazi, M.1 aTsiaras, K.1 aPollani, A.0 tJournal of marine systems.g2012 June, v. 94S p.S16-S22dElsevier B.V.x0924-79637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011300169520143600282592002801718650001201746650000901758650002201767650002801789650001801817650002101835650001701856650002001873650001601893650001901909650003001928653003901958653002601997653001902023653002602042653000802068700001702076700001802093700001702111700001502128700001202143773008902155856008502244852000902329655001202338IND60687368720221122061918.0200517e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068736872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1174332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShittu, Samson10aElectrical and mechanical analysis of a segmented solar thermoelectric generator under non-uniform heat flux  aOptimization of segmented solar thermoelectric generator for power output enhancement has been well researched however, the mechanical reliability study of such devices is usually neglected. In addition, assumed heat flux distribution or uniform flux distribution from solar concentrators is usually used for solar thermoelectric generator however, this is not accurate. Therefore, this study presents a detailed three-dimensional numerical investigation on the effect of non-uniform and uniform heat flux on the electrical and mechanical performance of segmented and non-segmented solar thermoelectric generator. Flux distribution from a compound parabolic concentrator is obtained by ray tracing using Lighttools software and COMSOL 5.4 Multiphysics software is used to perform the numerical study based on finite element method. Thermal stress analysis in a full-scale solar thermoelectric generator is presented and the effects of load resistance, solar radiation and cold side temperature on performance of solar thermoelectric generator is analysed. Results show that the power output of the segmented solar thermoelectric generators in Case 3, Case 4 and Case 5 increased by 44.07%, 59.12% and 37.9% respectively compared to that of Case 1 (bismuth telluride non-segmented solar TEG) at 13000W/m².

The first entirely characterized EuMV isolate is native from Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico; subsequently, EuMV was detected in weeds and pepper plants from another region of Mexico, and partial DNA-A sequences revealed significant differences in their putative replication specificity determinants with respect to EuMV-YP. This study was aimed to investigate the replication compatibility between two EuMV isolates from the same country. RESULTS: A new isolate of EuMV was obtained from pepper plants collected at Jalisco, Mexico. Full-length clones of both genomic components of EuMV-Jal were biolistically inoculated into plants of three different species, which developed symptoms indistinguishable from those induced by EuMV-YP. Pseudorecombination experiments with EuMV-Jal and EuMV-YP genomic components demonstrated that these viruses do not form infectious reassortants in Nicotiana benthamiana, presumably because of Rep-iteron incompatibility. Sequence analysis of the EuMV-Jal DNA-B intergenic region (IR) led to the unexpected discovery of a 35-nt-long sequence that is identical to a segment of the rep gene in the cognate viral DNA-A. Similar short rep sequences ranging from 35- to 51-nt in length were identified in all EuMV isolates and in three distinct viruses from South America related to EuMV. These short rep sequences in the DNA-B IR are positioned downstream to a ~160-nt non-coding domain highly similar to the CP promoter of begomoviruses belonging to the SLCV clade. CONCLUSIONS: EuMV strains are not compatible in replication, indicating that this begomovirus species probably is not a replicating lineage in nature. The genomic analysis of EuMV-Jal led to the discovery of a subgroup of SLCV clade viruses that contain in the non-coding region of their DNA-B component, short rep gene sequences located downstream to a CP-promoter-like domain. This assemblage of DNA-A-related sequences within the DNA-B IR is reminiscent of polyomavirus microRNAs and could be involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of the cognate viral rep gene, an intriguing possibility that should be experimentally explored  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia mosaic virus 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3agenes 3agenomics 3aintergenic DNA 3amicroRNA 3apepper 3areplication origin 3asequence analysis 3avirology 3aMexico 3aSouth America1 aBernal-Alcocer, Artemiza1 aBañuelos Hernández, Bernardo,1 aAlpuche-Solís, Ángel G1 aHernández-Zepeda, Cecilia1 aMoreno-Valenzuela, Oscar1 aFrías-Treviño, Gustavo1 aArgüello-Astorga, Gerardo R0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.275-275dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-2753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100004300148245011700191300001200308520168100320592002802001650001802029650001702047650000702064650001102071650001902082650002402101650001702125650001302142650001202155651001102167700007902178700002502257700004702282700002902329700004002358700003602398773015002434856008302584852000902667655001202676IND60772937320221123021153.0220726e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077293732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-09914-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Rayanna Jacques Agra Bezerra10aInfluence of parent material on soil chemical characteristics in a semi-arid tropical region of Northeast Brazil  ap. 331.  aSoil parental material is one of the main factors that influence pedogenesis. Several studies evaluated the relationship between the parent material and soil chemistry, but few studies have assessed such a relationship in semi-arid tropical regions. This investigation was carried out to assess the effect of different parent materials on the chemical composition and available concentrations of macronutrients and micronutrients, including potentially toxic elements (Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb) in soils in a semi-arid tropical setting. The chemical composition of the soils inherited the geochemical signature of their parent materials. Quartz sandstones, augen gneisses, and peraluminous granites exhibited the lowest reservoirs of plant nutrients and formed sandy, acid, and infertile soils. On the other hand, alkaline soils and soils with high concentrations of nutrients formed on ultramafic rocks (harzburgite), marble, and anorthosite. The pH, clay content, and CEC were the main attributes of the soils governing the availability of macro and micronutrients. The low soil organic carbon contents did not influence the availability of the nutrients. The parent material also influenced the soil texture. Parent materials that are richer in silica formed more sandy soils. The availability of Cd, Cr, and Pb in soils was low; however, the elevated Ni concentrations of soils derived from ultramafic rocks may pose risks to the environment and human health. Cluster and discriminant analyses were used to discriminate the natural fertility of soils. These results are useful for the agro-pedological zoning of the Brazilian semi-arid tropical region and for land use planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay fraction 3ahuman health 3apH 3aquartz 3asoil formation 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil texture 3atoxicity 3atropics 3aBrazil1 ada Silva, Ygor Jacques Agra Bezerra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2565-66771 aStraaten, Peter van,1 ado Nascimento, Clístenes Williams Araújo1 aBiondi, Caroline Miranda1 ada Silva, Yuri Jacques Agra Bezerra1 aAraújo Filho, José Coelho de,0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 May, v. 194, no. 5 p.331-331dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09914-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245007600160300001800236520098200254592002801236650002201264650000801286650003401294650001601328700002701344700002301371700002101394773013101415856007801546852000901624655001201633IND60548781320221118052353.0160905e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054878132DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b131332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaier, Sabine10aGrowth and Structure of the First Layers of Ice on Ru(0001) and Pt(111)  ap. 3145-3151.  aScanning tunneling microscopy was used to probe the structure and growth of the first few layers of water on Ru(0001) and Pt(111) at the molecular level. The surface-bound first layer is composed of a mixture of water molecules forming hexagonal structures, both in registry and out-of-registry with the substrate atoms. The hexagons are connected by pentagonal and heptagonal units. At temperatures below 140 K, this layer structure gives rise to the growth of metastable amorphous structures in the second and higher layers. We found that in the transition from amorphous to crystalline ice the structure of the original bottom layer changes to one in perfect local registry with the hexagonal surfaces of Ru(0001) and Pt(111). We further discovered structural defects in the form of extended one-dimensional lines of five- and eight-membered rings that are domain boundaries and stacking faults in the growing ice layers, which lead to the formation of metastable cubic ice.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3aice 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3atemperature1 aLechner, Barbara A.

Study areas were located near Summerland and Kelowna in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had nine treatments: four pairs of stands thinned to densities of ∼250 (very low), ∼500 (low), ∼1000 (medium), and ∼2000 (high) stems/ha with one stand of each pair fertilized five times at 2-year intervals, and an unthinned stand. Neither density nor fertilization treatments had any significant effect on 15-year increments of height growth. Mean diameter at breast height (17% increase), basal area (BA) (28% increase), and volume (27% increase) growth increments per tree were significantly enhanced by fertilization, but were not affected by density. Repeated fertilization enhanced both BA (20% increase) and volume (18% increase)/ha at the stand level. Despite the significant decrease in crop tree stand density resulting from PCT, 15-year BA and volume increments were statistically similar across density treatments. Contributions of non-crop trees to total stand productivity appeared to be substantial, particularly within the heavily thinned stands. Because trees provide the majority of all aboveground terrestrial carbon, they are an important sink for atmospheric CO2. Enhancing stand productivity may provide adaptive advantages for carbon sequestration to help limit greenhouse gases as well as resiliency of forests subjected to changing growing conditions due to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gases 3astems 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3atree and stand measurements 3aclimate change 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3astand density 3atrees 3astand basal area 3aforests 3aBritish Columbia 0aLong-term monitoring 0aPre-commercial thinning 0aFertilization 0aLodgepole pine 0aStand productivity 0aForest management 0abasal area1 aSullivan, Thomas P.0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 Nov. 01, v. 307 p.155-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.06.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010500173300002000278520194000298592002802238650000802266650001302274650001202287650000902299650001502308650001202323650001302335650002002348650001602368700005702384700001702441700001302458700001802471700001602489773012202505856008702627852000902714655001202723IND60621077920221121025105.0181115e20181013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062107792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b026412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qingxiang10aPromotion of Anthracite Burnout for a 300 MWₑ Down-Fired Boiler with a Novel Combustion Technology  ap. 11924-11935.  aEccentric-swirl-secondary-air combustion technology (ESSACT) has been applied to a 300 MWₑ anthracite- and down-fired boiler with swirl burners. To improve burnout performance of the retrofitted boiler, the effects of primary air ratios on flow and combustion characteristics are investigated via cold-model aerodynamic experiments and industrial experiments. When primary air ratios are 17.09 and 19.08%, a deflective flow field occurs, and with increasing the primary air ratio from 21.11 to 24.75%, a symmetrical “W” flow field is formed. With increasing the primary air ratio from 17.09 to 24.75%, the maximum dimensionless vertical velocity of air flow near the front wall increases linearly from 0.364 to 0.521. Accordingly, the penetration depth in the real boiler increases by approximately 2.88 m. For a primary air ratio of 18.47%, the temperatures at the burner exit and in the furnace hopper near the front and rear walls are both seriously asymmetrical and the combustion path of pulverized coal particles by the rear wall is relatively short. When the primary air ratio increases from 21.18 to 23.85%, the combustion in the furnace is relatively symmetrical. The pulverized coal ignition distances are shortened continuously and are all within 1.2 m, and the temperature near the water-cooled wall in the furnace hopper increases by approximately 80 °C; the combustion path of pulverized coal particles increases continuously. When the combustion symmetry property, unburned combustible in fly ash, and NOₓ emissions are taken into account, the primary air ratio of 22.96% is preferable for the retrofitted down-fired boiler. In comparison to the original boiler, unburned combustible in fly ash decreases by 33.4% and NOₓ emissions decrease by 43.8%. In comparison to the preliminary application of ESSACT, unburned combustible in fly ash further decreases by 12.7% on the basis of a large reduction of NOₓ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aburners 3acoal 3acombustion 3afly ash 3afurnaces 3anitrogen oxides 3atemperature1 aChen, Zhichao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8431-60661 aYan, Tianshu1 aLiu, Tao1 aZeng, Lingyan1 aLi, Zhengqi0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Oct. 13, v. 32, no. 11 p.11924-11935dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b026413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010800168300001600276520144400292592002801736650002001764650001601784650001101800650001201811650001901823650001801842650001601860650002301876653002601899653002601925653002701951653002801978653002802006653001202034700002402046700001602070700001902086700002302105773012502128856008202253852000902335655001202344IND60609398320221119120739.0180823e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060939832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZafeiri, Ioanna14aThe role of surface active species in the fabrication and functionality of edible solid lipid particles  ap. 228-240.  aLipid particles are very promising candidates for utilisation as Pickering stabilisers, and fabrication of these species has been attracting considerable academic and industrial research. Nonetheless, current understanding of these systems is hindered by the fact that, as a whole, studies reporting on the fabrication and Pickering utilisation of lipid particles vary significantly in processing conditions being utilised and formulation parameters considered. The present study investigates, under well-controlled processing and formulation conditions, the fabrication of edible lipid particles from two lipid sources in the presence of two different types of amphiphilic species (surfactant or protein) via melt-emulsification and subsequent crystallisation. Fabricated solid lipid particles were assessed in terms of their particle size, interfacial and thermal behaviour, as well as stability, as these microstructure attributes have established links to Pickering functionality. Lipid particle size and stability were controlled by the type and concentration of the used amphiphilic species (affecting the melt emulsification step) and the type of lipid source (influencing the crystallisation step). Interfacial behaviour was closely linked to the type and concentration of the surface active component used. Finally, the types of lipid and amphiphilic agents employed were found to affect lipid particle thermal behaviour the most.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aemulsifying 3alipids 3amelting 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size 3asurfactants 3athermal properties 0aSolid lipid particles 0aInterfacial behaviour 0aSurface active species 0aPolymorphic transitions 0aPickering functionality 0aProtein1 aNorton, Jennifer E.1 aSmith, Paul1 aNorton, Ian T.1 aSpyropoulos, Fotis0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 500 p.228-240dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012500159300002000284520042400304592002800728650001600756650001400772650001600786650001500802650001300817650001900830650001500849650001700864700001800881700001900899773014400918856007401062852000901136655001201145IND60670834720221119092416.0191002e20141028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067083472DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta03512g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Zhiyuan12aA self-assembled macroporous coagulation graphene network with high specific capacitance for supercapacitor applications  ap. 19141-19144.  aA macroporous graphene network was prepared through polyethyleneimine-induced coagulation of graphene-oxide nanosheets from the dispersion.

The São Paulo government has reduced the water pressure in its mains, which regularly leaves faucets running dry. And it is now taking a carrot-and-stick approach to water usage, financially rewarding those who conserve and fining those who waste. Barring a sudden reversal of meteorological misfortune, officials are contemplating drastic rationing that would deprive millions of households of water for up to 5 days a week. In a press conference last week, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences took state authorities to task for failing to take bolder actions sooner and for a lack of transparency about the gravity of the situation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3ahouseholds 3apeople 3awastes 3awater utilization 3aBrazil0 tScience.g2015 Feb. 20, v. 347, no. 6224 p.812-812dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013500162300002000297520138200317592002801699650001501727650001401742650001801756650001701774650001501791650001901806650001501825650001301840650002001853650001101873650003701884700001601921700001901937700002701956700002401983700002002007773014502027856007402172852000902246655001202255IND60670834820221119092530.0191002e20140930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067083482DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta03518f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmar, Akrajas Ali10aHighly-reactive AgPt nanofern composed of {001}-faceted nanopyramidal spikes for enhanced heterogeneous photocatalysis application  ap. 17655-17665.  aThe structure and property of the catalyst surface determine the physico-chemical process and the reactivity at the surface, such as catalysis behavior, adsorption, surface segregation and charge transfer, etc. A catalyst with a surface containing high-energy facets, high defect or high-energy sites, such as twinning, vertexes, spikes, etc., may facilitate enhanced catalytic and surface reactivity. Here, we present a straightforward approach to synthesize novel nanopyramidal spike composed nanoferns of AgPt bimetals vertically-oriented on the substrate surface for potential application in catalysis. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that the nanopyramidal spike is characterized by {001} faces, the high-energy facet of the fcc metal system, promising enhanced catalytic reaction. The crystal growth analysis result determines that the lattice-mismatching effect between Ag and Pt is the key factor for the formation of the nanopyramidal AgPt structure and the nanofern suprastructure is produced via oriented-attachment of the nanopyramidals. The heterogeneous catalytic properties characterisation of AgPt nanofern in the photodegradation of methyl orange in the absence of any reducing agent revealed that the catalytic efficiency is determined by the Ag concentration in the nanocrystals and the morphology of the nanofern structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3amethyl orange 3ananocrystals 3ananosilver 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aplatinum 3areducing agents 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRahmi, Elvy1 aBalouch, Aamna1 aAbd Rahman, Mohd Yusri1 aSalleh, Muhamad Mat1 aOyama, Munetaka0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Sept. 30, v. 2, no. 41 p.17655-17665dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta03518f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245015500173300001600328520160100344592002801945650001701973650001301990650002502003650002302028650001102051650001702062650001102079650003102090650001502121650002302136650001002159650001602169650002502185653001302210653000802223653001702231653001202248653001202260700001602272700001402288700002002302700001802322773011902340856009002459852000902549655001202558IND60562788320221116160709.0190405e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056278832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2017.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscribano, S.10aNon-destructive prediction of soluble solids and dry matter content using NIR spectroscopy and its relationship with sensory quality in sweet cherries  ap. 112-120.  aNear infrared spectroscopy (NIR) models developed in the spectral region between 729 and 975nm for a handheld instrument have been demonstrated to be accurate, robust and versatile for the rapid and non-destructive evaluation of soluble solids (SSC) and dry matter (DMC) content in sweet cherries at two different temperatures, 0 and 23°C. Coefficient of determination (R2) values for model calibrations ranged from 0.922 to 0.946 for SSC and from 0.910 to 0.933 for DMC, with standard errors of calibration from 0.612 to 0.792 and from 0.687 to 0.911% for SSC and DMC, respectively, depending on the variety and the temperature of the fruit. External validation of the models demonstrated they could be confidently used for ‘Chelan’ and ‘Bing’ sweet cherries; R2 values for SSC ranged from 0.726 to 0.891 and for DMC from 0.670 to 0.725 between the predicted and the observed values in the external validation set, respectively. Consumer preference evaluation for ‘Bing’ and ‘Chelan’ sweet cherries with differing SSC (16.38–28.45) and DMC (17.67–31.62%) revealed higher acceptance by consumers for cherries with high DMC as well as for cherries with high SSC. DMC was equal to or superior to SSC for predicting flavor intensity and balance of sweet to sour taste as assessed by consumers. Considering the revealed importance in sensory evaluation of DMC, as well as SSC, in the eating quality of sweet cherry, the use of handheld NIR devices, which are rapid, lightweight and user-friendly should be considered for routine, non-destructive analysis of sweet cherry quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus avium 3acherries 3aconsumer preferences 3adry matter content 3aflavor 3afood quality 3amodels 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprediction 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3atemperature 3atotal soluble solids 0aHandheld 0aNIR 0aPrunus avium 0aQuality 0aSensors1 aBiasi, W.V.1 aLerud, R.1 aSlaughter, D.C.1 aMitcham, E.J.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2017 June, v. 128 p.112-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2017.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010800166300001100274500001900285520167600304592002801980596005902008596007702067596007602144596006302220650001602283650001602299650001602315650001402331650001002345650001002355650002702365650002302392650001602415650002002431650000702451650001602458650002402474650001302498700001802511700001302529700001702542700001902559700001302578700001702591773011402608856008302722852000902805655001202814IND60685993620221118004648.0200324e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068599362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-020-01113-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chaoyue10aOverexpression of a TIFY family gene, GsJAZ2, exhibits enhanced tolerance to alkaline stress in soybean  ap. 33.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrevious studies have indicated the potential role of a TIFY family gene, GsJAZ2, for its response to alkaline stress in Arabidopsis. Here, we transformed GsJAZ2 into an elite soybean (Glycine max) using particle bombardment-based genetic transformation system to assess whether overexpression of GsJAZ2 in soybean improved alkaline tolerance. Results revealed that transgenic soybean overexpressing GsJAZ2 grew well under alkaline conditions, while wild-type (WT) plants exhibited chlorosis, stunted growth, or even death. Higher chlorophyll concentration and lower of Malondialdehyde (MDA) content were detected in the transgenic plants compared to WT under alkaline stress. Moreover, the transcription levels of two alkaline-responsive genes were up-regulated in the GsJAZ2 overexpression at the early or later stage of alkaline stress, respectively, indicating that GsJAZ2 overexpression enhanced tolerance to alkaline stress in soybean, which might modulate intracellular pH homeostasis and osmotic balance through regulating the expression of alkaline-responsive genes. Additionally, GsJAZ2 is a member of the JAZ subfamily that belongs to the TIFY family. Overexpression of GsJAZ2 in soybean conferred JA insensitivity, including JA-mediated root growth inhibition. The transcripts of some JA-responsive genes were examined and altered under alkaline stress, implying that GsJAZ2 overexpression may involve in JA signal pathway for accumulating anti-osmotic substances in defense to alkaline stress. Collectively, the findings of this study facilitate our understanding of GsJAZ2 in response to alkaline stress as well as enrich the function of TIFY genes in crop.  aPublisher supplied data  a31301337cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aQC2014C036cNational Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province  aKFJ-STS-QYZD-037cScience and Technology Service Network Project of CAS  aNo. 31972966cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis 3aGlycine max 3achlorophyll 3achlorosis 3adeath 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3agrowth retardation 3ahomeostasis 3amalondialdehyde 3apH 3aroot growth 3asignal transduction 3asoybeans1 aPan, Xiangwen1 aYu, Yang1 aZhu, Yanming1 aKong, Fanjiang1 aSun, Xia1 aWang, Feifei0 tMolecular breeding.g2020 Mar., v. 40, no. 3 p.33-33dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-020-01113-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245010400206300001800310520123500328592002801563650002301591650002201614650001401636650001301650650002001663650002001683650001501703650003201718650001901750650004401769650002601813650001601839650001001855650002201865650001701887653001601904653002301920653002201943653001401965653002601979700005802005700002002063700001902083700005602102773014802158856008002306852000902386655001202395IND60647706020221118020933.0190620e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064770602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b011932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chen-Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1567-467610aAntidiabetic Stilbenes from Peony Seeds with PTP1B, α-Glucosidase, and DPPIV Inhibitory Activities  ap. 6765-6772.  aOne unusual resveratrol tetramer, paeonilactiflorol (1), and 14 known compounds (2–15) were isolated from peony seeds (Paeonia lactiflora) under the guidance of bioassay. Paeonilactiflorol (1) was determined by extensive HRESIMS, UV, IR, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses. Most of the stilbenes showed obvious inhibition on PTP1B and α-glucosidase, superior to the monoterpene glycosides. Especially, the stilbene tetramer (1) and trimer (8) exhibited high activity inhibiting both PTP1B with IC₅₀ values of 27.23 and 27.81 μM and α-glucosidase with IC₅₀ values of 13.57 and 14.39 μM. Two trans-dimers (4 and 5) also showed dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV) inhibitory activity (55.35% and 61.26%, 500 μM) in addition to PTP1B and α-glucosidase. Enzyme kinetic study indicated that the types of inhibition on PTP1B were noncompetitive for 3 and 5 and mixed for 8 and 10. Quantitative analysis suggested that the stilbene trimers 8 (23.17 ± 0.36 mg/g) and 10 (15.24 ± 0.25 mg/g) were the main contents in peony seeds and should be responsible for the antidiabetic effects. This investigation supports the therapeutic potential of peony seeds in the treatment of diabetes with stilbenes as the active constituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaeonia lactiflora 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abioassays 3adiabetes 3aenzyme kinetics 3aglycemic effect 3aglycosides 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amonoterpenoids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aquantitative analysis 3aresveratrol 3aseeds 3aspectral analysis 3atherapeutics 0apeony seeds 0aPaeonia lactiflora 0apaeonilactiflorol 0astilbenes 0aantidiabetic activity1 aGeng, Chang-An1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9834-07561 aHuang, Xiao-Yan1 aZhang, Xue-Mei1 aChen, Ji-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5781-75110 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 June 04, v. 67, no. 24 p.6765-6772dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b011933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001300167245013000180300001600310520088700326592002801213650002501241650001301266650001001279650001901289650001101308650001501319650001301334650001301347650003801360650001501398650002101413650004101434650003501475650002301510650001101533650001801544650003201562650004301594650004301637650001101680650000901691650003601700650003801736650001301774653000801787653000801795653000801803653000801811653000701819653000901826653000901835653000801844653000801852653000801860653001801868653003501886653001401921653001301935653002601948653002801974700001402002700001502016700001702031700001802048700001802066773007402084856008202158852000902240655001202249IND60099098520221117200213.0161021e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009909852DNAL7 a238920902pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.07.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xin10a576kb deletion in 1p36.33–p36.32 containing SKI is associated with limb malformation, congenital heart disease and epilepsy  ap. 352-355.  a1p36 deletion (monosomy 1p36) is one of the most common terminal deletions observed in humans, characterized by special facial features, mental retardation, heart defects, development delay and epilepsy. Previously, we reported molecular findings in patients with limb, congenital heart disease (CHD) and other malformations with SNP-array. In a syndromic patient of the same cohort, we detected a small deletion of 1p36.33–p36.32 containing SKI (Sloan–Kettering Institute protooncoprotein). Recently, dominant mutations in SKI were identified to be correlated with Shprintzen–Goldberg syndrome. Retrospective examination revealed this patient with limb malformations, CHD, epilepsy and mild development delay. Together with previous reports, our study suggests that the 1p36.33–1p36.32 deletion encompassing SKI may represents a previous undescribed microdeletion disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aepilepsy 3aheart 3aheart diseases 3ahumans 3amonosomics 3amutation 3apatients 2aAbnormalities, Multiplexgenetics 2aAdolescent 2aChild, Preschool 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 1xgenetics 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aEpilepsyxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Deletion 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aHand Deformities, Congenitalxgenetics 2aHeart Septal Defects, Atrialxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProto-Oncogene Proteinsxgenetics 2aSyndrome 0aCNV 0aCHD 0aSNP 0aPCR 0aCT 0aOMIM 0aHg19 0aASD 0aDGV 0aSGS 0a1p36 deletion 0aShprintzen–Goldberg syndrome 0aSNP array 0aEpilepsy 0aCopy number variation 0aCongenital heart defect1 aZhang, Yi1 aWang, Jian1 aYang, Jin-Fu1 aYang, Yi-Feng1 aTan, Zhi-Ping0 tGene.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 528 p.352-355dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.07.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012200161300001800283520143900301592002801740596005901768596005901827596005301886596007301939596005502012650002002067650001402087650001602101650001402117650001202131650001402143650003302157650002002190650001102210650002402221650002002245650001302265650002002278650001902298700001702317700005302334700001902387700001502406773012502421856008302546852000902629655001202638IND60780195520221121185523.0220731e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078019552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-02954-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Biqi10aDNA Methylation Profiles of Ovarian Granular Cells from Fluorosis Female Patients Suffering Reproductive Dysfunctions  ap. 3529-3536.  aFluorosis often causes female reproductive dysfunction. A rapid turnover of DNA methylation is a pathological change in many human diseases, including female reproductive dysfunction. The role of DNA methylation in fluorosis was unknown and investigated in this experiment. Fifty fluorosis women patients were selected as High F group and forty-six healthy women were recruited as Control group were enrolled. In addition, ovarian granulosa cells were obtained from five women in High F group and five women in Control group. All ten women went through in vitro fertilization (IVF) process with DNA methylation sequencing. KGN cells (human granulosa cell line) were cultured with different concentrations of sodium fluoride (0–8 mM NaF) for 24 h for the in vitro study. The level of DNA methylation in blood samples was significantly higher in High F group than that in Control group. The level of serum estradiol (E₂) was significantly lower in women from High F group, while the levels of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in High F group were significantly higher than that in Control group. The methylation sequences of KGN cells relating to autophagy were significantly changed by NaF treatment dose-dependently. Based on these results, it is concluded that DNA methylation and autophagy may play a significant role in the pathophysiology of reproductive dysfunction caused by fluorosis.  aPublisher supplied data  a81673115cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a82073496cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2012GS610101cMinistry of Science and Technology  a2020KW-057cInternational Cooperation Foundation of Shaanxi province  a2018D050cDepartment of Health of Shaanxi Province 3aDNA methylation 3aautophagy 3ablood serum 3aestradiol 3afemales 3afluorosis 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agranulosa cells 3ahumans 3aluteinizing hormone 3apathophysiology 3aresearch 3asodium fluoride 3atrace elements1 aDong, Siyuan1 aChen, Qun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8638-29081 aDong, Zhaoheng1 aChen, Chen0 tBiological trace element research.g2022 Aug., v. 200, no. 8 p.3529-3536dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02954-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012400163300001400287520121000301592002801511650001101539650002001550650001901570650001901589650002801608650001401636650001401650650004101664650002301705650001201728650001201740650001601752650002101768650001901789650004401808650002201852650002001874650001301894650002101907653002501928653001901953653003001972653002102002700001902023700001402042700001802056700001502074773014602089856008302235852000902318655001202327IND60701424520221121085443.0210519e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070142452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fshw.2020.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jingna10aPurification, structural elucidation, and in vitro antitumor effects of novel polysaccharides from Bangia fuscopurpurea  ap. 63-71.  aA water-soluble polysaccharide, designated BFP-3, was isolated from Bangia fuscopurpurea by hot water extraction, anion-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography and tested to determine its antitumor activity. The structural characteristics of BFP-3 were investigated by chemical and spectroscopic methods, including partial acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that BFP-3 was mainly comprised of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose, and galactose. Moreover, the weight-average molecular weight of BFP-3 was estimated to be approximately 333 kDa. The backbone of BFP-3 was primarily composed of repeating 5-α-l-Araf-1→(4-α-d-Glcp-1)₄→4,6-β-d-Manp-1 units, and the side chains consisted of repeating β-d-Galp-1→(4-β-d-Galp-1)₄→4,6-β- d-Galp-1→3,4-α-l-Rhap, β-l-Arap-1→(3-β-d-Galp-1)₃, and β-l-Arap-1 units. Counting Kit-8 assays revealed that BFP-3 significantly inhibited the proliferation of A2780, COC1, SKOV3, HO-8910, and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells in vitro, indicating that BFP-3 could have potential applications in the treatment of ovarian cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBangia 3aacid hydrolysis 3aanimal ovaries 3aanion exchange 3aantineoplastic activity 3aarabinose 3agalactose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agel chromatography 3aglucose 3amannose 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aovarian neoplasms 3apolysaccharides 3arhamnose 3awater solubility 0aBangia fuscopurpurea 0aPolysaccharide 0aStructure, ovarian cancer 0aAntitumor effect1 aChen, Xiaoting1 aQiao, Kun1 aSu, Yongchang1 aLiu, Zhiyu0 tFood science and human wellness.g2021 Jan., v. 10, no. 1 p.63-71dElsevier B.V.aKeAi Communications Co.

The origins of this activity and the nature of the active species remain open questions. Gas-phase studies of isolated gold clusters hold promise for disentangling these problems. Here we address the interaction of neutral gold clusters (Auₙ; 4 ≤ n ≤ 21) with molecular oxygen by probing the highly characteristic O–O vibrational stretch frequencies. This reveals that for selected cluster sizes the oxygen is highly activated with respect to the free moiety. Complementary quantum chemical calculations provide evidence for substantial electron transfer to the O₂ unit and concomitant rearrangement of the parent gold cluster structure upon binding and activation. This gives evidence for a model of the interaction between neutral gold clusters and molecular oxygen.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aelectron transfer 3agases 3agold 3amodels 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aoxygen1 aMeijer, Gerard1 aFielicke, André0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 135, no. 5 p.1727-1730dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja312223t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245012400157300001600281520148800297592002801785650001101813650001301824650002001837650001301857650001901870650001301889650002401902650001201926650001501938650001401953650001501967650001201982650002001994650002102014650002202035653002702057653002702084653001502111653002002126700001902146700002702165700002302192700002302215773010202238852000902340856007202349655001202421IND4421706120221122085229.0200510e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442170612DNAL7 a10.1071/MU080652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortelli, Dean J.10aSocial organisation and foraging ecology of the cooperatively breeding Chestnut-crowned Babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps)  ap. 153-162.  aAn individual's fitness is assumed to be maximised through early dispersal and independent breeding. However, offspring across a diversity of taxonomic groups delay dispersal and remain with at least one of their parents after reaching sexual maturity. Delayed dispersal and resulting family living are expected to arise when constraints exist on independent reproduction and where offspring benefit by remaining philopatric. A first step to elucidating the nature of such constraints and benefits for a given species is to have an understanding of the social organisation and habitat preferences of a species. The present study examined the social organisation, foraging preferences and characteristics of preferred foraging areas during a breeding season in the cooperatively breeding Chestnut-crowned Babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps). During the study, groups of Babblers bred plurally in breeding units of two to 13 adults that occupied non-exclusive home-ranges averaging 38 ha, with larger groups occupying larger ranges. Babblers spent most of the day foraging, mostly on the ground, and preferred to forage within drainage zones. The preference for such zones probably arose because they offered both greater vegetative cover from aerial predators and biomasses of potential prey. These findings lead to the prediction that the availability of drainage zones within a group's range will influence offspring dispersal decisions in Chestnut-crowned Babblers at the site studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3adrainage 3afamily studies 3aforaging 3ahabitat preferences 3aparents 3aphilopatry 3apredators 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3asexual maturity 3asocial structure 3aspecies diversity 0abenefits of philopatry 0aecological constraints 0ahome-range 0aplural breeding1 aBarclay, Holly1 aRussell, Deborah J.

Assessing mitochondrial function in mouse peripheral nerves can be challenging due to the small sample size, a limited number of mitochondria present in the tissue, and the presence of a myelin sheath. The technique described in this work minimizes these challenges by using a unique permeabilization protocol adapted from one used for muscle fibers, to assess sciatic nerve mitochondrial function instead of isolating the mitochondria from the tissue. By measuring fluorimetric reactive species production with Amplex Red/Peroxidase and comparing different mitochondrial substrates and inhibitors in saponin-permeabilized nerves, it was possible to detect mitochondrial respiratory states, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the activity of mitochondrial complexes simultaneously. Therefore, the method presented here offers advantages compared to the assessment of mitochondrial function by other techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3afluorometry 3amice 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3amyelin sheath 3anerve tissue 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3apermeability 3aperoxidase 3areactive oxygen species 3asample size1 aCamacho-Pereira, Juliana0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 May 05, , no. 183 p.e63690-e63690dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/636903Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63690/assessing-mitochondrial-function-sciatic-nerve-high-resolution  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245015600177300001600333520081600349592002801165650003301193650002401226650001801250650002701268650001301295650002201308650001501330650001401345650003001359650001801389650001401407650001201421651001001433700002101443700002201464700002301486700002101509700002501530700002401555773010401579856008601683852000901769655001201778IND60087701720221122103132.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008770172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohapatra, Jajati K.10aMultiplex PCR for rapid detection of serotype A foot-and-mouth disease virus variants with amino acid deletion at position 59 of the capsid protein VP3  ap. 287-291.  aIn India, there has been co-circulation, extinction and emergence of genotypes/lineages within serotype A foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. At present an antigenically heterogeneous, unique lineage within genotype VII dominates the field outbreaks. This genetic cluster has amino acid deletion at position 59 of VP3 (VP3⁵⁹-deletion group), considered to be critical antigenically. The emergence of this group warrants rapid and accurate detection to facilitate early planning and implementation of an effective control policy. A rapid multiplex PCR assay was developed for detection of the dominating VP3⁵⁹-deletion group with 100% sensitivity and specificity, even before generating sequence data and confirmatory phylogenetic analysis. This development is important for surveillance of FMD in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aamino acid deletion 3acoat proteins 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3agenotype 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3aserotypes 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aPandey, Laxmi K.1 aSharma, Gaurav K.1 aBarik, Sushanta K.1 aPawar, Sachin S.1 aPalsamy, Rameshkumar1 aPattnaik, Bramhadev0 tJournal of virological methods.g2011 Jan., v. 171, no. 1 p.287-291dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015400166500001900320520112000339592002801459650002401487650001601511650001701527650001501544653003901559653003801598653001401636653001501650653001401665700001901679773011001698856008301808852000901891655001201900IND60701424720221121120116.0200831e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070142472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fpsl.2020.1005372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFengler, Romy10aMigration and permeation of mineral oil components from paper-based food contact materials into foods – A critical comparison of analytical methods  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMineral oil hydrocarbons (MOH) have been focused upon for their ability to migrate out of recycled, paper-based food contact materials. Their transfer into food products is controlled and predicted using various methods. This article provides insight into a variety of testing methods concerned with the migration and permeation of MOH. The influence of the experimental design and analytical approaches on the results is critically discussed. The research on and the potential of theoretical approaches by mathematical modelling are considered. Migration test conditions have not been regulated thus far. Those based on existing regulations dealing with polymers are generally inappropriate. In principle, there should be a focus on the application of food simulants and model substances. There is a wide range of barrier efficiency test methods for the adequate use of functional barrier materials. Permeation experiments, which result in physicochemical properties of the barrier, seem to be more suitable. Mathematical modeling has a high potential for simplifying the evaluation of the quantity of MOH in food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperimental design 3amineral oil 3apermeability 3ashelf life 0aMineral oil saturated hydrocarbons 0aMineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons 0aMigration 0aPermeation 0aModelling1 aGruber, Ludwig0 tFood packaging and shelf life.g2020 Sept., v. 25 p.100537-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23300x2214-28947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2020.1005373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01777naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011600158300001800274520074500292592002801037650001201065650000901077650001401086650002401100700001901124700002201143700002201165700002401187700002501211773013101236856007501367852000901442655001201451IND60539048120221122040847.0160815e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053904812DNAL7 a10.1021/ja31268492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukazawa, Aiko10aThiophene-Fused Bisdehydro[12]annulene That Undergoes Transannular Alkyne Cycloaddition by Either Light or Heat  ap. 1731-1734.  aA new bisdehydro[12]annulene derivative having a thiophene-fused structure has been synthesized. This highly twisted π-conjugated macrocycle with two acetylene moieties in close proximity produces a [2+2]-type alkyne cycloadduct by either photoirradiation or mild heating without any transition metals. Theoretical calculations reveal that the thermal reaction proceeds through successive 8π and 4π electrocyclic reactions, while the photochemical reaction is an asynchronous concerted [2+2] cycloaddition. The fused structure with the less-aromatic thiophene ring is crucial for achieving this reaction. The cycloadduct, thiophene-fused biphenylene, has significant potential as a new polycyclic π-scaffold for electronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aheat 3athiophene 3atransition elements1 aOshima, Hiroya1 aShiota, Yoshihito1 aTakahashi, Shouya1 aYoshizawa, Kazunari1 aYamaguchi, Shigehiro0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 135, no. 5 p.1731-1734dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja31268493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03995naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001600167245013500183300001600318500001500334520176800349592002802117650002702145650001302172650001002185650001302195650001002208650001202218650002502230650001202255650002302267650001902290650001802309650001302327650002502340650001302365650001302378650003002391650001402421650001402435650002602449650001802475650001702493650001902510650001802529650004502547650005202592650001802644650001102662650001102673650002002684650003802704650002202742653002002764653002602784653002202810653000802832653002102840653001502861653001002876653001702886700001702903700001902920700001702939700002002956700001602976700001802992700002603010773007403036856008203110852000903192655001203201IND60099098820221117200137.0161021e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009909882DNAL7 a238920852pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzgu, Fatih10aSevere renal tubulopathy in a newborn due to BCS1L gene mutation: Effects of different treatment modalities on the clinical course  ap. 364-366.  a2019-12-06  aVery early onset Toni–Debré–Fanconi Syndrome, a disorder of proximal renal tubules of the kidney which results in the increased urinary excretion of glucose, amino acids, uric acid, phosphate and bicarbonate, could be the manifestation of various inborn errors. Defects of oxidative phosphorylation are a heterogeneous group of disorders with various clinical presentations. Recently, patients with early liver failure, renal tubulopathy and encephalopathy due to the mutations in the BCS1L gene coding for a structural protein in mitochondrial complex III have been described.Ten-day-old female newborn was referred to our clinic because of intractable acidosis. Physical examination revealed severe hypotonia, and hepatomegaly. The laboratory examinations revealed lactic acidosis, increased blood alanine, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, generalized aminoaciduria and glucosuria. The tubular reabsorption of phosphate was reduced. Because of multisystem involvement, mitochondrial disease was suspected and the mutational analysis of the BCS1L gene revealed homozygous P99L mutation. As the patient was unresponsive to bicarbonate replacement, oral dichloroacetate and peritoneal dialysis, continuous high dose intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy with a dose up to 1.25mEq/kg/h was started. The patient got on well until the age of 9months when she died of sepsis.It was stressed that high dose intravenous continuous sodium bicarbonate therapy could be an alternative treatment option in patients with severe acidosis and renal tubulopathy resistant to dichloroacetate and peritoneal dialysis. Patients with BCS1L mutations should be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe tubulopathy in the newborn period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartate transaminase 3aacidosis 3agenes 3aneonates 3ablood 3aglucose 3aalanine transaminase 3aalanine 3asodium bicarbonate 3aencephalopathy 3arenal tubules 3apatients 3aclinical examination 3adialysis 3amutation 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aexcretion 3auric acid 3aintravenous injection 3aliver failure 3ahomozygosity 3adisease course 2aConsanguinity 2aElectron Transport Complex IIIxgenetics 2aFanconi Syndromexdiagnosisxgeneticsxtherapy. 2aFatal Outcome 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant, Newborn 2aPseudomonas Infectionsxdiagnosis 2aSepsisxdiagnosis 0aLactic acidosis 0aMitochondrial disease 0aRenal tubulopathy 0aDCA 0aGRACILE syndrome 0aBCS1L gene 0aBCS1L 0atherapeutics1 aSenaca, Sara1 aGunduz, Mehmet1 aTumer, Leyla1 aHasanoglu, Alev1 aTiras, Ulku1 aUnsal, Rukiye1 aBakkaloglu, Sevcan A.0 tGene.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 528 p.364-366dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012100204300001800325520118500343592002801528650001201556650001201568650001301580650001901593650002601612650001501638650000901653650002201662650001101684650003001695651001801725700006401743700002401807700002201831700002201853700001901875773012701894856008302021852000902104655001202113IND60795142120221122145739.0221001e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079514212DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-022-06253-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Renu S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8926-897510aWhy coupled general circulation models overestimate the ENSO and Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) relationship?  ap. 2995-3011.  aInterannual variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is modulated by Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies over Indo-Pacific Oceans, especially by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In general, coupled models used for seasonal prediction overestimate the correlation between ENSO and ISMR compared to observations. By analysing the observational data from 1982 to 2017, this study shows that the relationship between ENSO and ISMR is weak during August compared to the other months of the summer monsoon season (June, July, and September). This weak association between ENSO and ISMR during August is due to an increase in the synoptic variability. Thus, the effect of large-scale flow dominated by ENSO is suppressed by the formation of a synoptic system in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), making ENSO-ISMR relation feeble in August. The data analysis of various coupled models shows that all models underestimate synoptic variability, due to which simulated ENSO-ISMR relation is overestimated during August. Coupled model exhibit strong biases in relative humidity and cyclonic circulation over the northern BoB hence underestimating the synoptic variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aclimate 3adynamics 3amonsoon season 3aobservational studies 3aprediction 3arain 3arelative humidity 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aBay of Bengal1 aRao, Suryachandra A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6460-56721 aPillai, Prasanth A.1 aSrivastava, Ankur1 aPradhan, Maheswar1 aRamu, Dandi A.0 tClimate dynamics.g2022 Nov., v. 59, no. 9-10 p.2995-3011dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06253-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014300163300001800306520174200324592002802066650003402094650002502128650002802153650002602181650002502207650001502232650001502247650001702262650001002279650001302289650000902302650001902311650001302330650002802343650001302371650002602384650001702410650001502427650001402442700001902456700002302475700002002498700002002518700002902538700002002567700006202587773012502649856008302774852000902857655001202866IND60780196020221121185448.0220731e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078019602DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-02980-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Azmi10aInduction of Iron Stress in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Lines by Siderophore of Aspergillus nidulans Towards Promising Anticancer Effect  ap. 3594-3607.  aHepatocellular carcinoma is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and needs efficient and feasible approach of treatment. Present study focuses on exploring the anticancer activity of a secondary metabolite called siderophore of Aspergillus nidulans against hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2. These small peptides are produced by microorganisms including fungi for scavenging iron from its surroundings. Fungi including Aspergillus spp. are known to produce siderophores under iron-limited conditions. Siderophores have high affinity towards iron and are classified into various types. In the present study, siderophore isolated and purified from fungal cultures was confirmed to be of hydroxamate type by chrome azurol sulfonate and Atkin’s assay. HPLC analysis confirmed purity while LC–ESI–MS revealed that the siderophore is triacetyl fusigen. Cancerous cells, HepG2, grown under siderophore treatment showed inhibition in growth and proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Reduction in viability and metabolic activity was evident upon treatment as seen in trypan blue, MTT and WST assay. Fluorescent staining using PI and DAPI confirmed the same while DCFDA staining revealed increased reactive oxygen species production which might have led to cell death and deterioration. Such increase in ROS has been correlated with iron accumulation by assessing intracellular iron level through ICP-MS. To assess the effect of siderophore treatment on normal cells, WRL-68, same assays were carried out but the effect was mostly non-significant up to 48 h. Thus, present work suggests that an optimum dose of siderophore purified from A. nidulans culture might prove a useful anticancer agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiochemical pathways 3acell death 3acell lines 3afluorescence 3afungi 3ahepatoma 3airon 3aneoplasm cells 3apeptides 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch 3asecondary metabolites 3asiderophores 3asulfonates 3aviability1 aSingh, Pratika1 aChaudhary, Archana1 aHaque, Rizwanul1 aSingh, Prashant1 aMiśra, Aruṇa Kumāra,1 aSarkar, Abhijit1 aSrivastava, Amrita1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9657-72230 tBiological trace element research.g2022 Aug., v. 200, no. 8 p.3594-3607dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02980-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03847naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245019300174300001300367520205200380592002802432650001702460650001102477650002402488650001702512650001802529650001502547650001102562650001502573650001602588650001502604650001802619650001302637650002102650650001502671650001502686651001202701651002202713653002002735653002002755653002202775653002602797653002102823700002202844700001902866700002102885700001702906700002302923700001802946700002402964700002102988700002103009700002003030773010003050856008603150852000903236655001203245IND60562789020221116160754.0190408e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056278902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasqualini, Vanina10aSpatiotemporal dynamics of submerged macrophyte status and watershed exploitation in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon: Understanding critical factors in ecosystem degradation and restoration  ap. 1-14.  aIncreases in the intensity of disturbances in coastal lagoons can lead to shifts in vegetation from aquatic angiosperms to macroalgal or phytoplankton communities. Such abrupt and discontinuous responses are facilitated by instability in the equilibrium controlling the trajectory of the community response. We hypothesized that the shift in macrophyte populations is reversible, and that this reversibility is dependent on changes in the pressures exerted on the watershed and lagoon functioning. Biguglia lagoon (Mediterranean Sea, Corsica) is an interesting case study for the evaluation of long-term coastal lagoon ecosystem functioning and the trajectory of submerged macrophyte responses to disturbances, to facilitate the appropriate restoration of ecosystems. We used historical data for a two hundred-year period to assess changes in human activities on the watershed of the Biguglia lagoon. Macrophyte mapping (from 1970) and monitoring data for dynamics (from 1999) were used to investigate the trajectory of the community response. The changes observed in this watershed included a large number of hydrological developments affecting salinity and resulting in changes in macrophyte distribution. Nutrient inputs over the last 40 years have led to a shift in the aquatic vegetation from predominantly aquatic angiosperm community to macroalgae and phytoplankton in 2007 (dystrophic crisis). Changes in hydrological management and improvements in sewage treatment after 2007 led to a significant increase of aquatic angiosperms over a relatively short period of time (4–5 years), particularly for Ruppia cirrhosa and Stuckenia pectinata. There has been a significant resurgence of Najas marina, due to changes in salinity. The observed community shift suggests that Biguglia lagoon is resilient and that the transition may be reversible. The restored communities closely resemble those present before disturbance. These findings demonstrate the need to understand watershed exploitation and ecosystem variability in lagoon restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNajas marina 3aRuppia 3aStuckenia pectinata 3acase studies 3acoastal water 3aecosystems 3ahumans 3amacroalgae 3amacrophytes 3amonitoring 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3asewage treatment 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aCorsica 3aMediterranean Sea 0aCoastal lagoons 0aHuman pressures 0aLong-term changes 0aSubmerged macrophytes 0aCommunity shifts1 aDerolez, Valérie1 aGarrido, Marie1 aOrsoni, Valerie,1 aBaldi, Yoann1 aEtourneau, Sabrina1 aLeoni, Vanina1 aRébillout, Patrick1 aLaugier, Thierry1 aSouchu, Philippe1 aMalet, Nathalie0 tEcological engineering.g2017 May, v. 102 p.1-14dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245018200205300001600387500002000403520162500423592002802048596006902076596006202145650002202207650001302229650002102242650001402263650001202277650002202289650001302311650001202324650002002336650001302356650001102369650002402380650001702404650001502421650001702436700007802453700006402531773013702595856007402732852000902806655001202815IND60792880520221118052147.0220911e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079288052DNAL7 a10.1111/jac.124982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrudzińska, Magdalena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1268-895X10aDrought stress during the growing season: Changes in reducing sugars, starch content and respiration rate during storage of two potato cultivars differing in drought sensitivity  ap. 609-620.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe research was carried out on two potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) varieties with different tolerance to drought stress. Both varieties were cultivated in various moisture conditions: No stress, which uses the natural atmospheric conditions prevailing during the growing season and supplemented with water using drip irrigation and two combinations of drought conditions: 40 days stress at tuberizations, and intermittent drought (3 stress periods of 7 days). After harvesting, the tubers were stored at two temperatures, that is, 5°C and 8°C, for 39, 67, 143 and 164 days. The main aim of the research was the evaluation of the reaction of two potato varieties differing in drought stress tolerance to the accumulation of sugars and the respiration rate of tubers. It was found that tubers of drought stress‐sensitive variety (Cekin) accumulated more glucose and fructose than tubers of drought‐resistant variety (Tajfun), regardless of the type of drought applied during the growing season. The applied drought, both constant and intermittent, resulted in an increase in the content of reducing sugars compared with the control conditions. After applying both types of drought during the vegetation period, the respiration rate increased during tuber storage. Larger changes were recorded in the case of an intermittent drought. At a higher storage temperature, in the variety resistant to drought stress, a decrease in glucose content was found after long‐term storage, while in the sensitive variety, the content of this component increased, regardless of the moisture conditions during the growing season.  aPublisher supplied data  aMRiRW: 29:4‐3‐00‐3‐02cMinistry of Agriculture in Poland  aD.S.

Gouty arthritis is the inflammation of tissues and joints caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. In this experiment, we investigated the anti-hyperuricemic effectiveness of different concentrations of AgO-NPs in mice. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of administration of AgO-NPs in monosodium urate (MSU)–induced gouty mice for the very first time. Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were administered intraperitoneal for gout induction, followed by 5, 10, and 20 µg/mL doses of AgO-NPs for 2 weeks. The positive control was provided with the commercially available drug allopurinol to compare the effects of AgO-NPs and allopurinol. The main purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of the nanoparticles in comparison with commercially available drugs. AgO-NPs have been shown to improve the condition of gouty arthritis by reducing significantly (P ˂ 0.001) increased levels of ALT, AST, and total bilirubin. The total protein estimation results showed significant improvement at concentration of 20 µg/mL of AgO-NPs. The lipid profile results showed that high concentration (20 µg/mL) of AgO-NPs decrease the lipid content significantly as compared to control. It was concluded from this study that the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antilipidemic properties of AgO-NPs may improve the hyperuricemic condition in gouty arthritis mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallopurinol 3aantioxidants 3abilirubin 3agout 3ainflammation 3alipid content 3aprotein content 3aresearch 3asilver oxide 3atissue repair 3atrace elements1 aMoghul, Nurain Baig1 aJaved, Ambreen1 aButt, Maisra Azhar1 aAbbas, Hassan Burair1 aRehman, Hamza1 aRajput, Tausif Ahmed1 aBokhari, Syed Ali Imran0 tBiological trace element research.g2022 Aug., v. 200, no. 8 p.3677-3687dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02960-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013600166500001900302520184000321592002802161650001602189650001502205650001302220650001302233650001102246650001402257650001402271650001002285650001802295650001202313650001302325650001602338650001602354650001702370650002102387650002102408650001302429653001402442653002002456653002002476653001902496700002402515773010202539856008202641852000902723655001202732IND60701425320221121120128.0201125e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070142532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cpb.2020.1001602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKundu, Atreyee10aGhMATE1 expression regulates Aluminum tolerance of cotton and overexpression of GhMATE1 enhances acid soil tolerance of Arabidopsis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe ionic form of Aluminum (Al³⁺) is one of the dangerous metals to the plants under acid soil condition. A principal functional tool of plant Al tolerance encompasses Al-induced stimulation of membrane transporters, which accelerates the organic acid release from the root region. The released organic acid (usually citrate, oxalate and malate) form stable and nontoxic complexes with Al in the rhizosphere. Several genes were characterized to understand the acid soil tolerance mechanisms of plants. In particular, Al-activated malate and citrate discharge from the roots are effectively involved in acid soil stress tolerance mechanisms. Based on the above mechanisms, in this present work, the cotton citrate (GhMATE1 [Multidrug and Toxic compound Extrusion]) transporters has been cloned and characterized in Cotton. Down-regulation of GhMATE1 (GhMATE1-RNAi) system increased the sensitivity to Al and proton. Moreover, plants lacking GhMATE1 released negligible amount of citrate when compared with control plants. The primary and secondary root growth of GhMATE1-RNAi-lines was significantly inhibited under Al stress conditions. Besides, Al stress responsive genes like GhALMT1 (Aluminum-activated Malate Transporter 1), GhSTOP1 (Sensitive to Proton toxicity 1) and GhALS3 (Aluminum Sensitive 3) were not affected in GhMATE1-RNAi lines. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing GhMATE1 exhibited Al tolerant phenotypes and these transgenic plants displayed accelerated root growth and enhanced citrate excretion when compared with control plants. The results pointed out that the GhMATE1 expression is Al inducible and controls the citrate-mediated Al³⁺ sequestration. These observations indicated that GhMATE1 is a key gene which is involved in Al induced citrate release and lateral root growth arrest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3acitrates 3acotton 3aexcretion 3aextrusion 3agenes 3alateral roots 3amalates 3aoxalates 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3asoil quality 3astress tolerance 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aMATE gene 0aRhizotoxicities 0aSecondary roots 0aAbiotic stress1 aGanesan, Markkandan0 tCurrent plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 24 p.100160-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23302x2214-66287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpb.2020.1001603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010300164300001800267520121600285592002801501650002101529650001101550650001001561650001401571650001501585650002401600650002001624700001701644700001901661700001801680700001501698773009101713856008101804852000901885655001201894IND60575679120221121160828.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057567912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-017-1216-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jingjing10aHomogeneous dispersion of chitin nanofibers in polylactic acid with different pretreatment methods  ap. 1705-1715.  aChitin nanofibers extracted from crab shell were used to reinforce polylactic acid (PLA) by extrusion molding. The dispersion problem of nanofibers in PLA matrix was solved by three pretreatment methods, including water pretreatment, polyethylene glycol (PEG) pretreatment, and polyethylene oxide (PEO) pretreatment. The results demonstrated that chitin nanofibers were distributed uniformly on the fracture surface of the PLA matrix with three different pretreatment methods. However, the aspect ratio of nanofibers with was reduced with the PEG and PEO pretreatment methods. Therefore, the bending modulus (MOE), bending strength (MOR) and impact toughness of the chitin nanofibers/PLA composites prepared by the water pretreatment method were much higher than those of the composites prepared by the PEG and the PEO pretreatment method. Furthermore, the reinforcing effect with the PEG method is slightly better than that with the PEO method. Although it was found that both PEG and PEO were good interfacial compatibilizers for nanofibers and PLA, the reinforcing effect of the composites prepared by PEG and PEO pretreat methods was suppressed due to the decrease of the aspect ratio for chitin nanofibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abending strength 3achitin 3acrabs 3aextrusion 3ananofibers 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolylactic acid1 aGao, Yanqing1 aZhao, Jingfeng1 aSun, Jingrong1 aLi, Dagang0 tCellulose.g2017 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1705-1715dSpringer Netherlandsx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-017-1216-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011700170300001600287520171500303592002802018596007502046596007302121596007302194596008302267650001602350650001602366650002602382650002602408650001702434650001402451650001202465650001702477650001102494650000902505650002102514650002002535650001402555700001902569700006502588773013502653856008302788852000902871655001202880IND60763687520221119041151.0220121e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076368752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-021-01684-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, O. G. G.10aComparative pangenomic analyses and biotechnological potential of cocoa-related Acetobacter senegalensis strains  ap. 111-123.  aAcetobacter senegalensis belongs to the group of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) that present potential biotechnological applications, for production of D-gluconate, cellulose and acetic acid. AAB can overcome heat and acid stresses by using strategies involving the overexpression of heat-shock proteins and enzymes from the complex pyrroquinoline-ADH, besides alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH). Nonetheless, the isolation of A. senegalensis and other AAB from food may be challenging due to presence of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells and due to uncertainties about nutritional requirements. To contribute for a better understanding of the ecology of AAB, this paper reports on the pangenome analysis of five strains of A. senegalensis recently isolated from a Brazilian spontaneous cocoa fermentation. The results showed biosynthetic clusters exclusively found in some cocoa-related AAB, such as those related to terpene pathways, which are important for flavour development. Genes related to oxidative stress were conserved in all the genomes, with multiple clusters. Moreover, there were genes coding for ADH and putative ABC transporters distributed in core, shell and cloud genomes, while chaperonin-encoding genes were present only in the core and soft-core genomes. Regarding quorum sensing, a response regulator gene was in the shell genome, and the gene encoding for acyl-homoserine lactone efflux protein was in the soft-core genome. There were quorum quenching-related genes, mainly encoding for lactonases, but also for acylases. Moreover, A. senegalensis did not have determinants of virulence or antibiotic resistance, which are good traits for strains intended to be applied in food fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018/13564-3cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a18/13564-3cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a306330/2019-9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aAcetobacter 3aacetic acid 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiosynthesis 3acellulose 3aecology 3afermentation 3aflavor 3aheat 3aoxidative stress 3aregulator genes 3avirulence1 aGimenez, M.

The well‐fitted regression equations both for the yellowness and for the sensory score of cooked rice were obtained, with the R² values of 0.946 and 0.881, respectively. The predicted lowest yellowness and highest sensory score were 5.619 and 82.801, and the optimized concentrations of l‐cys, CP and SE‐15 were 0.03, 0.16 and 0.15%, respectively. The verification results showed that the lowest yellowness and highest sensory score were 5.633 and 82, which was in accordance with the predicted value. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Cooked rice is one of the most important ready‐to‐eat meals in human daily life. But during storage, it is easy for them to undergo non‐enzymatic browning reaction, which has an influence on the color and sensory quality of cooked rice and reduce the commercial value for cooked rice. The main utility of this research is the application of food additive combinations based on l‐cysteine in cooked rice, which can be considered a novel technique to maintain the quality of cooked rice during storage. The color and sensory analyses on stored cooked rice can confirm that the combined food additives of l‐cysteine, composite phosphate and sucrose ester of fatty acid could inhibit the yellowness and maintain sensory score of cooked rice during storage. The use of this technique could maintain the quality of cooked rice and increase its commercial value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3acolor 3acysteine 3aequations 3afatty acid esters 3afood additives 3ahumans 3aphosphates 3aready-to-eat foods 3arice 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3asucrose1 aDeng, Shasha1 aDing, Yuting1 aLyu, Fei0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2015 Oct., v. 39, no. 5 p.488-494dFood & Nutrition Press.x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.122543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04638naa a2201021 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100002400167245015500191300001400346500001500360520174600375592002802121650004502149650001702194650001702211650001602228650003202244650001102276650003002287650004002317650001702357650002402374650001202398650001002410650001302420650002102433650001302454650002502467650003502492650001002527650002102537650001602558650002502574650002302599650002802622650005302650650001102703650001902714650003202733650003802765650001102803650005102814650000902865650001602874650002602890650003602916650001502952650003002967650002102997650001603018653001703034653001003051653000903061653001003070653001703080653002603097653001003123653000803133653000803141653000803149653001103157653000703168653000703175653000803182653002703190653001003217653000703227653000803234653000803242700001803250700002303268700002303291700002403314700002603338700001703364700001703381700001703398700002603415773007203441856008203513852000903595655001203604IND60099099420221117200238.0161021e20131010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009909942DNAL7 a239332712pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.07.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkadam-Teker, Basak14aThe effects of age and gender on the relationship between HMGCR promoter-911 SNP (rs33761740) and serum lipids in patients with coronary heart disease  ap. 93-98.  a2019-12-06  aHydroxymethylglutaryl-Coenzyme A Reductase (HMGCR) catalyzes the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. This enzyme is the target of the widely available cholesterol lowering statins. In this population-based case–control study, the frequencies of -911 C>A polymorphism (rs3761740) of the HMGCR gene in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and healthy subjects were investigated and the correlations between the different genotypes and hypercholesterolemia with cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed.The HMGCR genotypes were determined in 365 patients with CHD and 365 controls by PCR–RFLP assay. Anthropometric measurements were measured in all participants.There was no significant difference in the genotype frequencies of the HMGCR polymorphism between the male subjects of both patient and control groups, however, the HMGCR-CC genotype was found to be more frequent in female patients with CHD than female controls (p=0.002). The HMGCR-CC genotype showed higher total-cholesterol (TC) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels than the CA+AA genotypes in male CHD patients (p=0.018). Due to this significant sex interaction, a multivariate analysis was conducted on the patient group. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the HMGCR-CC genotype was significantly associated with age<55 (OR=2.837, p=0.001) and TC≥5.18mmol/L (OR=1.970, p=0.027) in male subjects. However, this association was not observed in female patients (p>0.05). This analysis confirmed that the HMGCR-CC genotype was associated with elevated TC levels in male CHD patients with age<55years.These results suggest that age and sex modify the contribution of the HMGCR-911 polymorphism to fasting serum TC, LDL-C levels and risk of CHD.  aPublisher supplied data 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ablood lipids 3abiosynthesis 3ablood serum 3aanthropometric measurements 3agender 3apolymerase chain reaction 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3arisk factors 3aregression analysis 3afasting 3agenes 3agenotype 3acoronary disease 3apatients 3ahypercholesterolemia 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAdult 2aAge Distribution 2aAge Factors 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCoronary Diseasexbloodxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHumans 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductasesxgenetics 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aPrevalence 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aSex Distribution 2aSex Factors 0aPolymorphism 0aLDL-C 0arisk 0aHDL-C 0aLipoproteins 0amultivariate analysis 0aHMGCR 0aDBP 0aHWE 0aBMI 0aVLDL-C 0aAD 0aTC 0aSBP 0aCoronary heart disease 0aSREBP 0aTG 0aSNP 0aCHD1 aKurnaz, Ozlem1 aCoskunpinar, Ender1 aDaglar-Aday, Aynur1 aKucukhuseyin, Ozlem1 aCakmak, Huseyin Altug1 aTeker, Erhan1 aBugra, Zehra1 aOzturk, Oguz1 aYilmaz-Aydogan, Hulya0 tGene.g2013 Oct. 10, v. 528 p.93-98dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.07.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013700158300002000295520178000315592002802095650002002123650001602143650001502159650002602174650001602200650001402216650000902230650001802239650001902257650001402276650000702290650002202297650002102319650002802340650001302368650001902381700001402400700001602414700001502430700001802445700001202463700001302475700001802488773013402506856007502640852000902715655001202724IND60539048920221122005247.0160815e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053904892DNAL7 a10.1021/ja408286k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Jiangwei10aCell-Specific and pH-Activatable Rubyrin-Loaded Nanoparticles for Highly Selective Near-Infrared Photodynamic Therapy against Cancer  ap. 18850-18858.  aSpatiotemporal control of singlet oxygen (¹O₂) release is a major challenge for photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer with high therapeutic efficacy and minimum side effects. Here a selenium-rubyrin (NMe₂Se₄N₂)-loaded nanoparticle functionalized with folate (FA) was designed and synthesized as an acidic pH-activatable targeted photosensitizer. The nanoparticles could specifically recognize cancer cells via the FA-FA receptor binding and were selectively taken up by cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis to enter lysosomes, in which NMe₂Se₄N₂ was activated to produce ¹O₂. The pH-controllable release of ¹O₂ specially damaged the lysosomes and thus killed cancer cells in a lysosome-associated pathway. The introduction of selenium into the rubyrin core enhanced the ¹O₂ generation efficiency due to the heavy atom effect, and the substitution of dimethylaminophenyl moiety at meso-position led to the pH-controllable activation of NMe₂Se₄N₂. Under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, NMe₂Se₄N₂ possessed high singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ) at an acidic pH (ΦΔ = 0.69 at pH 5.0 at 635 nm) and could be deactivated at physiological pH (ΦΔ = 0.06 at pH 7.4 at 635 nm). The subcellular location-confined pH-activatable photosensitization at NIR region and the cancer cell-targeting feature led to excellent capability to selectively kill cancer cells and prevent the damage to normal cells, which greatly lowered the side effects. Through intravenous injection of FA-NMe₂Se₄N₂ nanoparticles in tumor-bearing mice, tumor elimination was observed after NIR irradiation. This work presents a new paradigm for specific PDT against cancer and provides a new avenue for preparation of highly efficient photosensitizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aendocytosis 3afolic acid 3aintravenous injection 3airradiation 3alysosomes 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apH 3aphotochemotherapy 3aphotosensitivity 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aselenium 3asinglet oxygen1 aDing, Lin1 aXu, Hai-Jun1 aShen, Zhen1 aJu, Huangxian1 aJia, Li1 aBao, Lei1 aYu, Runsheng,0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Dec. 18, v. 135, no. 50 p.18850-18858dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja408286k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007800169300001600247520116900263592002801432650004101460650001601501650001201517650001301529650001701542650001901559650001401578650001101592651001701603653001201620653002201632653001501654653001401669653001701683653001501700700001801715700002001733773010701753856008501860852000901945655001201954IND50066207720221120150424.0190215e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006620772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2012.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkins, Shanan10aHumpback dolphin bycatch in the shark nets in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  ap. 442-449.  aHumpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) in South Africa are classified as Vulnerable and one quantifiable threat is accidental mortality in the shark nets in KwaZulu-Natal. We investigated the spatial, temporal and life history patterns of this bycatch to guide mitigation strategies to decrease humpback dolphin capture. A total of 203 individuals were caught between 1980 and 2009. We analysed patterns of captures in relation to the area of capture (location) and year and month of retrieval from the nets. We also analysed the distribution of the sex and size (body length) of humpback dolphins. Most catches (61%) occurred at Richards Bay in the northern part of their distribution in South Africa. Annual catch rate fluctuated considerably and there was little seasonality. The sex ratio was male-biased (1.55:1) and in particular skewed towards adolescents (56%) which constituted the majority of the catch. We suggest that mitigation strategies be focused at Richards Bay, throughout the year. Of the existing shark net mitigation strategies, changing fishing gear from nets to baited hooks (drumlines) could be useful to decrease humpback dolphin capture rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquacultural and fisheries equipment 3abody length 3abycatch 3adolphins 3alife history 3arisk reduction 3asex ratio 3asharks 3aSouth Africa 0aBycatch 0aHumpback dolphins 0aShark nets 0aGill nets 0aLife history 0aMitigation1 aCliff, Geremy1 aPillay, Neville0 tBiological conservation.g2013 Mar., v. 159 p.442-449dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010100177520185000278592002802128650001802156650001102174650001902185650000902204650001502213650001502228650001302243650001702256650001902273650002102292650001302313650001902326650001602345650001002361653001902371653003002390653002302420700002002443700006402463700005702527773011602584856008702700852000902787655001202796IND60683552420221119203208.0200318e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068355242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1124842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurcas, Fabio Enrico10aSodium carbonate-based post combustion carbon capture utilising trona as main sorbent feed stock  aIn the pursuit of shifting technology towards sustainable, environmentally benign processes, post-combustion carbon capture technology is recognised to be a timely mitigation option. This paper presents the development of a novel sodium carbonate-based post combustion carbon capture process utilising the carbonate mineral trona (trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate) as main sorbent feedstock source. The energy penalty, the fraction of energy sacrificed to capture CO2 relative to the net energy produced serves as main performance indicator. Investigations on the correlative relationship between energy penalty as a function of capture efficiency are carried out by retrofitting the process to a 600 MW reference coal-fired power plant. The energy penalty of the global system features a distinct local minimum of 3.99%, corresponding to a CO2 capture efficiency of 90.00% and a CO2 outlet purity of 99.90%. The Specific Primary Energy Consumption for CO2 Avoided (SPECCA) index corresponding to this minimum is evaluated to be SPECCA = 0.514MJkgCO2-1. Sensitivity analyses on the effect of increasingly high SO2 flue gas volume fractions ySO2 show that the capture efficiency is virtually unimpaired for calcination temperatures of 190 ⩽T⩽280 °C and ySO2 ranging from 0.50 to 0.70%. Whilst commercially available CO2 capture technology is energy intense and prone to sorbent degradation, the process developed retains high capture efficiencies of calcium oxide-based looping cycles at low operating temperatures and eliminates the predisposition of amine-based sorbents utilised in scrubbing capture schemes to deplete due to the presence of SO2 in the inlet flue gas stream. It can be concluded that sodium carbonate based post-combustion capture processes are a competitive alternative to existing CO2 capture technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3afeedstocks 3aflue gas 3apower plants 3aprimary energy 3asodium carbonate 3asorbents 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atrona 0aCarbon capture 0aCarbonate looping process 0aSodium bicarbonate1 aPragot, Wanawan1 aChacartegui, Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7285-86611 aAfzal, Waheed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2927-01140 tEnergy conversion and management.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 208 p.112484-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2020.1124843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009300166300001600259520162400275592002801899650001101927650002501938650001201963650002001975650001301995650002302008650001602031650001502047650001302062650002302075650001502098650000902113650001302122650001102135650001502146650001502161651001202176653000802188653000802196653000702204653000702211653000802218653001502226653001302241653003002254653001402284653001502298700001502313700001802328700001702346773010302363856008602466852000902552655001202561IND60562789720221116160714.0190408e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056278972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukla, S.10aShifting nutrient sink and source functions of stormwater detention areas in sub-tropics  ap. 178-187.  aTwo-year field measured water and nutrient fluxes from an agricultural stormwater detention area (SDA) in Florida's Everglades region showed that it was a source of phosphorus (P) for the first year (Y1 retention efficiency=−12%) and a sink for the second year (Y2, 54%). The SDA remained a consistent sink of nitrogen (N). Source function was a combined effect of dilution of incoming drainage from a tropical storm and legacy-based soil P saturation. Denitrification was the main biochemical process contributing to N retention (Y1=23%, Y2=56%). Volume reduction was the main reason for nutrient retention, especially for P because of limited to no remaining soil P sorption capacity. Although a net sink of P for Y2, an event-wise analysis showed the source function for 40% of the outflow events indicating intermittent P release from soil. Because surface P treatment efficiency during both years was either less than or close to the water retention efficiency, volume reduction and not sorption or biological assimilation controlled P treatment. Almost a third of the incoming P was lost through subsurface pathways, highlighting the significance of groundwater P losses from SDAs. Harvesting and removal of biomass can mine P and restore SDA's sink function. For an example sub-basin of Florida Everglades, potentially harvestable P from SDAs was more than the basin P loads. A payment for environmental services project to treat additional P through biomass harvesting is a sustainable approach, especially under future climate projections of more frequent high-intensity storms for the Everglades and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomass 3adenitrification 3adrainage 3aecosystem services 3agroundwater 3aharvesting 3anitrogen 3anutrient retention 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3asorption 3astorms 3astormwater 3asubtropics 3aFlorida 0aSDA 0aBMP 0aTP 0aTN 0aSTA 0aPhosphorus 0aNitrogen 0aBest management practices 0aReservoir 0aDesorption1 aShukla, A.1 aKnowles, J.M.1 aHarris, W.G.0 tEcological engineering.g2017 May, v. 102 p.178-187dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03986naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245011300203300001800316520172900334592002802063596006202091596005902153596006202212596004602274650001902320650002302339650002202362650001902384650001902403650001502422650001202437650001302449650001502462650002102477650001302498650001902511650001902530650001702549650001902566650000902585650000902594650002102603650002002624650001602644650001502660651001002675700005302685700006402738700005302802700006002855700005402915700006102969700005303030700005803083773012703141856008303268852000903351655001203360IND60795143420221122145751.0221001e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079514342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-022-06243-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kexin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1453-697610aEnhanced soil respiration, vegetation and monsoon precipitation at Lantian, East Asia during Pliocene warmth  ap. 2683-2697.  aPliocene warmth has been used as an analogue for predicting climate response to the rapid atmospheric CO₂ increase in the future. Pedogenic carbonates provide an essential archive to reconstruct terrestrial paleoenvironment in a warm world. The stable carbon isotopic compositions of pedogenic carbonate ([Formula: see text]) are principally used to reconstruct the history of C4 plants along with coexisting organic matter [Formula: see text]. However, a growing body of evidence shows spatial and temporal decoupling between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] especially in arid regions, raising concerns when using [Formula: see text] as a proxy for photosynthetic pathway. Here, we report paired [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] data from Pliocene to early Pleistocene loess-paleosols in Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), middle latitude East Asia. The model sensitivity analysis suggests the dominant control of soil respiration flux (SRF) on [Formula: see text] values in this region. SRF is then reconstructed using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Our results show that the SRF was enhanced during Pliocene warmth, associated with increased vegetation density and East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) precipitation. An overall higher SRF across the CLP during the mid-Pliocene, compared with the Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) period, suggests there was a northwestward shift of the EASM rain belt and vegetation under warmer climate. Our results suggest that global temperature has dominated the middle latitude ecosystem and soil variations through its influence on the hydrological cycle, providing insights into future ecological and environmental response to global warming in East Asia.  aPublisher supplied data  a42111530065cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a42021001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41920104005cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a1545859cU.S. National Science Foundation 3aHolocene epoch 3aMonte Carlo method 3aPleistocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3aclimate 3adynamics 3aecosystems 3ahydrologic cycle 3alatitude 3amonsoon season 3aorganic matter 3apaleoecology 3aphotosynthesis 3arain 3asoil 3asoil respiration 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 3avegetation 3aChina1 aLu, Huayu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6306-69851 aGarzione, Carmala N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0350-20011 aZhao, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6496-02411 aLiang, Chenghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2239-742X1 aLi, Shuyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1454-31161 aBreecker, Dan O.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0200-223X1 aLei, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2171-82921 aZhang, Hongyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4656-52450 tClimate dynamics.g2022 Nov., v. 59, no. 9-10 p.2683-2697dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06243-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009500162300001800257520138700275592002801662596005901690596005901749596005901808650002101867650002601888650000801914650002901922650001401951650001301965650001401978650002301992650001802015650001302033650001602046650001702062650003402079650001702113700001902130700001502149700001602164700001802180700001402198700005902212773011102271856008302382852000902465655001202474IND60772933920221120230427.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077293392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04469-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pei10aAntibacterial cotton fabric prepared by a “grafting to” strategy using a QAC copolymer  ap. 3569-3581.  aQuaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have outstanding antimicrobial effect, but covalent immobilization of plentiful QAC onto cotton fiber surface to realize a durable function remains a challenge. Herein, a quaternary ammonium monomer, [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (DMC) was co-polymerized with methyl acrylate (MA) to prepare an antibacterial copolymer, poly(DMC-co-MA). To graft the copolymer with an improved grafting efficiency, cotton fabric was treated using carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) to establish an amino-functionalized fiber surface first. This treatment allows the amidation reactions between the amino groups and the pendant ester groups in the poly(DMC-co-MA) to take place, achieving a durable anionic polymer coating onto the fiber surfaces with remarkably antibacterial effect. Characterization results indicated that when DMC/MA monomer ratio was 100:1, the resulting copolymer endows the modified cotton fabric with antibacterial capability that inactivates all Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Even after 50 laundering cycles, more than 98.0% of the antibacterial rate could still be retained. Moreover, the wearing comfort properties such as softness, water absorption and air permeability of the finishing cotton fabrics have been insignificantly changed by comparing to the untreated cotton fabric.  aPublisher supplied data  a51873195cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51573167cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51803186cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aair 3aantibacterial properties 3acellulose 3achitosan 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3acotton fabric 3ahardness 3alint cotton 3apermeability 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3awater uptake1 aZhang, Mengyi,1 aQu, JieHao1 aWang, LuJie1 aGeng, JunZhao1 aFu, FeiYa1 aLiu, Xiangdong,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4863-37150 tCellulose.g2022 Apr., v. 29, no. 6 p.3569-3581dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-022-04469-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245011900161300001800280520129800298592002801596650000901624650001101633650001101644650001101655650001401666650001301680651001501693700001601708700001501724773010501739856004801844852000901892655001201901IND4483850220221118040501.0120928e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448385022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-012-5277-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, JiaWang10aLate quaternary glacial cycle and precessional period of clay mineral assemblages in the western pacific warm pool  ap. 3748-3760.  aVariability of clay mineral assemblages in the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) over the past 370 ka shows the prominent glacial-interglacial cyclicity. Smectite (62%â91%) is the dominant clay mineral, with decreased contents during interglacials while increased in glacials. In contrast, variations in chlorite (4%â21%), illite (4%â12%), and kaolinite (2%â10%) share a similar pattern with higher contents during interglacials than glacials, mirroring to that of smectite. The results indicate that the smectite-dominated clay minerals derive mainly from the river detrital inputs of New Guinea. The glacial-interglacial cycle of clay mineral assemblages well correspond to the fluctuation of sea level. When the sea level was low, the river materials can travel more easily across the narrow shelf off the island of New Guinea, inject directly into the subsurface currents flowing westwards, then merge into the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC), and eventually deposit on the central part of WPWP. Precessional periods of the smectite content indicate the intensity of mechanical erosion in its provenance of New Guinea, responding to the river runoff and precipitation, and this could also be linked to the meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aillite 3arivers 3arunoff 3asea level 3asmectite 3aNew Guinea1 aLiu, ZhiFei1 aZhou, Chao0 tChinese science bulletin.g2012 Oct., v. 57, no. 28-29 p.3748-3760dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-012-5277-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245013300152300002000285520090000305592002801205650001301233650001401246650001801260650001301278650002201291650001401313650001101327650001701338700001801355700001501373700001701388700001901405773014401424856007401568852000901642655001201651IND60670831220221119090715.0191002e20141014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067083122DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta03366c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Han10aImproving the performance of PEDOT-PSS coated sulfur@activated porous graphene composite cathodes for lithium–sulfur batteries  ap. 18345-18352.  aA novel PEDOT-PSS coated sulfur@activated porous graphene composite (PEDOT/S@aPG) is prepared by the impregnation of sulfur with aPG and encapsulation with PEDOT-PSS as the cathode material for lithium–sulfur batteries. The abundant nanopores and large surface area of aPG can provide an intimate contact and strong interaction with S species. Furthermore, the conductive PEDOT-PSS layer can facilitate the charge transportation and prevent the dissolution of polysulfides. As a result, the as-prepared PEDOT/S@aPG composite cathode with a sulfur content of about 60.1% shows a higher specific discharge capacity (1198 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.1 C) in the first cycle and good cycling stability, retaining a reversible capacity of 845 mA h g⁻¹ after 200 cycles. Moreover, the PEDOT/S@aPG cathode also exhibits excellent rate capability, showing a high reversible capacity of 718 mA h g⁻¹ at 2 C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3achemistry 3aencapsulation 3agraphene 3alithium batteries 3ananopores 3asulfur 3asurface area1 aSun, Minqiang1 aZhang, Tao1 aFang, Yuqian1 aWang, Gengchao0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 Oct. 14, v. 2, no. 43 p.18345-18352dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta03366c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007800166300001400244520174200258592002802000650002002028650002602048650001002074650001802084650001602102650001302118650001802131650001502149650001402164650001702178650002502195650002402220650001302244650000902257650002202266650001002288650001902298650001302317650002502330651001302355653002002368653001002388653002002398653001702418653001302435700001902448773011402467856008102581852000902662655001202671IND60630374220221120141749.0190207e20180406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063037422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMan, Farahdina10aSafety assessment of standardized aqueous Brucea javanica extract in rats  ap. 21-26.  aThe seeds of Brucea javanica and its aqueous decoction is a traditional medicine consumed by diabetic patients in Malaysia. The daily consumption of B. javanica seeds and it's aqueous decoction causes much concern as the quassinoids and its glycosides from the seeds exhibited various pharmacological activity at low doses.The aim of the present study is to evaluate the repeated dose toxicity of the standardized aqueous extract administered daily for 30 days through oral administration at its effective hypoglycemia doses.The seeds were dried, ground and extracted in deionized water. A HPLC-photodiode array method was developed and validated for the standardization of both the hypoglycemia agents, namely bruceine D and E in aqueous extract. Both normoglycemia and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats were fed orally with 15, 30 and 60mg/kg body weight of standardized aqueous extract. The blood glucose was measured at 0–8h. In repeated dose toxicity, similar doses were administered orally to rats for 30 days. At the end of 30 days, the blood was withdrawn and subjected to biochemical and haematology analysis while organs were harvested for histology analysis.Oral administration of standardized aqueous extract exhibited a dose-response relationship in both the normoglycemia and STZ-induced diabetic rats. Daily oral administration of 15, 30 and 60mg/kg standardized aqueous extract for 30 days to rats did not show signs to toxicity in its biochemical, haematology and histology analysis.In conclusion, although the seeds were reported to contain compounds with various pharmacological activity, the daily oral administration to rats for 30 days do not showed signs of toxicity at its effective hypoglycemia doses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucea javanica 3aanimal disease models 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3adiabetes 3adose response 3ahematology 3ahistology 3ahypoglycemia 3amedicinal properties 3aoral administration 3apatients 3arats 3asafety assessment 3aseeds 3astreptozotocin 3atoxicity 3atraditional medicine 3aMalaysia 0aBrucea javanica 0aSeeds 0aAqueous extract 0aHypoglycemia 0aToxicity1 aChoo, Chee-Yan0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 Apr. 06, v. 215 p.21-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010500158300001800263520128600281592002801567650001301595650001101608650002201619650001601641650003001657650003401687650002101721650000901742650001401751650001401765650001101779650001401790650001201804700001301816700001901829700001601848700003001864773014101894856007402035852000902109655001202118IND60670831320221119090655.0191002e20150303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067083132DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta03367a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaracibar, A.10aNew insights into the electrochemical performance of Li₂MnSiO₄: effect of cationic substitutions  ap. 6004-6011.  aThe performance of the Li₂MnSiO₄ cathode material is hindered by voltage decay and capacity fading caused by structural instability. To rationalize the origin of such structural instability, we have investigated a total of 142 Li₂yMnSiO₄ configurations at y = 0.125, 0.25, 0.333, 0.375, 0.417, 0.5, 0.625, 0.666, 0.75 and 0.875 by density functional theory methods. It is found that the most stable Li₂yMnSiO₄ configurations with y ≤ 0.5 consist of Mn⁴⁺ and Mn³⁺ in octahedral or five-fold coordination. This induces a crystal deformation, loss of the orthogonal symmetry, and a notorious volume decrease (7% for LiMnSiO₄ and 14% for Li₀.₅MnSiO₄). The effect of Mn substitution on the crystal structure of the delithiated silicates Li₀.₅Mn₀.₇₅M₀.₂₅SiO₄ is computationally investigated for M = Mg, Fe, Co and Ni. The most stable configurations for Mg, Fe and Co substitutes possess Mn⁴⁺ in octahedral coordination, sharing edges with the adjacent Si and Mn polyhedra. DFT results suggest that among the studied substituents, only Ni could help to maintain the structural integrity of the delithiated samples. Experimentally, Li₂Mn₁₋ₓNiₓSiO₄ samples with x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 were synthesized and electrochemically tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acobalt 3acrystal structure 3adeformation 3adensity functional theory 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anickel 3asilicates 3asilicon1 aWang, Z.1 aCarroll, K.

Restoration through grasslands has great potential primarily due to the contribution of the root system. However, the impacts of grassland restoration remain uncertain, as current understandings of the direction and magnitude of changes in different SOC fractions and the influence of root properties on SOC are still unclear. To address this problem, we conducted a field study to investigate variations in SOC fractions and root properties under different grassland restoration times (1, 5, 10, 15, 25 and 30 years following restoration) in the Loess Plateau, China. Specifically, we measured fractions of soil labile organic carbon including microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and fractions of soil stable organic C including humus carbon (HS), fulvic acid carbon (FA) and humic acid carbon (HA) in the 1 m soil profile. Furthermore, we evaluated root biomass, root C, root lignin and cellulose as potential drivers of SOC patterns. We found that SOC, soil labile organic C and soil stable organic C fractions generally increased with the revegetation time, except for brief decreases at the 5- and 15-year marks. Across the entire period (year 1 to 30), the proportions of HS and FA to SOC increased by 10.64% and 14.72% at 30 years, respectively, while the ratios of MBC and DOC to SOC were relatively stable. The average SOC accumulation rate was 0.72 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in the 1 m soil profile over the 30-year grassland revegetation period. The average rate of change of FA (0.67 Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) was higher than that of the HA, HS and soil labile organic C fractions, which indicated that SOC stability increased and SOC accumulation was mainly derived from the enhancement of FA. Decreases in root biomass and cellulose storage drove reductions in SOC fraction stores with soil depth. The root cellulose exerted significant influences on the SOC and SOC fractions, especially on FA (R² = 0.82, p < 0.01). These findings show that grassland restoration plays an important role in improving and increasing SOC; in particular, the increase of FA results from the augmentations of root cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3acellulose 3adissolved organic carbon 3afulvic acids 3agrassland restoration 3agrasslands 3ahumic acids 3ahumus 3alabile carbon 3alignin 3amicrobial carbon 3aroot systems 3asoil depth 3asoil profiles 3aChina 0aRestoration time 0aRoot biomass 0aRoot carbon fractions 0aSoil organic carbon fractions1 aGuo, Zehui1 aHuiyan,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7084-50121 aAn, Shaoshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1272-02270 tCatena.g2020 Aug., v. 191 p.104575-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1045753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245011000200300001800310500002000328520140500348592002801753596010601781650001701887650002201904650001201926650000901938650001101947650000901958650002101967650001001988650001901998650001302017650001402030650002002044650001202064651001402076700002002090700001802110700001502128700002202143700002102165773012402186856007402310852000902384655001202393IND60787078420221120121241.0220807e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078707842DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.145202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrønkjær, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1337-466110aIntra‐annual variation in feeding of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua: the importance of ephemeral prey bursts  ap. 1507-1519.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeasonal prey bursts are important for the life cycles and energy budgets of many predators. This study documents the diet and, especially, the importance of the ephemeral occurrence of capelin as prey for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Godthaabsfjord, west Greenland, over an annual cycle. The cod showed clear differences in diet composition on the 11 sampling dates resulting in a spring–summer, late summer–autumn and winter cluster. Moreover, a single sampling date, 12 May, was defined by cod gorge feeding on spawning capelin, which led to average stomach contents 4.3 times higher than the average for the remaining sampling dates. Changes in nitrogen stable isotope values from 22 April to 7 July in cod liver and muscle tissue were used to calculate the consumption of capelin. Based on this, the consumption of capelin varied between 538 and 658 g wet weight for a 1.3 kg cod. Using published consumption/biomass estimates and observed growth rates, the capelin intake corresponds to 10.1%–33.3% of the annual food consumption and accounts for 28.1%–34.5% of the annual growth of the cod. The present study documents the omnivorous feeding mode of Atlantic cod but highlights the utilization and importance of ephemeral prey bursts for the annual energy budget of the cod. It is hypothesized that access to capelin is critical for the postspawning recovery of Godthaabsfjord cod.  aPublisher supplied data  cDanish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation as part of the Greenland Climate Research Centre 3aGadus morhua 3aMallotus villosus 3abiomass 3adiet 3aenergy 3afish 3afood consumption 3aliver 3amuscle tissues 3anitrogen 3aomnivores 3astable isotopes 3astomach 3aGreenland1 aOttosen, Rasmus1 aJoensen, Thor1 aReeve, Lee1 aNielsen, Einar E.1 aHedeholm, Rasmus0 tJournal of fish biology.g2020 Nov., v. 97, no. 5 p.1507-1519dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.145203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008800171300002000259520139600279592002801675650001401703650001201717650001501729650001501744650001401759650001701773650001201790650001801802650001001820650001301830650002201843650001201865650002301877650001401900650002201914700005601936700001501992773012202007856008702129852000902216655001202225IND60621075220221122203339.0181115e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062107522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b020352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhuojun10aCombustion Mechanisms and Kinetics of Fuel Additives: A ReaxFF Molecular Simulation  ap. 11852-11863.  aFuel additives are widely used as octane number improvers, oxygenates, emission depressors, and corrosion inhibitors to promote combustion processes of liquid fuel. In this work, six kinds of fuel additives, including ethanol, butanol, dimethyl carbonate, dibutyl carbonate, methyl tert-butyl ether, and tri-tert amyl glycerol ether, were studied by ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulations. The bond dissociation reactions were found to be more dominant at the early stage than oxidation reactions, which means the unimolecular reactions were the main pathways of primary reactions in hydrocarbon combustion. The rate constants of primary reactions of ethanol combustion were much smaller than those of other systems, which were in good agreement with the product distribution analysis and previous work. The main reaction pathway and relative rate constants for all systems were evaluated. Four kinds of main radicals, including ·CH₃, ··CH₂, ·OH, and ·HO₂, were detected, and the number variation with time are presented. The number of ·OH radicals was the largest among those four radicals, and it was found to gradually increase with time except for ether systems; the number of ·CH₃ and ··CH₂ radicals sharply increased first and then gradually decreased. Hopefully, the results obtained in this work will be helpful to future design and screening of new fuel additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3abutanol 3acarbonates 3acombustion 3acorrosion 3adissociation 3aethanol 3afree radicals 3afuels 3aglycerol 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3ascreening 3asimulation models1 aSun, Weizhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9957-36201 aZhao, Ling0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Oct. 02, v. 32, no. 11 p.11852-11863dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b020353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001300142245012800155300001800283520050400301592002800805650001400833650001300847650002200860650001300882650001300895700001200908700001500920700001800935773013100953856007801084852000901162655001201171IND60548778920221118132328.0160905e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054877892DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b109452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qian10aAerobic Copper-Promoted Radical-Type Cleavage of Coordinated Cyanide Anion: Nitrogen Transfer to Aldehydes To Form Nitriles  ap. 2885-2888.  aWe have disclosed for the first time the copper-promoted CN triple bond cleavage of coordinated cyanide anion under a dioxygen atmosphere, which enables a nitrogen transfer to various aldehydes.

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is a type of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) that has been widely applied in the healthcare system in Taiwan.The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of use and patterns of prescription for the CHM-based treatment of HIV-infected patients and to assess the long-term effects of CHM on hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease events in these patients.We identified 21,846 HIV-infected patients (ICD-9-CM: 042-044, 079, and V08 codes). Of these, 1083 and 2166 patients who used CHM and were non-users, respectively, were matched for age, gender, and ART use before CHM. The chi-squared test, Cox proportional hazard model, Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test were used for comparisons between these two groups.CHM users had a lower risk of hyperlipidemia compared with non-users after adjusting for comorbidities by using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model (P = 0.0011; HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.52–0.85). In addition, the CHM users had a lower risk of cardiovascular disease compared with non-users after adjusting for comorbidities (P = 0.0004; HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.53–0.83). The 10-year cumulative incidences of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease were lower in the CHM group (P < 0.0001 for both, log rank test). Among the 12 most commonly used CHMs in these patients, Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San (JWXYS) (46.1%), Ge-Gen-Tang (GGT) (40.6%), and Yin-Qiao-San (YQS) (38.0%) were the most common herbal formulas used. Huang-Qin (HQin) (44.6%), Yan-Hu-Suo (YHS) (40.5%), and Jie-Geng (JG) (39.5%) were the most commonly used single herbs. A CHM network analysis showed that JG was the core CHM in one cluster, and BM, MXSGT, and HQin were important CHMs in that cluster. In the other cluster, YHS was the core CHM, and SYGCT and JWXYS were important CHMs.CHM as adjunctive therapy may reduce hyperlipidemia and the risk for cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients. The list of the comprehensive herbal medicines that the patients used might be useful in further scientific investigations or therapeutic interventions for preventing atherosclerosis among HIV-infected patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aalternative medicine 3aantiretroviral agents 3aatherosclerosis 3achronic diseases 3acomorbidity 3agender 3ahealth services 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3ahyperlipidemia 3along term effects 3amodels 3apatients 3arisk 3atraditional medicine 3aTaiwan 0aHIV 0aAIDS 0aART 0aCHM 0aCAM 0aICD-9-CM 0aNHIRD 0aTCM 0aHR 0aJWXYS 0aGGT 0aYQS 0aHQin 0aYHS 0aJG 0aBM 0aMXSGT 0aHIV 0aChinese herbal medicine 0aHyperlipidemia 0aCardiovascular disease1 aLi, Demao,1 aCheng, Chi-Fung1 aWu, Yang-Chang1 aLai, Chih-Ho1 aHo, Tsung-Jung1 aLiu, Xiang1 aTsang, Hsinyi1 aLin, Ting-Hsu1 aLiao, Chiu-Chu1 aHuang, Shao-Mei1 aLi, Ju-Pi1 aLin, Jung-Chun1 aLin, Zhijian,1 aLiang, Wen-Miin1 aLin, Ying-Ju0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 June 12, v. 219 p.71-80dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245018000204300001800384500002000402520152600422592002801948650001601976650001501992650002002007650002602027650001702053650001502070650001902085650001602104650001002120650001902130650001802149650001402167650001302181650001402194650001302208650001402221650001302235651001002248700007202258773012302330856007402453852000902527655001202536IND60756363820221120024054.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075636382DNAL7 a10.1111/are.155432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamouda, Awatef Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1168-295110aCharacterization of Clinostomum cutaneum and Clinostomum phalacrocoracis in tilapia species of Aswan Governorate, Egypt: A morphological, molecular and histopathological study  ap. 6726-6740.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClinostomum species are digeneans, and their metacercariae infect both cultured and wild fish worldwide, causing significant economic losses and possibly possessing zoonotic potential; identification of these parasites has proven challenging due to the high degree of similarity and minor differences between different species. To identify them, we used a combination of morphological and molecular methods. Only tilapia species were positive for clinostomatids among 1200 examined fish samples from Aswan Governorate, Egypt (Oreochromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapia zillii, Lates niloticus, Synodontis schall, Synodontis serratus and Hydrocynus forskalii). Clinostomum cutaneum and Clinostomum phalacrocoracis were isolated from cultured O. niloticus with a prevalence of 25% and 11.5%, respectively, and from wild O. niloticus, S. galilaeus and T. zillii with a prevalence of 12.5% and 27.5%, 23% and 33%, and 7.5% and 16.5% respectively. The nuclear ribosomal gene marker (28S rRNA) was amplified using PCR and sequenced, followed by phylogenetic analysis, which revealed that the two species under investigation were very closely related to C. cutaneum and C. phalacrocoracis. The histopathological changes associated with clinostomatid infections are necrosis, tissue damage and immune cell infiltration at the site of infection. C. cutaneum metacercaria was characterized for the first time in Egyptian fish. It was pathogenic to tilapia and caused significant mortality in cultured conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClinostomum 3aHydrocynus 3aLates niloticus 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aSarotherodon 3aSynodontis 3aTilapia zillii 3aaquaculture 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3ametacercariae 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3awild fish 3azoonoses 3aEgypt1 aYounis, Abuelhassan Elshazly1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7476-93200 tAquaculture research.g2021 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.6726-6740dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.155433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245008100176300001500257520194600272592002802218650001202246650001302258650001502271650001502286650002102301650001002322650001102332650001402343650002102357650002502378650000902403650001002412650003502422650002602457651000902483653001102492653001002503653001302513653001302526653001002539653000802549700002302557700001702580700002302597700001902620700002702639700002602666700002202692700002202714700002302736700002202759700002802781773010002809856008802909961000902997852000903006655001203015IND60607257720221120085019.0180730e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060725772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeakins, Sarah J.10aProduction of leaf wax n-alkanes across a tropical forest elevation transect  ap. 89-100.  aWaxy compounds form the boundary layer of the living leaf and contribute biomarkers to soils, and lake and marine sediments. Cataloging the variation in leaf wax traits between species and across environmental gradients may contribute to the understanding of plant functional processes in modern ecosystems, as well as to calibration efforts supporting reconstruction of past ecosystems and environments from the sedimentary archives of leaf wax biomarkers. Towards these goals, we have surveyed the distributions of leaf wax n-alkanes in trees from the lowland tropical rainforest (TR) and montane cloud forest (TMCF) of Perú. Molecular abundances were quantified via gas chromatography flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for 632 individuals, 152 species, 99 genera and 51 families across 9 forest plots spanning 0.2–3.6km elevation. We found the expected abundance distributions; for example, they were dominated by long chain, odd numbered n-alkanes, especially C29 and C31. New observations included a tendency to increasing total alkane concentration at higher elevation. We propose that the well known leaf economic strategy to increase leaf mass per unit area with elevation, provides a theoretical basis for understanding the increase in leaf wax n-alkane abundance with elevation: we infer an increased investment in foliar defense associated with increased leaf lifespan and in response to environmental pressures including cloud immersion and declining temperature. Furthermore, we combined measurements of n-alkane concentration with estimates of forest productivity to provide new ways to quantify ecosystem-scale forest alkane productivity. We introduce a new concept of n-alkane net primary productivity (NPPalk; the product of alkane concentration and leaf NPP) and find that alkane productivity estimates range from 300 to 5000g C/ha/yr, associated with ecological and environmental changes across the elevation profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aaltitude 3abiomarkers 3aecosystems 3aflame ionization 3alakes 3aleaves 3alongevity 3amarine sediments 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3atrees 3atropical montane cloud forests 3atropical rain forests 3aPeru 0aAmazon 0aAndes 0aCHAMBASA 0aLeaf wax 0aPerú 0aNPP1 aPeters, Thomas R.,1 aWu, Mong Sin1 aShenkin, Alexander1 aSalinas, Norma1 aGirardin, Cécile A.J.1 aBentley, Lisa Patrick1 aBlonder, Benjamin1 aEnquist, Brian J.1 aMartin, Roberta E.1 aAsner, Gregory P.1 aMalhi, Y.q(Yadvinder),0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2016 Oct., v. 100 p.89-100dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2016.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03932naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245024600153300001800399500002000417520163700437592002802074596005402102596009702156596009302253596005802346650002502404650002802429650002802457650001302485650001602498650003202514650001302546650001702559650000902576650002002585650002002605650002002625650002702645650002302672650001402695650001902709650002102728650001302749650001502762650001502777650001302792650001102805650002502816650001202841650002502853650001802878650001602896700001602912700005602928700001902984700001603003700001603019700001703035773012303052856007403175852000903249655001203258IND60756363920221120050119.0211113e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075636392DNAL7 a10.1111/are.155442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu10aEffect of dietary complex Chinese herbal medicine on growth performance, digestive enzyme activities in tissues and expression of genes involved in the digestive enzymes and antioxidant enzymes and bacterial challenge in Litopenaeus vannamei  ap. 6741-6750.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of complex Chinese herbal medicines (CCHM) on growth performance, digestive enzyme activity, immunity and metabolism and Vibrio parahemolyticus resistance of Litopenaeus vannamei. The 30‐day feeding experimental results indicated that dietary CCHM obviously increased the survival rate (SR), weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) of shrimp. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was obviously reduced by the CHMM. The supplementation of CCHM could significantly (p < 0.05) increase the activity of protease in the stomach, hepatopancreas and intestine of shrimp. The activities of amylase and lipase were enhanced significantly (p < 0.05) in the stomach, hepatopancreas and intestine of shrimp fed 10 g/kg CCHM diet. The number of haemocytes was increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the shrimp fed the diet with 10 and 15 g/kg CHMM. The activities of total superoxide dismutase (T‐SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px) and catalase (CAT) in the hepatopancreas of shrimp fed with 10 g/kg CCHM were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of the control group. The gene expression levels of SOD, CAT, ATPase, TLR, chymotrypsin and GS in the hepatopancreas and intestine of prawns fed with 10 g/kg CCHM were significantly (p < 0.05) up‐regulated. In challenge experiment, the relative protection rate was significantly (p < 0.05) increased in the shrimp fed CCHM‐supplemental diet when challenged with V. parahaemolyticus. Comprehensive consideration of the current experimental results, the additive suitable dosage of the CCHM was 10 g/kg.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020YFD0900400cNational Key R&D Program of China  a202010057182cInnovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for Undergraduates in Tianjin  aITTMRS2021009cInnovation Team for Tianjin Modern Agricultural Industry Technical System  a20YFZCSN00140cTianjin Science and Technology Project 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aamylases 3aaquaculture 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalase 3achymotrypsin 3adiet 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3agene expression 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3ahemocytes 3ahepatopancreas 3aherbal medicines 3aimmunity 3aintestines 3ametabolism 3aresearch 3ashrimp 3aspecific growth rate 3astomach 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3aweight gain1 aBian, Yunyi1 aCui, Qingman1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3440-042X1 aYuan, Chunying1 aLin, Yiting1 aLi, Jiayuan1 aMeng, Peirou0 tAquaculture research.g2021 Dec., v. 52, no. 12 p.6741-6750dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.155443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013200172300001200304520115400316592002801470650001001498650001301508650001701521650001301538650000901551650000901560650001201569650001101581650002701592650002001619650003701639653002601676653001501702653001801717653001801735653001901753700002101772700002301793700001901816773009001835856008401925852000902009655001202018IND60637268820221120113006.0190417e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063726882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foostr.2018.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwasaki, Tomohito10aEffect of actomyosin form extracted from skeletal fast muscle on the structural and rheological properties of heat-induced gels  ap. 1-8.  aLittle is known about the mechanism of heat-induced gelation of natural actomyosin, or the influence of pyrophosphate on the morphology and physical properties of the product. In the current study, these questions were investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. When using high salt concentrations (0.5 M NaCl), actomyosin lost its “arrowhead” structure after heating for two minutes, and aggregation, including interfilament binding, occurred after six minutes of heating at 60° C. The product in this case exhibited a strand-like gel structure. On the other hand, in the presence of 0.1 M NaCl, cohesion between filaments began after two minutes of heating, and an aggregate-type gel structure was formed. When pyrophosphate was added in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, marked dissociation of actomyosin into myosin and actin occurred. In the presence of 0.1 M NaCl, the filament structure of the actomyosin bundles became difficult to detect. The addition of pyrophosphate did not improve the physical properties of the resultant heat-induced actomyosin gel, since the elasticity of the actomyosin gel decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acohesion 3adissociation 3agelation 3agels 3aheat 3amuscles 3amyosin 3arheological properties 3asodium chloride 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aChicken breast muscle 0aActomyosin 0aPyrophosphate 0aGel structure 0aGel properties1 aMasuda, Yasuyuki1 aHasegawa, Yasuhiro1 aMaeda, Naoyuki0 tFood structure.g2018 Jan., v. 15 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:23298x2213-32917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foostr.2018.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024001900131040001800150100002200168245009200190300001600282520067100298592002800969650002200997650001001019650001301029650001001042650001301052650001401065650001401079651001001093653002301103653001301126653001001139653002201149700002201171773013701193856008301330852000901413655001201422IND60595061220221121233213.0180526e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059506122DNAL7 a10.1676/1559-4491-129.1.2122doi4 awils-129-01-29  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Lauren E.10aSimultaneous polygyny by a male Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) in central Texas  ap. 212-215.  aAlthough polygyny is common and regular among a small proportion of North American songbirds, some socially monogamous passerines may also exhibit occasional polygyny.

We present evidence of a partial collapse of a Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus) nest during the nestling period and the subsequent adult response. A nest camera captured the nest collapse and showed one adult Gyrfalcon holding a live nestling in its beak before leaving the nest. Later, we found the surviving nestling alive in an alternate nest 5 m from the original nest, presumably transported there by the adult. We believe this is the first report of an adult Gyrfalcon moving a nestling to a new location following nest disturbance. We place this observation into a context of Gyrfalcon nesting behavior described in published sources. The continued use of nest cameras may provide additional documentation and insight into this behavior and its prevalence in birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFalco rusticolus 3aadults 3abirds 3acameras 3anesting 3anestlings 0aAlaska 0abehavioral response 0aFalco rusticolus 0aGyrfalcon 0anest camera 0anest collapse 0anestling relocation1 aPaprocki, Neil1 aAnderson, David L.1 aBechard, Marc J.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2017 Mar., v. 129, no. 1 p.216-221dThe Wilson Ornithological SocietywJournal:6298x1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676/1559-4491-129.1.2163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010100168300001600269520095800285592002801243650002101271650001501292650001501307650001401322650001101336650002301347650001401370650001501384650002001399653002201419653002201441653001501463653002001478653002801498700001901526700001601545700002101561773012501582856008201707852000901789655001201798IND60609396320221119120755.0180823e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060939632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahamon, Daniel10aComputational study of ibuprofen removal from water by adsorption in realistic activated carbons  ap. 323-334.  aMolecular simulations using the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method have been performed in order to obtain physical insights on how the interaction between ibuprofen (IBP) and activated carbons (ACs) in aqueous mixtures affects IBP removal from water by ACs.

Individual effects of factors such as porous features and chemical heterogeneities in the adsorbents are investigated and quantified. Results are in good agreement with experimental adsorption data, highlightening the ability of GCMC simulation to describe the macroscopic adsorption performance in drug removal applications, while also providing additional insights into the IBP/water adsorption mechanism.

Two major compounds related to their beneficial activities in animals and humans are arbutin and hydroquinone.To establish potential benefit/risk ratio associated with daily oral administration of strawberry tree water leaf extract, arbutin and hydroquinone in doses expected to be non-toxic.We performed a 14-day and a 28-day study on male and female Lewis rats and evaluated main haematological parameters and the effects of treatments on the levels of primary DNA damage in white blood cells (WBC) using the alkaline comet assay.Our findings suggest no significant changes in the haematological parameters following prolonged exposure to strawberry tree water leaf extract, arbutin, and hydroquinone. However, hydroquinone causes increased, and extract as well as arbutin decreased WBC count in male rats compared to control after 14 days of treatment. DNA damage measured in WBC of rats treated with all compounds was below 10% of the DNA in the comet tail, which indicates low genotoxicity. The genotoxic potential of strawberry water leaf extract was within acceptable limits and reflected effects of a complex chemical composition upon DNA. We also observed slight gender- and exposure time- related differences in primary DNA damage in the leucocytes of control and treated rats.Future studies should investigate which doses of strawberry tree water leaf extract would be most promising for the potential use as a substitute for bearberry leaves for treatment of urinary infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArbutus unedo 3aArctostaphylos uva-ursi 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3abioactive compounds 3afemales 3agenotoxicity 3ahydroquinone 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3aleukocyte count 3aleukocytes 3amales 3amutagens 3aoral administration 3aquinones 3arats 3arelative risk 3astrawberries 3atraditional medicine 0aEMA 0aIARC 0a% DNA 0aST 0aSTE 0aTL 0aTM 0aOECD 0aUS EPA 0aStrawberry tree 0aArbutin 0aHydroquinone 0aGenotoxicity 0aWhite blood cells 0aComet assay1 aBrčić Karačonji, Irena1 aKopjar, Nevenka1 aShek-Vugrovečki, Ana1 aCikač, Tihana1 aBenković, Vesna0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 Apr. 06, v. 215 p.83-90dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.12.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245010700213300001800320520133700338592002801675650002301703650001801726650002101744650001601765650001401781650002001795650001301815650002701828650002101855650002201876650001601898700002201914700002001936773011101956856008302067852000902150655001202159IND60772935020221120122329.0220726e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077293502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-022-04479-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukhawipat, Nathapong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3012-274910aCaesalpinia sappan L. wood fiber: bio-reinforcement for polybutylene succinate-based biocomposite film  ap. 3375-3387.  aCaesalpinia sappan L. wood fiber (CSWF), a novel advanced bio-reinforcement for polybutylene succinate (PBS) composite films, has shown significant promise ranging from 0 to 15 part per hundred of resin (phr). The functional groups and interactions, morphology, thermal stability, mechanical characteristics, and biodegradability were all investigated. Without treatment or any compatibilizers, CSWF could be well-dispersed in the PBS matrix. The PBS/CSWF10 composite film had highest mechanical strength, with a tensile strength of 12.21 N/mm² and a break elongation of 21.01%. Biodegradability studies indicated that the PBS/CSWF10 composite films degraded completely in three months. Furthermore, the Eₐ of degradation resulting from TGA and the shift of wavenumber resulting from FTIR revealed that the addition of CSWF has a greater interaction between additive and martix than conventional cellulose. The PBS/CSWF10 composite has the potential to be environmentally friendly, with promising short-term degradation and rising mechanical characteristics. Therefore, it is the optimum concentration of a certain biocomposite film. As a result, a novel advanced natural-based cellulose for biopolymer composites film was discovered, as well as other benefits for bio-reinforcement of the green plastic composite film industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaesalpinia sappan 3abiocomposites 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3acellulose 3acomposite films 3aindustry 3apolybutylene succinate 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3awood fibers1 aSaengdee, Laksana1 aPasetto, Pamela0 tCellulose.g2022 Apr., v. 29, no. 6 p.3375-3387dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-022-04479-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03432naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014500175300001600320500001900336520234900355592002802704650001202732650002802744650001602772650001302788650001602801650002202817651001602839700002102855700002602876700001802902773010502920856004803025852000903073655001203082IND50060090320221118040506.0210726e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006009032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-012-9479-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansen, Sergej H.

Conservation of these specialist species in agricultural landscapes relies on knowledge of their essential resources and the spatial distribution of these resources. In The Netherlands, the dusky large blue Phengaris (Maculinea) nausithous butterflies were extinct until their reintroduction in 1990. In addition, a spontaneous recolonization of road verges in an agricultural landscape occurred in 2001 in the southern part of The Netherlands. We analyzed the use of the essential resources, both host plants and host ants, of the latter population during the summers of 2003 and 2005. First we tested whether the distribution of the butterflies during several years could be explained by both the presence of host plants as well as host ants, as we expected that the resource that limits the distribution of this species can differ between locations and over time. We found that oviposition site selection was related to the most abundant resource. While in 2003, site selection was best explained by the presence of the host ant Myrmica scabrinodis, in 2005 it was more strongly related to flowerhead availability of the host plant. We secondly compared the net displacement of individuals between the road verge population and the reintroduced population in the Moerputten meadows, since we expected that movement of individuals depends on the structure of their habitat. On the road verges, butterflies moved significantly shorter distances than on meadows, which limits the butterflies in finding their essential resources. Finally we analyzed the availability of the two essential resources in the surroundings of the road verge population. Given the short net displacement distances and the adverse landscape features for long-distance dispersal, this landscape analysis suggests that the Phengaris population at the Posterholt site is trapped on the recently recolonized road verges. These results highlight the importance of assessing the availability of essential resources across different years and locations relative to the movement of the butterflies, and the necessity to careful manage these resources for the conservation of specialist species in agricultural landscapes, such as this butterfly species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyrmica 3aagricultural landscapes 3abutterflies 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3aoviposition sites 3aNetherlands1 aHolmgren, Milena1 avan Langevelde, Frank1 aWynhoff, Irma0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2012 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.921-930dSpringer-Verlagx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-012-9479-y  aDNAL 7aarticle04603naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245016400177300001600341520247800357592002802835650003402863650002302897650001602920650002602936650002002962650001802982650002203000650002503022650001703047650002503064650002303089650002003112650002203132650001203154650001603166650001303182650001403195650001103209650001803220650001903238650003203257650002103289650001103310650004303321650002103364650002503385650002703410653002103437653003103458653002203489653003603511700003203547700003703579700003003616700003303646700002803679700002803707773011603735856008103851852000903932655001203941IND60630375120221120142016.0190207e20180406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063037512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.12.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, Rodrigo Rodrigues10aAntioxidant and anti-glycation capacities of some medicinal plants and their potential inhibitory against digestive enzymes related to type 2 diabetes mellitus  ap. 140-146.  aPlants preparations are used by traditional medicine in the treatment of various diseases, such as type-2 diabetes mellitus. Some medicinal plants are capable of controlling the complications of this metabolic disease at different levels, for example, providing antioxidant compounds that act against oxidative stress and protein glycation and others which are capable of inhibiting the catalysis of digestive enzymes and thus contribute to the reduction of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Our objective was to investigate the antioxidant and anti-glycation activities of some medicinal plants and their potential inhibitory against α-amylase, α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase activities.Based on the ethnobotanical researches carried out by academic studies conducted at the Federal University of Uberlandia, ten plants traditionally used in the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus were selected. Ethanol (EtOH) and hexane (Hex) extracts of specific parts of these plants were used in enzymatic assays to evaluate their inhibitory potential against α-amylase, α-glucosidase and lipase, as well as their antioxidant (DPPH, ORAC and FRAP) and anti-glycation (BSA/fructose model) capacities.The results indicate that EtOH extract of four of the ten analyzed plants exhibited more than 70% of antioxidant and anti-glycation capacities, and α-amylase and lipase inhibitory activities; no extract was able to inhibit more than 40% the α-glucosidase activity. The EtOH extracts of Bauhinia forficata and Syzygium. cumini inhibited α-amylase (IC50 8.17 ± 2.24 and 401.8 ± 14.7 μg/mL, respectively), whereas EtOH extracts of B. forficata, Chamomilla recutita and Echinodorus grandiflorus inhibited lipase (IC50 59.6 ± 10.8, 264.2 ± 87.2 and 115.8 ± 57.1 μg/mL, respectively). In addition, EtOH extracts of B. forficata, S. cumini, C. recutita and E. grandiflorus showed, respectively, higher antioxidant capacity (DPPH IC50 0.7 ± 0.1, 2.5 ± 0.2, 1.3 ± 0.2 and 35.3 ± 9.0 μg/mL) and anti-glycation activity (IC50 22.7 ± 4.4, 246.2 ± 81.7, 18.5 ± 2.8 and 339.0 ± 91.0 μg/mL).EtOH extracts of four of the ten species popularly cited for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus have shown promising antioxidant and anti-glycation properties, as well as the ability to inhibit the digestive enzymes α-amylase and lipase. Thus, our results open new possibilities for further studies in order to evaluate the antidiabetic potential of these medicinal plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBauhinia forficata 3aEchinodorus 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3aSyzygium cumini 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abovine serum albumin 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aethanol 3aethnobotany 3afructose 3aglycation 3ahexane 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amedicinal plants 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3atraditional medicine 3atriacylglycerol lipase 0aOxidative stress 0aPostprandial hyperglycemia 0aPancreatic lipase 0aAdvanced glycation end products1 ada Silva Carvalho, Danúbia1 ade Moura, Francyelle Borges Rosa1 aJustino, Allisson Benatti1 aSilva, Heitor Cappato Guerra1 aPeixoto, Leonardo Gomes1 aEspindola, Foued Salmen0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 Apr. 06, v. 215 p.140-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.12.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024001900130040001800149100002200167245015600189300001400345520163300359592002801992650001302020650001102033650001102044650001302055650001602068650000902084650002102093650001202114650000902126650001702135650001002152650001402162650001002176650001402186650001602200650001702216651001102233651001302244653002502257653001502282653001602297653001302313700001402326700002202340773013502362856008202497852000902579655001202588IND60595061520221122231441.0180526e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059506152DNAL7 a10.1676/1559-4491-129.1.362doi4 awils-129-01-05  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Adam E.10aBreeding biology of an endemic Bornean turdid, the Fruithunter (Chlamydochaera jefferyi), and life history comparisons with Turdus species of the world  ap. 36-45.  aWe present the first description of the breeding biology for the Fruithunter (Chlamydochaera jefferyi), a member of the cosmopolitan family Turdidae, and a montane endemic to the tropical Asian island of Borneo. We also compile breeding biology traits from the literature to make comparisons between the Fruithunter and the thrush genus Turdus. Our comparisons indicate that Fruithunters exhibit a slower life history strategy than both tropical and north temperate Turdus. We located and monitored 42 nests in 7 years in Kinabalu Park, Sabah, Malaysia. The mean clutch size was 1.89 ± 0.08 eggs, and the modal clutch size was 2 eggs. Mean fresh egg mass was 6.15 ± 0.13 g, representing 9.5% of adult female body mass. Average lengths of incubation and nestling periods were 14.56 ± 0.24 and 17.83 ± 0.31 days respectively. Only the female incubated and brooded the eggs and nestlings, but both the male and female fed nestlings. Female attentiveness during incubation was high throughout, reaching an asymptote around 85% with average on-bouts of 39.0 ± 2.5 mins. The daily nest survival probability was 0.951 ± 0.025, and the daily predation rate was 0.045 ± 0.024. Female feeding rate increased as brooding effort decreased, suggesting that female feeding rate may be constrained by the need to provide heat while nestlings are unable to thermoregulate. This contrasts with the feeding behavior of males, which showed much less of an increase across the nestling period. Furthermore, we describe a new vocalization which expands the vocal repertoire for Fruithunters, and we provide a brief audio clip and spectrogram.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurdidae 3aTurdus 3aadults 3abreeding 3aclutch size 3aeggs 3afeeding behavior 3afemales 3aheat 3alife history 3amales 3anestlings 3anests 3apredation 3aprobability 3avocalization 3aBorneo 3aMalaysia 0aavian life histories 0abird nests 0aFruithunter 0aTurdidae1 aTuh, Fred1 aMartin, Thomas E.0 tWilson journal of ornithology.g2017 Mar., v. 129, no. 1 p.36-45dThe Wilson Ornithological SocietywJournal:6298x1559-44917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1676/1559-4491-129.1.363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03455naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245015700170300001400327520126300341592002801604650002701632650001601659650001401675650002101689650001601710650001001726650001801736653000801754653000801762653000801770653000901778653000701787653001001794653000801804653001001812653000801822653001001830653000901840653000701849653000901856653000801865653000701873653000901880653001001889653000901899653000901908653000801917653000801925653000901933653000701942653000801949653000801957653000801965653000801973653001001981653001701991653002202008653001202030653000902042700002402051700002202075700002102097700001702118700002102135700001802156700002002174700001902194700001902213700001902232700002202251700001802273700002402291700002702315700002202342700002102364773010002385856008302485852000902568655001202577IND60637269220221121052946.0190417e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063726922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phanu.2017.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartini, Daniela10aClaimed effects, outcome variables and methods of measurement for health claims proposed under Regulation (EC) 1924/2006 in the framework of bone health  ap. 17-36.  aSeveral foods or food components have been the object of application for authorization of health claims on bone health, pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1924/2006. For most of them, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has issued negative opinions mainly for reasons pertaining to an insufficient substantiation of the claim, incluiding the choice of not appropriate outcome variables (OVs) and methods of measurement (MMs). The present manuscript refers to the collection, collation and critical analysis of OVs and MMs related to bone health compliant with the Regulation. The definition of the keywords, the PubMed search strategies and the creation of databases of references were performed to critically analyse the OVs and their MMs on the basis of the literature review. The assessment of each OV and related MM was defined according to its appropriatness in relation to the claimed effects proposed. The results obtained are relevant for the choice of the best OVs and MMs, to be used not only for the substantiation of health claims on bone health, but also in general research performed with different purposes. Moreover, the results can be used by EFSA during the update of guidance for the scientific requirements of health claims on bone health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abone health 3adatabases 3afood composition 3afood safety 3afoods 3ahealth claims 0aALP 0aBMC 0aBMD 0aCPII 0aCT 0aCTXII 0aDXA 0aECLIA 0aECM 0aELISA 0aFRAX 0aGH 0aHPLC 0aMRI 0aOA 0aPICP 0aPIINP 0aPINP 0apQCT 0aPTH 0aQCT 0aRCTs 0aRR 0aSPA 0aVAS 0aVFA 0aWHO 0aWOMAC 0aHealth claim 0aOutcome variables 0aMethods 0aBone1 aGuareschi, Cristina1 aBiasini, Beatrice1 aBedogni, Giorgio1 aGalli, Carlo1 aAngelino, Donato1 aMarchi, Laura1 aZavaroni, Ivana1 aPruneti, Carlo1 aVentura, Marco1 aGalli, Daniela1 aMirandola, Prisco1 aVitale, Marco1 aDei Cas, Alessandra1 aBonadonna, Riccardo C.1 aPasseri, Giovanni1 aDel Rio, Daniele0 tPharmaNutrition.g2018 Mar., v. 6, no. 1 p.17-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21616x2213-43447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phanu.2017.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245013800206300001100344520149400355592002801849650001201877650001901889650002001908650001901928650001501947650001901962650001201981650001201993650001102005651002302016700002702039773011302066856008302179852000902262655001202271IND60772935220221120122218.0220618e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077293522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-022-03333-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmadu, Iddrisu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4839-119710aClimate Action (Goal 13): The role of climate beliefs, health security and tourism prioritisation in 30 Sub-Saharan African countries  ap. 25.  aEmpirical studies on the reasons for public support for climate action remain limited in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) despite the escalating climate crises and the urgent need to combat it. The current study addressed this evidentiary deficit by examining the influence of climate beliefs, national health security and tourism prioritisation on residents’ support for climate action. We used a dataset from a social survey among 20,258 climate-aware individuals in 30 SSA countries for the analyses. The findings confirm our hypotheses that believers of anthropogenic climate change are more supportive of climate action and increasing national health security decreases residents’ support for climate action. Counterintuitively, a nation’s prioritisation of travel and tourism undermined residents’ support for climate action. While no gendered differences existed in these relationships, sub-regional variations were observed. Our study is one of the most extensive and novel investigations on public support for climate action among underrepresented populations, allowing for cross-regional and gendered comparisons. For desired support, there is the need for clear and persuasive communication on the link between human behaviour and climate change to deal with the controversies and misconceptions on the cause of climate change. Highlighting the co-benefits of a good climate for tourism, health and wellbeing of residents in SSA could also illuminate urgency for climate action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ahuman behavior 3apersuasion 3aprioritization 3asurveys 3atourism 3atravel 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aAdongo, Charles Atanga0 tClimatic change.g2022 Apr., v. 171, no. 3-4 p.25-25dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl8952x0165-00097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-022-03333-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01543naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245010200197300001800299506007600317520030300393592002800696506003700724650002300761650002300784650001000807650000700817650001500824700002700839700001600866700002000882700001900902700001900921773013400940856007401074852000901148655001201157IND60638729820221207131903.0190430e20160419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063872982DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc00898d2doi7 aPMC48937922pmcid7 a270429972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuminek, G.10aHow cocrystals of weakly basic drugs and acidic coformers might modulate solubility and stability  ap. 5832-5835.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCocrystals of a weakly basic drug (nevirapine) with acidic coformers are shown to alter the solubility dependence on pH, and to exhibit a pHₘₐₓ above which a less soluble cocrystal becomes more soluble than the drug.

In September 2017, after Hurricane Maria impacted the Dolphin Discovery facility in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis, a juvenile male bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) died within 96 hr of presenting with acute anorexia, lethargy, and respiratory distress. Histopathology demonstrated necrohemorrhagic bronchopneumonia, necrotizing hepatitis, splenitis, and lymphadenitis, with intralesional Gram-negative bacilli. B. pseudomallei was confirmed by bacteriological culture and DNA sequencing. This case emphasizes the challenges of melioidosis diagnosis, the importance of awareness for both early detection and efficacious treatment, and recognition in tropical regions where it has been either not reported or underreported. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of cetacean melioidosis in the Caribbean Islands, an often severe and fatal disease with increasing prevalence on the American continent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia pseudomallei 3aDNA 3aTursiops truncatus 3aanorexia 3abronchopneumonia 3adistress 3ahepatitis 3ahistopathology 3ahurricanes 3ajuveniles 3alymphadenitis 3amales 3amedicine 3amelioidosis 3awildlife 3azoos 3aAustralia 3aCaribbean 3aSaint Kitts and Nevis 3aSouth East Asia 0aBottlenose dolphin 0acetacean 0amarine mammal1 aSanchez-Okrucky, Roberto1 aBustamante, Lilian1 aVences, Maria1 aDennis, Michelle M.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2020 June 12, v. 51, no. 2 p.443-447dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2019-00503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03886naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010000170300001600270520188200286592002802168650001902196650001502215650001602230650001902246650001402265650001902279650001702298650001602315650001402331650001602345650001202361650003102373650001002404650002102414650001902435650001102454650001902465650001802484650001602502650002002518650001802538650002002556650001302576650000902589650002502598650001702623650001002640653003402650653001902684653001902703653002002722653001802742653001602760700002402776700002202800700002202822700002502844700002702869700001702896700002902913700002802942773011602970856008103086852000903167655001203176IND60630375320221120142203.0190207e20180406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063037532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutjarit, Nareerat10aCurcuma comosa reduces visceral adipose tissue and improves dyslipidemia in ovariectomized rats  ap. 167-175.  aCurcuma comosa Roxb. (C. comosa) or Wan chak motluk Zingiberaceae family, is widely used in Thai traditional medicine for treatment of gynecological problems as well as relief of postmenopausal symptoms. Since C. comosa contains phytoestrogen and causes lipid lowering effect by an unknown mechanism, we investigated its effect on adiposity and lipid metabolism in estrogen-deprived rats.Adult female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and received daily doses of either a phytoestrogen from C. comosa [(3R)–1,7-diphenyl-(4E,6E)–4,6-heptadien-3-ol; DPHD], C. comosa extract, or estrogen (17β-estradiol; E2) for 12 weeks. Adipose tissue mass, serum levels of lipids and adipokines were determined. In addition, genes and proteins involved in lipid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation in visceral adipose tissue were analyzed.Ovariectomy for 12 weeks elevated level of serum lipids and increased visceral fat mass and adipocyte size. These alterations were accompanied with the up-regulation of lipogenic mRNA and protein expressions including LXR-α, SREBP1c and their downstream targets. OVX rats showed decrease in proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation including AMPK-α and PPAR-α in adipose tissue, as well as alteration of adipokines; leptin and adiponectin. Treatments with E2, DPHD or C. comosa extract in OVX rats prevented an increase in adiposity, down-regulated lipogenic genes and proteins with marked increases in the protein levels of AMPK-α and PPAR-α. These findings indicated that their lipid lowering effects were mediated via the suppression of lipid synthesis in concert with an increase in fatty acid oxidation.C. comosa exerts a lipid lowering effect in the estrogen deficient rats through the modulations of lipid synthesis and AMPK-α activity in adipose tissues, supporting the use of this plant for health promotion in the post-menopausal women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma comosa 3aadipocytes 3aadiponectin 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3abeta oxidation 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3aestradiol 3afatty acids 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahealth promotion 3ahyperlipidemia 3aleptin 3alipemic effect 3amessenger RNA 3aovariectomy 3aplant estrogens 3apostmenopause 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3arats 3atraditional medicine 3avisceral fat 3awomen 0aEstradiol (PubChem CID: 5757) 0aAnti-adiposity 0aCurcuma comosa 0aDiarylheptanoid 0aPhytoestrogen 0aOvariectomy1 aSueajai, Jetjamnong1 aBoonmuen, Nittaya1 aSornkaew, Nilubon1 aSuksamrarn, Apichart1 aTuchinda, Patoomratana1 aZhu, Weiming1 aWeerachayaphorn, Jittima1 aPiyachaturawat, Pawinee0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 Apr. 06, v. 215 p.167-175dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245008600170300001200256520189600268592002802164650002102192650000802213650001002221650002402231650001302255650001202268650003002280650002402310650002102334650001102355650001402366650001302380650001302393650001202406651001202418651001602430651002902446700002002475700002802495700002102523773010902544856007902653852000902732655001202741IND60749285920221121051522.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074928592DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-2612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Gennip, René GP10aGenetic modification of Bluetongue virus by uptake of "synthetic" genome segments  ap. 261.  aSince 1998, several serotypes of Bluetongue virus (BTV) have invaded several southern European countries. In 2006, the unknown BTV serotype 8 (BTV8/net06) unexpectedly invaded North-West Europe and has resulted in the largest BT-outbreak ever recorded. More recently, in 2008 BTV serotype 6 was reported in the Netherlands and Germany. This virus, BTV6/net08, is closely related to modified-live vaccine virus serotype 6, except for genome segment S10. This genome segment is closer related to that of vaccine virus serotype 2, and therefore BTV6/net08 is considered as a result of reassortment. Research on orbiviruses has been hampered by the lack of a genetic modification method. Recently, reverse genetics has been developed for BTV based on ten in vitro synthesized genomic RNAs. Here, we describe a targeted single-gene modification system for BTV based on the uptake of a single in vitro synthesized viral positive-stranded RNA. cDNAs corresponding to BTV8/net06 genome segments S7 and S10 were obtained by gene synthesis and cloned downstream of the T7 RNA-polymerase promoter and upstream of a unique site for a restriction enzyme at the 3'-terminus for run-off transcription. Monolayers of BSR cells were infected by BTV6/net08, and subsequently transfected with purified in vitro synthesized, capped positive-stranded S7 or S10 RNA from BTV8/net06 origin. "Synthetic" reassortants were rescued by endpoint dilutions, and identified by serotype-specific PCR-assays for segment 2, and serogroup-specific PCRs followed by restriction enzyme analysis or sequencing for S7 and S10 segments. The targeted single-gene modification system can also be used to study functions of viral proteins by uptake of mutated genome segments. This method is also useful to generate mutant orbiviruses for other serogroups of the genus Orbivirus for which reverse genetics has not been developed yet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBluetongue virus 3aRNA 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenomics 3amutants 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction mapping 3areverse genetics 3arunoff 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3avirology 3aviruses 3aGermany 3aNetherlands 3aNorthern European region1 aVeldman, Daniel1 avan de Water, Sandra GP1 avan Rijn, Piet A0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.261-261dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-2613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245011300162300001800275520136800293592002801661650002201689650001901711650001601730650001101746650001701757650001701774650002101791650001501812650000901827650001901836650002301855650002001878700001901898700001901917700002901936700001701965700002001982773012102002856007402123852000902197655001202206IND60618195620221120151036.0181029e20180123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061819562DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra12764b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSami, Syed Kamran10aEnhanced capacitive deionization performance by an rGO–SnO₂ nanocomposite modified carbon felt electrode  ap. 4182-4190.  aThe capacitive deionization (CDI) is a potential desalination technology in which brackish water flows between electrodes; by this process, ions are generated and stored in an electrical double layer formed at the electrode surface. In this work, we report efficient electrode materials which enable the capacitive deionization system to overcome the several issues of desalination. The rGO–SnO₂ nano-composite has been fabricated by an eco-friendly and facile hydrothermal process. The synthesized composite presents an improvement in electrochemical performance and an excellent capacitance retention of 60% even at relatively high scan-rates. In a specially designed CDI cell, the synthesized nanocomposite has shown excellent cyclic performance, high reversibility, and a remarkable electrosorption capacity of 17.62 mg g⁻¹ at an applied potential of 1.2 V with an initial salt concentration of 400 mg L⁻¹. The enhancement in electrosorption capacity of the electrode emerges due to its high specific capacitance in NaCl aqueous solution. Moreover, the system has shown a fast ion-removal rate with excellent stability and reversibility in an aqueous sodium-chloride (NaCl) solution. These results suggest that the rGO–SnO₂ composite prepared in this work is a feasible electrode material for desalination in the capacitive deionization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abrackish water 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3adeionization 3adesalination 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aions 3ananocomposites 3asalt concentration 3asodium chloride1 aSeo, Jung Yong1 aHyeon, Suh-Eun1 aShershah, Md.

In this paper, single-crystalline Cr2O3 nanoplates embedded in carbon matrix were successfully synthesized through direct thermal decomposition of a trinuclear cluster complex of [Cr3O(CH3CO2)6(H2O)3]NO3·CH3COOH ([Cr3O]) in Ar atmosphere. The synergetic effect of the plate-like structure and embedding in carbon matrix contributes to the enhanced electrochemical performance of the Cr2O3-C nanoplates. Owing to different crystallinity and composition, the obtained products at 400, 500, 600, and 700°C with different carbon content of 12.52, 8.26, 5.35 and 3.27% exhibited enhanced battery-type electrode materials in three-electrode system with high specific capacitance (823.11, 781.65, 720.72, and 696.73Fg⁻¹ at 1Ag⁻¹) and remarkable cycling stability (about 0.3, 2.7, 4.5 and 5.6% loss of its initial capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 5Ag⁻¹). Furthermore, an assembled asymmetric device (Cr2O3-C nanoplates (positive electrode)//activated carbon (AC, negative one)) with an extended operating voltage window of 1.8V achieves a specific capacitance of 58.06Fg⁻¹ at the current density of 1Ag⁻¹ and an energy density of 26.125Whkg⁻¹ at power density of 0.9kWkg⁻¹, as well as superior cycling stability with 91.4% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. The results indicate that the Cr2O3 nanoplates embedded in carbon matrix show promising potential to construct high-performance energy storage devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acrystal structure 3aelectric power 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3anitrates 3asemiconductors 3asynergism 3athermal degradation 3athermal stability 0aChromium oxide nanoplate 0aCarbon composite 0aTrinuclear complex 0aAsymmetric supercapacitors 0aElectrochemical energy storage1 aJiang, Yuqian1 aLu, Zhiyong1 aZhao, Chenglan1 aXie, Li1 aChen, Lingyun1 aDuan, Jingui0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2017 July 15, v. 498 p.351-363dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2017.03.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012100164300001600285500001500301520176800316592002802084650000902112650001702121650002102138650002902159650001702188650001802205650001202223650001902235650001802254650001602272650001502288650000902303650001102312650001802323650001302341650003602354650002202390650001502412650001802427650001302445653001102458700001902469700001702488700002502505700001702530773009302547856004802640852000902688655001202697IND50063588020221117222539.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006358802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-012-9713-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCreed, I.

We hypothesized that the topographically regulated distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the dominant factor contributing to soil CO₂ efflux. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring soil CO₂ efflux and sampling particulate and dissolved substrates (both mobile DOC in soil solution and DOC potentially sorbed onto Fe and Al oxyhydroxides) in surface (freshly fallen leaves (FFL) and forest floor) and near-surface (A-horizon or top 10 cm of peat) soils along three hillslope transects (15°, 25° and 35° slopes) that included upland (crest, shoulder, backslope, footslope, and toeslope) and wetland (periphery and central) topographic features during the snowfree season within a sugar maple forest. We observed that median snowfree season soil CO₂ efflux ranged from <1 to >5 μmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹. Substrates in the near-surface mineral soil were most strongly related to median soil CO₂ efflux, and when combined mobile DOC and sorbed DOC together explained 78% of the heterogeneity in median soil CO₂ efflux (p < 0.001). When the carbon pool in FFL (an important source of DOC to the forest soils) was included, the explanation of variance increased to 81% (p < 0.001). Topographically regulated processes created high concentrations of mobile DOC at the footslope, and high concentrations of sorbed DOC further downslope at the toeslope, forming distinct traps of DOC that can become hotspots for soil CO₂ production. A reduction in the uncertainty of forest carbon budgets can be achieved by taking into consideration the topographic regulation of the substrates contributing to soil CO₂ efflux.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeat 3acarbon sinks 3asoil respiration 3adissolved organic carbon 3aforest soils 3agas emissions 3aforests 3acarbon dioxide 3asoil solution 3auncertainty 3aA horizons 3airon 3aleaves 3amineral soils 3avariance 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3atopographic slope 3alandscapes 3aforest litter 3aaluminum 0acarbon1 aWebster, K.

This approach has been extensively studied in the literature using low-salinity/smart water and surfactant injection separately. However, application of surfactants in enhanced oil recovery is limited by their compatibility with the conditions of the reservoirs. In this study, polyethoxylated non-ionic surfactants with different ethylene oxide units were combined with low-salinity brine for a more efficient and cost-effective process. The compatibility of the surfactant solutions highly improved by reducing the salinity in the range of 200–2 g/L. Interfacial tension (IFT) measurements revealed that IFT decreased with increasing salinity. Contact angle measurements of calcite surfaces showed that wettability can be altered from a strong oil-wet state to a water-wet state after treatment with solutions of non-ionic surfactants over a wide range of salinities (∼2–110 g/L). ζ potential, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the non-ionic surfactant could partially displace carboxylate compounds from the surface and adsorb by forming a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group on the calcite surface. The formation of hydrogen bonds between ethoxy groups of the surfactant and hydroxyl or carboxylic groups on the solid surface can result in the replacement of organic compounds on the calcite surface. The organic compounds could form a new layer on the layer of adsorbed surfactant molecules via hydrophobic interactions. In addition, adsorption of the hydrophobic part of the non-ionic surfactant on the hydrophobic calcite surface and the formation of a surfactant double layer could partially contribute to the wettability alteration process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acalcite 3acarbonates 3acontact angle 3acost effectiveness 3aethylene oxide 3afuels 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3anonionic surfactants 3aoils 3asalinity 3asurface tension 3athermogravimetry 3awettability 3azeta potential1 aAl-Maamari, Rashid S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7189-17741 aAoudia, Mohamed1 aKarimi, Mahvash1 aHadji, Moundher0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Sept. 26, v. 32, no. 11 p.11222-11233dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b023733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245017700158300001800335520064300353592002800996650001201024650001701036650002001053650001901073650001201092650001701104650003101121650001501152700002201167700002601189700001801215700002001233700002301253700002401276700001901300700002201319700001701341700002101358773013101379856007801510852000901588655001201597IND60548779820170628000000.0160905e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054877982DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b120842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Jiefang10aPrototypes of Lanthanide(III) Agents Responsive to Enzymatic Activities in Three Complementary Imaging Modalities: Visible/Near-Infrared Luminescence, PARACEST-, and T1-MRI  ap. 2913-2916.  aWe report first prototypes of responsive lanthanide(III) complexes that can be monitored independently in three complementary imaging modalities.

The mean concentrations (expressed in mg kg⁻¹) are Ce 70.6, Nd 32.9, La 36.2, Y 21.6, and Sc 13.7 in surface horizons (Ap), while in subsurface horizons (Bt or Bw and some Ck), the values are Ce 67.6, Nd 31.8, La 34.4, Y 19.6, and Sc 13.9. The relative abundance in these soils is Ce > La > Nd > Y > Sc in both the surface and subsurface horizons. These values are close to, or slightly higher than, the regional levels but similar to national and global averages, although relatively high values have been detected at certain sampling points. Another aim was to explain the spatial variations in these elements within the territory under study. It was found that the spatial variations are due to the nature of the parent materials and the pedogenetic processes, although the sparse spatial distribution patterns with prominent anomalies are interpreted arising from anthropogenic sources (fertilization). However, these anomalies did not present any environmental risk in the studied zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3acerium 3alanthanum 3aneodymium 3arisk 3ascandium 3avineyards 3ayttrium 3aSpain1 aS., Bravo1 aJ.A., Amorós1 aC., Pérez-de-los-Reyes1 aJ., García-Pradas1 aM., Sanchez1 aF.J., García-Navarro0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 May, v. 194, no. 5 p.341-341dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09956-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245012900184300001600313520139700329592002801726650002401754650001401778650001801792650002201810650001601832650002801848650001801876650001601894650001201910650001601922650001401938653001601952653001801968653000901986653002801995700002302023700002902046700001902075773016002094856008202254852000902336655001202345IND60790043020221119231605.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079004302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2022.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalas-Villalobos, Ulises Andrés13aAn in-situ approach based in mineral oil to decrease end-product inhibition in prodigiosin production by Serratia marcescens  ap. 217-226.  aProdigiosin is an intense red microbial pigment produced by Serratia marcescens strains. Although various in-vitro activities make it attractive for the pharmaceutical and food industry, the production of this alkaloid is dramatically affected by media components and feedback inhibition, resulting in low productivities and high commercial costs. The present work proposes an interest low-cost production coupled to a two-phase in-situ product recovery system based on mineral oil to improve prodigiosin production. The scale-up of this strategy at batch and continuous processes was also studied. A medium composed of peanut (40 g/L) and defatted soybean flour (5.25 g/L) resulted in the highest prodigiosin titers. The addition of mineral oil (5 % v/v) triggered a 1.12-fold and 2-fold at pigment content and cell density, respectively. Scale-up at batch bioreactor resulted in a prodigiosin concentration of 1282 mg/L. However, continuous fermentation reached a 1.5-fold in the production rate compared to batch. Mathematical modeling was used to describe batch process behavior, obtaining all R² above 0.975. From these results, a potential large-scale strategy could be proposed for an industrially attractive prodigiosin production system using S. marcescens via fermentation, alleviating end-product inhibition phenomenon and putting it in perspective with an economical approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerratia marcescens 3aalkaloids 3abatch systems 3abiobased products 3abioreactors 3acontinuous fermentation 3afood industry 3amineral oil 3apeanuts 3aprodigiosin 3asoy flour 0aProdigiosin 0aS. marcescens 0aISPR 0aExtractive fermentation1 aSantacruz, Arlette1 aCastillo-Reyna, Josefina1 aAguilar, Oscar0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2022 Sept., v. 135 p.217-226dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE)wJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2022.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014400163300001600307520126000323592002801583650001501611650001501626650002201641650001401663650002101677650001701698650001401715650000701729650002401736650002301760650001701783650001401800650002001814650002301834653002601857653001401883653001001897653003101907653001401938700002401952700001401976700001801990700001402008700001702022773015102039856008202190852000902272655001202281IND60790043120221119231557.0220921e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079004312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2022.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yanhong10aCellulose adsorbent produced from the processing waste of brewer’s spent grain for efficient removal of Mn and Pb from contaminated water  ap. 227-237.  aRemoval of heavy metals from drinking water is of high importance to human health. This study reports the fabrication of a novel cellulose adsorbent from a secondary waste material, i.e., a fiber-rich product (FP) from brewer’s spent grain, for Pb and Mn removal from water. FP was sequentially treated by diluted acid, alkali, and bleach to produce purified cellulose fibers, which were then modified by 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) oxidation. The adsorption data fitted the Langmuir isotherm and the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was determined to be 272.5 mg/g for Pb (II) and 52.9 mg/g for Mn (II) at pH 6.5. Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption process followed the pseudo-second-order rate model and nearly completed in 15 min. The performance of the adsorbent in removing Pb and Mn from contaminated tap water was efficient with 87.4% of Pb and 83.9% of Mn. This study provides a novel insight into the fabrication of low-cost and high-capacity cellulose adsorbents from a waste material, then demonstrates its application for water purification. Meanwhile, it allows the integrated utilization of brewer’s spent grain, which supports the sustainable resource management and circular economy development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3abiobased products 3acellulose 3acircular economy 3ahuman health 3aoxidation 3apH 3aresource management 3asorption isotherms 3aspent grains 3atap water 3awater pollution 3awater purification 0aFood processing waste 0aCellulose 0aTEMPO 0aHeavy surface modification 0aTap water1 aDietrich, Andrea M.1 aJin, Qing1 aLin, Tiantian1 aYu, Dajun1 aHuang, Haibo0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2022 Sept., v. 135 p.227-237dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2022.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245013100199300001800330500002000348520162900368592002801997596023502025650002502260650001102285650001302296650002302309650001402332650001102346650001302357650001102370650002202381651001902403700002502422700002102447700002202468773012402490856007402614852000902688655001202697IND60787079820221120110742.0220807e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078707982DNAL7 a10.1111/jfb.145322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMrnak, Joseph T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0909-739010aEffect of water velocity and temperature on energy use, behaviour and mortality of pallid sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus larvae  ap. 1690-1700.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNatural reproduction of pallid sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus has been limited for decades and a recruitment bottleneck is hypothesized to occur during the larval stage of development. In this study, we evaluated the effects of water velocity and temperature on the swimming activity, energy use, settling behaviour and mortality of endogenously feeding larvae. The swimming activity of drifting sturgeon larvae (i.e., fish exhibiting negative rheotaxis) increased at low water velocity. In subsequent experiments, we observed greater energy depletion and resultant mortality of larvae in no‐flow environments (0 cm s⁻¹) compared to tanks with water velocity ranging from 3.5 to 8.3 cm s⁻¹. The growth rate of drifting larvae was positively related to water temperature (18.7–23.3°C), but reduced growth rate at low water temperature (18.7°C) resulted in protracted development that extended average drift duration by ~4 days compared to larvae reared at 23.3°C. This study provides evidence that cooler summer water temperatures, characteristic of present‐day conditions in the upper Missouri River, can reduce larval development and extend both the drift duration and distance requirements of S. albus. Moreover, if dispersed into low velocity environments, such as in reservoir headwaters, larvae may experience increased mortality owing to a mismatch between early life stage drift requirements and habitat conditions in the river. Manipulation of water releases to increase seasonal water temperature below dams may aid survival of S. albus larvae by shortening the time and distance spent drifting.  aPublisher supplied data  cWestern Area Power Administration, Grant Number: 17‐UGPR‐47; U.S. Geological Survey; South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks, South Dakota State University; Wildlife Management Institute; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 3aScaphirhynchus albus 3aenergy 3ahabitats 3alarval development 3amortality 3arivers 3asturgeon 3asummer 3awater temperature 3aMissouri River1 aHeironimus, Laura B.1 aJames, Daniel A.1 aChipps, Steven R.0 tJournal of fish biology.g2020 Dec., v. 97, no. 6 p.1690-1700dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:13582x0022-11127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.145323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007200148245017500220300001800395520136700413592002801780650000801808650001501816650001801831650001701849650001001866650001701876650001801893650001201911650000901923650001701932650001001949650001401959650002401973650001501997650002702012650002802039650001302067650001902080773012502099856008302224852000902307655001202316IND60780193820221121160912.0220616e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078019382DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-021-02914-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Hanan Ramadan Hamad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9457-905410aAcute Oral Administration of Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Suppresses Lead Acetate–Induced Genotoxicity, Inflammation, and ROS Generation in Mice Renal and Cardiac Tissues  ap. 3284-3293.  aLead, a highly toxic pollutant, causes numerous health problems and affects nearly all biological systems thus arousing interest in using antioxidants to reduce its toxic effects. Therefore, the undertaken study estimated the influence of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO₂-NPs) on the lead acetate–induced genotoxicity and inflammation in the kidney and heart tissues of mice. Twenty male mice were randomly divided into negative control and lead acetate and/or CeO₂-NPs administrated groups. Comet and diphenylamine assays were conducted to assess the DNA damage and the expression of apoptosis-related genes and inflammatory cytokines were also measured in addition to the estimation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Co-administration of CeO₂-NPs significantly reduced the DNA damage and ROS generation caused by lead acetate in the kidney and heart tissues. The co-administration of CeO₂-NPs also ameliorated the lead acetate–induced dysregulation in the expression levels of p53, K-ras, interleukin-6, and cyclooxygenase-2 in the kidney and heart. Conclusion: the co-administration of CeO₂-NPs suppresses the genotoxicity, inflammation, and ROS generation resulting from lead acetate administration and restoring the genomic DNA integrity; thus, administration of CeO₂-NPs is recommended to minimize the lead acetate–induced hazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3adiphenylamine 3agenotoxicity 3aheart 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alead 3alead acetate 3amales 3ananoceria 3aoral administration 3apollutants 3aprostaglandin synthase 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch 3atrace elements0 tBiological trace element research.g2022 July, v. 200, no. 7 p.3284-3293dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02914-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245010700160300001400267520136600281592002801647650001901675650002301694650002501717650002801742650002801770650002701798650001601825650002101841650001901862650001201881650001301893650002501906650001801931650001401949650001601963650001301979650002801992650001102020653002402031653002402055653002002079653001202099653000802111700001602119700001402135700001402149700001302163700001402176700005302190700001402243700001302257700001502270700002202285773009902307856008102406852000902487655001202496IND60567221520221121050227.0190405e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056722152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2017.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpanu, C.10aTesting commercial biopreservative against spoilage microorganisms in MAP packed Ricotta fresca cheese  ap. 72-76.  aRicotta fresca cheese is susceptible to secondary contamination and is able to support the growth of pathogens or spoilage psychotrophic bacteria during storage. The aim of the present study was to evaluate which among three commercial biopreservatives was suitable to be used to control the growth of spoilage microorganisms in sheep's milk MAP ricotta fresca cheese. 144 Ricotta fresca cheese samples were inoculated either with the bioprotective culture Lyofast FPR 2 (including Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum e Lactobacillus rhamnosus) or Lyofast CNBAL (Carnobacterium spp) or the fermentate MicroGARD 430. Not inoculated control and experimental ricotta were MAP packed (30% CO2 and 70% N2) and stored at 4 °C. Triplicate samples were analyzed after 5 h and 7, 14 and 21 days after inoculation for total bacterial count, mesophilic lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, Listeria monocytogenes, moulds and yeasts. Among the tested biopreservatives only Carnobacterium spp was able to control Pseudomonas spp and Enterobacteriaceae. The maximum reduction in the concentration of Pseudomonas spp and Enterobacteriaceae was respectively 1.93 and 2.66 log10 cfu/g, observed 14 days after production. Therefore, Carnobacterium spp was selected as the culture of choice to conduct a challenge study against Pseudomonas spp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnobacterium 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPseudomonas 3abiopreservatives 3acarbon dioxide 3acheeses 3aewe milk 3alactic acid bacteria 3amolds (fungi) 3apathogens 3aplate count 3aspoilage 3aspoilage microorganisms 3ayeasts 0aCarnobacterium spp. 0aProtective cultures 0aPseudomonas spp 0aRicotta 0aMAP1 aScarano, C.1 aPiras, F.1 aSpanu, V.1 aPala, C.1 aCasti, D.1 aLamon, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9184-96801 aCossu, F.1 aIbba, M.1 aNieddu, G.1 aDe Santis, E.P.L.0 tFood microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 66 p.72-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008300167300001600250520128400266592002801550650002001578650001001598650002001608650001701628650002001645650002601665650002501691650001201716650001501728653001601743653002501759653002101784653003101805653003101836700001601867700001801883700002001901700001701921700001801938700006301956700006002019700005802079773011302137856008602250852000902336655001202345IND60683549120221119205023.0200419e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068354912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, KangJu10aMicroneedle drug eluting balloon for enhanced drug delivery to vascular tissue  ap. 174-183.  aHigh rates of restenosis and neointimal formation have driven increasing interest in the application of drug eluting balloons (DEB) as counteractive measures for intraluminal drug delivery. The use of DEBs eliminates the need for stents so that serious side effects including in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis can be avoided and long-term medication of anti-platelet agent is not needed. Despite their benefits, DEBs have poor drug delivery efficiency due to short balloon inflation times (30–60 s) that limit the passive drug diffusion from the balloon surface to the luminal lesion. To increase drug delivery efficiency, a microneedle DEB (MNDEB) was developed by a conformal transfer molding process using a thin polydimethylsiloxane mold bearing a negative array of MNs of 200 μm in height. A MN array composed of UV curable resin was formed onto the surface of DEB, and drugs were coated onto the structure. The mechanical properties of the MN array were investigated and MN penetration into luminal vasculature was confirmed in vivo. An increase in drug delivery efficiency compared to a standard DEB was demonstrated in an in vivo test in a rabbit aorta. Finally, the superior therapeutic efficacy of MNDEBs was evaluated using an atherosclerosis rabbit model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aaorta 3aatherosclerosis 3adrug therapy 3ain vivo studies 3amechanical properties 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3arabbits 3athrombosis 0aMicroneedle 0aDrug eluting balloon 0aVascular disease 0aEndovascular drug delivery 0aConformal transfer molding1 aLee, JiYong1 aLee, Seul Gee1 aPark, SeungHyun1 aYang, Da Som1 aLee, Jung-Jae1 aKhademhosseini, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2692-15241 aKim, Chong-sŏn,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2263-32741 aRyu, WonHyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2839-31390 tJournal of controlled release.g2020 May 10, v. 321 p.174-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158300002000260520119800280592002801478650001101506650000901517650001701526700001601543700001501559700001701574700001501591700001701606700001901623773012501642856007501767852000901842655001201851IND60781764820221123021333.0220702e20220622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078176482DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02230c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Mingcong10aOptically controlled coalescence and splitting of femtoliter/picoliter droplets for microreactors  ap. 18311-18320.  aMicroreactor technology has attracted tremendous interest due to its features of a large specific surface area, low consumption of reagents and energy, and flexible control of the reaction process. As most of the current microreactors have volumes of microliters or even larger, effective methods to reduce the microreactors' sizes and improve their flexibility and controllability have become highly demanded. Here we propose an optical method of coalescence and splitting of femto-/pico-liter droplets for application in microreactors. Firstly, two different schemes are adopted to stably trap and directionally transport the microdroplets (oil and water) by a scanning optical tweezing system. Then, optically controlled coalescence and splitting of the microdroplets are achieved on this basis, and the mechanism and conditions are explored. Finally, the microdroplets are used as microreactors to conduct the microreactions. Such microreactors combine the advantages of miniaturization and the multi-functions of microdroplets, as well as the precision, flexibility, and non-invasiveness of optical tweezers, holding great potential for applications in materials synthesis and biosensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aoils 3asurface area1 aYao, Benjun1 aYuan, Shun1 aZhang, Weina1 aZhang, Yao1 aYang, Guowei1 aLei, Hongxiang0 tRSC advances.g2022 June 22, v. 12, no. 29 p.18311-18320dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02230c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01399naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245004600163300001800209520059100227592002800818650002300846650002300869650000800892700001800900773013100918856007501049852000901124655001201133IND60539046320170621000000.0160815e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053904632DNAL7 a10.1021/ja31129342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchäfer, Marion

The dissolution and degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose in chemical pulps in these DESs were analyzed, while the relationships between the polarity parameters of DESs and the degradation and dissolution of cellulosic fibers were discussed. The results show that dicarboxylic acids/ChCl were more conducive to the solubility and degradation of cellulosic fibers compared to monocarboxylic acids/ChCl at a higher temperature. In addition, the increase in alkyl of the CA could reduce the solubility to cellulosic fiber. The further study reveals that the dissolution and degradation of cellulosic fibers are generally governed both by temperature and the ability of DESs hydrogen bond acidity (α), while temperature shows little effect on α. However, no remarkable relationships were found between the DESs hydrogen bond basicity (β) and cellulose degradation and dissolution.  aPublisher supplied data  a31770632cNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province 3aacetic acid 3aacidity 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3achemical pulp 3acholine 3acholine chloride 3aformic acid 3ahardwood 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrogen bonding 3asolubility 3atechnology 3atemperature1 aLu, Xingmei1 aZhao, Honghui1 aLin, Changmei1 aNi, Liufang1 aCao, Shilin1 aMa, Xiaojuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5927-26580 tWood science and technology.g2022 Sept., v. 56, no. 5 p.1475-1486dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-022-01406-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009800158300001800256520178500274592002802059650002702087650001602114650001702130650000902147650001402156650001202170650001902182650001802201650002102219650001702240650001102257650000902268700001702277700001502294700002002309773013102329856007502460852000902535655001202544IND60539046420221122040940.0160815e20130206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053904642DNAL7 a10.1021/ja311385y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhanxia10aSmart Mesoporous SiO2 Nanoparticles for the DNAzyme-Induced Multiplexed Release of Substrates  ap. 1934-1940.  aThe fluorescent dyes methylene blue, MB⁺, and thionine, Th⁺, can be trapped in the pores of mesoporous silica, MP-SiO₂, by means of functional nanostructures consisting of the Mg²⁺- or Zn²⁺-dependent DNAzyme sequences. In the presence of Mg²⁺ or Zn²⁺ ions the respective DNAzymes are activated, leading to the specific cleavage of the respective caps, and the selective release of MB⁺ or Th⁺. The enlargement of the conserved loop domains of the Mg²⁺- or Zn²⁺-dependent DNAzyme sequences with foreign nucleotides prohibits the formation of active DNAzymes and eliminates the release of the respective dyes. This is due to the flexibility of the loops that lacks affinity for the association of the ions. The insertion of aptamer sequences (e.g., the adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) aptamer) or ion-binding sequences (e.g., T-rich Hg²⁺ ion-binding domains) as foreign components to the loop regions allows the formation of active Mg²⁺- or Zn²⁺-dependent DNAzyme structures through the cooperative formation of aptamer-ATP complexes or T-Hg²⁺-T bridges. These aptamer–substrate complexes or T-Hg²⁺-T bridges allosterically stabilize and activate the DNAzymes, thus allowing the selective release of the fluorescent substrates MB⁺ or Th⁺. The metal ion-driven DNAzyme release of substrates from the pores of MP-SiO₂, and particularly the allosteric activation of the DNAzymes through cooperative aptamer–substrate complexes or metal-ion bridges, has important future nanomedical implications for targeted release of drugs. This is demonstrated with the triggered release of the anticancer drug, doxorubicin, by the Mg²⁺-DNAzyme-locked pores or by the aptamer-ATP complex-triggered activation of the Mg²⁺-dependent DNAzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3adoxorubicin 3afluorescence 3aions 3amagnesium 3amercury 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3aporous media 3asilica 3azinc1 aBalogh, Dora1 aWang, Fuan1 aWillner, Itamar0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Feb. 06, v. 135, no. 5 p.1934-1940dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja311385y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012400156300002000280520047700300592002800777650001400805650001900819650002200838650001100860650001400871650001100885650001900896650001100915700001600926700001100942700001800953700001700971700001500988700001701003700001301020700001801033773012501051856007501176852000901251655001201260IND60781764920221123021326.0220702e20220622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078176492DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02255a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Gefei10aSolid-state molecular oxygen activation using ball milling and a piezoelectric material for aerobic oxidation of thiols  ap. 18407-18411.  aThe agitation of BaTiO₃via ball milling converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, leading to the reduction of molecular oxygen via a single electron transfer pathway analogous to the photocatalytic reaction.

PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs were detected in all the samples. Due to the proximity to important urban and industrial areas higher concentrations were determined in colonies located in the Northern Mediterranean coast than those found in the Southern Mediterranean or Atlantic colonies where a softer anthropogenic impact occurs. Mean ∑PCDD/F concentrations ranged from 49 to 223pg/g lipid weight (lw) and ∑dl-PCB concentrations varied from 146 to 911ng/g lw. In the Natural Park of the Ebro Delta (Northern Mediterranean coast) two gull species share habitat: yellow-legged and Audouin gull (Larus audouinii). Eggs from both species were collected and PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels compared. The species that feeds exclusively on pelagic fish (L. audouinii) had significantly higher PCDD/F and dl-PCB levels than the scavenger L. michahellis, pointing out the diet-dependent differences in the accumulation of persistent organic pollutants between similar cohabitant breeding species. Finally, mean TEQ values were in general below those considered as critical for toxicological effects in birds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus michahellis 3aanthropogenic activities 3abirds 3abreeding 3acoasts 3adibenzofuran 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3alipids 3anational parks 3apelagic fish 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolychlorinated dibenzodioxins 3apolychlorinated dibenzofurans 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aMediterranean 0aPCDD/Fs 0adl-PCBs 0aGull eggs 0aBiomonitoring1 aGene'rosa Martrat, Ma1 aParera, Jordi1 aBertolero, Albert1 aÁbalos, Manuela1 aSantos, Francisco Javier1 aLacorte, Silvia1 aAbad, Esteban0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 550 p.114-122dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245015100165500001900316520099800335592002801333650002401361650001601385650001001401650001901411650001101430650001401441650001901455650001301474650001001487653001901497653002701516653003601543653003001579653003301609700001401642700001901656700001601675700001501691700001601706700001201722700001601734700001901750700001301769773010001782856008701882852000901969655001201978IND60734890820221120024439.0210603e20211001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073489082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Lei10aAddition of Aegilops geniculata 1Ug chromosome improves the dough rheological properties by changing the composition and micro-structure of gluten  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAegilops geniculata, a relative of common wheat, has many useful traits for the improvements of wheat varieties. The wheat-Ae. geniculata disomic addition lines (DALs) carrying prior traits need to be characterized for wheat varieties improvement. We currently found that CS-1Ug (Chinese Spring-Ae. geniculata 1Ug DAL) possessed improved dough rheological properties than CS (Chinese Spring) did, and investigated the reasons of those rheological changes in dough. The results showed that CS-1Ug carries a novel high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS), a substitute for Dx2 from CS, which led to the changes in the relative proportion of individual HMW-GS in total HMW-GSs. Changes in gluten composition improved the stability and elasticity of dough by promoting the accumulation of unextractable polymeric protein, and optimizing the micro-structure of the gluten. The current study provides basic information on CS-1Ug used as a potential resource for future wheat quality breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegilops geniculata 3achromosomes 3adough 3afood chemistry 3agluten 3aglutenins 3amicrostructure 3apolymers 3awheat 0aAe. geniculata 0aDisomic addition lines 0aUnextractable polymeric protein 0aMicro-structure of gluten 0aDough rheological properties1 aYu, Liwei1 aTong, Jingyang1 aZhao, Yiyue1 aYang, Yang1 aMa, Yanrong1 aCui, Lu1 aHu, Yingang1 aWang, Zhonghua1 aGao, Xin0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 358 p.129850-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245014000173300001600313500001500329520094200344592002801286650001601314650001901330650002001349650001301369650005201382650000901434650001001443650001201453650003401465650001001499650001201509650004301521650003201564650001601596651001001612653003201622700001801654700001401672700002001686700001601706700001601722773010401738856008601842852000901928655001201937IND60087699920221118065342.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008769992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xing-Juan10aDevelopment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification for visual detection of the HCLV vaccine against classical swine fever in China  ap. 200-205.  a2019-12-06  aA loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for the rapid and specific detection of HCLV vaccine strain against classical swine fever.

No cross-reaction with other porcine viruses including different wild-type CSFV strains and the bovine viral diarrhoea virus was observed. The agreement between the LAMP and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assays was 94.4% for the detection of 72 batches of HCLV vaccine.

The impact of the storage time of the raw material and the type of cut (i.e., cube and chip) was also examined. Fresh-cut potato from raw material stored 2 months at 12°C and 90% relative humidity (RH) displayed 1 to 2.5 times higher respiration activity than potatoes stored 4 months under the same conditions. Lower CO2 emission was only observed when potatoes stored 4 months were used. Fresh-cut potato shelf life decreased (less than 23 d at 5°C) due to microbial growth. Approximately 7 log cfu g−1 for mesophilic and psycrophilic bacteria and Enterobactericeae when potatoes stored 4 months were used. Microbial growth was higher in chips than cube. The native colored-fleshed potatoes were rich in polyphenols, and total antioxidant capacity is 1 to 2 times higher than that of commercial potato. Total polyphenol content was not affected by the storage time of the raw material and remained stable under storage at 5°C. However, fresh-cut potato processed from raw material stored 2 months had 1.5 to 3 times more total antioxidant capacity than that processed from raw material stored 4 months. For both parameters, Bruja exhibited values approximately 60% higher. Although all the analyzed varieties were suitable for fresh-cut elaboration, Bruja and Michuñe roja displayed higher metabolic activity and susceptibility to microbial deterioration and browning. To guarantee fresh-cut potato quality, raw material should be maintained no longer than 4 months in storage. From this moment some quality parameters alterations, that limited the fresh-cut shelf life, begin to be observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon dioxide 3afresh-cut produce 3agenotype 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amicrobial growth 3apolyphenols 3apotatoes 3araw materials 3arelative humidity 3ashelf life 3astorage time 0aNative potato 0aMicrobial growth 0aPolyphenols 0aAntioxidant capacity1 aOyarzún, Denisse1 aSepúlveda, Alejandra1 aEscalona, Victor0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2017 June, v. 128 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2017.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01427naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002900138245013700167300001800304520038100322592002800703650002100731650001700752650002700769650002300796650002300819650001200842700002000854700002300874773013400897856007301031852000901104655001201113IND60658603820221119130939.0190826e20100427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065860382DNAL7 a10.1039/b926894d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThirumalairajan, Srinath10aInterrogation of the active site of OMP decarboxylase from Escherichia coli with a substrate analogue bearing an anionic group at C6  ap. 3158-3160.  aAn analogue of orotidine 5′-monophosphate (OMP), 6-phosphonouridine 5′-monophosphate is a competitive inhibitor of OMP decarboxylase from E. coli, binding with an affinity similar to that of OMP.

Initially, MIPs materials were prepared via visible light-initiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization at ambient temperature using 2,4-D and its analogs as template molecules, in which 4-vinyl pyridine (4-VP), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) diphenylphosphine oxide (TPO), 2-(((dodecylthio)carbonothioyl)thio)-2-methylpropanoic acid (DDMAT) were functional monomer, cross-linker, visible light initiator and RAFT agent, respectively. Then, the morphologies of the MIPs materials were characterized by FT-IR, SEM and DLS. The results showed that the MIPs materials were well-distributed spherical particles with sizes ranging from 1 to 2 μm. Furthermore, a four-channel MIPs sensor array included four polymer microspheres with a fluorescent dye displacement procedure was developed to distinguish the templates and their chemical analogs at the ppm concentration level. With the support of principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, the four-channel MIPs sensor array proves to be a simple and effective method to recognize and distinguish the templates and nontemplates in aqueous solution with 100% accuracy. Finally, the four-channel MIPs sensor array was also found to have satisfactory accuracy in monitoring 2,4-D contaminated environmental water and mixed juice.  aPublisher supplied data  a2006JJ6148cNatural Science Foundation of Hunan Province  a19K086cScientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department 3a2,4-D 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aaqueous solutions 3acluster analysis 3aemulsions 3aethylene glycol 3afluorescent dyes 3aherbicide residues 3ajuices 3alight 3amicroparticles 3amolecular imprinting 3amonitoring 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyridines 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aJiao, Tiantian1 aXu, Changli1 aLi, Wei1 aXiong, Yan0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 June, v. 55, no. 16 p.6848-6860dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04516-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014500168520090600313592002801219650002101247650002901268650001701297650001401314650001301328650002001341650001601361650001401377650001901391650003701410650001401447650002401461650000701485650001701492650002701509650001601536650002101552653001301573653001601586653001601602653001401618653002101632653002701653653002501680700001801705700002001723773010001743856008701843852000901930655001201939IND60734890920221120024410.0210813e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073489092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Tai-Ti10aFunctionalities of chitosan conjugated with lauric acid and l-carnitine and application of the modified chitosan in an oil-in-water emulsion  aThe aim of this research was to conjugate chitosan (CT) with lauric acid (LA) and l-carnitine (CNT) to yield a product that is water-soluble at neutral pH and has surface, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities. The resulting CT-LA-CNT is water-soluble at neutral pH, in contrast with CT and CT-LA, which require the aid of acid to become soluble. Concerning antimicrobial activity, for S. aureus, the minimum bactericidal concentration of CT was lower than those of CT-LA or CT-LA-CNT, while the three compounds exhibited similar bactericidal activity against E. coli. CT-LA-CNT was also used to study the oxidative stability of soybean oil in an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion; sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Tween 80 and Span 80 (TS), an emulsifier mixture, were used as controls for comparison. The results showed that CT-LA-CNT was better than SDS and TS at protecting the lipid from oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidants 3acarnitine 3achitosan 3adodecanoic acid 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3afood chemistry 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apH 3apolysorbates 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asoybean oil 3awater solubility 0aChitosan 0aLauric acid 0al-carnitine 0aConjugate 0aWater solubility 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aAntioxidant activity1 aSu, Guan-Zhen1 aYang, Tsung-Shi0 tFood chemistry.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 359 p.129851-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1298513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245007500172300001400247520080200261592002801063650001601091650001101107650002401118650001301142653003001155653001101185653001601196653002101212653001001233653003901243700002201282700002101304700002201325700002101347700001801368700001801386700002501404700001701429773011701446856009001563852000901653655001201662IND60562787320221118080455.0190405e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056278732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2017.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiels, Elien10aAssessment of bruise volumes in apples using X-ray computed tomography  ap. 24-32.  aA non-destructive methodology was developed to automatically detect and quantify bruise volumes in the equatorial region of apples, using X-ray CT images. Grey level threshold values were calculated to segment bruises in ‘Jonagold’, ‘Joly Red’ and ‘Kanzi’ apple fruit using the multi-level Otsu’s threshold method. Comparisons were made between the CT-based bruise volume estimates and bruise volume estimates that were based on destructive measurements in combination with simple geometric assumptions. Visualisation of the bruises in both 2 and 3D showed that bruises, resulting from a pendulum impact with a spherical impactor, can be highly irregularly shaped which implies that the bruise volume estimations based on simple geometric assumptions cannot deliver accurate results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aapples 3acomputed tomography 3ageometry 0aX-ray computed tomography 0aBruise 0aPostharvest 0aImage processing 0aFruit 0aNon-destructive quality inspection1 avan Dael, Mattias1 aKeresztes, Janos1 aVanmaercke, Simon1 aVerboven, Pieter1 aNicolai, Bart1 aSaeys, Wouter1 aRamon, H.q(Herman),1 aSmeets, Bart0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2017 June, v. 128 p.24-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl47454x0925-52147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2017.01.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245007800157300001600235500001500251520159400266592002801860650001901888650001601907650001101923650001301934650001901947650001901966650002101985650001502006650002702021650001402048650002502062650002402087650002102111650001202132650002002144650001502164650001802179650002002197650003002217650002802247650000902275653001902284700003102303700001902334700002702353700001802380700001902398773014902417856007302566852000902639655001202648IND4420977320221121194937.0140728e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442097732DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.21882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValentín, Lara10aEvaluation of basidiomycetous fungi for pretreatment of contaminated soil  ap. 851-858.  a2019-12-05  aBACKGROUND: For most dioxin‐contaminated sawmill soils, combustion is recommended. However, the process may be inefficient if the soil has a high organic matter content. The use of saprotrophic basidiomycetous fungi is an alternative for pretreatment of this kind of soil. A total of 147 fungi were evaluated for their ability to grow in sawmill soil. From this screening, the best soil colonizing fungi were selected to study their enzyme activities and degradation of soil organic matter. Pine (Pinus sylvestris) bark was used as a co‐substrate to propagate the fungi into the soil. The activities of manganese peroxidase (MnP), laccase, endo‐1,4‐β‐glucanase, endo‐1,4‐β‐xylanase, and endo‐1,4‐β‐mannanase were analysed from the inocula and fungal treated soil. RESULTS: The screening revealed that 56 out of 147 fungi were able to grow in non‐sterile soil, and most of them were litter‐decomposing fungi (LDF). In pine bark cultures, the highest enzyme activities were observed with Phanerochaete velutina, which produced 5 U g⁻¹ of MnP. The activity of endo‐1,4‐β‐glucanase was generally higher than that of other hydrolytic enzymes. The highest carbon loss from soil with a high organic matter content was achieved by P. velutina (3.4%) and Stropharia rugosoannulata (2.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Many LDF, and in addition the white‐rot fungus P. velutina, are potential degraders of soil organic matter since they showed good growth and respiratory activity. Pine bark was a suitable lignocellulosic co‐substrate and a good promoter of MnP activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3alignocellulose 3asaprotrophs 3acarbon 3asawmills 3apolluted soils 3asoil pollution 3alosses from soil 3acombustion 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3ascreening 3amanganese peroxidase 3asoil organic matter 3aPinus sylvestris 3alaccase 3aenzyme activity 3asoil fungi 3aPhanerochaete 3awhite-rot fungi 3aStropharia rugosoannulata 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3abark 0aorganic matter1 aKluczek‐Turpeinen, Beata1 aOivanen, Pekka1 aHatakka, A.q(Annele),1 aSteffen, Kari1 aTuomela, Marja0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2009 June, v. 84, no. 6 p.851-858dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.21883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245013500178300001600313520107600329592002801405650001801433650002101451650000801472650001501480650001901495650003501514650001501549650001301564650002201577700002501599700002501624700002501649700002401674700002301698700001801721700002001739773010401759856008601863852000901949655001201958IND60087700120221120202946.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008770012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavryushina, Elena S.10aImmunolocalization of Picornavirus RNA in infected cells with antibodies to Tyr-pUp, the covalent linkage unit between VPg and RNA  ap. 206-211.  aThe genomic RNA of picornaviruses is attached to a small protein (VPg) via a covalent bond between a tyrosine and a 5′-terminal uridine phosphate. The same structure is present in potyvirus and calicivirus families. VPgs play a key role in initiation of viral replication by acting as primers for RNA synthesis. The model compound [N(Ac),CO(NHMe)]Tyr-(5′P→O)Up-O-(CH₂)₆NH₂ (mCLU), mimicking this ‘covalent linkage unit’ (CLU) and containing Tyr-pUp was synthesized in solution following the phosphoramidite scheme and used to raise antibodies for studying picornavirus infection. The antibodies recognized CLU-containing mengovirus RNA and showed minimal cross-reactivity with RNAs lacking CLU. Immunofluorescence staining of cells infected with a human rhinovirus demonstrated co-localization of the signals from anti-mCLU and from anti-VPg antibodies. Efficient synthesis of mCLU and anti-mCLU antibodies might be of great utility for investigating viral replication and identifying yet unknown viral and cellular CLU-containing RNA–protein complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaliciviridae 3aHuman rhinovirus 3aRNA 3aantibodies 3across reaction 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aphosphates 3atyrosine 3avirus replication1 aBryantseva, Sofia A.1 aNadezhdina, Elena S.1 aZatsepin, Timofei S.1 aToropygin, Ilya Yu.1 aPickl-Herk, Angela1 aBlaas, Dieter1 aDrygin, Yuri F.0 tJournal of virological methods.g2011 Jan., v. 171, no. 1 p.206-211dElsevier B.V.x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245016900217300001600386520137200402592002801774650001201802650002001814650002601834650001401860650001201874650001901886650002101905650001001926650001901936650001601955650001001971650002401981650003702005650002702042650001302069650001402082650002402096653001702120653001202137653001502149653001502164653001502179700002902194700003502223700002902258700002502287700002802312700004902340700002802389700003702417700003802454700003102492700002802523700002902551700003002580700003002610700003602640773010302676856008602779852000902865655001202874IND60567222120221121014107.0180830e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056722212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2017.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta Silva, Rose Anny1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6127-911110aIn vitro anti-Candida activity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors against fluconazole-resistant strains and their activity against biofilm-forming isolates  ap. 341-348.  aRecent research has shown broad antifungal activity of the classic antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This fact, combined with the increased cross-resistance frequency of the genre Candida regarding the main treatment today, fluconazole, requires the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In that context, this study aimed to assess the antifungal potential of fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine against fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. planktonic cells, as well as to assess the mechanism of action and the viability of biofilms treated with fluoxetine. After 24 h, the fluconazole-resistant Candida spp. strains showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the ranges of 20–160 μg/mL for fluoxetine, 10–20 μg/mL for sertraline, and 10–100.8 μg/mL for paroxetine by the broth microdilution method (M27-A3). According to our data by flow cytometry, each of the SSRIs cause fungal death after damaging the plasma and mitochondrial membrane, which activates apoptotic signaling pathways and leads to dose-dependant cell viability loss. Regarding biofilm-forming isolates, the fluoxetine reduce mature biofilm of all the species tested. Therefore, it is concluded that SSRIs are capable of inhibit the growth in vitro of Candida spp., both in planktonic form, as biofilm, inducing cellular death by apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aantidepressants 3aantifungal properties 3aapoptosis 3abiofilm 3acell viability 3across resistance 3adeath 3aflow cytometry 3afluconazole 3afungi 3amechanism of action 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amitochondrial membrane 3aplankton 3aserotonin 3asignal transduction 0aCandida spp. 0aBiofilm 0aFluoxetine 0aParoxetine 0aSertraline1 ada Silva, Cecília Rocha1 ade Andrade Neto, João Batista1 ada Silva, Anderson Ramos1 aCampos, Rosana Sousa1 aSampaio, Letícia Serpa1 ado Nascimento, Francisca Bruna Stefany Aires1 ada Silva Gaspar, Brenda1 ada Cruz Fonseca, Said Gonçalves1 aJosino, Maria Aparecida Alexandre1 aGrangeiro, Thalles Barbosa1 aGaspar, Danielle Macedo1 ade Lucena, David Freitas1 ade Moraes, Manoel Odorico1 aCavalcanti, Bruno Coêlho1 aNobre Júnior, Hélio Vitoriano0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2017 June, v. 107 p.341-348dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245015600161300001800317520151300335592002801848596005901876596008801935596008802023596007502111596007502186596009902261596009902360596007302459650001502532650002102547650002102568650001602589650001802605650001802623650002202641650001302663650002102676650001302697650002602710650001502736650002102751700001302772700001702785700001702802700001802819700001602837700001402853700001302867700001702880700001602897773012202913856008303035852000903118655001203127IND60685992520221118004752.0200611e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068599252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04510-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fan10aPoly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone)/tussah silk fibroin nanofiber vascular scaffolds with small diameter fabricated by core-spun electrospinning technology  ap. 7106-7119.  aA biomimetic vascular scaffold with excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility is urgently needed, and designing such a scaffold is a challenge. The majority of vascular scaffolds have satisfactory biocompatibility, but poor mechanical properties. Herein, biodegradable poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) with biomimetic mechanical properties was used to prepare small-diameter (< 1.5 mm) PLCL/tussah silk fibroin (TSF) nanofiber vascular scaffolds grafted with TSF using the core-spun electrospinning technology. The morphology, biocompatibility, and mechanical properties of the PLCL/TSF nanofiber vascular scaffolds were characterized. The diameter of PLCL/TSF nanofibers was almost unchanged after grafting TSF with an average diameter of 408 ± 13 nm and a reduced water contact angle of 56 ± 8°. The protein adsorption was twice that of pure PLCL nanofiber vascular scaffolds. Remarkably, PLCL/TSF nanofiber vascular scaffolds displayed excellent mechanical properties. Their radial tensile strength and axial Young’s modulus were twice and more than three times those of traditional nanofiber vascular scaffolds, respectively. The biological properties of PLCL/TSF nanofiber vascular scaffolds were evaluated by in vitro culture of vascular endothelial cells. The scaffolds effectively promoted vascular endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation. The developed PLCL/TSF nanofiber vascular scaffolds are potentially valuable for use as readily available vascular grafts.  aPublisher supplied data  a51803244cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a182102310862cKey Scientific and Technological Research Projects in Henan Provinces  a182102210127cKey Scientific and Technological Research Projects in Henan Provinces  a2018018cApparel Council Scientific and Technological Guiding Projects  a2017036cApparel Council Scientific and Technological Guiding Projects  a19B540001cKey Scientific Research Projects of Higher Education Institutions in Henan Province  a18A540002cKey Scientific Research Projects of Higher Education Institutions in Henan Province  a2020HYTP032cYouth talent support project of Henan Province of China 3aadsorption 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3abiomimetics 3acell adhesion 3acontact angle 3aendothelial cells 3afibroins 3ain vitro culture 3alactones 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananofibers 3atensile strength1 aLiao, Xi1 aLiu, Chunhui1 aLi, Mengying1 aChen, Yuankun1 aShao, Weili1 aWeng, Kai1 aLi, Fang1 aOu, Kangkang1 aHe, Jianxin0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 June, v. 55, no. 16 p.7106-7119dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04510-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245018100167300001600348520131100364592002801675650001301703650001901716650002101735650001701756650000901773650001401782650001501796650003701811650002201848650002001870650001801890650002101908650002001929651001901949773012701968856004802095852000902143655001202152IND4529671920221122133835.0160219e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND452967192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11157-011-9252-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Tony,10aIdentifying polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in oil-contaminated surface waters at Deepwater Horizon by cultivation, stable isotope probing and pyrosequencing  ap. 301-305.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an important class of chemical pollutants that constitute a major component of total hydrocarbons in crude oils. Based on their poor water solubility, toxicity, persistence and potential to bioaccumulate, these compounds are recognized as high-priority pollutants in the environment and are of significant concern for human health. At oil-contaminated sites, PAH-degrading bacteria perform a critical role in the degradation and ultimate removal of these compounds. In April 2010, enormous quantities of PAHs entered the Gulf of Mexico from the thousands of tons of oil that were released from the ill-fated drilling rig Deepwater Horizon. In the ensuing months after the spill, intense research efforts were devoted to characterizing the microorganisms responsible for degrading the oil, particularly in deep waters where a large oil plume, enriched with aliphatic and low molecular-weight aromatic hydrocarbons, was found in the range of 1,000–1,300 m. PAHs, however, were found mainly confined to surface waters. This paper discusses efforts utilizing DNA-based stable isotope probing, cultivation-based techniques and metagenomics to characterize the bacterial guild associated with PAH degradation in oil-contaminated surface waters at Deepwater Horizon.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3aisotope labeling 3ametagenomics 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asequence analysis 3astable isotopes 3asurface water 3atoxic substances 3awater pollution 3aGulf of Mexico0 tRe/views in environmental science and bio/technology.g2011 Dec., v. 10, no. 4 p.301-305dSpringer-Verlagx1569-17057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11157-011-9252-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009300168300001600261520144400277592002801721650001701749650001401766650002201780650001601802650001601818650002201834650002201856650001101878650001301889650001101902650001301913650000701926650001501933650001301948650001801961653003801979653002402017653001902041653002202060653003102082653003202113700001802145700001502163700002402178700001902202773008102221856008402302852000902386655001202395IND60545229720221119223444.0160901e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054522972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Yongjun10aKinetic modeling and energy efficiency of UV/H2O2 treatment of iodinated trihalomethanes  ap. 259-269.  aPhotodegradation of I-THMs including CHCl2I and CHI3 by the UV/H2O2 system was investigated in this study. CHCl2I and CHI3 react rapidly with hydroxyl radical (OH) produced by the UV/H2O2 system, with second-order rate constants of 8.0 × 109 and 8.9 × 109 M−1 s−1, respectively. A fraction of CHCl2I could be completely mineralized within 15 min and the remaining fraction was mainly converted to formic acid (HCO2H). Cl− and I− were identified as the predominant end-products. No ClO3− was observed during the photodegradation process, while IO3− was detected but at less than 2% of the total liberated iodine species at the end of the reaction. The effects of pH, H2O2 dose, and matrix species such as humic acid (HA), HCO3−, SO42−, Cl−, NO3− on the photodegradation kinetics were evaluated. The steady-state kinetic model has been proven to successfully predict the destruction of CHCl2I and CHI3 by UV/H2O2 in different water matrices. On this basis, the kinetic model combined with electrical energy per order (EE/O) concept was applied to evaluate the efficiency of the photodegradation process and to optimize the H2O2 dose for different scenarios.

These results showed that lettuce responds to heat stress by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the early stage and lettuce responds to heat stress by improving the photosynthetic pigment, osmotic adjustment contents and changing plant morphology in the later stage, thus balancing heat stress response and growth, ultimately promoting the increase of its biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3abiomass production 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3aclimate 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3alettuce 3amalondialdehyde 3anight temperature 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant morphology 3aproline 3asugar content 3asugars 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athermosensitivity 3awater stress 0aLettuce 0aBiomass accumulation 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aPhotosynthetic pigment 0aPlant morphology 0aHS 0aLN 0aSL 0aLL 0aLW 0aPL 0aRFW 0aSFW 0aTFW 0aSDW 0aRDW 0aTDW 0aROS 0aSOD 0aPOD 0aCAT 0aMAD 0aPro 0aSS 0aH2O2 0ao2⋅-1 aSui, Xinyi1 aZhao, Liuxin1 aGao, Xingxing1 aWang, Jianxia1 aWen, Xiangzhen1 aLi, Yaling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8189-05130 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 July 27, v. 301 p.111112-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.1111123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01357naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009000157300002000247520036100267592002800628650001700656650000900673650001600682700001700698700001500715700001800730700001600748700001400764700001500778700001800793773012500811856007400936852000901010655001201019IND60641102620221119132446.0190505e20160907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064110262DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17197d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chongwen10aInsight into the effect of ion source for the solution processing of perovskite films  ap. 85026-85029.  aWe find that there exists an ion exchange phenomenon in the precursor solutions for perovskite films.

Resurveys conducted over large spatial scales, for example, can be used to discriminate between site-specific causes of decline and those that act at the population level. Here we used regional resurvey data to address changes in Argentine ant site occupancy in urban, agricultural, and natural environments in coastal southern California. We resurveyed 145 locations originally sampled 12–14 years ago and observed a slight decrease in Argentine ant site occupation, from 85 to 79% across all sites. At the majority of sites where apparent absences were recorded, however, the Argentine ant had merely retreated outside of the proscribed sampling area (a 25-m radius circle) and was still present within 80 m, on average, of the original sampling point. This finding thus suggests that the apparent absences observed most likely reflect contractions of the area occupied by polydomous supercolonies, possibly in response to local-scale changes in environmental conditions, as opposed to processes acting at larger spatial scales. We also conducted back-to-back annual resurveys (in 2018 and 2019) of all urban sampling points (n = 95) to quantify annual turnover in site occupancy. These resurveys revealed 2.4% site turnover with 97% (92/95) sites being classified as either presences (n = 85) or absences (n = 7) in both years. Our results support the findings of resurveys conducted in northern California, where Argentine ant distributions have slowly expanded over decadal time scales. Historical resurveys can provide insights into why populations of introduced species change over time and should incorporate an appreciation of how invader traits affect detectability.  aPublisher supplied data  aLong-term Research in Environmental Biology 1654525cNational Science Foundation 3aLinepithema humile 3adecline 3aintroduced species 3aoccupations 3aCalifornia1 aHolway, David A.0 tBiological invasions.g2020 May, v. 22, no. 5 p.1669-1679dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl66237x1387-35477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-020-02211-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010800173520165300281592002801934650001901962650001601981650001401997650001902011650001102030650001202041650001202053650001902065650001802084650001802102650001902120650001102139650001102150650002502161650001102186650001902197653002202216653002402238653003002262700001802292700001502310700001602325700005702341700001702398700001602415700001402431773011902445856008802564852000902652655001202661IND60783355420221120121406.0220906e20221110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078335542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuangyuan10aSpatial distribution and influencing mechanism of CO2, N2O and CH4 in the Pearl River Estuary in summer  aEstuaries, considered as the important carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrous oxide (N₂O) and methane (CH₄) sources to the atmosphere, are increasingly affected by near-bottom hypoxia. However, the impact of estuarine hypoxic zone development on GHGs production and discharge remains poorly understood due to the seasonal and spatially distributed heterogeneity of estuarine hypoxia occurrence and the lack of simultaneous monitoring of the distribution of bottom hypoxic waters and the vertical distribution of GHGs. Here, we conducted high spatial resolution vertical stratification sampling and analysis of water column GHGs in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), a large estuary with frequent hypoxia in recent years. Our results showed that Pearl River runoff is the main source of GHGs in the PRE. Strong nitrification is an important N₂O production mechanism in the PRE. In situ generation of water and resuspension of surface sediments were the main sources of CH₄ in bottom water, while massive organic matter (OM) mineralization is the main driver of CO₂ in bottom water. The development of a hypoxic zone in the PRE significantly increased the concentration of N₂O and CH₄ in the bottom water and thus increased air-water fluxes. The air-water fluxes of N₂O, CH₄ and CO₂ of PRE in summer were 31.9 ± 7.5 μmol m⁻² d⁻¹, 192.5 ± 229.4 μmol m⁻² d⁻¹ and 51.9 ± 14.1 mmol m⁻² d⁻¹, respectively. This study reveals that GHGs fluxes from estuarine waters to the atmosphere will increase significantly with increasing eutrophication caused by human activities and the expansion of hypoxic zones in estuarine waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironment 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3ahumans 3ahypoxia 3amethane 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrous oxide 3aorganic matter 3arivers 3arunoff 3aspatial distribution 3asummer 3awater analysis 0aN2O, CH4, and CO2 0aPearl River Estuary 0aGreenhouse gases emission1 aGao, Quanzhou1 aWu, Jiaxue1 aXie, Yuting1 aYang, Qianc(Chinese literature and film specialist)1 aWang, Ruowen1 aZhang, Jing1 aLiu, Qian0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 10, v. 846 p.157381-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03662naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002400165245014100189300001600330500001500346520187700361592002802238650002702266650001502293650002602308650001102334650001202345650001002357650001202367650004102379650001102420650002402431650006902455650005102524650001602575650002502591650000902616650001202625650000902637650007202646650001002718650002602728650002802754653001402782700002302796700002302819700002302842700001902865773013202884852000903016856008303025655001203108IND2201523120221118011758.0181016e199905  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220152312DNAL7 a103533572pmid7 a10.1177/1040638799011003082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNietfeld, Jerome C.10aIsolation of Cilia-Associated Respiratory (CAR) Bacillus from Pigs and Calves and Experimental Infection of Gnotobiotic Pigs and Rodents  ap. 252-258.  a2019-12-04  aFilamentous, gram-negative bacteria morphologically similar to cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus of rodents and rabbits were isolated from the tracheas of 5 pigs and 4 calves. All pigs but none of the calves had histologic lesions of chronic tracheitis. In silver-stained histologic sections, CAR bacilli were adhered to the tracheal epithelium of each pig but were not found in the calves. Like CAR bacillus of rats, the bacteria displayed gliding motility and grew only in cell culture or cell culture medium supplemented with fetal serum. Initially, all isolates were contaminated by Mycoplasma spp. This contamination was eliminated from 4 pig isolates by limiting dilutions, and mycoplasma-free isolates were used to intranasally inoculate gnotobiotic pigs and CAR bacillus-free mice and rats and to immunize guinea pigs. The gnotobiotic pigs remained healthy, and when they were necropsied 4 and 7 weeks after infection no macroscopic or microscopic lesions were found in the respiratory tract. However, CAR bacillus was isolated at both times from the nasal cavities and tracheas of inoculated pigs, and the ciliated tracheal epithelium of infected pigs necropsied 7 weeks after infection was colonized by low numbers of CAR bacillus-like bacteria. The rats and mice remained healthy through week 12 postinoculation, and evidence of short- or long-term colonization was not detected by histologic examination or culture. When used as primary antibody for immunohistochemical staining, sera from guinea pigs immunized with pig CAR bacillus specifically stained CAR bacilli colonizing the respiratory epithelium of naturally infected pigs, whereas sera collected prior to immunization failed to react with the bacteria. These results indicate that CAR bacilli are unlikely to be primary pathogens of pigs or cattle and that rodents do not act as reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aMycoplasma 3atrachea (vertebrates) 3acalves 3arodents 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aBacillusximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aCattle 2aCiliaxmicrobiology 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aGram-Negative Bacterial Infectionsxveterinary 2aGuinea Pigs 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMice 2aRabbits 2aRats 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsximmunologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aSwine 2aTracheaxmicrobiology 2aVaccinationxveterinary 0aisolation1 aFickbohm, Barry L.1 aRogers, Douglas G.1 aFranklin, Craig L.1 aRiley, Lela K.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 11, no. 3 p.252-258dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638799011003083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02542naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002800137245009800165300001600263520147800279592002801757653002301785653003601808653002201844653001801866653002001884653003001904653002101934653002401955700001601979700002601995773010102021856007302122852000902195655001202204IND60131256720221120135909.0151127e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013125672DNAL7 a10.1672/08-70.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutton-Grier, Ariana E.10aOrganic Amendments Improve Soil Conditions and Denitrification in a Restored Riparian Wetland  ap. 343-352.  aLow soil organic matter (SOM) levels can limit nutrient cycling and plant growth in restored wetlands. This study examined how the addition of different amounts of compost at a restoration site in Charlotte, North Carolina, affected the development of soil properties, microbial communities, and plant growth and diversity. The stream and wetland restoration was completed in July 2004 and monitored for three years. Available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) increased with increasing SOM. The microbial community responded to organic matter (OM) additions with increases in both total microbial biomass and microbial activity (as measured by denitrification potential). Plant community responses were less consistent. In 2004, leaf %% N significantly increased with increasing OM for two species (Pontederia cordata and Sagittaria latifolia) while two other species (Acorus calamus and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani) showed no relationship; in 2005, however, there was no relationship for any of the species. We also found no relationship between total plant aboveground biomass and %% SOM measured in 2006. We found negative relationships between species richness and %% SOM in 2004 and 2006, but not in 2005. These results suggest that compost amendments are an effective method for improving soil properties, stimulating microbial communities, and can improve some ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, but may have limited early effects on plant communities.  aPublisher supplied data 0acompost amendments 0adenitrification potential (DEA) 0amicrobial biomass 0aplant biomass 0aplant diversity 0asoil organic matter (SOM) 0aspecies richness 0awetland restoration1 aHo, Mengchi1 aRichardson, Curtis J.0 tWetlands.g2009 Mar., v. 29, no. 1 p.343-352dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F08-70.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245006800178300001400246506002800260520073100288592002801019506003701047650001201084650001401096650001501110650001201125653001901137653003101156653001701187773011501204856008901319852000901408655001201417IND60773841320221207051048.0160726e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077384132DNAL7 a10.21107/agriekonomika.v5i1.12882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaqiqiansyah, Gusti10aAnalisis dinamika kelompok tani nelayan di pesisir kota bontang  ap. 31-40.  aResource is Open Access  a<p>This purpose of research is to assess the level of dynamics farmer group of fishermen at Coastal in Bontang.

Numerical experiments were conducted to investigate how these characteristics control unsaturated zone flow and transport. Hypothetical profiles of inner-lift structure were generated with multiple point statistics and populated with hydraulic parameters of a finer and coarser material. Early arrival of water and solutes at the bottom of the lifts was observed after spring snowmelt. The leaching efficiency, a measure of the proportion of a resident solute that is flushed out of the rock via infiltrating snowmelt or rainfall, was consistently high, but modified by the structure and texture of the lift. Under high rates of net percolation during snowmelt, preferential flow was generated in coarse textured part of the rock, and solutes in the fine textured parts of the rock remained stagnant. Under lower rates of net percolation during the summer and fall, finer materialswere flushed too, and the spatial variability of solute concentration in the lift was reduced. Layering of lifts leads to lower flow rates at depth, minimizing preferential flow and increased leaching of resident solutes. These findings highlight the limited role of large scale connected geometries on focusing flow and transport under dynamic surface net percolation conditions. As such, our findings agree with recent numerical results from soil studies with Gaussian connected geometries as well as recent experimental findings, emphasizing the dominant role of matrix flow and high leaching efficiency in large waste rock dumps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3aleaching 3apreferential flow 3arain 3asnowmelt 3asoil 3asolutes 3aspring 3astatistics 3asummer 3atexture 3awastes 0aUnsaturated preferential flow 0aStochastic pattern generation 0aSolute leaching 0aMine waste rock dumps1 aIreson, Andrew M.1 aBarbour, S.

The processing covering the period 1975–2016 was done with a higher density of points for the Czech and Slovak Republics and a lower density for European regions with more important distribution of potato growing on arable land. The obtained results show an unambiguous statistically significant trend in the increase of minimum temperature by around 0.5°C per 10 years; contrarily, no more significant trends were recorded for air humidity. For precipitation no statistically significant decreases were found at any of the processed localities, increases were rarely detected. Considering the number of days with precipitation, for the western part of the studied territory rather increases, while for the eastern part stagnation, and for Ukraine decrease in days with precipitation were recorded. Trends in the processed characteristics using the index method of late blight indicate a statistically more significant earlier onset of the first treatment especially at Czech localities; however, at most localities a slight increase in the number of infection periods and in the number of days with infection pressure was found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aair 3aarable soils 3aclimate change 3ahumidity 3apotatoes 3atemperature 3aUkraine 0apotato 0aPhytophthora infestans 0aweather 0aEurope1 aHausvater, E.1 aDolezal, P.1 aBastova, P.0 tScientia Agriculturae Bohemica.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 49, no. 3 p.173-180dSciendowJournal:23174x1805-94307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sab-2018-00233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010700167300001600274520196600290592002802256650002602284650002002310650001802330650001302348650003302361650001402394650003702408650002402445650001302469700001902482700002202501700001702523700002802540700002102568700001802589773015902607856008202766852000902848655001202857IND60588834720221120161418.0181123e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058883472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-017-1392-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehmann, René,13aAn alternative approach to overcome shortcomings with multiple testing of binary data in ecotoxicology  ap. 213-222.  aBinary data such as survival, hatching and mortality are assumed to be best described by a binomial distribution. This article provides a simple and straight forward approach for derivation of a no/lowest observed effect level (NOEL/LOEL) in a one-to-many control versus treatments setup. Practically, NOEL and LOEL values can be derived by means of different procedures, e.g. using Fisher’s exact test in coherence with adjusted p values. However, using adjusted p values heavily decreases statistical power. Alternatively, multiple t tests (e.g. Dunnett test procedure) together with arcsin-square-root transformations can be applied in order to account for variance heterogeneity of binomial data. Arcsin-square-root transformation, however, violates normal distribution because transformed data are constrained, while normal distribution provides data in the range [Formula: see text]. Furthermore, results of statistical tests relying on an approximate normal distribution are approximate too. When testing for trends in probabilities of success (probs), the step down Cochran–Armitage trend test (CA) can be applied. The test statistic used is approximately normal. However, if probs approach 0 or 1, normal approximation of the null-distribution is suboptimal. Thus, critical values and p values lack statistical accuracy. We propose applying the closure principle (CP) and Fisher–Freeman–Halton test (FISH). The resulting CPFISH can solve the problems mentioned above. CP is used to overcome [Formula: see text]-inflation while FISH is applied to test for differences in probs between the control and any subset of treatment groups. Its applicability is presented by means of real data sets. Additionally, we performed a simulation study of 81 different setups (differing numbers of control replicates, numbers of treatments etc.), and compared the results of CPFISH to CA allowing us to point out the advantages and disadvantages of the CPFISH.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinomial distribution 3adata collection 3aecotoxicology 3ahatching 3alowest observed effect level 3amortality 3ano observed adverse effect level 3anormal distribution 3avariance1 aBachmann, Jean1 aKaraoglan, Bilgin1 aLacker, Jens1 aPolleichtner, Christian1 aRatte, Hans Toni1 aRatte, Monika0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2018 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.213-222dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-017-1392-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245008200206300001600288520147400304592002801778650001401806650001901820650001701839650001101856650002201867650001701889650001201906650002301918650001401941650001501955650001301970650002401983650001502007650001702022650001202039700001802051773011302069856008102182990002302263852000902286655001202295IND60094115720221118125053.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2010.12.0082doi7 aPMC30398402pmcid7 a212559982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathew, Robin10aAutophagy in tumorigenesis and energy metabolism: friend by day, foe by night  ap. 113-119.  aAutophagy is the mechanism by which cells consume parts of themselves to survive starvation and stress. This self-cannibalization limits cell death and tissue inflammation, recycles energy and biosynthetic substrates and removes damaged proteins and organelles, accumulation of which is toxic. In normal tissues, autophagy-mediated damage mitigation may suppress tumorigenesis, while in advanced tumors macromolecular recycling may support survival by buffering metabolic demand under stress. As a result, autophagy-activation in normal cells may suppress tumorigenesis, while autophagy inhibition may be beneficial for the therapy of established tumors. The mechanisms by which autophagy supports cancer cell metabolism are slowly emerging. As cancer is being increasingly recognized as a metabolic disease, how autophagy-mediated catabolism impacts cellular and mammalian metabolism and tumor growth is of great interest. Most cancer therapeutics induce autophagy, either directly by modulating signaling pathways that control autophagy in the case of many targeted therapies, or indirectly in the case of cytotoxic therapy. However, the functional consequence of autophagy induction in the context of cancer therapy is not yet clear. A better understanding of how autophagy modulates cell metabolism under various cellular stresses and the consequences of this on tumorigenesis will help develop better therapeutic strategies against cancer prevention and treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautophagy 3acarcinogenesis 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3ainflammation 3amammals 3ametabolic diseases 3aneoplasms 3aorganelles 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3astarvation 3atherapeutics 3atissues1 aWhite, Eileen0 tCurrent Opinion in Genetics & Development.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.113-119dElsevier Ltdx0959-437X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2010.12.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01267naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245007600153300001800229520031900247592002800566650002300594650002300617650000900640650001900649650001500668650002500683700001200708700001500720773013400735856007500869852000900944655001200953IND60658992420221123005547.0190826e20110719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899242DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12027a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Gang10aNanoparticle-coated PDMS elastomers for enhancement of Raman scattering  ap. 8560-8562.  aA simple but efficient method for highly sensitive Raman detection, covering a thin polydimethylsiloxane elastomer, pre-coated with a layer of Au or Ag nanoparticles, onto the detected substrate, is proposed.

Hydroxycinnamic acids, several characteristic anthrones and chromones, the phenolic dimer feralolide and flavonoids such as flavones and isoflavones were identified. The stable radical DPPH test and the ORAC assay were then used to determine the in vitro radical scavenging. The outer green rind was the most active, while the inner parenchyma was much less effective. The 5-methylchromones aloesin, aloeresin A and aloesone were the most active among the pure secondary metabolites tested. The results suggest that several compounds are likely to contribute to the overall radical scavenging activity, and indicate that leaf portion must be taken into account when the plant is used for its antioxidant properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe arborescens 3aAloe vera 3aantioxidant activity 3acolorimetry 3acoumaric acids 3aflavones 3afree radical scavengers 3aisoflavones 3aleaves 3amass spectrometry 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3asecondary metabolites 0aMetabolic profiling 0aAnthrones 0aChromones 0aPhenylpropanoids 0aORAC 0aAntioxidants 0aAloin (PubChem CID: 12305761) 0aAloe-emodin (PubChem CID: 10207) 0aAloesin (PubChem CID: 160190) 0aAloeresin A (PubChem CID: 5317657) 0aAloesone (PubChem CID: 5317700) 0aAloenin (PubChem CID: 16230)1 aPellizzoni, Marco1 aPellegrino, Roberto1 aMolinari, Gian Pietro1 aColla, Giuseppe0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 170 p.501-507dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.08.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04464naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002200167245005500189300001600244500000900260520286500269592002803134650002503162650001703187650001803204650001903222650001303241650001303254650002103267650001303288650001303301650001203314650001303326650001803339650001503357650001003372650001403382650001203396650001503408650000903423650000903432650002603441650000903467650002003476650002403496650001103520650001403531650001703545650001003562651002903572700002203601700002203623773012303645852000903768856009703777655001203874991594294300742620221116224924.0191122e197709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7791110612DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1977.00021962006900050007x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarvey, Robert G.10aGiant Foxtail and Velvetleaf Control in Sweet Corn  ap. 761-764.  aepub  aVelvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.) and giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm.) are among the most serious weed problems in sweet corn (Zea mays L.) grown in the north central U.S. While several herbicide treatments have been used to partially control these weeds, the treatments frequently leave soil residues which can injure susceptible crops commonly grown in rotation with sweet corn. Consequently, studies were conducted over a 3-year period on fields (Plano silt loam, 3.5 to 4% organic matter, Typic Argindoll fine silty mixed mesic) heavily infested with velvetleaf and giant foxtail to compare the effectiveness of 10 herbicides applied alone and in 36 combinations in controlling these weeds. Visual observations of sweet corn injury and weed control were obtained and the sweet corn was harvested to determine the effects on yields. Oats (cv. ‘Lodi’) and peas (cv. ‘NK-692’), which commonly follow sweet corn in a crop rotation and which are susceptible to residues of common herbicides, were grown over the plot areas the year following sweet corn and evaluated for carryover injury. Of the herbicide treatments included in the study, the best overall weed control and the largest average sweet corn yields were produced by a sequential application of 2.2 kg/ha alachlor [2-chloro-2',6'-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl) acetanilide] applied premergence and 1.1 kg/ha bentazon [3-isopropyl-1H-2,1,3-benzo-thiadiazin-(4)3H-one 2,2-dioxide] applied postemergence and by a preemergence combination of 2.2 kg/ha alachlor and 0.6 kg/ha metribuzin [4-amino-6-tert-butyl-3-(methylthio)-as-triazin-5 (4H) one]. Preplant incorporated combinations of butylate (S-ethyl diisobutylthiocarbamate) with atrazine [2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6-(isopropylamino)-s-triazine] or cyanazine [2-([4-chloro-6-(ethylamino)-s-triazin-2-yl] amino)-2-methyl-propionitrile] and preemergence combinations of alachlor with atrazine or cyanazine provided good weed control and satisfactory yields in 2 of the 3 test years. Three-way combinations of atrazine, cyanazine, and butylate, as well as preemergence combinations of alachlor with bifenox (methyl 5-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-2-nitrobenzoate) dicamba (3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid) and a preemergence and postemergence split treatment of cyanazine also showed promise. Preemergence treatments failed to control velvetleaf adquately in 1973 when insufficient rainfall was received, but preplant-incorporated treatments failed similarly in 1974 following excessive rainfall. Postemergence treatments were typically best for controlling velvetleaf hut did not satisfactorily control giant foxtail. The only injury to oats (Avena sativa L.) or peas (Pisum sativum L.) from soil residues persisting until the spring following sweet corn, occurred from atrazine applied at 3.4 kg/ha preplant-incorporated in combination with butylate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3aAvena sativa 3aPisum sativum 3aSetaria faberi 3aZea mays 3aalachlor 3aapplication rate 3aatrazine 3abentazon 3abifenox 3abutylate 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3acrops 3acyanazine 3adicamba 3ametribuzin 3aoats 3apeas 3apesticide application 3arain 3asilt loam soils 3asoil organic matter 3aspring 3asweetcorn 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aMidwestern United States1 aAndrew, Robert H.1 aRuscoe, Alfred W.0 tAgronomy journal.g1977 Sept., v. 69, no. 5 p.761-764dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1977.00021962006900050007x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01468naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011200161300001800273520036500291592002800656650002100684650002300705650001700728700002300745700002100768700002400789700002700813700002200840700002200862700002800884773013400912856007501046852000901121655001201130IND60658992720221119002833.0190827e20110726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899272DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12033f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jin-Young,10aCapsulation of carbon nanotubes on top of colloidally templated and electropolymerized polythiophene arrays  ap. 8871-8873.  aWe describe the capsulation of colloidally templated polythiophene (P3-TAA) arrays with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) after colloidal template electropolymerization.

Because of the high yield of aromatic mixtures in bio-oil, they carry great potential for fuel efficiency. Nevertheless, due to its high viscosity, abundance of acid, and heteroatom contaminants, the bio-oil ought to be upgraded and hydrotreated in order to be applied as an alternative fuel. A continuous low H₂ pressure HDO of bio-oil is favored as it could be simply integrated with conventional pyrolysis systems, functioning at low pressures, as well as supporting a flexible plan for serial processing in respective bio-refineries. Additionally, such a process is cheaper and safer in comparison with the high pressure set ups. This review meticulously elaborates on the operation conditions, challenges, and opportunities for using this process in an industrial scale. The operating temperature, the H₂ flow ratio, the active site, and the catalyst stability are some important factors to be considered when it is intended to reach a high conversion efficiency for the HDO in low H₂ pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aalternative fuels 3abiofuels 3abiorefining 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aLow pressure/atmospheric H2 hydrodeoxygenation 0aFast pyrolysis oil 0aBio oil upgrading 0aGuaiacol 0aPhenolic compounds1 aAbnisa, Faisal1 aWan Daud, Wan Mohd Ashri1 aAroua, Mohamed Kheireddine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9388-54390 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2018 Aug., v. 133 p.117-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2018.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245009600204300001600300520165700316592002801973596005102001596004502052596006802097650001702165650001202182650001602194650001102210650001802221650001502239650001302254700002902267700001502296773015902311856008202470852000902552655001202561IND60588835420221121223603.0181123e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058883542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-017-1442-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Dongjun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3863-840810aConditional bias-penalized Kalman filter for improved estimation and prediction of extremes  ap. 183-201.  aKalman filter (KF) and its variants are widely used for real-time state updating and prediction in environmental science and engineering. Whereas in many applications the most important performance criterion may be the fraction of the times when the filter performs satisfactorily under different conditions, in many other applications estimation and prediction specifically of extremes, such as floods, droughts, algal blooms, etc., may be of primary importance. Because KF is essentially a least squares solution, it is subject to conditional biases (CB) which arise from the error-in-variable, or attenuation, effects when the model dynamics are highly uncertain, the observations have large errors and/or the system being modeled is not very predictable. In this work, we describe conditional bias-penalized KF, or CBPKF, based on CB-penalized linear estimation which minimizes a weighted sum of error variance and expectation of Type-II CB squared and comparatively evaluate with KF through a set of synthetic experiments for one-dimensional state estimation under the idealized conditions of normality and linearity. The results show that CBPKF reduces root mean square error (RMSE) over KF by 10–20% or more over the tails of the distribution of the true state. In the unconditional sense CBPKF performs comparably to KF for nonstationary cases in that CBPKF increases RMSE over all ranges of the true state only up to 3%. With the ability to reduce CB explicitly, CBPKF provides a significant new addition to the existing suite of filtering techniques for improved analysis and prediction of extreme states of uncertain environmental systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aCyberSEES-1442735cNational Science Foundation  aIIP-1237767cNational Science Foundation  aNA16OAR4590232cNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3aalgal blooms 3adrought 3aengineering 3afloods 3aleast squares 3aprediction 3avariance1 aSaifuddin, Miah Mohammad1 aLee, Haksu0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2018 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.183-201dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-017-1442-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01612naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245010800174300001400282520073900296592002801035650001901063650002701082650001301109650001601122773011601138856008301254852000901337655001201346IND60094116320221118131355.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2010.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGradzielski, Michael14aThe rheology of vesicle and disk systems — Relations between macroscopic behaviour and microstructure  ap. 13-17.  aThe presence of amphiphilic bilayers in the form of vesicles and disks typically has a profound effect on the rheology of the corresponding surfactant solutions. For instance such aggregates often show pronounced effects of shear thinning. These effects not only depend on the type of structure present, such as uni- or multilamellar vesicles, but in addition become more complicated due to the fact that shear may largely affect the structures present and thereby the rheological behaviour may depend to a large extent on the shear history of the given system.

This method is significantly affected by the addition of sodium carbonate. The currently applied Folin–Ciocalteu methods may have been modified without any validation in the quantitative standards and the order of processes. In this study, serial experiments were performed to investigate the effect of phenolic calibrations based on the classic Folin–Ciocalteu method. Esterification condensations were observed in the assays with prior basification for gallic acid and catechin used as quantitative standards. The phenolic contents obtained in the samples differed depending on when basification occurred compared with the gallic acid calibration. The bias of the classic Folin–Ciocalteu method derived from cross-linkage of molecules was first defined in this study. The performance of the Folin–Ciocalteu method is optimised and validated again.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatechin 3acrosslinking 3aesterification 3agallic acid 3aphenols 3aquantitative analysis 3asodium carbonate 0aPolyphenols 0aMolybdate 0aPhotometry 0aAlkaline reduction 0aEsterification1 aCheng, Chien-Wei1 aLiang, Ji-Yuan0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 170 p.10-15dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02084naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245006800174300001600242520087300258592002801131650003401159650001301193650001301206650001301219650001701232653002301249653000801272653002801280653001401308653002201322653000801344653002701352653001301379700001901392700002401411700002101435773012601456856008301582852000901665655001201674IND60601575520181023000000.0180706e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2014.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesport, Jean-Claude10aActivité physique lors de la sclérose latérale amyotrophique  ap. 321-326.  aFor a long time, an intense physical activity has been suspected to be a risk factor for developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, the patients would like to know if their disease may be worsened by physical activity, but also if physical activity may be useful against spasticity, and if creatine, a nitrogenous compound occurring in the first anaerobic phase of exercise may have an interest. Animal studies suggest a global favourable effect of moderate exercise, but these data cannot be strictly applied in humans. Human studies show that an intense physical activity like football or American football might be a risk factor for developing ALS. Studies are not enough powerful to indicate an interest of exercise after the onset of the disease. Physical activity does not improve the spasticity, and creatine seems not to be effective during ALS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3acreatine 3aexercise 3apatients 3arisk factors 0aActivité physique 0aSLA 0aMaladie neuromusculaire 0aCréatine 0aPhysical activity 0aALS 0aNeuromuscular disorder 0aCreatine1 aJésus, Pierre1 aFayemendy, Philippe1 aPouchard, Lucile0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2014 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.321-326dElsevier SASwJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2014.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01613naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245004400181300001300225520083300238592002801071650001601099650002601115650001101141773011501152856008301267852000901350655001201359IND60094116620221118131330.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cocis.2010.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarthès-Biesel, Dominique,10aModeling the motion of capsules in flow  ap. 3-12.  aThis review presents the mechanical behavior of a capsule under the influence of viscous deforming forces due to a flowing fluid. We focus on artificial capsules that are initially spherical with an internal liquid core and that are enclosed by a very thin hyperelastic membrane with different constitutive laws. The recent modeling strategies are outlined together with their respective advantages and limitations. We then consider the motion and deformation of a single initially spherical capsule freely suspended in a simple shear or plane hyperbolic flow and discuss the effect of the membrane constitutive law, of initial pre-stress and of membrane buckling under compression. We then consider the flow of spherical capsules in small pores and show how it can be used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3amechanical properties 3amodels0 tCurrent opinion in colloid & interface science.g2011 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.3-12dElsevier Ltdx1359-02947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2010.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01908naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245014200163300001600305520074200321592002801063650002201091650001601113650001401129650001101143650001301154650001601167651001201183653002401195653001501219653001701234653001701251653001401268653001301282653001401295653001401309773010001323856007801423852000901501655001201510IND60614570920221123004938.0181002e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061457092DNAL7 a10.2478/vzoo-2018-00302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhytova, E.

We formulated a model to predict stomatal conductance (gₛ), consistent with the maximum energy circulation concept of Lotka and Odum, by maximizing the sucrose flux out of photosynthesizing leaves. The proposed modeling approach recovers all prior results derived from stomatal optimization theories and profit-maximization arguments for the xylem hydraulic system aimed at predicting gₛ. The novel features of this approach are its ability to 1) predict the price of losing water in carbon units using xylem and phloem properties (i.e., the marginal water use efficiency) and 2) explain why water molecules become more expensive to exchange for CO₂ molecules when soil moisture becomes limiting or when plants acclimate to new elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentration. On short time-scales (sub-daily), predicted gₛ under many environmental stimuli were consistent with measurements reported in the literature, including a general sensitivity of gₛ to vapor pressure deficit and leaf water potential. During progressive droughts, differences in the coordination among the leaf, xylem, and phloem functioning determine the isohydric-to-anisohydric behavior among plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3adrought 3aliquids 3acarbon 3aprofit maximization 3avapor pressure 3aroots 3acarbon dioxide 3astomatal conductance 3aenergy 3asucrose 3amodels 3aleaf water potential 3aphloem 3asoil water 3axylem 3awater resources 3aprediction 3aprices 3awater use efficiency 3astomata 0aAcclimation 0aIsohydric-to-anisohydric behavior 0aMarginal water use efficiency 0aPhloem 0aStomatal response 0aXylem1 aDomec, Jean-Christophe1 aPalmroth, Sari1 aPockman, William T.1 aLitvak, Marcy E.1 aKatul, Gabriel G.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2018 Sept., v. 119 p.1-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007100169300001600240520146300256592002801719650001401747650001301761650002301774650002001797650002401817650001401841650001301855650001801868650001701886650001501903650001701918650001401935650001401949650001201963650002401975650001301999650001802012650002002030650001702050653001302067653002002080653001602100653001802116653002402134653001302158653001902171653001402190653001702204653002402221700002002245700001602265773012602281856008302407852000902490655001202499IND60601575920181023000000.0180706e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2014.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThibault, Ronan10aActivité physique, nutrition, et insuffisance cardiaque chronique  ap. 327-335.  aChronic heart failure (CHF) is a highly prevalent syndrome and a burden for public health. Malnutrition, including its most severe form, cardiac cachexia, is an independent factor of mortality and morbidity. During the course of CHF, there is a loss of muscle mass and an impaired oxidative capacity of muscular mitochondria, together with a shift of type I oxidative to type II non-oxidative muscular fibers. These muscle changes are multifactorial, and result in physical exercise deconditioning. In CHF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise training (ET) is well tolerated and improves exercise capacity, quality of life, and cardiovascular-related mortality. ET integrated into a global cardiac rehabilitation program is recommended by academic societies for CHF therapy. Cardiac rehabilitation centres offer ET programs combined with therapeutic education. In CHF-related malnutrition, ET or nutrition support alone, although insufficiently documented, seems to be ineffective. Specific care programs of multimodal rehabilitation enclosing ET, oral nutritional supplements, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and anabolizing androgens, could improve exercise capacity and clinical outcome in undernourished patients with moderate to severe CHF. The clinical trial NUTRICARD (ClinicalTrial.gov NCT #01864733) supported in part by the French Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (SFNEP) is currently testing this hypothesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrogens 3acachexia 3aclinical nutrition 3aclinical trials 3adietary supplements 3aeducation 3aexercise 3aheart failure 3amalnutrition 3ametabolism 3amitochondria 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amuscles 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apatients 3apublic health 3aquality of life 3atherapeutics 0aCachexie 0aRéhabilitation 0aAndrogènes 0aTestostérone 0aAcides gras oméga3 0aCachexia 0aRehabilitation 0aAndrogens 0aTestosterone 0aOmega-3 fatty acids1 aMeyer, Philippe1 aCano, Noël0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2014 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.327-335dElsevier SASwJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2014.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03988naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100002400170245012700194300001400321500001500335520188500350592002802235650001602263650001802279650001202297650001602309650001502325650001302340650001502353650001702368650001402385650002502399650001302424650001702437650002002454650002202474650002002496650002102516650002602537650002402563650001102587650003002598650001202628650002502640650003402665650005802699650001102757650006202768650007302830650003202903650001702935651002002952651003502972653000903007700002503016700003003041700002103071700002203092773010403114856008703218852000903305655001203314IND4457669820221116190137.0141112e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445766982DNAL7 a214819612pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFirestone, Simon M.12aA case-control study of risk factors for equine influenza spread onto horse premises during the 2007 epidemic in Australia  ap. 53-63.  a2019-12-05  aThe 2007 epidemic of equine influenza in Australia provided an opportunity to investigate the effectiveness of on-farm biosecurity measures in preventing the spread of a novel pathogen in a largely naive population. We conducted a case-control study of 200 horse premises from highly affected regions of the state of New South Wales (NSW), to investigate risk factors for the spread of equine influenza onto horse premises, specifically, non-compliance with biosecurity measures recommended to horse owners by the relevant animal health authority, the NSW Department of Primary Industries. The study was restricted to cases occurring during the first seven weeks of the epidemic, a period prior to vaccination and the relaxation of some movement restrictions. Case and control premises were selected from a laboratory testing dataset and interviews were conducted with horse owners and managers on premises between July and November 2009. The proximity of premises to the nearest infected premises was the factor most strongly associated with case status. Case premises were more likely than control premises to be within 5km and beyond 10km of an infected premises. Having a footbath in place on the premises before any horses were infected was associated with a nearly four-fold reduction in odds of infection (odds ratio=0.27; 95% confidence interval: 0.09, 0.83). This protective association may have reflected overall premises biosecurity standards related to the fomite transmission of equine influenza. Compliance with certain on-farm biosecurity practices seemingly prevented horses on premises in high risk areas being infected with equine influenza during the 2007 outbreak in Australia. In future outbreaks, in addition to broader disease control measures, on-farm biosecurity practices should be adopted by horse owners and managers to prevent equine influenza spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosecurity 3aanimal health 3afomites 3avaccination 3acompliance 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3acase studies 3apathogens 3acase-control studies 3amanagers 3arisk factors 3adisease control 3adisease outbreaks 3acontrol methods 3aequine influenza 3alaboratory techniques 3aconfidence interval 3ahorses 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aHorse Diseasesxepidemiologyxtransmissionxvirology. 2aHorses 2aInfluenza A Virus, H3N8 Subtypexisolation & purification 2aOrthomyxoviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 3aNew South Wales 0aNew South Walesxepidemiology. 0arisk1 aSchemann, Kathrin A.1 aToribio, Jenny-Ann L.M.L.1 aWard, Michael P.1 aDhand, Navneet K.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2011 June 1, v. 100, no. 1 p.53-63dElsevier B.V.x0167-58777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245009400153300001600247500002400263520145000287650001201737650001301749650001001762650000901772650000901781650001401790650001101804650001001815650001001825650001301835650003301848700002201881700001901903700002201922700002201944773013801966852000902104856007502113655001202188IND4459641820221120194831.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445964182DNAL7 a10.1603/AN101802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoyal, Gaurav10aComparative Morphology of the Immature Stages of Three Corn-Infesting Ulidiidae (Diptera)  ap. 416-428.  aIncludes references  aSeveral species of Ulidiidae (Diptera) are primary pests of maize (Zea mays L.). The ability to distinguish their immature stages would be useful for biological studies where their distributions overlap. Morphology of the immature stages was examined for three Ulidiidae that attack maíze in the southeastern United States: Chaetopsis massyla (Walker), Euxesta eluta Loew, and Euxesta stigmatias Loew. Egg, larval, and pupal characters were measured and described with the aid of light and scanning electron microscopy. Because of considerable overlap in character states, only a few traits in each stage could be used to separate these three species. C. massyla eggs had pores restricted to the posterior end, but the pores were evenly distributed in the two Euxesta species. Eggs of the two Euxesta species could not be differentiated. Larval mouth hooks of C. massyla had a distinct tooth on their ventral surface, whereas this tooth was lacking in E. eluta and E. stigmatias. Fewer oral ridges were observed on C. massyla larvae than on E. eluta or E. stigmatias. Posterior spiracular slits were apparent in E. stigmatias versus obscure in E. eluta larvae. The length and spinule arrangements on creeping welts could be used to separate E. eluta and E. stigmatias larvae. Posterior spiracular plates of C. massyla puparia were trapezoidal versus ovoid in the two Euxesta species. Puparium color varied significantly among the three species. 3aEuxesta 3aZea mays 3acolor 3acorn 3aeggs 3aimmatures 3alarvae 3amouth 3apests 3apuparium 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aNuessly, Gregg S.1 aSteck, Gary J.1 aCapinera, John L.1 aSeal, Dakshina R.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2011 May, v. 104, no. 3 p.416-428dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN101803Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02542naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245011500210500002200325520138600347592002801733653002301761653002201784653003101806653003601837653000801873653000901881700001401890700001801904700002001922700002201942700001701964700001801981773006601999856008202065852000902147655001202156IND60558728820221119031022.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055872882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nicl.2016.11.0072doi7 aPMC51336482pmcid7 a279424522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shang-Ran10aCAG repeat length does not associate with the rate of cerebellar degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3  aPre-press version  aThis cross-sectional study investigated the correlation between the CAG repeat length and the degeneration of cerebellum in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) patients based on neuroimaging approaches. Forty SCA3 patients were recruited and classified into two subgroups according to their CAG repeat lengths (≥74 and <74). We measured each patient's Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratios based on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and 3-dimensional fractal dimension (3D–FD) values derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. Furthermore, the 3D–FD values were used to construct structural covariance networks based on graph theoretical analysis. The results revealed that SCA3 patients with a longer CAG repeat length demonstrated earlier disease onset. However, the CAG repeat length did not significantly correlate with their SARA scores, cerebellar NAA/Cr ratios or cerebellar 3D–FD values. Network dissociation between cerebellar regions and parietal-occipital regions was found in SCA3 patients with CAG≥74, but not in those with CAG<74. In conclusion, the CAG repeat length is uncorrelated with the change of SARA score, cerebellar function and cerebellar structure in SCA3. Nevertheless, a longer CAG repeat length may indicate early structural covariance network dissociation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBrain connectivity 0aFractal dimension 0aMagnetic resonance imaging 0aMagnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aNAA 0aSCA31 aWu, Yu-Te1 aJao, Chii-Wen1 aSoong, Bing-Wen1 aLirng, Jiing-Feng1 aWu, Hsiu-Mei1 aWang, Po-Shan0 tNeuroImage: Clinical.g2016, dElsevier Inc.x2213-15827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2016.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001700135245015400152300001600306500002400322500001500346520079200361650002301153650001601176650001101192650002401203650002701227650001301254650001501267650002701282650002601309650001001335650001101345650001401356653001401370700002201384700002001406700002201426700002001448700002201468773013801490852000901628856007501637655001201712IND4459641920221120194749.0110703s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445964192DNAL7 a10.1603/AN100452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Vijay10aComparison of In Vivo Host Animals as Blood-Feeding Source for Laboratory Rearing of the Sandfly Vector Phlebotomus argentipes (Diptera: Psychodidae)  ap. 429-433.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar is transmitted by parasite-infected sandflies.

By combining heterodyne-detected vibrational sum frequency generation (HD-VSFG) with differential spectroscopy involving simultaneous curve fitting (DS-SCF) analysis, we retrieve electrolyte (Na₂CO₃ and NaF)-correlated OH-stretch spectra of water at the air/water interface. Vibrational mapping of the perturbed interfacial water with the hydration shell spectra (obtained by DS-SCF analysis of Raman spectra) of the corresponding anion discloses that the kosmotropic electrolytes do not form well-defined EDL at the air/water interface. Instead, the interfacial water forms a stronger hydrogen-bond with the surface-expelled anions (CO₃²– and F–) and becomes more inhomogeneous than the pristine air/water interface. Together, the results reveal that the perturbation of interfacial water by the kosmotropic electrolyte is a “local phenomenon” confined within the hydration shell of the surface-expelled anion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3ahydrogen bonding 3areaction kinetics1 aMondal, Jahur Alam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6536-787X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Apr. 20, v. 125, no. 16 p.3977-3985dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c110243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01579naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245010700199500002000306520053400326592002800860650001100888650002100899650000900920650002100929650001600950650001600966700001900982700005901001773012101060856007501181852000901256655001201265IND60789271420221116212519.0220819e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078927142DNAL7 a10.1002/vzj2.201712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedweik, Henrik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4425-131412aA combined flow cell–respiration box to quantify carbon transformation processes in undisturbed soil  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new experimental laboratory design is introduced to analyze and quantify transport and turnover processes in top‐ and subsoils.

At this stage, researchers mainly employed commercial MPs (CMPs) as the model particles to explore the toxic effects of MPs. But whether CMPs can reflect the effects of realistic MPs (RMPs) still remains unknown. Herein, the effects of commercial and realistic polystyrene MPs on gut microbiota of zebrafish were compared. Considering MPs co-exist with antibiotics in real environment, we further distinguished the effects of CMPs and RMPs when they co-existed with enrofloxacin (ENR). The results revealed that while both CMPs and RMPs significantly shifted the gut microbiota, CMPs exhibited stronger toxic effects and more severe damage to gut. Furthermore, ENR exhibited a distinct effect with both CMPs and RMPs on gut microbiota, while the addition of CMPs and RMPs significantly alleviated the toxicity of ENR. In addition, analysis via Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database revealed that seven major level 1 pathways associated with metabolism, information processing and diseases in the microbial community were affected. Taken together, this work is the first to report that CMPs could not represent RMPs in terms of toxicity and other behaviors, reminding people the limits of using CMPs in ecotoxicology studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3adatabases 3adigestive system 3aecotoxicology 3aenrofloxacin 3ahistopathology 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amicroplastics 3apollutants 3apolystyrenes 3atoxicity 0aRealistic microplastics 0aEnrofloxacin 0aCombined exposure 0aGut microbiome 0aHistological analysis1 aLv, Min1 aLi, Jinhua1 aDing, Jing1 aWang, Yunqing1 aFu, Longwen1 aSun, Xiyan1 aHan, Xiaoyue1 aChen, Lingxin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 15, v. 434 p.128874-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245005000154300001600204500001400220520169700234592002801931650000801959650001501967650001201982650001601994650001902010650002402029650001302053650002902066650001102095650001502106650000902121650002502130653001102155700001602166700001402182700001502196773009502211856007202306852000902378655001202387IND60689975920221119225129.0200424e20091030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068997592DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.99782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Juan10aTargeted engineering of the Drosophila genome  ap. 274-277.  aNAL-light  aThe application of phiC31 phage integrase in Drosophila for unidirectional and site-specific DNA integration was pioneered by Groth et al. in 2004 1 and quickly triggered a wave of innovative tools taking advantage of these unique properties of phiC31. Three recent papers have further developed novel approaches that combine the phiC31-mediated DNA integration with the homologous recombination (HR)-based gene targeting 2 3 for the purpose of efficient and targeted modifications of Drosophila genomic loci. Despite significant differences, the general strategies are similar in principle in the SIRT (site-specific integrase mediated repeated targeting) approach by Gao et al. 4, the IMAGO (integrase-mediated approach for gene knock-out) approach by Choi et al. 5 and the genomic engineering approach developed by our group 6. All three use HR-based gene targeting to first implant a single or a pair of phiC31-attP recombination sites into the target locus. Flies carrying such targeted insertions of attP sites can then be used as "founder lines", in which modified DNA sequences ("knock-in DNA") can be repeatedly and efficiently inserted back into the target locus via phiC31-mediated integration. Thus, by carrying out the targeting experiments only once, one can then directedly and efficiently modify the target locus into virtually any desired knock-in allele. Here we give a brief overview of the SIRT, IMAGO, and genomic engineering approaches and propose a revised genomic engineering scheme in which a single ends-out targeting event will generate founder lines suitable for both recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) and single-site based integration of knock-in DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3aalleles 3aengineering 3agene targeting 3agenetic engineering 3agenomics 3ahomologous recombination 3aimagos 3aintegrases 3aloci 3anucleotide sequences 0aphages1 aZhou, Wenke1 aDong, Wei1 aHong, Yang0 tFly.g2009 Oct. 30, v. 3, no. 4 p.274-277dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.99783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03789naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015000170506010400320506007600424520214000500592002802640506003702668650001602705650001202721650001702733650001502750650001502765650001402780650002602794650001902820650000902839653002702848653002302875653002802898653002602926653002402952653000902976700002102985700001303006700001803019700001503037700001303052700001403065773011903079856008803198852000903286655001203295IND60783352520221207102047.0220906e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078335252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Zhuorui10aMechanism of the effect of vertically propagating internal gravity waves on turbulence barrier and pollutant diffusion during heavy haze episodes  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring heavy haze episodes, especially the cumulative stage (CS) of pollutants, strong turbulence intermittency and the resulting turbulence barrier effect (i.e., a phenomenon that turbulence at certain heights may disappear forming a laminar flow as if there is a barrier layer impeding the vertical turbulent exchange) suppress the vertical diffusion of pollutants, leading to high PM₂.₅ concentrations. However, there are still some short-time removal processes of pollutants occurring at different heights in the CS, accompanied with interesting non-simultaneous drop or opposite variation of PM₂.₅ concentrations at different heights. The ubiquitous internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the stable boundary layer (SBL) may play a critical role in the above situation, as they are closely related to the intermittent turbulence bursts appearing in the persistent weak turbulent motions. In this study, two representative heavy haze pollution cases were chosen to demonstrate the above speculation using five layers of turbulence data, two layers of pressure fluctuations and three layers of PM₂.₅ concentrations. Results showed that the non-simultaneous drop or opposite variation of PM₂.₅ concentrations was associated with the destruction of turbulence barrier by the vertical propagation of IGWs. IGWs generated by some certain mechanisms, such as nonhomogeneous terrain and wind shear around the low-level jet (LLJ), can propagate upward or downward with the upward or downward development of the temperature inversion layer. The vertically propagating IGWs then triggered intermittent increasing turbulence layer by layer. Turbulence between layers reconnected sequentially and turbulence barriers were broken in turn. The enhanced turbulent exchange expedited the pollutant diffusion, thus the PM₂.₅ concentrations at different heights varied non-simultaneously even inversely. This study provides a good explanation for the positive effects of sub-mesoscale motions such as IGWs on triggering intermittent increasing turbulence and facilitating the diffusion of pollutants during heavy haze pollution events.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aenvironment 3agravity 3alaminar flow 3alandscapes 3apollutants 3apollution 3atemperature inversion 3aturbulent flow 3awind 0aInternal gravity waves 0aTurbulence barrier 0aIntermittent turbulence 0aPressure fluctuations 0aPollutant diffusion 0aHaze1 aZhang, Hongsheng1 aWei, Wei1 aZhang, Xiaoye1 aCai, Xuhui1 aSong, Yu1 aZhu, Tong0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 845 p.157349-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001700164245009800181300001400279500001500293520118500308592002801493650002301521650001601544650001501560650002301575650001201598650000801610650001501618650001201633650003401645650001101679650001401690650001201704650006101716650001101777650002501788650005801813650003101871653003201902653001401934700001801948700001601966700001701982773013001999852000902129856008302138961001302221655001202234IND2199787120221119001413.0181016e199801  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219978712DNAL7 a95268562pmid7 a10.1177/1040638798010001052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrock, K.

To evaluate over time the ability to detect BVDV by virus isolation from serum or white blood cell preparations, 4 persistently infected calves were monitored from birth until 70 days of age. In 3 of 4 persistently infected calves, virus isolation from serum and white blood cells was negative until approximately 42 days of age, when colostral antibody had declined. The level of viremia in 7 adult (>12 months) persistently infected animals decreased by 1 10-fold dilution over at least a 2-year period. The level of viremia became undetectable by virus isolation from serum in 1 of the 7 animals examined. This decline was associated with the development of virus neutralizing antibody. Although the level of viremia is fairly stable within persistently infected animals, the presence of specific neutralizing antibody may affect the ability to isolate BVDV. These findings are important when considering diagnostic testing to identify persistently infected animals by virus isolation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolostral immunity 3ablood serum 3aantibodies 3aantibody detection 3aviremia 3aage 3aleukocytes 3aviruses 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3acalves 3adetection 2aAnimals 2aBovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Diseasexbloodxdiagnosis. 2aCattle 2aNeutralization Tests 2aPestivirusxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aViremiaxbloodxdiagnosis. 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aisolation1 aGrooms, D.

The possibility to genetically modify micro-organisms to bring immunogenic material (antigens/epitopes) to the human (or animal) immune system to provoke an immune response, provides new hope to producing prophylactic vaccines against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis and emerging diseases. Regulatory requirements associated with the development of genetically-modified organism (GMO)-containing vaccines in Europe add an additional burden to the clinical trial application procedure and to the preparation and initiation of a clinical trial of such vaccines. Moreover, the GMO regulatory framework is complex and only partially harmonised across Europe, which may hamper multi-country clinical trials with GMO-containing vaccines. This paper provides an overview of clinical trial applications with GMO-containing vaccines in Europe and reviews the regulatory framework in countries where GMO-containing vaccine clinical trial authorisation (CTA) applications were submitted between 2004 and 2017.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aclinical trials 3aemerging diseases 3aepitopes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3amalaria 3amicroorganisms 3atuberculosis 3avaccines 3aEurope 0aGenetically modified organism 0aGMO 0aVaccines 0aVector-based vaccines 0aRegulation 0aClinical trials, contained use 0aDeliberate release1 aDamme, Pierre van,1 aLeroux-Roels, Geert1 aVandermeulen, Corinne1 aBerthels, Nele1 aBeuneu, Claire1 aMali, Stéphanie0 tVaccine.g2019 Sept. 30, v. 37, no. 42 p.6144-6153dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014600172520104700318592002801365650001501393650002801408650001501436650002101451650001501472650000901487650001801496650001701514653000801531653000801539653001001547653000701557653000701564653000701571653000801578653000701586653003901593653001801632653002301650653000901673653002301682773011401705856008601819852000901905655001201914IND60773127220221121072108.0220523e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeña, Aránzazu12aA comprehensive review of recent research concerning the role of low molecular weight organic acids on the fate of organic pollutants in soil  aPlants exude through the roots different compounds, including, among others, low-molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs), with a relevant effect on multiple metabolic activities. Numerous studies have revealed their role in improving soil mineral acquisition and tolerance against inorganic pollutants. However, less information is available on how they may alter the fate of organic pollutants in soil, which may cause environmental problems, compromise soil quality and have a detrimental effect on animal and human health. This review intends to cover recent studies (from 2015 onwards) and provide up-to-date information on how LMWOAs influence environmental key processes of organic pollutants in soil, like adsorption/desorption, degradation and transport, without forgetting plant uptake, with obvious environmental and health repercussions. Critical knowledge gaps and future research needs are also discussed, because understanding these processes will help searching effective strategies for pollutant reduction and control in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanimal and human health 3adesorption 3amolecular weight 3apollutants 3asoil 3asoil minerals 3asoil quality 0aDOC 0aDOM 0aLMWOA 0aMW 0aOC 0aOM 0aPAH 0aRE 0aLow molecular weight organic acids 0aRoot exudates 0aOrganic pollutants 0aSoil 0aEnvironmental fate0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 15, v. 434 p.128875-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02918naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006400158300001800222520150200240592002801742650002001770650002801790650001901818650001001837650001401847650001001861650001401871650001501885650001701900650002201917650002101939650001401960650001401974650002701988650001302015650002802028650002102056650001702077650001802094650001002112650001502122650001102137650001402148650000902162700002002171773012602191856007402317852000902391655001202400IND60676287520221121173954.0191114e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067628752DNAL7 a10.1039/c9fo00749k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Fang-Chun10aEffects of diosgenin and its derivatives on atherosclerosis  ap. 7022-7036.  aAtherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of death in patients with cardiovascular diseases worldwide. Although some progress has been made in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases still continue to rise. At present, it is an important topic for researchers to develop safe and effective drugs from natural products to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases. Diosgenin (DSG) is a plant sterol saponin mainly found in natural medicinal plants such as fenugreek seeds and wild yam tubers. More and more studies have reported that DSG has significant pharmacological activities such as anticancer, cardiovascular protection, hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotection. Furthermore, diosgenin is also an important basic raw material for the preparation of steroids and contraceptives in the pharmaceutical industry. Numerous preclinical studies have shown that DSG has great potential in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases in vivo and in vitro, especially in atherosclerosis. This review mainly discusses the effects of DSG on endothelial dysfunction, lipid profile, and macrophage foam cell formation, VSMC viability, thrombosis and inflammation during the formation of atherosclerosis. Also, the mechanism of DSG on atherosclerosis was elaborated in detail. It is noteworthy that newly synthesized DSG derivatives and DSG delivery systems have good antithrombotic activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3acardioprotective effect 3acontraceptives 3adeath 3adiosgenin 3adrugs 3afenugreek 3afoam cells 3ainflammation 3alipid composition 3amedicinal plants 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aneuroprotective effect 3apatients 3apharmaceutical industry 3apharmacokinetics 3aphytosterols 3araw materials 3aseeds 3athrombosis 3atubers 3aviability 3ayams1 aJiang, Jian-Guo0 tFood & function.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 10, no. 11 p.7022-7036dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9fo00749k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245007300184520180800257592002802065650001302093650001602106650002102122650001602143650001302159650001002172650001102182650001402193650001102207653001602218653002702234653002002261653002302281653003102304700002802335700002202363773011902385856008802504852000902592655001202601IND60783352620221120055411.0220906e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078335262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVélez-Pereira, Andrés M.10aAerobiological modelling II: A review of long-range transport models  aThe long-range atmospheric transport models of pollen and fungal spores require four modules for their development: (i) Meteorological module: which contain the meteorological model, and it can be coupled to transport model with the same output configuration (spatio-temporal resolution), or uncoupled does not necessarily have the same output parameters. (ii) Emission module: settles the mass fluxes of bioaerosol, it can be done with a complex parameterization integrating phenological models and meteorological factors or by a simple emission factor. (iii) Sources of emission module, specifically refers to forestry/agronomy maps or, in the case of herbs and fungi, to potential geographical areas of emission. Obtaining the highest possible resolution in these maps allows establishing greater reliability in the modelling. (iv) Atmospheric transport module, with its respective established output parameters. The review and subsequent analysis presented in this article, were performed on published electronic scientific articles from 1998 to 2016. Of a total of 101 models applied found in 64 articles, 33 % performed forward modelling (using 15 different models) and 67 % made backward modelling (with three different models). The 88 % of the cases were applied to pollen (13 taxa) and 12 % to fungal spores (3 taxa). Regarding the emission module, 22 % used parametrization (four different parameters) and 10 % emission factors. The most used transport model was HYSPLIT (59 %: 56 % backward and 3 % forward) following by SILAM 10 % (all forward). Main conclusions were that the models of long-range transport of pollen and fungal spores had high technical-scientific requirements to development and that the major limitations were the establishment of the flow and the source of the emission.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3abioaerosols 3aemissions factor 3aenvironment 3aforestry 3afungi 3amodels 3aphenology 3apollen 0aAerobiology 0aAirborne fungal spores 0aAirborne pollen 0aBackward modelling 0aLong-range transport model1 aDe Linares, Concepción1 aBelmonte, Jordina0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 845 p.157351-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013400170300001600304520048000320536027200800592002801072596010601100650001901206650002101225650001201246650000901258650001201267651002501279651001001304653000901314653002001323700002501343773013301368856008501501852000901586655001201595IND60654911920221120154416.0190727e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065491192DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2019.16349272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArahuetes, Ana14aThe potential of sustainable urban drainage systems (SuDS) as an adaptive strategy to climate change in the Spanish Mediterranean  ap. 764-779.  aChanges in weather pattern caused by climate change generate more frequent extreme rain events as well as droughts.

When this route is blocked (partially or totally), new deactivation routes become available. Using new green chemistry procedures, with favorable green chemistry metrics, monosubstitution and disubstitution of N group(s) in indigo, by tert-butoxy carbonyl groups, N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)indigo (NtBOCInd) and N,N′-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)indigo (N,N’tBOCInd), respectively, were synthetically accomplished. The compounds display red to purple colors depending on the solvent and substitution. Different excited-state deactivation pathways were observed and found to be structure- and solvent-dependent. Trans–cis photoisomerization was found to be absent with NtBOCInd and present with N,N’tBOCInd in nonpolar solvents. Time-resolved fluorescence experiments revealed single-exponential decays for the two compounds which, linked to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) studies, show that with NtBOCInd ESPT is extremely fast and barrierless—predicted to be 1 kJ mol–¹ in methylcyclohexane and 5 kJ mol–¹ in dimethylsulfoxide—, which contrasts with ∼11 kJ mol–¹ experimentally obtained for indigo. An alternative ESPT, competitive with the N–H···O═C intramolecular pathway, involving dimer units is also probed by TDDFT and found to be consistent with the experimentally observed time-resolved data. N,N’tBOCInd, where ESPT is precluded, shows solvent-dependent trans–cis/cis–trans photoisomerization and is surprisingly found to be more stable in the nonemissive cis conformation, whose deactivation to S₀ is found to be solvent-dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3afluorescence 3agreen chemistry 3aindigo 3aphotoisomerization 3asolvents1 aGalvão, Adelino M.1 aPineiro, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7460-37581 ade Melo, J.

This process can cause the extinction and decline of associated insect species. The present paper is the first study analyzing wild bee diversity and abundance patterns in wet meadows. We surveyed bees using pan traps, transect walks, and nest traps in four Molinietum (Poaceae) meadows near Krakóów, Poland. During one season, we identified a relatively high γγ-diversity of wild bees, consisting of 105 species (13 from the Polish Red List) belonging to 22 genera, which represent almost one-fourth of the Polish bees. The wild bee fauna between sites was not variable, which was indicated by low ββ-diversity. We found that nesting preference of bees did not differ between the study area and xerothermic meadows, which suggests that differentiation in bee fauna of wet and dry grasslands is mostly due to food specialization rather than nesting preference. Abundance analysis of the bee community showed that the least abundant species were disproportionately comprised of oligolectic species, indicating that species closely associated to plants of wet meadows are especially threatened. Moreover, using occurrence data we found that 34%% of the species belonging to the families Halictidae, Melittidae, and the tribe Nomadini found in wet meadows are considered rare in Poland. Our results highlight an urgent need to perform further investigations and develop specific protection plans for bees not only in Krakóów's Molinietum meadows, but also in wetlands throughout Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 0afood plant specialization 0aHymenoptera (Apiformes) 0apollinators 0athreatened species 0awet grassland1 aSzentgyöörgyi, Hajnalka1 aWantuch, Marta1 aCelary, Waldemar1 aWestphal, Catrin1 aSettele, Josef1 aWoyciechowski, Michal0 tWetlands.g2008 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.975-983dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F08-83.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03984naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001800164245029700182300001400479500001500493520167500508592002802183650002602211650003002237650003702267650002802304650003802332650003402370650001902404650001402423650001202437650006802449650001102517650002002528650002802548650003402576650004702610650004702657650006402704650003402768650008102802650004002883650006602923653003202989653002503021653003903046700001603085700002103101700001903122700001703141700001403158773013003172852000903302856008303311655001203394IND2199787420221119001214.0181016e199801  cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219978742DNAL7 a95268592pmid7 a10.1177/1040638798010001082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, D.

The majority of BVDV infections (62%) were associated with other virus infections, suggesting that BVDV may potentiate infection with other agents rather than being a primary pathogen of the respiratory tract. The results were compared with those obtained by virus neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition testing, and the sensitivity, specificity, and overall correlation were calculated. Sensitivities of 92%, 95%, 100%, and 100% were obtained for BVDV, BRSV, PI3V, and IBRV, respectively. The corresponding specificity values were 89%, 92%, 86%, and 91%. The overall correlation for each virus was 90%, 93%, 90%, and 93%, respectively. These results demonstrate that this ELISA system may be used successfully to detect seroconversion in serum pairs, highlight the frequency of multiple viral infections in outbreaks of respiratory disease, and provide further evidence of an immunosuppressive role for BVDV infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiagnostic techniques 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3ahemagglutination inhibition test 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aseroconversion 3adetection 2aAnimals 2aBovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Diseasexdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseases 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aHemagglutination Inhibition Testsxmethods 2aInfectious Bovine Rhinotracheitisxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aNeutralization Testsxmethods 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virus Infectionsxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aRespiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovine 2aRespirovirus Infectionsxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxveterinary. 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0aBovine respiratory syncytial virus1 aMcShane, J.1 aMawhinney, K.

We provide critical base knowledge for Everglades restoration by characterizing the existing vegetation communities of an Everglades remnant, describing how present and historic hydrology affect wetland vegetation community composition, and documenting change from communities described in previous studies. Vegetation biomass samples were collected along transects across Water Conservation Area 3A South (3AS). Ten community types were present between November 2002 and 2005. Separate analyses for key a priori groups (slough, wet prairie, and sawgrass) provided detailed conclusions about effects of historic hydrology on the vegetation of 3AS. Communities were affected by hydrologic variables up to four years previous to the sample. We identified wet prairie/slough species such as Eleocharis spp. and Nymphaea odorata as short-term sentinel species of community change. Sawgrass and N. odorata should be monitored for long-term change. Comparisons to preceding studies indicated that many of the communities of previous times, when conditions were drier, no longer exist in our study area and have been replaced by deeper water community types.  aPublisher supplied data 0acharacterization 0aEverglades 0ahydrology 0amultivariate analysis1 aKitchens, Wiley M.0 tWetlands.g2008 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.1086-1096dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F08-96.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245011700206300001800323520200300341592002802344650001602372650002102388650001902409650002302428650001602451650001302467653002202480653001302502653001402515653001602529653002302545653001102568700001402579700001402593773010002607856008602707852000902793655001202802IND60659349020221117045259.0190906e20190920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065934902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRozbroj, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3084-746X14aThe mad leading the blind: Perceptions of the vaccine-refusal movement among Australians who support vaccination  ap. 5986-5993.  aVaccine refusal is shaped by the social ecology in which it occurs. How people who refuse vaccines are communicated to and treated may affect the nature and strength of their negative vaccine beliefs, and their responsiveness to health promotion messages. Yet little is known about how people who refuse vaccines are perceived by the public. Our research examined perceptions among pro-vaccine Australians of the vaccine-refusal movement.Descriptions of the vaccine-refusal movement by 2666 pro-vaccine Australians were analysed using thematic discourse analysis. Descriptive themes were identified via inductive, iterative coding. Discourse analysis techniques were then used to interpret latent beliefs about the vaccine-refusal movement.Participants had negative and stigmatising perceptions of the vaccine-refusal movement. They believed the movement is dangerous, misinformed, and comprised of charlatans and fools who are unintelligent, selfish, overly emotional, conspiratorial and scientifically illiterate. Discursive analysis showed that these perceptions were underpinned by beliefs that people would have to be defective in some way to believe anti-vaccine rhetoric. Furthermore, perceptions were underpinned by beliefs that the movement spreads not only disease, but also dangerous ideas that were seen to attack the social order, institutions, values and reason. Participants′ intensely-negative views related to their inability to imagine why someone would refuse vaccines.This research provides a focused, qualitative account of public perceptions of the vaccine-refusal movement. The findings are concerning: stigma towards vaccine-refusing people may adversely affect their wellbeing and entrench their negative vaccine beliefs. The research suggests that more compassionate, nuanced discussion of vaccine refusal in the public sphere is needed. It also supports the need to systematically examine public attitudes towards vaccine refusal as a determinant of vaccine confidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAustralians 3ahealth promotion 3apublic opinion 3asocial environment 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aVaccine hesitancy 0aAttitude 0aAustralia 0aQualitative 0aPublic perceptions 0aStigma1 aLyons, A.1 aLucke, J.0 tVaccine.g2019 Sept. 20, v. 37, no. 40 p.5986-5993dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015500171300001600326520136600342592002801708650002601736650001801762650001201780650002301792650001801815650001801833650002001851650001501871650001301886650001501899650001501914650001201929650001501941653002801956653002201984653002602006653001502032653002102047653003702068700002302105700002002128773008102148856008402229852000902313655001202322IND60545227520221119223630.0160901e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054522752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Wagenen, Jon10aCharacterization of nutrient removal and microalgal biomass production on an industrial waste-stream by application of the deceleration-stat technique  ap. 301-311.  aIndustrial wastewaters can serve as a nutrient and water source for microalgal production. In this study the effluent of an internal circulation (IC) reactor anaerobically treating the wastes of a biotechnology production facility were chosen as the cultivation medium for Chlorella sorokiniana in batch and continuous cultures. The aim was to evaluate the rates of nutrient removal and biomass production possible at various dilution rates. The results demonstrate that the industrial wastewater served as a highly effective microalgae culture medium and that dilution rate strongly influenced algae productivity in a short light-path photobioreactor. Batch culture on undiluted wastewater showed biomass productivity of 1.33 g L−1day−1, while removing over 99% of the ammonia and phosphate from the wastewater. Deceleration-stat (D-stat) experiments performed at high and low intensities of 2100 and 200 (μmol photon m2s−1) established the optimal dilution rates to reach volumetric productivity of 5.87 and 1.67 g L−1day−1 respectively. The corresponding removal rates of nitrogen were 238 and 93 mg L−1day−1 and 40 and 19 mg L−1day−1 for phosphorous. The yield on photons at low light intensity was as high as had been observed in any previous report indicating that the waste stream allowed the algae to grow at its full potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella sorokiniana 3aalgae culture 3aammonia 3abiomass production 3abiotechnology 3aculture media 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphotons 3awastewater 0aMicroalgae productivity 0aDeceleration-stat 0aChlorella sorokiniana 0aIC reactor 0aNutrient removal 0aShort light-path photobioreactor1 aPape, Mathias Leon1 aAngelidaki, I.,0 tWater research.g2015 May 15, v. 75 p.301-311dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012800166520133400294592002801628650001501656650001201671650002201683650001201705650002301717650001501740650001601755650001701771650002101788650001001809650001901819650001101838650001601849650001901865653001201884653003101896653002201927653002801949653001501977700001801992700001602010700001402026700001902040700002002059700001502079773011402094856008602208852000902294655001202303IND60773127520221121101334.0220523e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ning10aMechanism of digestate-derived biochar on odorous gas emissions and humification in composting of digestate from food waste  aEmissions of odorous gases and prolonged composting duration are the key concerns in the composting of digestate from food waste (DFW). In this study, different amounts of biochar derived from DFW (BC-DFW) were introduced in the composting process of DFW to decrease the emissions of ammonia (NH₃) and volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) and composting duration. The addition of BC-DFW increased the temperature and germination index during DFW composting. The group with 25% BC-DFW exhibited a 30% smaller composting duration. Significant amounts of NH₃ and VSCs emissions were observed in the initial phase of DFW composting. Dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) was a prominent contributor to the odor associated with VSCs. The addition of BC-DFW facilitated the adsorption of NH₃ and VSCs, and the corresponding contents decreased by 5–21% and 15–20%, respectively. Moreover,the BC-DFW accelerated the transformation of ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) to nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N), thereby alleviating the NH₃ volatilization. The addition of 25% BC-DFW minimized the NH₃ emission and enhanced the generation of humic-acid-like matter, thereby promoting humification. Therefore, the addition of 25% BC-DFW was optimal for promoting the degradation of organic matter and humification and odor emission reduction (e.g., NH₃, DMDS).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochar 3adimethyl disulfide 3afood waste 3agermination 3ahumification 3anitrate nitrogen 3aodors 3aorganic matter 3asulfur 3atemperature 3avolatilization 0aAmmonia 0aVolatile sulfur components 0aGermination index 0aHumic-acid-like matters 0aAdsorption1 aHuang, Dandan1 aBai, Xinyue1 aLin, Yeqi1 aMiao, Qianming1 aShao, Mingshuai1 aXu, Qiyong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 15, v. 434 p.128878-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02867naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245011000178520134300288592002801631650001501659650001501674650001601689650001801705650001201723650001301735650001801748650001401766650002201780650001901802650001101821650000701832650001401839650001801853650002301871650002101894650001601915653002101931653002801952653003001980653001702010700001302027700002102040700001502061700001502076700001702091700002002108773011402128856008602242852000902328655001202337IND60773127620221121101314.0220523e20220715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfzal, Muhammad Zaheer10aSonocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin using hydrogel beads of TiO2 incorporated biochar and chitosan  aPharmaceuticals are necessary to be removed from environment. Herein TiO₂ incorporated biochar made from pyrolysis of agricultural wastes was encapsulated into chitosan to obtain a novel hydrogel beads. This hydrogel beads executed a dual role as both adsorbent and sonocatalyst, which proved to be suitable for the removal of antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) from water. The results showed that adsorption of CIP followed pseudo first order kinetics model and Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, having maximum adsorption at pH 9. Whereas the degradation was more efficient at pH 6 due to greater standard potential for •OH/H₂O in acidic media. The degradation was maximum at 150 W of ultrasonic power, then decreased in presence of dissimilar electrolytes and even reduced to 0 in presence of Na₃PO₄. Different quenchers such as benzoquinone (BQ), Triethanolamine (TEA) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) reduced degradation efficiency (DE) and mineralization efficiency (ME). The DE was decreased from 85.23% to 81.50% (BQ), 74.27% (TEA), and 61.77% (IPA) within 25 min. The prepared sonocatalyst was capable of regeneration with DE, remaining sufficiently high (62%) even after four regeneration steps. These results indicate that titanium-biochar/chitosan hydrogel beads (TBCB) are durable and effective for long-term CIP removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3abenzoquinones 3abiochar 3achitosan 3aciprofloxacin 3ahydrogels 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amineralization 3amodels 3apH 3apyrolysis 3asonocatalysis 3asorption isotherms 3atitanium dioxide 3aultrasonics 0aTitanium-biochar 0aChitosan hydrogel beads 0aCiprofloxacin degradation 0aSonocatalyst1 aZu, Peng1 aZhang, Chun-Miao1 aGuan, Jing1 aSong, Chao1 aSun, Xue-Fei1 aWang, Shu-Guang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 15, v. 434 p.128879-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245015100204300001600355500001900371520189200390592002802282596009402310596004602404650001902450650001502469650001702484650001202501650001502513650002002528650001102548650001002559650003102569650001302600650001202613650001502625650001202640650000902652651001502661700001802676700001502694700001602709700001502725773009902740856008202839852000902921655001202930IND60689976420221119224949.0200424e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068997642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-019-00427-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodil, I.

We examined the relative macrobenthic contribution to the seafloor metabolism by estimating respiration and secondary production based on seasonal measurements of macrofauna biomass across key coastal habitats of the Baltic Sea archipelago. Then, we compared the macrofauna estimates with estimates of overall seafloor gross primary production and respiration obtained from the same habitats using the aquatic eddy covariance technique. Estimates of macrobenthic respiration rates suggest habitat-specific macrofauna contribution (%) to the overall seafloor respiration ranked as follows: blue mussel reef (44.5) > seagrass meadow (25.6) > mixed meadow (24.1) > bare sand (17.8) > Fucus-bed (11.1). In terms of secondary production (g C m⁻² y⁻¹), our estimates suggest ranking of habitat value as follows: blue mussel reef (493.4) > seagrass meadow (278.5) > Fucus-bed (102.2) > mixed meadow (94.2) > bare sand (52.1). Our results suggest that approximately 12 and 10% of the overall soft-sediment metabolism translated into macrofauna respiration and secondary production, respectively. The hard-bottoms exemplified two end-points of the coastal metabolism, with the Fucus-bed as a high producer and active exporter of organic C (that is, net autotrophy), and the mussel reef as a high consumer and active recycler of organic C (that is, net heterotrophy). Using a combination of metrics of ecosystem functioning, such as respiration rates and secondary production, in combination with direct habitat-scale measurements of O₂ fluxes, our study provides a quantitative assessment of the role of macrofauna for ecosystem functioning across heterogeneous coastal seascapes.  aPublisher supplied data  aproject ID 283417cFinnish Marine Research Infrastructure network, The Academy of Finland  aproject ID 294853cThe Academy of Finland 3aMytilus edulis 3aautotrophs 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenergy 3afauna 3agross primary productivity 3ahabitats 3ameadows 3ametabolism 3amussels 3asand 3aBaltic Sea1 aAttard, K.

A life cycle assessment of the dominant crops produced in a Peruvian coastal valley was realized, in order to establish regionalized life cycle inventories for Peruvian products and to provide the basis for a regional evaluation of the impacts of eutrophication, acidification, human toxicity, and biodiversity loss due to water use. Five scenarios for the year 2020 characterized by different crop combinations and irrigation systems were considered as development options. The results of the regional assessment showed that a business-as-usual scenario, extrapolating current trends of crop cultivation, would lead to an increase in nitrate leaching with eutrophying effects. On the other hand, scenarios of increased application of drip irrigation and of mandarin area expansion would lead to a decrease in nitrate leaching. In all scenarios the human toxicity potential would decrease slightly, while an increase in irrigation water use would benefit the biodiversity of a nearby groundwater-fed wetland. Comparisons with results from other studies confirmed the importance of regionalized life cycle inventories. The results can be used as decision support for local farmers and authorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3aeutrophication 3afarmers 3ahumans 3airrigation water 3aleaching 3alife cycle inventory 3amicroirrigation 3anitrates 3aplanning 3atoxicity 3awetlands1 aVerones, Francesca1 aHellweg, Stefanie0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2012 Sept. 18, v. 46, no. 18 p.9872-9880dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes301644y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024002200115024001900137040001800156100001800174245012600192300001300318520071500331592002801046650002401074650001101098650002001109650002501129650001201154650001901166650001401185650002601199773014601225856006701371856010301438990002301541852000901564655001201573IND60643259920221122140851.0190510e20070704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064325992DNAL7 a10.3791/2252doi7 aPMC25570942pmcid7 a189790232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRasgon, Jason10aPopulation replacement strategies for controlling vector populations and the use of wolbachia pipientis for genetic drive  ap. e225.  aIn this video, Jason Rasgon discusses population replacement strategies to control vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. "Population replacement" is the replacement of wild vector populations (that are competent to transmit pathogens) with those that are not competent to transmit pathogens. There are several theoretical strategies to accomplish this. One is to exploit the maternally-inherited symbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. Wolbachia is a widespread reproductive parasite that spreads in a selfish manner at the extent of its host's fitness. Jason Rasgon discusses, in detail, the basic biology of this bacterial symbiont and various ways to use it for control of vector-borne diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWolbachia pipientis 3adengue 3adisease control 3adisease transmission 3amalaria 3amicrosymbionts 3aparasites 3avector-borne diseases0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2007 July 04, , no. 5 p.e225-e225dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/2253Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/225/population-replacement-strategies-for-controlling-vector-populations  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013500156300002000291520096500311592002801276650001701304650001801321650001401339650001101353650002301364650002101387700001801408700001501426700001401441700001401455700001501469773012501484856007501609852000901684655001201693IND60641100120221119132555.0220402e20160906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064110012DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17125g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shiyi10aSimulation of anodizing current–time curves and the morphology evolution of TiO₂ nanotubes obtained in phosphoric electrolytes  ap. 84309-84318.  aAlthough anodic TiO₂ nanotubes (ATNTs) have been investigated for many years, the growth kinetics need to be further studied to work out a comprehensive fully theoretical model. Here, the simulation and separation of anodizing current–time curves are applied to investigate the morphology evolution in mixed NH₄F/H₃PO₄ electrolytes for the first time. The total anodizing current was separated into ionic current and electronic current. The influence of NH₄F concentration on the ionic current, electronic current and morphology evolution was systemically studied. The linear relationship between nanotube length and ionic current indicates that the ionic current contributes to oxide growth. It is the first time the special surface layer of nanotubes and two-hole nanotubes in mixed electrolytes have been observed. Furthermore, a formation mechanism for the two-hole nanotubes is proposed based on the plastic flow model and oxygen bubble mould.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3agrowth models 3ananotubes 3aoxygen 3atheoretical models 3atitanium dioxide1 aLiao, Maoying1 aYang, Peng1 aYan, Shuo1 aJin, Rong1 aZhu, Xufei0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 06, v. 6, no. 87 p.84309-84318dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17125g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245006000156300001600216520083100232592002801063650001701091650001301108650001801121650003201139650005801171650001401229650001501243650001201258700002001270700001701290700001801307700001801325700001601343700001701359700001901376700001901395700002001414700002001434773012101454856007401575852000901649655001201658IND60440517120221120220424.0151024e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051712DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029773452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hee-Ju10aβ-Secretase (BACE1) inhibitors from Sanguisorbae Radix  ap. 799-803.  aIn the course of screening anti-dementia agents from natural products, two β-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors were isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of Sanguisorbae Radix by the activity-guided purification using silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and RP-HPLC.

The corresponding research about plastic properties, however, is very limited especially in liquid environments. In this work, the effect of a water film on the plastic deformation of monocrystalline copper (Cu) is performed by a nanoindentation process using molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicate that the water film induces strong fluctuation of the load–indentation depth curves and increase of the load at the same indentation depth. The plastic deformation of monocrystalline Cu is obviously strengthened due to the water film facilitating dislocation propagation sufficiently into the inner Cu substrate. In addition, the mechanism of plasticity response to the nanoindentation process is discussed based on the interaction force. The results reveal that with the water film thickness increasing, the interaction force between the indenter and monocrystalline Cu exhibits obvious delay and its value is significantly smaller compared with that of the nanoindentation without a water film. The water molecules under and around the indenter transmit the force stemming from the indenter to the Cu substrate, which strengthens the dislocation propagation into the inner substrate but blocks the dislocation propagation to the surface, leading to a larger plastic deformation of monocrystalline Cu. In addition, the effect tendency of the water film on the nanoindentation property of the Cu substrate slows down rather than increases continuously once the thickness is large enough. Our findings can help us to understand more thoroughly the plastic deformation mechanism of nanomaterials under liquid or humid conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3aliquids 3amechanical properties 3amolecular dynamics 3aplastic deformation 3aplasticity 3asimulation models 3aworking conditions1 aZhang, Yanan1 aSun, Kun1 aFang, Liang0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 6, no. 99 p.96824-96831dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17126e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013900168300001400307520183900321592002802160650001802188650001902206650001102225650000902236650002002245650001502265650001102280650001102291650000902302650001502311650003002326651001002356651001802366651001702384651001502401653001902416653001602435653002102451653001502472653002402487653001502511700001502526700001902541700001802560700001402578700001402592773010202606856008502708852000902793655001202802IND60628184620221121233717.0190320e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062818462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2019.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kunshan10aHeavy-mineral-based provenance and environment analysis of a Pliocene series marking a prominent transgression in the south Yellow Sea  ap. 25-35.  aDetrital minerals in sediments can provide insight into sedimentary provenance and depositional environments. Here we report a record of heavy minerals of a 300.1 m long core recovered from the western south Yellow Sea, which was dated back to the late Pliocene (~3.5 Ma). Results of detrital mineral analysis show that sediments are dominated mainly by silicate minerals sourced from the Chinese mainland through river inputs. Heavy minerals suggest that marine transgression occurred around 76–84 m depth of the core depth, about at 792–840 ka BP. The upper part of the core (0–76 m) is dominantly marine and the lower part (below 84 m) is terrestrial. From the Miocene to Early Pleistocene, the Yellow Sea area generally subsided; the deposition center began to move from west to east, therefore the content of fine sand increased relatively in the core sediment. Meanwhile, under the influence of depression evolution in the Subei Basin, the paths of rivers were shifted, as a result the contents of augite and garnet changed, sediments in the study area were dominated by proximal sediments sourced from the Subei Basin, possibly of mixed sediments of the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The lower part of the core was characterized by a dramatic increase in augite with hornblende and epidote as dominant minerals. In the Early Pleistocene, under the background of subsidence in the Yellow Sea area, while transgression occurred, rivers shifted southward. Comparison with the mineral composition of adjacent core NHH01 and surface sediments from the region suggests the Yellow River dominated the study area, and the old Yangtze River input being occasionally dominant. The heavy mineral assemblage was dominated by hornblende and epidote, as well as mica, garnet and authigenic pyrite in some sediment layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiocene epoch 3aPliocene epoch 3abasins 3amica 3amineral content 3aprovenance 3apyrite 3arivers 3asand 3asubsidence 3atransgressive segregation 3aChina 3aYangtze River 3aYellow River 3aYellow Sea 0aHeavy minerals 0aCSDP01 core 0aSouth Yellow Sea 0aProvenance 0aDeposit environment 0aQuaternary1 aShi, Xuefa1 aYao, Zhengquan1 aLiu, Jianxing1 aLiu, Jian1 aXu, Taoyu0 tSedimentary geology.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 382 p.25-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2019.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015500162300002000317520137300337592002801710650002001738650001001758650001001768650002801778650000801806650001801814650001101832650003001843700001901873700001401892700002401906773012801930856007502058852000902133655001202142IND60534412720221118052232.0160802e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053441272DNAL7 a10.1021/es301724h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrouillard, Ken G.10aCalibration of the Gastrointestinal Magnification Model to Predict Maximum Biomagnification Potentials of Polychlorinated Biphenyls in a Bird and Fish  ap. 10279-10286.  aThe gastrointestinal magnification (GI-magnification) model was calibrated in ring doves and Japanese koi using matched data on dietary assimilation and fecal depuration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Mass transport parameters describing PCB flux from gut contents to organism (Dgₒ′; mol d–¹ Pa–¹) and organism to gut contents (Dₒg; mol d–¹ Pa–¹) were quantified to test the hypothesis that the ratio of these two terms approached unity. For birds, Dgₒ′/Dₒg ranged from 2.9 to 6.3 and for fish the ratios ranged from 0.7 to 3.1. In both species, the ratio commonly exceeded 1. The GI-magnification model was used to predict maximum PCB biomagnification factors (BMFₘₐₓ) for each species which ranged from 18.5 to 33.8 for ring doves and 7.9 to 14.8 for Japanese koi. Chemical losses via respiration reduced steady state biomagnification factor (BMFₛₛ) estimates by a negligible amount in birds, whereas for fish, predicted BMFₛₛ decreased to values from 0.5 to 7.2. This study demonstrated that chemical transfer efficiency during assimilation exceeds organism/feces transfer which contributes to elevated PCB biomagnification potentials in birds and fish. Combined with reduced losses of chemical across respiratory surfaces, higher Dgₒ′/Dₒg ratios of birds contribute to elevated biomagnification in birds over fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioaccumulation 3adoves 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3akoi 3amass transfer 3amodels 3apolychlorinated biphenyls1 aPaterson, Gord1 aLiu, Jian1 aHaffner, G.

The neuroprotective activity-guided isolation resulted in 8 phenolic compounds (1–8), such as vanillic acid (1), ferulic acid (2), 3,5-dihydroxystilbene (3), (+)-aromadendrin (4), methyl vanillate (5), (-)-catechin (6), 2,3,4-trihydrobenzoic acid (7), and (+)-afzelechin (8). Among these, compounds6 and8 had a neuroprotective effect on the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in HT22 cells. Furthermore, compound6 had a DPPH free radical scavenging effect with an IC₅₀ value of 57.7 μM, and a superoxide anion radical scavenging effect with an 8.0 μM. Both compounds6 and8 had ABTS cation radical scavenging effects with IC₅₀ values of 7.8 μM and 23.7 μM, respectively. These results suggest that compounds6 and8 could be neuroprotectants owing to their free radical scavenging activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aferulic acid 3afree radical scavengers 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amice 3aneuroprotective effect 3aneurotoxicity 3asuperoxide anion 3avanillic acid1 aMin, Byung-Sun1 aZheng, Changji1 aLee, Joongku1 aOh, Sei-Ryang1 aAhn, Kyung-Seop1 aLee, Hyeong-Kyu0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2005 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.804-809dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029773463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003000153245011700183506011700300506007600417520142400493592002801917506003701945650001401982650002401996650001902020650001602039650001202055650002002067650001002087650001502097650001202112650001402124650001102138653001102149653002402160653003302184653002002217653001802237653002402255700002302279700002102302700001702323700003002340773011902370856008802489852000902577655001202586IND60783353320221207102548.0220906e20221110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078335332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosiorowska, Katarzyna E.10aProduction of PETase by engineered Yarrowia lipolytica for efficient poly(ethylene terephthalate) biodegradation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere has been a growing interest in poly(ethylene terephthalate) PET degradation studies in the last few years due to its widespread use and large-scale plastic waste accumulation in the environment. One of the most promising enzymatic methods in the context of PET degradation is the use of PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis, which has been reported to be an efficient enzyme for hydrolysing ester bonds in PET. In our study, we expressed a codon-optimized PETase gene in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. The obtained strain was tested for its ability to degrade PET directly in culture, and a screening of different supplements that might raise the level of PET hydrolysis was performed. We also carried out long-term cultures with PET film, the surface of which was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The efficiency of PET degradation was tested based on the concentration of degradation products released, and the results showed that supplementation of the culture with olive oil resulted in 66 % higher release of terephthalic acid into the medium compared to the mutant culture without supplementation. The results indicate the possibility of ethylene glycol uptake by both strains, and, additionally, the PETase produced by the newly engineered strain hydrolyses MHET. The structure of the PET film after culture with the modified strain, meanwhile, had numerous surface defects, cracks, and deformations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIdeonella 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3abiodegradation 3aenvironment 3aenzymes 3aethylene glycol 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3amutants 3aolive oil 3ayeasts 0aPETase 0aYarrowia lipolytica 0aPoly(ethylene terephthalate) 0aPET degradation 0aPlastic waste 0aGenetic engineering1 aMoreno, Antonio D.1 aIglesias, Raquel1 aLeluk, Karol1 aMirończuk, Aleksandra M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 10, v. 846 p.157358-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245014900153300002000302520059600322592002800918650002900946650001400975650002300989650001101012650001401023650002101037700001701058700001801075700001501093773012501108856007401233852000901307655001201316IND60641100420221119132413.0190505e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064110042DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17130c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Juan10aComparison of titania nanotube-supported cobalt catalysts prepared by impregnation and homogeneous precipitation for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis  ap. 89770-89775.  aThe properties and catalytic performance of Co/TiO₂ nanotubes prepared by impregnation (Imp) and homogeneous precipitation (HP) for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis were investigated. HP makes cobalt particles enrich the exterior surface of the support, while for the Imp catalyst, cobalt particles are distributed on both external and internal surfaces of the support. The HP catalyst displays a twofold higher activity as well as superior C₅₊ selectivity. The low activity of the Imp catalyst can be attributed to the strong Co–TiO₂ interaction and less available active cobalt sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3ananotubes 3atitanium dioxide1 aWang, Tiejun1 aWu, Liangpeng1 aLi, Xinjun0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 6, no. 92 p.89770-89775dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17130c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245008800170520146900258592002801727650001201755650001901767650001601786650002101802650002401823650000901847650001101856650001701867653002101884653000801905653002101913653002001934653001901954653002401973773011901997856008802116852000902204655001202213IND60783353420221123041235.0220906e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078335342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajani, Evan14aThe influence of climate change and variability on the IFD Curves in NSW, Australia  aIn this study, the possible impacts of climate change and multi-decadal climate variability on intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) curves were investigated using both stationary and non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions. The current study covers rainfall data recorded over 41 years for two rainfall stations, namely, Gowrie-055194 and Sydney Airport-066037, located within New South Wales state in Australia. Three future times (2030, 2060, and 2100), as well as 15 rainfall durations ranging from 6 min to 3-days, are considered. Consideration of the location parameter of the GEV distribution is influenced by climatic change and/or climate variability, providing a more consistent set of IFD curves. It is found that when the future period increases, the relative differences between the stationary and non-stationary IFD curves generally increase. When the new IFD curves (i.e., derived from the stationary and non-stationary approaches) are compared to the Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) IFD curves, it is clear that the ARR IFD curves and the new stationary IFD curves are more closely aligned compared to the non-stationary IFD curves. The findings of this research are useful and provide valuable information for future planning of water resources, environmental and urbanization plans. It is essential to understand the expected behavior of hydro-meteorological processes regarding the possible changes in the rainfall design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironment 3ahydrometeorology 3ameteorological data 3arain 3arunoff 3aurbanization 0aNon-stationarity 0aIFD 0aGEV distribution 0aDesign rainfall 0aClimate change 0aClimate variability0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 845 p.157359-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245011500205300001500320520104300335592002801378650001201406650001201418650002101430650001301451650002201464650001601486650002001502650001501522650001201537650001101549650002201560650001801582650001301600650002501613650000701638650001201645700001401657700001801671700001801689700001801707700002201725773010801747856008601855852000901941655001201950IND60628184820221121233740.0190318e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062818482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.12.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgan, Gary1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0634-389110aLong-term effects of grazing, liming and nutrient fertilization on the nitrifying community of grassland soils  ap. 97-102.  aHuman-managed grasslands receive significant inputs of fertilizing materials, which can greatly influence soil biological processes associated with the cycling of nitrogen (N), including microbial nitrification. Here we specifically address how soil ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) respond to 23 years of different management practices in a permanent grassland experiment.We found that AOB amoA gene copy numbers were significantly higher in limed soils (associated with greater pH values) whereas AOA amoA gene copy numbers were higher in grazed grasslands. The chronic addition of inorganic N fertilizer in the form of ammonium nitrate (either applied alone or in combination with other macro-nutrients) greatly contributed to increase AOB abundance. Our study brings evidence of how soil-nitrifying communities can differently respond to the long-term effect of animal (i.e. rabbit) grazing and to repeated applications of nutrient (e.g. NH4NO3) and non-nutrient (i.e. CaCO3) fertilizing materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrate 3abacteria 3acalcium carbonate 3agene dosage 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aliming 3along term effects 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apH 3arabbits1 aZhou, Xue1 aWang, Dongmei1 aJia, Zhongjun1 aCrawley, Mick1 aFornara, Dario A.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 Mar., v. 118 p.97-102dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.12.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245010800199500002000307520167600327592002802003596006002031596011302091596013702204650001302341650001002354650001502364650001802379650001302397650000902410650002002419650002002439650001602459700005902475700002102534700001602555700002702571700002802598700007002626700002102696700002902717700005702746700005702803700005702860773012102917856007503038852000903113655001203122IND60789272520221116142428.0220819e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078927252DNAL7 a10.1002/vzj2.201842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHachgenei, Nico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0490-210312aA device to simulate contaminant transfer and surface and subsurface flow through intact soil monoliths  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany contaminants of agricultural origin are released into rural environments, particularly at the soil surface. Their fate has been extensively investigated in repacked soils, but only few studies have addressed their transport in structurally preserved natural soils. Much remains unknown about their fate and transfer within and between environmental compartments, while the susceptibility of these compartments to the contaminants adverse effects can vary considerably. The lack of studies regarding surface and subsurface transfer of contaminants through intact soil compared with studies on repacked soil led us to propose a device and protocol for sampling intact soil monoliths (60 × 30 × 22 cm³, length, width, depth [LWD]) without heavy machinery. This is achieved by a modular design with removable top and bottom lid and a protocol of cutting the soil and replacing the affected bottom soil with a drainage layer of glass beads. The device allows the application of artificial rainfall events with simultaneous highly resolved quantification of infiltration excess overland flow and drainage discharge. It is designed to facilitate the collection of samples for physical, biological, and chemical analyses that fulfill cleanliness standards for organic contaminant analysis at trace levels using only poorly reactive stainless steel and glass materials. Testing of the device was performed by measuring the transfer of the antiparasitic drug ivermectin (IVM) through and over a silt‐loam pasture soil. This test case illustrates how the device can be used to gain valuable information on the transfer of trace organic contaminants through topsoils.  aPublisher supplied data  a#ANR‐10‐LABX‐56cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  aSNO SIC ANO‐1cInstitut National des Sciences de l‘Univers, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique  aZone critique et eau continentale/OHMCVcInstitut National des Sciences de l‘Univers, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 3adrainage 3aglass 3aivermectin 3aoverland flow 3apastures 3arain 3astainless steel 3asubsurface flow 3avadose zone1 aNord, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5541-93681 aSpadini, Lorenzo1 aMora, Henri1 aCourvoisier, François1 aSutra, Jean‐François1 aVandervaere, Jean‐Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9620-05891 aLegoût, Cédric1 aMorel, Marie‐Christine1 aMartins, Jean1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0314-13111 aLespine, Anne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8153-85551 aDuwig, Celine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1505-89960 tVadose zone journal.g2022 Mar., v. 21, no. 2 p.e20184-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008200161300001600243520171800259592002801977650002602005650001402031650001602045650002102061650002402082650001702106650001102123650001102134650003202145650002902177650001502206650001902221650001402240650001402254650001202268650001502280650001402295700002002309700001802329700001802347700001702365700001902382773012102401856007402522852000902596655001202605IND60440517520221120211206.0151024e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051752DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029773492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Soo-Yeon,10aInhibition of P-glycoprotein by natural products in human breast cancer cells  ap. 823-828.  aMultidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the most significant obstacles in cancer chemotherapy. One of the mechanisms involved in the development of MDR is the over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). It is widely known that natural compounds found in vegetables, fruits, plant-derived beverages and herbal dietary supplements not only have anticancer properties, but may also modulate P-gp activity. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of naturally occurring products on P-gp function in human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 (sensitive) and MCF-7/ADR (resistant). The accumulation of daunomycin (DNM), a P-gp substrate, was greater in the sensitive cells compared to the resistant cells, while the efflux of DNM was higher in the resistant cells compared to the sensitive cells over a period of 2 h. The IC₅₀ value of DNM in the resistant cells was about 22 times higher than that in the sensitive cells, indicating an over-expression of P-gp in the resistant cells, MCF-7/ADR. All of the compounds tested, with the exception of fisetin, significantly decreased the IC₅₀ value of DNM. Biochanin A showed the greatest increase in [³H]-DNM accumulation, increasing by 454.3±19.5% in the resistant cells, whereas verapamil, the positive control, increased the accumulation by 229.4±17.6%. Also, the accumulation of [³H]-DNM was increased substantially by quercetin and silymarin while it was reduced by fisetin. Moreover, biochanin A, silymarin, and naringenin significantly decreased DNM efflux from MCF-7/ADR cells compared with the control. These results suggest that some flavonoids such as biochanin A and silymarin may reverse MDR by inhibiting the P-gp function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3abeverages 3abiochanin A 3abreast neoplasms 3adietary supplements 3adrug therapy 3afruits 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amultiple drug resistance 3anaringenin 3aneoplasm cells 3aquercetin 3asilymarin 3atritium 3avegetables 3averapamil1 aSung, Min Kyung1 aKim, Na Hyung1 aJang, Jung Ok1 aGo, Eun Jung1 aLee, Hwa Jeong0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2005 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.823-828dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029773493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010800175500002200283520171500305592002802020650001302048650001102061650001702072650002302089650001302112653001702125653002402142653001702166653001502183653002002198700001902218700002102237700002202258773009202280856008602372852000902458655001202467IND60773128220221121165750.0220509e20211222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Addario, Sabrina10aIt ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you’re at: Hiring origins, firm heterogeneity, and wages  aPre-press version  aSequential auction models of labor market competition predict that the wages required to successfully poach a worker from a rival employer will depend on the productivities of both the poached and poaching firms. We develop a theoretically grounded extension of the two-way fixed effects model of Abowd et al. (1999) in which log hiring wages are comprised of a worker fixed effect, a fixed effect for the “destination” firm hiring the worker, and a fixed effect for the “origin” firm, or labor market state, from which the worker was hired. This specification is shown to nest the reduced form for hiring wages delivered by semi-parametric formulations of the canonical sequential auction model of Postel-Vinay and Robin (2002b) and its generalization in Bagger et al. (2014). Fitting the model to Italian social security records, origin effects are found to explain only 0.7% of the variance of hiring wages among job movers, while destination effects explain more than 23% of the variance. Across firms, destination effects are more than 13 times as variable as origin effects. Interpreted through the lens of Bagger et al. (2014)’s model, this finding requires that workers possess implausibly strong bargaining strength. Studying a cohort of workers entering the Italian labor market in 2005, we find that differences in origin effects yield essentially no contribution to the evolution of the gender gap in hiring wages, while differences in destination effects explain the majority of the gap at the time of labor market entry. These results suggest that where a worker is hired from tends to be relatively inconsequential for their wages in comparison to where they are currently employed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aauctions 3agender 3alabor market 3amarket competition 3avariance 0aHiring wages 0aSequential auctions 0aFirm effects 0aBargaining 0aGender wage gap1 aKline, Patrick1 aSaggio, Raffaele1 aSølvsten, Mikkel0 tJournal of econometrics.g2021 Dec. 22, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11871x0304-40767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009100166300001800257520128600275536073801561592002802299596007202327650001502399650001402414650002602428650000802454650001902462650001402481650002902495650001502524651001502539700002402554700002002578700001602598700001602614700001802630700001702648773013902665856008602804852000902890655001202899IND60654912920221120164837.0200515e20191117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065491292DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.16109852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fang10aAccuracy assessment and waveform analysis of CryoSat-2 SARIn mode data over Antarctica  ap. 8418-8431.  aThe new synthetic aperture radar interferometric (SARIn) measurement mode of CryoSat-2 provides better performance on the rough topography of the ice sheet margins than that of conventional radar altimetry. We assess the accuracy of CryoSat-2 SARIn mode data from Baseline C product of the European Space Agency (ESA), through comparison with two airborne laser altimeters on NASA IceBridge missions. The time difference between two compared data was limited to 30 days resulting in a reduction in the random error of ~0.3 m. We also assess the sensitivity of ESA retracker to surface slope, roughness and firn density using the mean waveform and retracked bin derived from CryoSat-2 Level 1B and Level 2i product. The ESA retracker appears to be sensitive to the surface slope and roughness according to the different leading edge shape and the retracked bin locations, however, not sensitive to the different firn density over four ice shelves. The modelled echo waveforms as SARIn are also used to analyse the impacts of surface characteristics (slope, roughness, and penetration depth) on echo waveform shape. It illustrates that the processes for ESA product fail to differentiate the changes in near-surface dielectric properties and determine radar-signal-penetration depth.  aThis work was supported by the Marine S&T Fund of Shandong Province for Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao) (No.2018SDKJ0102-8), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program No 41830536), Qian Xuesen Lab. - DFH Sat.

Classically, the measured data are represented as cumulated CO2 flux or as % total organic carbon (TOC) mineralized and from those data kinetic parameters are often derived using models of different complexity. Based on the conceptual idea that more than one C-pool exists, especially in soil mixtures, the simple single-pool model is more and more substituted by double-pool models to describe these data. Hereby, the model will be iteratively fitted to the data to obtain the pool sizes and rate constants of the pools (slow and fast). In the work presented, we show that the fitting of double-pool models will lead to different results in the pool sizes and kinetic parameters, depending on the fitting approach used. Secondly, general problems of over-fitting and the ill-posed problem are discussed, whereby it will be shown, that especially the estimation of the rate constant for the slow pool is highly uncertain. Based on these general findings and problems in the fitting procedure, fitting results reported in literature were analyzed. The meta-analysis indicates that only a small number of reported fits are apparently not well fitted, whereas a non-negligible percentage of reported fits were over-fitted or wrong parameters were reported. Finally, the paper provides guidelines for kinetic fitting and discusses possible fitting alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acomposts 3aguidelines 3alaboratory experimentation 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3astraw 3atemperature 3atopsoil 3atotal organic carbon 3awater content 0aIncubation experiments 0aCarbon turnover 0aKinetic modeling1 aNeuser, A.1 aHerbst, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1371-42081 aVereecken, H.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 May, v. 120 p.260-271dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245012700166300001800293520113600311592002801447650001301475650001801488650001401506650001601520650001501536650001001551650002801561650001001589650002001599650001001619650001001629650002501639650002001664650002101684650001201705650001301717650001101730650001701741700001801758700002401776700002301800700002201823700002501845700002101870700002801891700003101919700002401950773012601974856007402100852000902174655001202183IND60676288420221121173932.0191114e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067628842DNAL7 a10.1039/c9fo01186b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Catherine K.

Each consumed a serving of pasta made from durum wheat semolina (DWS) alone, or DWS flour with 25% of flours from whole FB (FBF), starch concentrate (FBS), protein concentrate (FBPC), or protein isolate (FBPI). Post-consumption measurements included postprandial blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1 and PYY, and subjective appetite, over 120 min. Second meal effects of treatments were assessed after participants consumed either an ad libitum or fixed size meal (12 kcal kg⁻¹) at a pizza meal at 120 min. Additions of FB flours from FBPC and FBPI reduced postprandial glycaemia and appetite, increased protein content and quality of the pastas and PYY and C-peptide responses, but had no effect on plasma insulin or GLP-1. In conclusion, DWS pastas with added faba bean protein flour reduce postprandial BG and appetite and have higher nutritional quality.

A protein–protein interaction between PixD and a response regulator PixE (Slr1693) is essential to achieve light signal transduction for phototaxis of the species. Although the initial photochemical reaction of PixD, the red shift of the flavin absorption spectrum, has been investigated, the subsequent reaction dynamics remain largely unresolved. Only the disassembly of the PixD₁₀–PixE₅ dark complex has been characterized by static size exclusion chromatography. In this report, interprotein reaction dynamics were examined using time-resolved transient grating spectroscopy. The dissociation process was clearly observed as the light-induced diffusion coefficient change in the time domain, and the kinetics was determined. More strikingly, disassembly was found to take place only after photoactivation of two PixD subunits in the complex. This result suggests that the biological response of PixD does not follow a linear correlation with the light intensity but appears to be light-intensity-dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSynechocystis 3aabsorption 3ablue light 3adiffusivity 3adissociation 3agel chromatography 3alight intensity 3aphototaxis 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asignal transduction 3aspectroscopy1 aNakasone, Yusuke1 aOkajima, Koji1 aIkeuchi, Masahiko1 aTokutomi, Satoru1 aTerazima, Masahide0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 23, v. 134, no. 20 p.8336-8339dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja301540r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007700172300001600249520124300265592002801508650000801536650001601544650002601560650002201586650001401608650001101622650001501633650001701648650002101665650002101686650001001707650001201717651001001729653002701739653001901766653001001785653002001795653001001815700002101825700001701846700002201863700001801885700001901903700001801922700001901940773008801959856008602047852000902133655001202142IND60547260020221120033211.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054726002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.07.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChate, Dilip M.10aDeviations from the O3–NO–NO2 photo-stationary state in Delhi, India  ap. 353-358.  aA network of air quality and weather monitoring stations was set-up across Delhi, India, under the System of Air quality Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) project. The objective of this network was to enable better understanding of air quality in terms of atmospheric chemistry, emissions and forecasting in Delhi, one of the largest metropolises in the world. In this study, we focus on the O3–NO–NO2-triad Photo Stationary State (PSS), and investigate site-specific deviations in the Leighton Ratio (Φ) during a short period in 2012 (1–31 December). Large variations were observed in the NO (<1 ppbv to a peak of 295 ppbv), NO2 (<2 ppbv–47 ppbv) and O3 (4 ppbv–95 ppbv) mixing ratios, all of which showed strong diurnal variation. The Φ values showed large deviations from unity over the measurement period, with mostly negative deviations (Φ < 1), showing that the air masses were dominated by local sources of NOx and that the PSS was not achieved. Positive deviations (Φ > 1) were also observed occasionally, and these data were used to estimate the total peroxy radical (PO2) mixing ratios. This is the first estimate of PO2 reported for the city of Delhi and compares well with the results in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3adiurnal variation 3aemissions 3amixing 3amonitoring 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aweather 3aIndia 0aPhoto-stationary state 0aLeighton ratio 0aOzone 0aNitrogen oxides 0aSAFAR1 aGhude, Sachin D.1 aBeig, Gurfan1 aMahajan, Anoop S.1 aJena, Chinmay1 aSrinivas, Reka1 aDahiya, Anita1 aKumar, Nandini0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Oct., v. 96 p.353-358dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.07.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007800159300001600237520127700253592002801530650002001558650001901578650001101597650001001608650001601618650001101634650001201645650001101657650001101668650001201679650001201691650001001703650000801713650003001721650002001751650001001771700001701781700001801798700001701816700001701833700001701850700002101867700001701888700002001905773012101925856007402046852000902120655001202129IND60440517620221120211135.0151024e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051762DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029773502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Mee-Jung10aDistribution of organochlorines and PCB congeners in Korean human tissues  ap. 829-838.  aIn order to investigate the residual amounts of organochlorines and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Korean human tissues (blood, adipose tissue, liver, kidney cortex, and lung), the samples were collected from the autopsied cadavers of 40 men and 40 women (from teens to seventies of age) α-BHC, β-BHC, γ-BHC, σ-BHC,p,p′-DDT,p,p′-DDD,p,p′-DDE, endrin, dieldein, aldrin, and 7 marker PCBs (28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180) were determined in human tissues. The levels of organochlorines and PCB congeners indicated that they have been widely distributed in Korean human body. Positive correlations in terms of age were observed for the following cases:p,p′-DDE,p,p′-DDT, θ-DDT, PCB 118, PCB 138, PCB 153, and θ-PCB in the adipose tissue, andp,p′-DDE in the lung. Concentration of these compounds showed a significant age-related increase. Accumulation of these compounds in aged people revealed that these compounds were more slowly eliminated in our environment and risk assessment was necessary for further proper action. Significant differences in the levels of PCBs between genders were found for PCB 118 in the adipose tissue and PCB 138 in the liver. Positive correlation coefficients between tissues were detected withp,p′-DDE and β-BHC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aadipose tissue 3aaldrin 3ablood 3acorrelation 3acortex 3aelderly 3aendrin 3ahumans 3akidneys 3alindane 3aliver 3amen 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arisk assessment 3awomen1 aLee, Sang-Ki1 aYang, Ja-Yeol1 aKim, Ki-Wook1 aLee, Su-Yeon1 aLee, Won-Tae1 aChung, Kyu-Hyuck1 aYun, Yeo-Pyo1 aYoo, Young-Chan0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2005 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.829-838dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029773503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245014000181300001800321520121700339592002801556650002001584650001101604650001001615650001901625650001501644700001901659773013901678856008601817852000901903655001201912IND60654913020221120154333.0200515e20191117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065491302DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2019.16109862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghinaeenifard, Fariba12aA comparison of longitude–latitude and Euclidean distance shape descriptors for determining tree crown shapes derived from LiDAR data  ap. 8432-8449.  aPrevious studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the Euclidean distance shape descriptor for characterizing individual tree crowns derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the longitude–latitude shape descriptor for tree crown shape characterization in comparison with the Euclidean distance descriptor using LiDAR data for 43 individual tree crowns. The three-dimensional (3D) shape signatures obtained from longitude–latitude and Euclidean distance measures of the tree crowns are compared with 3D shape signatures of simulated ellipsoid and hemisphere tree crowns. Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K–S test) and Mean Square Error (MSE) are used to measure the similarity of longitude–latitude and Euclidean distance signatures. The experimental results from all 43 examined trees suggest that the longitude–latitude shape descriptor can determine tree crown shapes with different leaf traits, while Euclidean distance is only able to characterize the shape of evergreen trees. Furthermore, the longitude–latitude shape descriptor, unlike the Euclidean distance shape descriptor, is not sensitive to the number of LiDAR points from the tree crown.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevergreen trees 3aleaves 3alidar 3aremote sensing 3atree crown1 aDong, Pinliang0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Nov. 17, v. 40, no. 22 p.8432-8449dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.16109863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012100158300001800279520137000297592002801667650001601695650002901711650001601740650002201756650001501778650002801793650001801821650004201839650001801881650002101899650002201920650003001942650001501972650002301987650001502010650002202025650002902047650001302076650003202089700001702121700001402138700001802152700002102170700001702191700001702208700001802225700001902243773012602262856007402388852000902462655001202471IND60676288520221121204634.0191114e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067628852DNAL7 a10.1039/c9fo01237k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Qiannan10aPotassium sorbate suppresses intestinal microbial activity and triggers immune regulation in zebrafish (Danio rerio)  ap. 7164-7173.  aPotassium sorbate (PS) is a class of bacteriostatic antiseptic agent widely used in the food industry; the effects of its intake on host health are currently unclear. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0.1 g L⁻¹ and 1 g L⁻¹ aqueous solutions of PS for 2 weeks to investigate the impact of PS on the microecological balance of the intestinal microbiota and immune system. PS exposure triggered immune regulation of zebrafish, significantly reducing the content of diverse biomarkers in the gut, including Immunoglobulin G (IgG), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Based on high-throughput sequencing data, it was observed that PS exposure resulted in some destabilization of the microbiome composition of the zebrafish, which mainly manifested as a reduction in the abundance of specific genera and the relative levels of transcription and carbohydrate metabolism related to microbial reproductive ability and activity. These changes were consistent with the activity index of microbiota (AIM), a novel measure that we constructed. Collectively, these results illustrate that PS can affect the immune system of zebrafish by changing the composition and function of the gut microbiota, and inhibiting the metabolism of the intestinal microbiota. Our study offers a new understanding of the toxicity of PS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aantibacterial properties 3aantiseptics 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomarkers 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3afood industry 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aimmune system 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobiome 3apotassium sorbate 3areproductive performance 3atoxicity 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aChang, Haibo1 aWang, Rui1 aYou, Zhengkai1 aJiang, Shuaiming1 aMa, Chenchen1 aHuo, Dongxue1 aZhu, Xiaopeng1 aZhang, Jiachao0 tFood & function.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 10, no. 11 p.7164-7173dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9fo01237k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245007800176506010400254506007600358520201300434592002802447506003702475650002202512650002002534650001602554650001002570650001402580650001802594650001802612650001802630650001402648650001702662653002202679653001202701653002202713653001302735653001602748653001802764700002002782700002302802700001702825773011902842856008802961852000903049655001203058IND60783353720221207115840.0220906e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078335372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMason, Victoria G.10aMicroplastics alter multiple biological processes of marine benthic fauna  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMarine sediments are a sink for microplastics, making seabed organisms particularly exposed. We used meta-analysis to reveal general patterns in a surge in experimental studies and to test for microplastic impact on biological processes including invertebrate feeding, survival and energetics. Using Hedge's effect size (g), which assesses the mean response of organisms exposed to microplastics compared to control groups, we found negative impacts (significant negative g values) across all life stages (overall effect size (g) = −0.57 95 % CI [−0.76, −0.38]), with embryos most strongly affected (g = −1.47 [−2.21, −0.74]). Six of seven biological process rates were negatively impacted by microplastic exposure, including development, reproduction, growth and feeding. Survival strongly decreased (g = −0.69 [−1.21, −0.17]), likely due to cumulative effects on other processes such as feeding and growth. Among feeding habits, omnivores and deposit feeders were most negatively impacted (g = −0.93 [−1.69, −0.16] and −0.92 [−1.53, −0.31], respectively). The study incorporated the first meta-analysis to contrast the effects of leachates, virgin, aged and contaminated particles. Exposure to leachates had by far the strongest negative effects (g = −0.93 [−1.35, −0.51]), showing studies of contaminants and leachates are critical to future research. Overall, our meta-analysis reveals stronger and more consistent negative impacts of microplastics on seabed invertebrates than recorded for other marine biota. Seabed invertebrates are numerous and diverse, and crucial to bottom-up processes, including nutrient remineralisation, bentho-pelagic coupling and energy transfer through the ocean food web. Marine sediments will store microplastics over long timescales. The reveal that microplastics impinge on multiple fundamental biological processes of seabed fauna implies plastic pollution could have significant and enduring effects on the functioning of the ocean.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abenthic organisms 3aenergy transfer 3aenvironment 3afauna 3afood webs 3ainvertebrates 3ameta-analysis 3amicroplastics 3apollution 3areproduction 0aSystematic review 0aBenthos 0aFunctional traits 0aSurvival 0aDevelopment 0aMeta-analysis1 aSkov, Martin W.1 aHiddink, Jan Geert1 aWalton, Mark0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 845 p.157362-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014800167520173900315592002802054650002902082650001202111650001702123650002702140650001802167650002002185650001102205653001002216653001002226653003302236653002702269653002602296653003302322700001902355700001802374700002302392700001802415773011902433856008502552852000902637655001202646IND60773128620221121211726.0220509e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2022.1301472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshikawa, Yu10aSevere ethanol stress induces the preferential synthesis of mitochondrial disaggregase Hsp78 and formation of DUMPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  aSevere ethanol stress (>9% v/v) induces pronounced translation repression in yeast cells. However, some proteins, which are exceptionally synthesized even under translation repression, play important roles in ethanol tolerance. These proteins are expected to provide important clues for elucidating the survival strategies of yeast cells under severe ethanol stress. In this study, we identified Hsp78 as a protein effectively synthesized under severe ethanol stress. As Hsp78 is involved in mitochondrial protein quality control, we investigated the effect of severe ethanol stress on mitochondrial proteins and found that Ilv2, Kgd1, and Aco1 aggregated with Hsp78 under severe ethanol stress, forming mitochondrial deposition sites for denatured proteins, called DUMPs (Deposits of Unfolded Mitochondrial Proteins). Aggregation of mitochondrial proteins and formation of DUMPs were accelerated in hsp78∆ cells compared with those in wild-type cells. During the recovery process after ethanol removal, aggregated Ilv2 and DUMP levels rapidly decreased in wild-type cells but were maintained for a long time (>180 min) in hsp78Δ cells. Furthermore, the frequency of respiration-deficient mutants caused by severe ethanol stress was higher in hsp78∆ cells than in wild-type cells. These results indicate that severe ethanol stress damaged mitochondrial proteins and that Hsp78 was preferentially synthesized to cope with the damage, thereby suppressing the rapid increase in aggregated protein levels under stress and achieving proper clearance of aggregated proteins during the recovery process. This study provides novel insights into the adverse effects of ethanol on mitochondria and yeast response to severe ethanol stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aethanol 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial proteins 3aprotein value 3aquality control 3ayeasts 0aHsp78 0aDUMPs 0aMitochondrial protein damage 0aTranslation repression 0aSevere ethanol stress 0aRespiration-deficient mutant1 aNishino, Seiya1 aFukuda, Shizu1 aNguyet, Vo Thi Anh1 aIzawa, Shingo0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2022 July, v. 1866, no. 7 p.130147-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2022.1301473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010700174300001800281520199200299592002802291650003102319650001402350650002502364650001302389650002002402650001502422650002102437650001702458650002002475650001802495650005302513650001802566650002102584650004102605650003702646650001002683650000902693650001902702650002002721650001902741650003102760650002402791650001402815650001902829653001902848653002002867653001802887653001102905700002402916700005902940700002302999773010003022856008603122852000903208655001203217IND60659350020221117045601.0190916e20190924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065935002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.08.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParenky, Ashwin C.10aHarnessing T-cell activity against prostate cancer: A therapeutic microparticulate oral cancer vaccine  ap. 6085-6092.  aProstate Cancer specific immunotherapy in combination with immune stimulating adjuvants may serve as a viable strategy for facilitating tumor regression and preventing recurrence. In this study, an oral microparticulate vaccine encapsulating tumor associated antigens (TAA) extracted from a murine prostate cancer cell line, TRAMP-C2, was formulated with the help of a spray dryer. Microparticles were characterized in vitro to determine their physicochemical properties and antigenicity. Formulated microparticles had an average size of 4.92 ± 0.5 μm with a zeta potential of 7.92 ± 1.2 mV. In order to test our formulation for its ability to demonstrate adequate antigen presentation and co-stimulation, microparticles were tested in vitro on murine dendritic cells. In vitro biological characterization demonstrated the activation of specific immune system markers such as CD80/86, CD40, MHC-I and MHC-II. Following in vitro characterization, in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of the oral microparticulate vaccine was evaluated in C57BL/6 male mice. Combination therapy of vaccine microparticles with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) demonstrated a five-fold reduction in tumor volume as compared to non-vaccinated mice. At the cellular level, cyclophosphamide and GM-CSF augmented the vaccine response as indicated by the reduced tumor volume and significant elevation of cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) CD8+ and (T-helper) CD4+ T-cells compared to mice receiving vaccine microparticles alone. Furthermore, our studies indicate a significant reduction in T-regulatory cells (T-regs) in mice receiving vaccine along with GM-CSF and cyclophosphamide, one of the immune escape mechanisms linked to tumor growth and progression. Thus, oral microparticulate vaccines have the potential to trigger a robust anti-tumor cellular response, and in combination with clinically relevant agents, significantly resist tumor growth and progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aadjuvants 3aantigen presentation 3aantigens 3acancer vaccines 3acell lines 3acyclophosphamide 3acytotoxicity 3adendritic cells 3aencapsulation 3agranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3aimmunotherapy 3ain vitro studies 3amacrophage colony-stimulating factor 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amales 3amice 3amicroparticles 3amouth neoplasms 3aneoplasm cells 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aremission 3azeta potential 0aCancer vaccine 0aProstate cancer 0aOral delivery 0aGM-CSF1 aAkalkotkar, Archana1 aMulla, Nihal S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9414-63551 aD'Souza, Martin J.0 tVaccine.g2019 Sept. 24, v. 37, no. 41 p.6085-6092dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245013000175300001600305506002800321520199800349592002802347506003702375650002102412650002102433650002202454650001402476650001602490650001302506653001302519653002202532653003102554653003502585700002102620700002002641700002502661773014002686856007902826852000902905655001202914IND60773838920221207070029.0200625e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077383892DNAL7 a10.22103/jab.2020.25282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPour-Aboughadareh, Alireza10aComparative assessment of SCoT and CBDP markers for investigation of genetic diversity existing in different aegilops species  ap. 153-174.  aResource is Open Access  a<strong>Objective</strong> <br />The main goals of this study were investigation of genetic diversity in 103 <em>Aegilops</em> accessions and comparison of the efficiency of start codon targeted (SCoT) and CAAT box-derived polymorphism (CBDP) markers. <br /> <br /><strong> Materials and methods</strong> <br />In this study, the genetic diversity in 103 <em>Aegilops</em> accessions belonging to seven species including seven samples of <em>Ae. caudata</em>, 14 samples of <em>Ae. crassa</em>, 19 samples of <em>Ae. cylindrica</em>, 11 samples of <em>Ae. neglecta</em>, 20 samples of <em>Ae. tauschii</em>, 15 samples of <em>Ae. triuncialis</em> and 17 samples of <em>Ae. umbellulata</em> was evaluated using 15 SCoT and 15 CBDP primers. <br /> <br /><strong>Results</strong> <br />In total, 15 SCoT and 15 CBDP primers amplified 164 and 141 polymorphic bands, respectively. SCoT primers showed the highest values for all of the informativeness parameters than CBDP primers. However, both molecular markers indicated the same PIC values. The results of analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that the highest proportion of genetic variance referred to within species. Among all species, <em>Ae. cylindrica</em> had the highest values of genetic parameters. Although cluster analysis based on each marker system classified all accessions into two main groups, the grouping pattern obtained from CBDP data indicated a clear phylogenetic relationship among <em>Aegilops</em> species compared to SCoT data. Besides, the results of clustering were confirmed by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) analysis. <br /> <br /><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />On the whole, both molecular markers revealed good capability in depicting of polymorphism among tested accessions. However, CBDP markers provided a vivid grouping pattern for evaluated samples. Hence, the use of this technique individually or in combination with other molecular markers is recommended for phylogenetic assessments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acluster analysis 3agenetic variance 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeny 3astart codon 3avariance 0aaegilops 0agenetic diversity 0amolecular targeted-markers 0aprincipal coordinates analysis1 aEtminan, Alireza1 aShooshtari, Lia1 aMaleki-Tabrizi, Neda0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2020 Feb., v. 11, no. 4 p.153-174dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2020.25283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245018100168300001400349520108100363592002801444650002101472650002501493650002201518650001501540650001801555650001101573650002601584650002201610650001601632650002401648650001401672650001601686653002501702653003601727653004001763653002101803653001601824700002301840700001901863700002401882773011401906856007802020852000902098655001202107IND60614568220221117173513.0181029e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061456822DNAL7 a10.2478/nbec-2018-00032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarageorgou, Ioanna14aThe effect of 2-hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin on the stability of polyphenolic compounds from Moringa oleifera Lam leaf extracts in a natural low-transition temperature mixture  ap. 29-37.  aPolyphenol extracts from Moringa oleifera leaves (MoL) were obtained with a glycerol-based low-transition temperature mixture (LTTM) and a combination of LTTM with 2-hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD). The extracts were maintained at 4, 22 and 50 °C for 18 days and the antiradical activity (AAR) was recorded to detect modifications in the antioxidant activity of the extracts. AAR displayed a constant decline at every temperature tested, following pseudo first-order kinetics and the decay constants suggested that the presence of HP-β-CD had a protective action, slowing down AAR decline. The analysis of the polyphenolic profiles using liquid chromatography-diode array-mass spectrometry revealed that after storage for 18 days at 50 °C, the major quercetin glycosides occurring in MoL were extensively degraded. Based on the detection of protocatechuic acid in the stored extracts, putative pathways of flavonol glycoside degradation were proposed. It was concluded that the decomposition of these components was mainly responsible for the AAR decline observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMoringa oleifera 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3aglycosides 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apolyphenols 3aprotocatechuic acid 3aquercetin 3atemperature 0aAntiradical activity 0a2-hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin 0aLow-transition temperature mixtures 0aMoringa oleifera 0aPolyphenols1 aGrigorakis, Spyros1 aLalas, Stavros1 aMakris, Dimitris P.0 tNova biotechnologica et chimica.g2018 July 01, v. 17, no. 1 p.29-37dSciendowJournal:21370x1338-69057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/nbec-2018-00033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002100147245006400168300001600232520136900248592002801617650000901645650003201654650001001686650002001696650002701716650001101743650001701754650001101771650001601782700002501798700002801823700002201851773011901873856008301992961001302075852000902088655001202097IND4456680520221120221227.0141111e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445668052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ifset.2011.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowker, Brian C.10aTenderization of beef loins using a high efficiency sparker  ap. 135-141.  aThe tenderizing effects of treating beef loins with high-pressure shockwaves from a sparker source were evaluated. Samples were sparker treated as either steaks or intact loin roasts on day 0 and Warner–Bratzler shear force (WBSF) was measured on days 0 and 7. With the sparker head 7.5-cm above the samples, non-aged steaks receiving 80 pulses at two locations had lower WBSF than controls. Aging decreased WBSF in all samples. With the sparker head set at 3.75-cm, treated samples exhibited 20–25% lower WBSF values than controls on day 0 and all of the treated samples demonstrated WBSF reductions >10%. Samples treated as individual steaks and intact loin roasts had similar tenderness improvements. The maximum observed tenderness improvements were 37% (entire steak), 56% (medial portion of steak), and 31% (lateral portion of steak). Data from this study indicate that high-pressure shockwaves generated from a sparker source are an effective postharvest technology for tenderizing beef. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: Improving meat tenderness is essential to enhancing the value and consumer appeal of inferior quality meat cuts. Demonstrating the ability to tenderize tough cuts of meat using sparker generated high-pressure shockwaves is an important step in providing the meat industry with an effective postharvest technology for improving product quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3alivestock and meat industry 3aloins 3ameat tenderness 3apostharvest technology 3aroasts 3ashear stress 3asteaks 3atenderizing1 aSchaefer, Raymond B.1 aGrapperhaus, Michael J.1 aSolomon, Morse B.0 tInnovative food science & emerging technologies.g2011 Apr., v. 12, no. 2 p.135-141dElsevier Ltdx1466-85647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ifset.2011.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024004200131040001800173100002100191245012000212300001600332520134700348592002801695650002701723650002101750650001501771650001501786650002201801650000901823650002301832650002101855650001201876650001401888650002001902650003201922650001001954700002201964773009901986856008502085852000902170655001202179IND4469652920221122232541.0141111e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446965292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2012.04.0162doi7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2012.04.0162chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKathirvel, Priya10aEffect of a membrane permeable metal chelator on iron and hemoglobin-mediated lipid oxidation in washed fish muscle  ap. 346-352.  aThe effect of a membrane permeable metal chelator, Nâ²,Nâ²,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN) on iron and hemoglobin-mediated lipid oxidation in washed cod muscle was evaluated. TPEN stimulated added iron-mediated lipid oxidation in washed cod muscle (pH 6.3) while ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) did not. TPEN delivered iron to cellular membranes of cod muscle more effectively compared to EDTA (p<0.05). FeâTPEN remained intact in the presence of excess EDTA which indicated that TPEN had a relatively high affinity for iron. TPEN also promoted lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) formation in washed cod alone, presumably by chelating and thereby activating endogenous metals. LOOH and hydrogen peroxide formation due to FeâTPEN may partly explain the observation that TPEN accelerated trout hemoglobin-mediated lipid oxidation in cod muscle. Peroxides accelerate oxidation of hemoglobin (Hb). Oxidized trout Hb readily releases hemin that efficiently decomposes LOOH to free radicals that, in turn, incur oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These studies indicate that TPEN activates low molecular weight metals that are endogenously present in washed cod and facilitates transport of metals to cellular membranes which exacerbates the ability of hemoglobin to promote lipid oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3achelating agents 3acod (fish) 3ahemoglobin 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3amolecular weight 3amuscles 3aoxidation 3aplasma membrane 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3atrout1 aRichards, Mark P.0 tFood research international.g2012 Oct., v. 48, no. 2 p.346-352dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2012.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05177naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007100163300001400234506002800248520377700276592002804053506003704081650002204118650002004140650001404160650001104174650001604185650001104201650001704212650001404229650001304243650002204256650001804278651001404296653002904310653002704339653001404366653002404380653002904404653002604433653001404459653001904473773011504492856007904607852000904686655001204695IND60773839020221207045743.0170823e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077383902DNAL7 a10.17969/rtp.v7i2.26482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiregar, Kiman10aTinjauan Penilaian Siklus Hidup Bahan Bakar Biodiesel di Indonesia  ap. 81-99.  aResource is Open Access  aAbstrak. Saat ini permasalahan lingkungan menjadi pertimbangan yang sangat penting dalam produksi biodiesel. Meskipun sumber energi ini (biodiesel) dianggap sebagai karbon netral, namun dalam rangkaian proses produksinya masih menghasilkan berbagai gas berbahaya ke lingkungan. Negara-negara Eropa dan Amerika mengklaim bahwa produksi biodiesel dari minyak kelapa sawit memberikan kontribusi emisi karbon ke atmosfer sepanjang jalur produksinya. Selain itu, US EPA-NODA dan EU RED menyatakan bahwa biodiesel dari minyak kelapa sawit hanya dapat mengurangi emisi GWP 17% dan 19% dibandingkan dengan bahan bakar berbasis fosil. Mengingat bahwa persyaratan minimum US adalah 20% dan EU adalah 35%, maka minyak kelapa sawit dari Indonesia mengalami kesulitan untuk memasuki pasar global. Pendekatan ilmiah harus dilakukan oleh Indonesia untuk mengatasi masalah ini. Tinjauan dari berbagai literatur menyebutkan bahwa keberlanjutan produksi biodiesel dari kelapa sawit lebih baik dibandingkan jarak pagar, bahkan apabila dibandingkan dengan bahan baku yang lain seperti lobak. Tinjauan dari berbagai literatur menyebutkan bahwa nilai karbon yang dapat diserap oleh hutan primer lebih tinggi dari hutan sekunder dan dari perkebunan kelapa sawit. Kondisi inilah yang menjadi alasan mengapa dunia menyebutkan bahwa Indonesia sebagai penyebab pemanasan global, meskipun penelitian lebih lanjut masih dibutuhkan berdasarkan data terakhir di Indonesia. Dari kondisi ril di Indonesia diperoleh nilai GRK sebelum produksi stabil yaitu 2.575,47 kg-CO2eq./ton-minyak biodiesel (BDF) untuk minyak kelapa sawit dan 3.057,74 kg-CO2eq./ton-BDF untuk minyak jarak pagar. Ketika produksi sudah stabil diperoleh nilai GRK sebesar 1.511,96 kg-CO2eq./ton-BDF untuk minyak kelapa sawit and 380,52 kg-CO2eq./ton-BDF untuk minyak jarak pagar. Jika kita bandingkan dengan minyak solar, maka nilai emisi CO2eq. dapat diturunkan 49,27 % untuk biodiesel dari minyak kelapa sawit dan 88,45 % untuk biodiesel dari minyak jarak pagar. Review of Life Cycle Assesment of Biodiesel in Indonesia Abstract. Currently, environmental consideration becomes the most important issue in biodiesel production. Eventhough source of energy is considered as carbon neutral, the production path may release various environmentally hazardous gasses. European and American countries claim that production of biodiesel from palm oil contributes carbon emission to the atmosphere along its production path. Furthermore, US EPA-NODA and EU RED stated that palm oil based biodiesel can only reduce emission of GWP by 17 % and 19 % compared to fossil-fuel based. Considering on the minimum requirement is 20 % for US and 35 % for EU, CPO from Indonesia experiences difficulties to enter the global market. Scientific approach should be undertaken by Indonesia to address this issue. Summary of the literature mentions that the sustainability of biodiesel from palm oil is better than Jatropha curcas, compared to other sources of raw materials, such as rapeseed. Summary of the literature mentions that the value of carbon that can be absorbed by primary forest is higher than secondary forest and palm oil plantation. This is the reason why world claims Indonesia on global warming issues although further research is still needed based on the latest data. From the real condition in Indonesia, in which GHG value before stable productivity is 2 575.47 kg-CO2eq./ton-Biodiesel fuel(BDF) for oil palm and 3 057.74 kg-CO2eq./ton-BDF for Jatropha curcas. When the productivity has reached stability, the GHG value is 1 511.96 kg-CO2eq./ton-BDF for oil palm and 380.52 kg-CO2eq./ton-BDF for Jatropha curcas. If we compared to diesel fuel, CO2eq. emission is reduced up to 49.27 % and 88.45 % for BDF-CPO and BDF-CJCO, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aElaeis guineensis 3aJatropha curcas 3abiodiesel 3acarbon 3adiesel fuel 3aenergy 3afossil fuels 3apalm oils 3arapeseed 3asecondary forests 3aworld markets 3aIndonesia 0aPotensi pemanasan global 0apenilaian siklus hidup 0abiodiesel 0aminyak kelapa sawit 0aGlobal warming potential 0alife cycle assessment 0abiodiesel 0acrude palm oil0 tRona Teknik Pertanian.g2014 Oct., v. 7, no. 2 p.81-99dSyiah Kuala UniversitywJournal:27803x2528-26547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17969/rtp.v7i2.26483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009600171300001400267500001500281520092600296592002801222650001701250650001301267650001401280650002301294650002801317650001301345650001601358650002001374650001601394650002001410653002501430653002201455653001601477653002401493653005101517653001701568653002501585653001701610653002401627700002101651773012401672856008301796852000901879655001201888IND60601573020181023000000.0180706e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2013.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachmann, Patrick10aFaut-il prévenir ou traiter la dénutrition associée aux cancers ORL, quand et comment ?  ap. 73-78.  a2019-12-06  aHead and neck cancers early impair oral intakes. Often affecting people at risk, the malnutrition associated to head and neck cancers is common and is further impaired by treatments’ toxicities and functional consequences. Rehabilitation after treatment is frequently partial. Nutritional care must be implemented as soon as the diagnosis is done in order to minimize the negative nutritional effects of disease and of the treatments; in case of radio-chemotherapy, personalized dietetic counseling is recommended due to its effect on quality of life and reduction in the toxicity burden. Enteral nutrition is often required: prophylactic gastrostomy used in case of heavy treatments should be performed in association with swallowing and chewing exercises. During palliative care, the placement of a gastrostomy should be discussed early but decided only for patients in good condition with reasonable life expectancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3amalnutrition 3atoxicity 3alongevity 3aat-risk population 3ahead and neck neoplasms 3apatients 3adeglutition 3aquality of life 3amastication 3aenteral feeding 0aHead and Neck cancer 0aEnteral nutrition 0arisk groups 0aNutrition entérale 0aCancer des voies aéro-digestives supérieures 0aDénutrition 0aConseil diététique 0aMalnutrition 0aDietetic counseling1 aQuilliot, Didier0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2014 Feb., v. 28, no. 1 p.73-78dElsevier SASwJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2013.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001500165245003400180300001300214520110500227592002801332650002701360650001501387650004001402650003001442650001901472650001501491650002001506650003401526650003201560650001401592650001201606650001201618650002201630650001101652650007901663650002001742650000901762650004101771650008601812650001401898651002601912651003301938700001501971700001501986700001602001700001402017700001402031700001502045700001502060700001602075773011002091856008202201961000902283852000902292655001202301IND4461282220221123004156.0141112e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446128222DNAL7 a216652372pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavini, G.10aEpizootic heamorragic disease  ap. 1-17.  aEpizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an infectious non-contagious viral disease transmitted by insects of the genus Culicoides which affects wild and domestic ruminants. The causative agent, the epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), belongs to the family Reoviridae, genus Orbivirus and shares many morphological and structural characteristics with the other members of the genus such as bluetongue, African horse sickness and equine encephalosis viruses. In recent years EHD outbreaks have been reported in countries bordering the European Union. They caused disease in cattle and severe repercussion on the livestock industry of the affected countries. In the light of recent European bluetongue epizootic these events pose an increasing threat to the European Union. This review includes the most recent information regarding the virus and the disease as well as tools for its diagnosis and control. It is our conviction that more attention should be drawn to both EHDV and the disease itself in order to fulfil all these gaps and not to be unprepared in case future possible incursions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican horse sickness 3aCulicoides 3aEpizootic hemorrhagic disease virus 3aEquine encephalosis virus 3aEuropean Union 3abluetongue 3acattle diseases 3aepizootic hemorrhagic disease 3alivestock and meat industry 3aruminants 3aviruses 2aAnimals 2aArthropod Vectors 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosisxeconomicsxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aCeratopogonidae 2aDeer 2aHemorrhagic Disease Virus, Epizootic 2aReoviridae Infectionsxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aRuminants 0aEuropexepidemiology. 0aNorth Americaxepidemiology.1 aAfonso, A.1 aMellor, P.1 aAradaib, I.1 aYadin, H.1 aSanaa, M.1 aWilson, W.1 aMonaco, F.1 aDomingo, M.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2011 Aug., v. 91, no. 1 p.1-17dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245008800179300001800267500001500285520075300300592002801053650002001081650001101101650001301112650001501125650000801140650001201148650001201160650001201172650001801184650003301202650007301235650002801308650003301336650001401369650007901383650002301462651001101485651001101496653001501507700001601522700001701538700002101555700002701576700001701603700001801620700001901638700001501657700001301672700001801685700001701703700001701720700001901737773009801756856004801854852000901902655001201911IND4473653820221120221100.0121003e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447365382DNAL7 a214422332pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-011-0968-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraujo, J.10aDetection of hantaviruses in Brazilian rodents by SYBR-Green-based real-time RT-PCR  ap. 1269-1274.  a2019-12-05  aCurrent knowledge of the pathogenic hantavirus indicates that wild rodents are its primary natural reservoir.

One hundred sixty-four rodents native to the Atlantic Forest biome were captured in São Paulo State, Brazil, and their tissues were tested. The presence of hantavirus RNA was detected in sixteen rodents: three specimens of Akodon montensis, three of Akodon cursor, two of Necromys lasiurus, one of Juliomys sp., one of Thaptomys nigrita, five of Oligoryzomys nigripes, and one of Oryzomys sp.

The European Union has implemented a set of very strict procedures for the approval to grow, import and/or utilize GMOs as food or food ingredients. Thus, analytical methods for detection of the GMOs are necessary in order to verify compliance with labeling requirements. There are few effective screening methods for highly processed GM (genetically modified) products. Four genes (CP4-EPSPS, Cry1A(b), BAR, and, PAT) are common exogenous genes used in commercialized transgenic soybean, maize, and rice. In the present study, a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed to simultaneously detect the four exogenous genes and one endogenous gene in two runs. We tested eleven representative highly processed products samples (soya lecithin, soya protein powder, chocolate beverage, infant rice cereal, soybean refine oil, soybean salad oil, maize oil, maize protein powder, maize starch, maize jam) using the developed method, and amplicons of endogenous gene and transgenic fragments were obtained from all the processed products except for soybean refined oil, soybean salad oil and maize oil, and the sensitivity was 0.005%. These results indicate that multiplex nested PCR is appropriate for qualitative detection of transgenic soybean, maize and rice in highly processed products except for refined oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanalytical methods 3acocoa (beverage) 3acompliance 3acorn 3acorn oil 3acorn starch 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aimports 3ainfants 3aingredients 3ajams 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apowders 3aprocessing technology 3aproteins 3arice 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans1 aQingzhang, Li1 aXuejun, Gao1 aYanbo, Yu1 aLu, Li1 aMinghui, Zhang0 tFood control.g2011 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.1617-1623dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01783naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245011100165300001800276520064300294592002800937650002300965650002300988650001101011650001101022650001301033650001901046650001401065650001401079700002101093700002001114700001601134700005801150773012101208856008301329852000901412655001201421IND60653933520221116183908.0190722e20190628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065393352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b021052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Xue-Li10aVisible-Light-Induced Copper-Catalyzed Decarboxylative Coupling of Redox-Active Esters with N-Heteroarenes  ap. 5728-5732.  aHerein we report a protocol for visible-light-induced copper-catalyzed decarboxylative coupling reactions between N-heteroarenes and redox-active esters.

As ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays an essential role in cholesterol metabolism, its modulation may be one of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the experienced benefit of traditional recipes. Intense research activity has been dedicated to the identification of natural products from traditional medicine that regulate ABCA1 expression.This review surveys natural products, originating from ethnopharmacologically used plants, fungi or marine sources, which influence ABCA1 expression, providing a reference for future study.Information on regulation of ABCA1 expression by natural compounds from traditional medicine was extracted from ancient and modern books, materia medica, and electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and ResearchGate).More than 60 natural compounds from traditional medicine, especially traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), are reported to regulate ABCA1 expression in different in vitro and in vivo models (such as cholesterol efflux and atherosclerotic animal models). These active compounds belong to the classes of polyketides, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, tannins, alkaloids, steroids, amino acids and others. Several compounds appear very promising in vivo, which need to be further investigated in animal models of diseases related to ABCA1 or in clinical studies.Natural products from traditional medicine constitute a large promising pool for compounds that regulate ABCA1 expression, and thus may prevent/treat diseases related to cholesterol metabolism, like atherosclerosis or Alzheimer's disease. In many cases, the molecular mechanisms of these natural products remain to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aABC transporters 3aAlzheimer disease 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aactive ingredients 3aalkaloids 3aamino acids 3aanimal models 3aatherosclerosis 3acholesterol 3acholesterol homeostasis 3adatabases 3ahomeopathic drugs 3aliver 3apain 3aphenylpropanoids 3apolyketides 3asurveys 3atannins 3aterpenoids 0aABCA1 0aNatural products 0aMacrophages 0aCardiovascular disease 0aCholesterol metabolism1 aHiebl, Verena1 aXu, Tao1 aLadurner, Angela1 aAtanasov, Atanas G.1 aHeiss, Elke H.1 aDirsch, Verena M.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 249 p.112444-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1124443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002800157245012600185300001400311506002800325520109900353592002801452506003701480650002501517650001301542650001801555650001401573650000901587651001201596653005001608653000901658653002201667653001701689653001501706653001201721653001201733653002801745700003001773773016401803856009201967852000902059655001202068IND60773839420221207064445.0170815e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077383942DNAL7 a10.21498/2518-1017.4(21).2013.568482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aСіленко, В.

To assess the demand for sorghum seed material and sufficiency of domestic seeds. Results. The analysis of the State register for the period of 2002–2012 showed that there was the tendency not only towards increasing quantity of sorghum crops in general but their substitution by hybrids of foreign breeding. During the period from 2002 to 2017, 72 sorghum varieties were entered on the State register in total, among them only 12 varieties were of domestic breeding, the rest 60 was presented by foreign breeding institutions. Investigation results allowed to determine that the production of base and prebase seeds of sorghum in 2010 amounted to 1,3 t, in 2016 was 43 t. During the same period the production of sugar sorghum increased from 0,2 to 12,0 t, grass sorghum – from 4,0 to 83 t. In 2017, requirements of acreage of such crops as grass sorghum and broomcorn were completely satisfied by the amount of grown seeds. At the same time, the need for seeds of sorghum and sugar sorghum can not be covered completely at the expense of domestic varieties reproduction. In 2017, general demand for sorghum seeds was 400,5 t, among which only 42,0 t was of domestic production. The rest demand for seeds will be met at the expense of import of foreign breeding seeds into the country to be grown and prepared for sowing abroad. Conclusions. In the Register of plant varieties suitable for dissemination in Ukraine, there are 72 sorghum varieties among them only 12 varieties were of domestic breeding, that is 17%, as compared to 83% of recommended great sorghum varieties of foreign breeding. In Ukraine, the area occupied by sorghum cultivation was 22,8 thou ha in 2005, up to 2017 it increased to 89,0 thou ha, and accordingly the demand for seeds run up from 102,6 to 400,5 t. The area occupied by the sugar sorghum in 2005 amounted to only 2,6 thou ha, in 2017 – 20,0 thou ha, that accordingly determined increase of demand for seed material from 13,0 to 99,9 t. In 2017, the part of the area where domestic hybrids of sorghum are growing was 10%, hybrids of sugar sorghum – 12%, that was indicative of very poor situation with domestic varieties dissemination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSorghum bicolor 3aacreage 3agrasses 3aimports 3asugars 3aUkraine 0agreat millet 0avarieties and hybrids 0ayielding 0aseeds 0aplanting acreage1 aГаврилюк, М.

L.10aComparison of Two Passive Flux Methods to Measure Ammonia Volatilization  ap. 949-956.  aepub  aSome micrometeorological methods for measuring NH₃ loss use passive flux samplers with oxalic acid coated glass tubes. In previous work, we observed that tubes that had been exposed in plots with broiler litter, cleaned with 0.32 mol L⁻¹ HCl and recoated, had uneven oxalic acid coating, which may lead to NH₃ bypass. One of the objectives of this study was to measure the NH₃–trapping capacity of previously exposed tubes that were cleaned by either washing and scrubbing with 0.32 mol L⁻¹ HCl or heating at 560°C for 1 h before being recoated with oxalic acid. There were no detectable differences between cleaning methods in adsorbed NH₃, but tubes cleaned with 0.32 mol L⁻¹ HCl had uneven oxalic acid coating that led to a 7.3% NH₃ bypass. Tubes cleaned by heating at 560°C for 1 h had even coating and no NH₃ bypass. Presumably, heating the tubes at 560°C oxidized volatile organic compounds bound to the glass, which were acting as nucleating points for oxalic acid. A second objective of this study was to compare a passive flux method with masts on the periphery of a circular plot (PM method) to a method with a central, rotating mast at the center of the plot (CM method). Results from three field studies on tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.) pastures showed that the PM method underestimated NH₃ losses by 31 to 37% compared with the CM method. These underestimations were probably caused by NH₃ bypass from tubes exposed to background NH₃. Our results suggest that the CM method may be preferable to the PM method when environmental conditions favor NH₃ bypass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aammonia 3acleaning 3acoatings 3aenvironmental factors 3aglass 3aheat 3ahydrochloric acid 3aoxalic acid 3apastures 3apoultry manure 3asamplers 3avolatile organic compounds 3avolatilization 3awashing1 aVaio, N.1 aRema, J.1 aBraun, L.1 aKissel, D.

In this review, we will provide a comprehensive summary of the properties, synthesis, characterisation, and application of 2D materials in the context of electrochemistry and related scientific fields. Firstly, the structural, electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, and a variety of preparation and characterisation techniques of 2D materials are presented. Secondly, current electrochemical understanding of 2D and layered materials and their modification is discussed. Lastly, future perspectives and new frontiers in optoelectronics, photocatalysis, and renewable energy using 2D materials are outlined.Our primary focus is on group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and other emerging 2D materials beyond graphene, including their heterostructures. These nanomaterials are essential for the next generation of devices in tuneable electrochemistry, sensing, and photovoltaics. Although broad in scope, this review is not an exhaustive list of facts; rather, it summarises the established knowledge and pinpoints the most promising future trends. It is aimed at readers with background in electrochemistry wanting to broaden their perspective or initiate research on 2D materials as well as those with 2D materials expertise looking to work on electrochemistry-based applications, such as energy storage and conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 0a2D materials 0aTMDC 0aHeterostructures 0aElectrochemistry 0aPhotovoltaics1 aToth, Peter S.0 tApplied Materials Today.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx2352-94077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2017.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011000168300001600278520096800294592002801262650001601290650001201306650001101318650001601329650001201345650001901357650002101376650001101397650001901408700002001427700001801447700001501465700001601480773012501496856008601621852000901707655001201716IND60099695920221123032049.0150808e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009969592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2011.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Xijun12aA possible structure of retrograded maize starch speculated by UV and IR spectra of it and its components  ap. 119-124.  a“Retrogradation” has been used to describe the changes that occur in starch after gelatinization, from an initially amorphous state to a more ordered or crystalline state, which has a significant impact on starch application in food, textiles and materials fields. But mechanism of starch retrogradation is still unclear until now and there is no breakthrough in this area. Here we are speculating a possible structure of retrograded maize starch by UV (binding with iodine) and IR spectra of it and its compositions. We speculate that nucleation of retrograded starch origins from combination of reducing end of amylopectin and non-reducing end of amylose, and retrogradation terminates at combining of non-reducing end of amylopectin and reducing end of amylose. The chain length of resistant digestion retrograded starch should be nearly same. The hydroxyl associated with sixth carbon atoms of glucan must form hydrogen bond with other hydroxyl of starch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3acarbon 3acorn starch 3afabrics 3agelatinization 3ahydrogen bonding 3aiodine 3aretrogradation1 aZhang, Kunsheng1 aLuo, Qingfeng1 aWang, Chen1 aLiu, Xueyan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 50, no. 1 p.119-124dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2011.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100003100189245006200220500002200282520104800304592002801352653001901380653001401399653002501413653003101438700002801469700001801497700002001515700002001535773006801555856008201623852000901705655001201714IND60569322220221118115101.0170524s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056932222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apmt.2017.05.0042doi7 aPMC57210992pmcid7 a292387412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChronopoulos, Demetrios D.10aChemistry, properties, and applications of fluorographene  aPre-press version  aFluorographene, formally a two-dimensional stoichiometric graphene derivative, attracted remarkable attention of the scientific community due to its extraordinary physical and chemical properties. We overview the strategies for the preparation of fluorinated graphene derivatives, based on top-down and bottom-up approaches. The physical and chemical properties of fluorographene, which is considered as one of the thinnest insulators with a wide electronic band gap, are presented. Special attention is paid to the rapidly developing chemistry of fluorographene, which was advanced in the last few years. The unusually high reactivity of fluorographene, which can be chemically considered perfluorinated hydrocarbon, enables facile and scalable access to a wide portfolio of graphene derivatives, such as graphene acid, cyanographene and allyl-graphene. Finally, we summarize the so far reported applications of fluorographene and fluorinated graphenes, spanning from sensing and bioimaging to separation, electronics and energy technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 0afluorographene 0achemistry 0agraphene derivatives 0acovalent functionalization1 aBakandritsos, Aristides1 aPykal, Martin1 aZbořil, Radek,1 aOtyepka, Michal0 tApplied Materials Today.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx2352-94077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2017.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245005000160520152700210592002801737650002301765650002301788650001101811650000901822650002101831650001501852650002101867650002001888650001201908650001301920650002801933650001001961650002001971651001601991700002002007700001902027773012802046856007402174852000902248655001202257IND60652695120221121225902.0190713e20181024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065269512DNAL7 a10.3390/su101138582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchenk, Patrick10aMotivations and Constraints of Meat Avoidance  aReducing the consumption of meat can make a significant contribution to sustainable development. However, at least in Western societies with their already rather high levels of per-capita meat consumption, only a minority of consumers reduces meat intake by following a vegetarian or plant-based diet. To arrive at a differentiated understanding of the conditions of meat avoidance, we empirically assess the importance of a broad set of specific motivations and constraints previously discussed in the literature, including specific benefits, particular constraints, social norms, and a vegetarian self-identity. The analysis is based on a random sample of students at the university of Zurich (Switzerland)&mdash;a social group exhibiting a rather high prevalence of plant-based diets and vegetarianism. Researching this young and educated population sheds light on the motivational underpinnings of consumer segments especially willing to reduce meat intake. Data were collected in November and December 2016. We found that a vegetarian self-identity, both injunctive and descriptive social norms, and convenience are the most important direct determinants of meat avoidance among this young and highly educated consumer segment. Furthermore, the results suggest that a vegetarian self-identity mediates the effects of ethical, health-related, and environmental benefits, taste as a constraint and partially the injunctive norm. Pecuniary costs of a vegetarian diet are not significantly correlated with meat avoidance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumers (people) 3aecosystem services 3aethics 3ameat 3ameat consumption 3amotivation 3aplant-based diet 3asocial behavior 3asociety 3astudents 3asustainable development 3ataste 3avegetarian diet 3aSwitzerland1 aRössel, Jörg,1 aScholz, Manuel0 tSustainability.g2018 Oct. 24, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101138583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01396naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010400167300001400271520050900285592002800794650003100822650001500853650001600868650001300884650001500897700001900912773008500931856008101016852000901097655001201106IND60120590020221118040411.0150208e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012059002DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617150100632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKononova, L.

Here, using a long-term located experiment, we assessed the effects of 18 years’ ryegrass/milk vetch amendment with (NF, 150 kg N ha⁻¹) or without nitrogen (N) fertilizer input (CK), on soil carbon management indices, paddy methane (CH₄) emissions and rice yields. The results showed that green manure, rather than fertilization, played a critical role in soil CMI, increasing the carbon pool index but reducing the carbon management index. The increased soil organic carbon and the reduced labile organic carbon were the main causes for this performance. Additionally, the effects of both fertilization and green manure amendment on CH₄ emissions were insignificant; however, fertilization significantly increased grain yield by 39.30% compared to CK. As a result, the methane emission intensity under fertilization treatment was notably lower than that from CK. The findings suggest that green manure amendment is a profitable manipulation for enhancing carbon sequestration without increasing paddy CH₄ emissions. However, this cannot substitute the critical role of N fertilizer in rice production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3aLolium 3aagricultural development 3aagronomy 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aemissions factor 3agrain yield 3agreen manures 3alabile carbon 3amanure amendments 3amethane 3amethane production 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apaddies 3arice 3asoil1 aXue, Lixiang 1 aWang, Jing 1 aPetropoulos, Evangelos 1 aXue, Lihong 1 aYang, Linzhang 0 tAgronomy.g2022 June 28, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120715483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014900165300001400314520161800328592002801946650002901974650002502003650001302028650000702041650001402048650001902062650003302081650001102114650001602125700001902141700001402160773008502174856008102259852000902340655001202349IND60120590320221118040426.0150208e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012059032DNAL7 a10.1134/S002626171501004X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerikvand, P.10aRSM optimization of dibenzothiophene biodesulfurization by newly isolated strain of Rhodococcus erythropolis PD1 in aqueous and biphasic systems  ap. 65-72.  aDibenzothiophene (DBT) is a recalcitrant organic sulfur compound which remains in the crude oil after hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process and can be removed by biodesulfurization (BDS). The objective of this study was the isolation of novel strain capable more BDS rate and optimization of DBT removal by both growing and resting cells. Response surface Methodology (RSM) was applied for evaluating the interactive effects of three independent factors including DBT concentration, temperature and pH. The three factors Box-Benken design with three center points was performed to generate the optimum condition for DBT removal by growing cells in aqueous medium and resting cells in biphasic medium. Among the isolated bacteria from oil-contaminated soil, a gram-positive, non-spore forming isolate designated PD1 showed the high BDS rate and capable to convert the DBT to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) as the final product. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that all of the studied parameters in the growing cells system showed significant effect on BDS rate, while in the resting cells effect of pH was not significant (P > 0.05). Maximum 2-HBP production (0.21 mM) by growing cells of PD1 strain was obtained at 0.38 mM initial DBT concentration, pH 6.88 and temperature of 27.57°C. For resting cells, maximum BDS activity of PD1 strain was determined as 0.46 μM 2-HBP/min g DCW at optimum pH 6.29, temperature of 26.13°C and DBT concentration of 7.73 mM. The BDS efficiency of Rhodococcus erythropolis PD1 (NCBI Gene Bank Accession no.

However, the molecular mechanisms of GNPP determination are not well understood. A rice GNPP mutant, ngp4a, was isolated from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized rice library of japonica Nipponbare. ngp4a produced fewer grains than wild-type plants at maturity as the number of secondary branches decreased significantly. The mutant phenotype of ngp4a was controlled by a recessive nuclear gene, which was fine-mapped into a 155.2 kb region on chromosome 4. One GNPP-related gene, Gnp4/LAX2 (LOC_Os04g32510), was found in the mapped region. The deletion of 3-bp nucleotides in the first exon of NGP4A resulted in a threonine residue loss. The mutation in NGP4A was responsible for the mutant phenotype of ngp4a. These results suggest that NGP4A is a new allele for Gnp4 and LAX2, while the mutant phenotype and underlying causation differed. Notably, transcriptome analysis revealed that NGP4A could regulate GNPP determination through the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Our results further elucidated the vital roles of Gnp4/LAX2 in GNPP determination, providing a new genetic resource and theoretical basis to further explore the molecular mechanisms of GNPP in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aagronomy 3aalleles 3abiosynthesis 3achromosomes 3aexons 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3anucleotides 3apanicles 3aphenotype 3arice 3athreonine 3atranscriptomics1 aYang, Wanling 1 aZhao, Minmin 1 aDing, Gumu 1 aZhou, Yi 1 aXie, Jiankun 1 aZhang, Fantao 0 tAgronomy.g2022 June 28, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120715493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017700168300001800345520124600363536012801609592002801737596006201765650001701827650001701844650001901861650001801880650001701898650001401915650002301929650001601952650002101968650000701989650002301996650001102019650001802030650001202048653001702060653002702077653001802104653002302122653001102145700002702156700001702183700001602200700002402216700001802240700002202258773012902280856008502409852000902494655001202503IND60624650820221121203404.0181204e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062465082DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2018.14903002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKara, Kanber10aInvestigation in terms of digestive values, silages quality and nutrient content of the using pomegranate pomace in the ensiling of apple pomace with high moisture contents  ap. 1233-1241.  aThe purpose of present study was to determine the quality and in vitro digestion parameters in silages of 100% pomegranate pomace (PPS), 100% apple pomace (APS) and 50% pomegranate pomace + 50% apple pomace (PAPS). The digestion parameters of 10% or 20% using of these silages in total mix ration (TMR) of dairy cattle were researched. The dry matter (DM), crude protein, flavonoids, tannins and anthocyanins of pomegranate pomace were higher than those of apple pomace. Fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates of pomegranate pomace were similar to those of apple pomace. The silage DM losses in APS decreased with pomegranate pomace (p = .004). The silage density, gas-methane production, and estimated digestion values of PPS and PAPS were higher than those of APS (p < .05). Lactic acid and pH value of APS and the PAPS were higher than the PPS (p < .01). The using of PPS up to 20% in TMR decreased in vitro estimated digestion of TMR (p < .05). The using of APS or PAPS up to 20% in TMR was appropriate for in vitro results. As a result, ensilaging of apple pomace with pomegranate pomace can increase silage density, silage DM; and can decrease silage DM losses; and do not affect silage quality-digestion parameters.  aThis study was supported by Project No. TCD-2014-5005 granted by the Research Fund of Erciyes University, Kayseri (Turkey).  aPublisher supplied data  cErciyes Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003062 3aanthocyanins 3aapple pomace 3acattle feeding 3acrude protein 3adairy cattle 3adigestion 3ain vitro digestion 3alactic acid 3anutrient content 3apH 3apomegranate pomace 3asilage 3asilage making 3atannins 0aApple pomace 0aindustrial by-products 0adigestibility 0apomegranate pomace 0asilage1 aGuclu, Berrin Kocaoglu1 aBaytok, Erol1 aAktug, Eray1 aOguz, Fatma Karakas1 aKamalak, Adem1 aAtalay, Ali Ihsan0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 46, no. 1 p.1233-1241dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2018.14903003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100005300180245014300233300001600376500002000392506007600412520185300488592002802341596004702369506003702416650002802453650001302481650001402494650001202508650001402520650001102534650001302545650001002558650001402568650002502582650002102607650002002628650001302648650001102661700005702672773014102729856007302870852000902943655001202952IND60622370020221207085059.0181125e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062237002DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.127142doi7 aPMC64333982pmcid7 a309233942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4235-906810aEffects of a low dose of ethanol on mating success of Drosophila melanogaster males: implications for the evolution of ethanol resistance?  ap. 801-809.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEthanol occurs naturally in the decaying fruit in which many species of Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) breed, potentially generating selection for resistance to its toxic and sedating effects. Studies measuring mortality of flies exposed to a range of ethanol concentrations have shown that within Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, populations from temperate regions are more ethanol resistant than ancestral tropical African populations. The high ethanol resistance of temperate D. melanogaster presents a puzzle, however, because breeding and feeding sites in the wild seldom contain enough ethanol to kill even more ethanol‐sensitive Afrotropical genotypes. We hypothesize that the ethanol concentrations encountered by temperate populations, though usually sub‐lethal, are nonetheless high enough to reduce fitness in other ways, potentially generating indirect selection for genotypes that can survive exposure to unnaturally high ethanol concentrations. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we compared the effects of a sub‐lethal dose of ethanol, comparable to that obtainable from fermenting fruit, on the mating success of males from one European and one Afrotropical population. Ethanol significantly reduced mating success of males from the Afrotropical population, but had no effect on that of males from the European population. We also show that when flies are placed on medium with a realistic concentration of ethanol, considerably more ethanol is absorbed through vapor than through feeding, suggesting that courting males may be unable to avoid being exposed to ethanol. We hypothesize that the higher resistance of temperate populations to being killed by high, unnatural ethanol concentrations may have evolved in part as a correlated response to selection for behavioral insensitivity to natural concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01AA016178cNational Institutes of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abreeding 3acourtship 3aethanol 3aevolution 3afruits 3agenotype 3amales 3amortality 3areproductive success 3astress tolerance 3atemperate zones 3atoxicity 3avapors1 aFry, James D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4699-31030 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2018 Oct., v. 166, no. 10 p.801-809dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.127143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011400170506011700284506007600401520161600477592002802093506003702121650002602158650001602184650002502200650001602225650002102241650002002262650002302282650001502305650002502320651001102345653001602356653001802372653001202390653002002402700002002422700002402442700002102466700001702487700002002504700002102524700002202545773010002567856008402667852000902751655001202760IND60793721720221207071054.0220926e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079372172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1013382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasiita, Rose K.10aPerformance of Oreochromis niloticus and Oreochromis andersonii in controlled laboratory conditions in Zambia  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the present study, two hatchery strains of Oreochromis niloticus and two of O. andersonii sourced from different hatcheries in Zambia were subjected to the same feeding and management regimes in a controlled indoor tank environment. All strains were stocked at a mean weight of 2.1 ± 0.01 g and harvested after 175 days. Mean final body weight at harvest for the two O. andersonii groups was 65.2 ± 31.5 g and 73.8 ± 38.5 g, which was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those for the two O. niloticus groups at 178.5 ± 74.7 g and 187.8 ± 73.6 g. There was no significant difference in body weight at harvest between hatchery strains within either species. The mean specific growth rate (SGR) and the daily growth coefficients (DGC) had similar patterns with the O. niloticus strains DGC values more than one and half times those of O. andersonii. The high survival values within all groups (range 86–96 %), their good condition factor index values (range 3.2–3.5) and lack of significant differences between species indicated the experimental conditions were suitable for both species and provided a valid test of their relative growth. Food conversion ratios (FCRs) for O. niloticus of 1.22 ± 0.11 and 1.07 ± 0.05 were significantly (P < 0.05) better than for O. andersonii of 1.81 ± 0.10 and 1.84 ± 0.18. The experiment provided rare well-controlled data comparing the growth performance of these species and different hatchery strains in Zambia, as a contribution to better informing investment decisions for the aquaculture industry there and in Southern Africa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3abody weight 3acondition factor 3afood conversion 3agrowth performance 3ahatcheries 3aspecific growth rate 3aZambia 0aAquaculture 0aZambia, feeds 0aTilapia 0aRelative growth1 aTrinh, Trong Q.1 aSakala, Masautso E.1 aChungu, Patience1 aMalambo, Tom1 aHampuwo, Buumba1 aMwema, Catherine1 aBenzie, John A.H.0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 Dec., v. 27 p.101338-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1013383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245012200209300001800331506007600349520174000425592002802165596010002193506003702293650001302330650001002343650002302353650002002376650002202396650001302418650002802431650000902459650001602468650001402484650002002498650001902518650002502537650001702562650003202579650001902611650001002630650001702640650001002657650001202667650002302679650001902702700001802721700002002739773013202759856008202891852000902973655001202982IND60655658620221207110049.0190803e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065565862DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-03853-z2doi7 aPMC66758372pmcid7 a314134082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuta, Denisa E.10aSensory and physicochemical changes in gluten-free oat biscuits stored under different packaging and light conditions  ap. 3823-3835.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe influence of different packaging films and their thickness (polyethylene terephthalate/casting polypropylene (PET/CPP_34), biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP_40), polyvinylchloride (PVC_12), BOPP/CPP_50 and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol/polypropylene (PE/EVOH/PP_50) on the quality of gluten-free oat biscuits was evaluated for a storage period up to 3 months under light and darkness conditions. Periodically (day 30, 60 and 90), physical parameters, peroxide value, texture and microbiological parameters together with sensory attributes (surface colour, smell, taste, crunchiness and off-flavour) were assessed. Moisture and water activity of biscuits decreased during storage in all packages. The highest peroxide value was obtained for biscuits packed in PVC_12, while the lowest was for the PE/EVOH/PP_50, for both storage conditions. The biscuits’ colour changed from yellow–brown to light yellow and the change was more pronounced in the light as compared to the dark storage conditions. The hardness value decreased (p > 0.05) during the storage period. The electronic nose system showed that the distinct volatile composition of the biscuits stored in the light was correlated with the higher scores of the off-flavour attribute and with the peroxide values. The sensory data showed that BOPP/CPP_50 preserved the colour of the biscuits, while PE/EVOH/PP_50 kept the initial crunchiness of the biscuits up to 90 days of storage in both light and dark conditions. The study suggested that BOPP/CPP_50 and PE/EVOH/PP_50 can be used for gluten-free oat biscuits’ packaging and storage up to 90 days for both conditions studied, without adversely affecting their physicochemical and sensory properties.  aPublisher supplied data  aproject number 111/2012cThe Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNDI-UEFISCDI0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiscuits 3acolor 3acomposite polymers 3aelectronic nose 3agluten-free foods 3ahardness 3amicrobiological quality 3aoats 3aoff flavors 3apackaging 3apackaging films 3aperoxide value 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3asmell 3astorage time 3ataste 3atexture 3avolatile compounds 3awater activity1 aCuletu, Alina1 aMohan, Gabriela0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2019 Aug., v. 56, no. 8 p.3823-3835dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-03853-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001200257520135400269592002801623650002201651650001501673650001501688650001001703650001301713650001501726650001001741650001401751650001101765650001001776650001501786650000901801650000901810650000901819650002101828650001301849650001701862650001001879651001401889700002101903773009301924856008102017852000902098655001202107IND60120590620221118040515.0150325e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012059062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-015-0273-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmebiri, L. C.10aExploring the synthetic hexaploid wheat for novel sources of tolerance to excess boron  ap. 273.  aExcessive levels of boron (B) in the subsoil can severely limit crop yields, particularly under dryland conditions where crops often have to depend on rainfall and available water stored in the soil during fallow. In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), boron tolerance is controlled by at least two loci located on chromosomes 4AL (Bo4) and 7BL (Bo1). In this study, we sought to determine whether novel genomic regions can be identified in wheat primary synthetic hexaploids (SHWs). The study used data from 333 SHW lines imported into Australia in different shipments between 2003 and 2007. On average, the SHWs were uniformly more tolerant to boron toxicity than the sensitive check, Meering, and the top 5 % showed tolerance levels that were superior (P ≤ 0.05) to that of Halberd, the most tolerant wheat check cultivar. At a genome-wide significance threshold of −log(P) ≥ 2.8, association analyses using different algorithms consistently identified three DArT markers, two on chromosome 1AL and one on 4AL. The 4AL region was localised close to the deletion bin location of Bo4, the root-specific boron transporter gene. On the other hand, the two loci on chromosome 1A represent novel regions, which when validated will increase the options of achieving tolerance beyond that conferred by Bo1 and Bo4 alone in breeding programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalgorithms 3aarid lands 3aboron 3abreeding 3acrop yield 3acrops 3acultivars 3afallow 3agenes 3ahexaploidy 3aloci 3arain 3asoil 3astress tolerance 3atoxicity 3atransporters 3awheat 3aAustralia1 aOgbonnaya, F.

Its presence is a health risk for sensitive individuals and it could negatively affect the wine quality. The objective of this work was to determine the biogenic amines content in Chilean young varietal wines. For that, a liquid chromatographic method with pre-column derivatization was optimized and validated to achieve a reliable quantification of the most important biogenic amines in wines, i.e. histamine, tyramine, spermine, spermidine, putrescine, cadaverine and phenylethylamine. Using a face-centered central composite design derivatization and chromatographic conditions were optimized. Derivatization with dansyl chloride showed an optimum yield for all biogenic amines at 60 °C during 60 min. These derivatives were optimally separated with a C₁₈ YMC-Pack ODS-A column set a 40 °C using a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and water under gradient conditions. An effective separation and quantification of the biogenic amines was achieved in 40 min using ultraviolet detection at 254 nm. Validation was established according to ICH guidelines, calibrations in matrix fitted a linear regression model with R² > 0.997. Repeatability (n = 6) and intermediate precision (n = 3) in matrix showed RSD values <2.34% and <3.16%, respectively. This method was applied to determine for the first time the biogenic amines content in Chilean wines. Twenty-seven samples of young varietal wines, i.e. Cabernet Sauvignon (n = 9), Merlot (n = 8) and Carménère (n = 10) were analyzed finding a biogenic amines content from 18.12 to 39.84 mg L⁻¹, where putrescine showed the highest concentration in all grape varieties. No significant difference was found between grapes varieties regarding total biogenic amines content (P = 0.7842, df = 26). Along with putrescine, histamine and tyramine were the most abundant biogenic amines but similar levels were also observed with spermidine.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahistamine 3aderivatization 3alinear models 3agrapes 3aat-risk population 3awine quality 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3aguidelines 3achlorides 3acadaverine 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amalolactic fermentation 3aputrescine 3atyramine 3awines 0arisk groups1 aCarrasco, Jonathan1 aPeña-Farfal, Carlos1 aHenríquez-Aedo, Karem1 aAranda, Mario0 tFood control.g2012 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.251-257dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2011.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245006600172300001600238520171300254592002801967650002201995650002402017650001102041650002202052650002502074650000902099650001502108650002902123650001602152650001902168653002302187653001702210653002902227700002602256773011202282856008602394852000902480655001202489IND60565562920221117233542.0180831e20170510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056556292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangroya, Deepak10aFactors influencing buying behaviour of green energy consumer  ap. 393-405.  aGreen energy has gained significant research attention across the globe due to its ability to reduce environmental damage. However, for complete acceptance of green energy, only government regulations are not enough; the willingness to use green energy and contribute to the wellbeing of the environment should spring from within consumers. Such willingness may be developed by enhancing consumers’ perceived value of green energy. However, in order to do so, it is necessary to assess existing levels of consumers’ perceived value towards green energy. The present study develops a multidimensional green perceived value scale to measure existing levels of consumers’ perceived value. The scale considers green perceived value as a multidimensional second order construct comprising functional value, social value, conditional value and emotional value dimensions. Such an attempt has not been made before which highlights the originality value of the present study. The scale can be used to assess consumers’ perception towards green energy. Such information would help in formulating strategies that encourage consumers to voluntarily adopt green energy. The study also reveals that it is not only the financial aspects that lead consumers to decide on adoption of green energy; consumers are also driven by emotional and social considerations. Thus, policy makers could formulate pro-green energy programmes and mass messages that appeal to consumers’ sense of responsibility to voluntarily adopt green energy without having to rely on financial incentives. Researchers could examine the considered dimensions of the scale further with respect to other constructs related to consumer behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3aeconomic incentives 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3alead 3apurchasing 3arenewable energy sources 3aresearchers 3asocial benefit 0aConsumer behaviour 0aGreen energy 0aPost purchase evaluation1 aNayak, Jogendra Kumar0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 May 10, v. 151 p.393-405dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245018700190300001400377520161500391592002802006650002902034650001802063650001402081650002002095650002302115650001502138650001102153650001602164650001702180650002102197650001102218650001802229650001902247650001402266650001102280650001102291650003002302650002802332650002402360650003802384650002002422650003402442650005702476650002302533650003102556650005402587650007002641651001002711700002302721700002702744700002602771700002402797773012702821856004802948852000902996655001203005IND4471717720221122174947.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447171772DNAL7 a214796622pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-011-9667-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrassinetti, Stefania12aA Multidisciplinary Approach for Assessing the Toxicity of Marine Sediments: Analysis of Metal Content and Elutriate Bioassays Using Metal Bioavailability and Genotoxicity Biomarkers  ap. 13-21.  aThe goal of this article is to verify the applicability of two different biological assays for studying a coastal area that is subject to anthropogenic inputs. Phytochelatins in the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii were used as a biomarker of metal bioavailability. The frequency of genetic damage in the sensitive D7 strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to estimate the mutagenic potential. Biological assays were carried out using sediment elutriates. Sediments were collected at three selected sites located in the Gulf of Follonica (Tuscany, Italy), during a 2-year sampling period: Cala Violina (reference site) and the mouths of the rivers Pecora and Cornia, named sites V, P and C, respectively. The chemical characterization of each site was determined in terms of metal concentrations (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb), measured in 11 sediment samples for each site. The results showed that metal concentrations in sediments from sites C and P were 2–10 times higher than the reference values (site V, year 2004). In addition, we found generally higher metal concentrations in the 2007 sediments than in the 2008 ones, including those of site V, due to the occurrence of an unexpected pollution event. This enabled us to obtain a pollution gradient to validate the proposed bioassays. In fact, the bioassays showed a potential biological hazard in the 2007 elutriates. Significant mutagenic effects were found in samples exhibiting higher concentrations of Cd and Cr. The induction of phytochelatins in T. weissflogii correlated positively with the Cd concentration in the elutriates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aThalassiosira 3abioassays 3abioavailability 3abiological hazards 3abiomarkers 3acoasts 3acorrelation 3agenotoxicity 3amarine sediments 3ametals 3anormal values 3aphytochelatins 3apollution 3arivers 3ayeasts 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aBiological Availability 2aDiatomsxmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGenetic Markers 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysisxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 2aMutagenicity Tests 2aPhytochelatinsxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 3aItaly1 aPitzalis, Emanuela1 aMascherpa, Marco Carlo1 aCaltavuturo, Leonardo1 aMorelli, Elisabetta0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2012 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.13-21dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-011-9667-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245009600189300001600285520154700301592002801848650000901876650001201885650001501897650001201912650001001924650001001934650000701944650002101951650001601972650001201988650001102000650003102011650000902042650005602051650002402107650001302131650001302144700002302157700002302180700001802203773008502221852000902306856008102315930003302396946001102429655001202440IND60438937120221123023628.0151024e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043893712DNAL7 a171363942pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-006-0611-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSöderman, Fredrik10aEnvironmental stress increases skeletal fluctuating asymmetry in the moor frog Rana arvalis  ap. 593-604.  aWhether fluctuating asymmetry (FA) provides a useful metric indicator of the degree of environmental stress experienced by populations is still a contentious issue. We investigated whether the degree of FA in skeletal elements is useful in elucidating the degree of environmental stress experienced by frog populations, and further, tested the proposition that a trait’s sensitivity to stress—as reflected in the degree of FA—is related to the degree of directional selection experienced by the given trait. We compared the degree of FA in four bilateral skeletal elements of male and female moor frogs (Rana arvalis) originating from low (acidified) and neutral pH populations. While the degree of uncorrected FA was unrelated to the degree of acidity, the growth rate and age of the individuals, the size-corrected FA was significantly higher in low than in neutral pH populations and decreased with individual ages and growth rates. In addition, both measures of FA were significantly higher in males and in particular in traits presumably under high sexual selection as indicated by the degree of sexual size dimorphism. All in all, the results indicate that individuals from acidified localities are smaller, younger and exhibit a significantly higher degree of FA than individuals from neutral pH populations. These results constitute the first assessment of FA in amphibians and suggest that the degree of FA in skeletal traits can be a useful indicator of the degree of environmental stress experienced by amphibian populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana 3aacidity 3adimorphism 3afemales 3afrogs 3amales 3apH 3asexual selection 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aRanidaexanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aSex Characteristics 2aSkeleton 2aWetlands1 avan Dongen, Stefan1 aPakkasmaa, Susanna1 aMerilä, Juha0 tOecologia.g2007 Apr., v. 151, no. 4 p.593-604dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0611-03Available from publisher's site  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03748naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002700166245011500193300001600308520187700324592002802201650001602229650002502245650001202270650001702282650001102299650002402310650001402334650001302348650001102361650002302372650002302395650001302418650002102431650001402452650001502466650002102481650001202502650001502514650002102529650001202550650002302562650001402585650001602599650003002615650002502645650004402670650002902714650002002743650002202763700002102785700003202806700002002838700002102858773008502879852000902964856008102973930003303054946001103087655001203098IND60438937320221123013932.0151024e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043893732DNAL7 a171466822pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-006-0609-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenwood, Jennifer L.10aNutrients stimulate leaf breakdown rates and detritivore biomass: bottom-up effects via heterotrophic pathways  ap. 637-649.  aMost nutrient enrichment studies in aquatic systems have focused on autotrophic food webs in systems where primary producers dominate the resource base. We tested the heterotrophic response to long-term nutrient enrichment in a forested, headwater stream. Our study design consisted of 2 years of pretreatment data in a reference and treatment stream and 2 years of continuous nitrogen (N) + phosphorus addition to the treatment stream. Studies were conducted with two leaf species that differed in initial C:N, Rhododendron maximum (rhododendron) and Acer rubrum (red maple). We determined the effects of nutrient addition on detrital resources (leaf breakdown rates, litter C:N and microbial activity) and tested whether nutrient enrichment affected macroinvertebrate consumers via increased biomass. Leaf breakdown rates were ca. 1.5 and 3× faster during the first and second years of enrichment, respectively, in the treatment stream for both leaf types. Microbial respiration rates of both leaf types were 3× higher with enrichment, and macroinvertebrate biomass associated with leaves increased ca. 2–3× with enrichment. The mass of N in macroinvertebrate biomass relative to leaves tended to increase with enrichment up to 6× for red maple and up to 44× for rhododendron leaves. Lower quality (higher C:N) rhododendron leaves exhibited greater changes in leaf nutrient content and macroinvertebrate response to nutrient enrichment than red maple leaves, suggesting a unique response by different leaf species to nutrient enrichment. Nutrient concentrations used in this study were moderate and equivalent to those in streams draining watersheds with altered land use. Thus, our results suggest that similarly moderate levels of enrichment may affect detrital resource quality and subsequently lead to altered energy and nutrient flow in detrital food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3aRhododendron maximum 3abiomass 3adetritivores 3aenergy 3aexperimental design 3afood webs 3aland use 3aleaves 3amacroinvertebrates 3amicrobial activity 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3arespiratory rate 3astreams 3awatersheds 2aAcerxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aEcosystem 2aFertilizers 2aInvertebratesxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aRhododendronxmetabolism 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology1 aRosemond, Amy D.1 aWallace, Bruceq(J.

In a manipulative field study, we surveyed the response of wood‐boring beetles (Coleoptera) to the small debris produced by commercial thinning operations in white spruce plantations using two methods. First, we sampled the wood‐boring beetles visiting the plantations using flight intercept traps. Then, at the end of the resource pulse in fresh woody debris, we documented the abundance of beetle emergence holes on vertical and horizontal woody debris, which indicate wood‐boring beetle colonization. Results demonstrated that the small horizontal debris generated by commercial thinning were used by saproxylic beetles but were not a preferred resource for colonization, by contrast with vertical dead wood. Only small‐body beetles colonized the horizontal debris and most debris were not colonized. Vertical dead wood, even if present in relatively small quantity when compared to horizontal dead wood, was a major determinant of beetle colonization and community composition. Biomass removal was shown to have a strong detrimental impact on beetle colonization rates. Based on these results, we suggest that most of the saproxylic species trapped after commercial thinning operations were attracted in response to the initial pulse of resource but did not actually colonize the debris from thinning. Thus, we stress the importance of distinguishing between species visitation and colonization following a resource pulse when sampling relies on indirect trapping methods.  aPublisher supplied data  cNew Brunswick Innovation Foundation  cFaculté des Études Supérieures de l'Université de Moncton  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  cFaculté des Études Supérieures et de la Recherche (FESR)  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada 3aColeoptera 3aPicea glauca 3aanimal communities 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adead wood 3aflight 3aplantations 3atrapping1 aThibault, M.1 aNadeau, P.1 aMoreau, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9217-58490 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2018 Oct., v. 166, no. 10 p.834-843dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.127263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245009500158300001800253520083200271592002801103650002301131650001901154650001201173650001301185700002701198700001901225700002101244773014601265856007801411852000901489655001201498IND60563592520221120203121.0170302e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056359252DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b133572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Anuvab10aDirect Characterization of a Reactive Lattice-Confined Ru2 Nitride by Photocrystallography  ap. 2912-2915.  aReactive metal–ligand (M–L) multiply bonded complexes are ubiquitous intermediates in redox catalysis and have thus been long-standing targets of synthetic chemistry. The intrinsic reactivity of mid-to-late M–L multiply bonded complexes renders these structures challenging to isolate and structurally characterize. Although synthetic tuning of the ancillary ligand field can stabilize M–L multiply bonded complexes and result in isolable complexes, these efforts inevitably attenuate the reactivity of the M–L multiple bond. Here, we report the first direct characterization of a reactive Ru₂ nitride intermediate by photocrystallography. Photogeneration of reactive M–L multiple bonds within crystalline matrices supports direct characterization of these critical intermediates without synthetic derivatization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aderivatization 3aligands 3anitrides1 aReibenspies, Joseph H.1 aChen, Yu-Sheng1 aPowers, David C.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 139, no. 8 p.2912-2915dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.6b133573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003300135040001800168100001700186245014100203300001100344506007600355520201900431592002802450506003702478650000902515650002402524650002002548650001102568650001602579650002802595650000802623650001002631650002402641650003202665650001402697650001502711650002602726650003402752650001002786650003202796650002802828651001002856700001802866700001802884700001802902700002102920773010802941856008003049852000903129655001203138IND50074554720221207051041.0220106e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007455472DNAL7 aPMC39739752pmcid7 a245976642pmid7 a10.1186/1743-7075-11-122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakai, Kenji10aDietary intakes of fat and total mortality among Japanese populations with a low fat intake: the Japan Collaborative Cohort (JACC) Study  ap. 12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: It may be useful to examine associations of fat intakes with total mortality as a basis for dietary recommendations. We aimed to elucidate associations between dietary fat and total mortality among Japanese populations with low fat intake. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study consisting of 58,672 men and women aged 40 to 79 years. Fat intakes were estimated using a food frequency questionnaire. Multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality by sex were computed according to quintiles of energy-adjusted fat intakes. RESULTS: During the follow-up period (median duration, 19.3 years), 11,656 deaths were recorded. In men, we found no clear association between total fat and total mortality. HRs across quintiles of total fat intake were 1.00, 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95–1.12), 1.02 (0.94–1.10), 0.98 (0.90–1.07), and 1.07 (0.98–1.17). No significant association was detected in regard to types of fat. In women, HR was lowest in the fourth quintile of total fat intake followed by the top quintile; HRs across quintiles were 1.00, 1.03 (0.94–1.11), 1.00 (0.92–1.09), 0.88 (0.81–0.96), and 0.94 (0.86–1.03). Regarding types of fat in women, total mortality was inversely associated with intakes of saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA); the lowest HR was in the top quintile of intake for SFA, MUFA, and PUFA: 0.91 (95% CI, 0.83–1.00), 0.91 (0.83–0.99) and 0.88 (0.80 - 0.97), respectively (trend P across quintiles, 0.020, 0.012, and 0.029, respectively). Causes of death other than cancer and cardiovascular disease contributed most to decreases in HRs for total and types of fat. In women, analysis with finer categories revealed that the lowest risk for total mortality appeared at total fat intake of 28% of energy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings from a large cohort study among populations with relatively low fat intake provide evidence regarding optimal levels of fat intakes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3arisk 3aprospective studies 3aJapanese people 3aenergy 3adietary fat 3acardiovascular diseases 3amen 3awomen 3aconfidence interval 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3amortality 3afat intake 3asaturated fatty acids 3afood frequency questionnaires 3adeath 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3adietary recommendations 3aJapan1 aNaito, Mariko1 aDate, Chigusa1 aIso, Hiroyasu1 aTamakoshi, Akiko0 tNutrition & metabolism.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.12-12dBioMed CentralwJournal:2211x1743-70757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-11-123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245006800166300001600234520128500250592002801535650000801563650001801571650002001589650001101609650001501620650001501635650001501650700005401665700001701719700001501736700001401751700002001765700001701785700001901802700002501821773014401846856008401990852000902074655001202083IND60766585320221119181841.0220208e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076658532DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.1c009112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Danyang10aMicrofibers Released into the Air from a Household Tumble Dryer  ap. 120-126.  aMicrofibers of polyester and cotton might be significant for the transport and fate of chemical pollutants in the air due to the amounts emitted, as well as their capacities to sorb inorganic and organic compounds. It was hypothesized that household tumble driers could be atmospheric sources of these microfibers. This study quantified the number of the two most common textile fibers discharged from a household vented tumble dryer to ambient air. The results suggest that driers of this type are a potential source of air contamination by microfibers, releasing 433,128–561,810 microfibers during 15 min of use. Microfibers can be generated from both polyester and cotton textiles. The abundances of microfibers of polyester produced were directly proportional to the masses of clothing loaded into a dryer, but such a relationship was not apparent for cotton textiles. On the basis of the results presented here and other relevant data, it was estimated that the average Canadian household can annually release from 9 × 10⁷ to 12 × 10⁷ microfibers from a single dryer. To minimize the release of these microfibers into the air, an appropriate engineered filtration system should be developed and adopted as an effective control measure for individual household driers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3acontrol methods 3acotton 3afiltration 3apolyesters 3atechnology1 aZhang, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9341-83151 aXu, Shaopeng1 aLin, Huiju1 aLiu, Yuan1 aKang, Jingliang1 aYim, Tszewai1 aGiesy, John P.1 aLeung, Kenneth M.

Here, we report a pyrene-containing π-peptide dendron hydrogel, which shows 1D and 2D nanostructures with varied CPL activities. It was found that the individual dendrons formed hydrogels in a wide pH range (3–12) and self-assembled into helices with pH-tuned pitches. Through chirality transfer, the pyrene unit could show CPL originated from both the monomer and excimer bands. When cyclodextrin was introduced, different supra-dendrons were obtained with β-cyclodextrin (PGAc@β-CD) and γ-cyclodextrin (PGAc@γ-CD) through host–guest interactions, respectively. Interestingly, the PGAc@β-CD and PGAc@γ-CD supra-dendrons self-assembled into 2D nanosheet and entangled nanofibers, respectively, showing cyclodextrin induced circularly polarized emission from both the monomer and excimer bands of the pyrene moiety. Thus, through a simple host–guest interaction, both the nanostructures and the chiroptical activities could be modulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3agamma-cyclodextrin 3ahydrogels 3aluminescence 3amoieties 3ananofibers 3ananosheets 3aoptical isomerism 3apH1 aYang, Dong1 aHan, Jianlei1 aZhou, Jin1 aJin, Qingxian1 aLiu, Minghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6603-12511 aDuan, Pengfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5971-75460 tLangmuir.g2018 Apr. 19, v. 34, no. 20 p.5821-5830dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b010353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03761naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003400153245006900187506010400256506007600360520216900436592002802605506003702633650001202670650000902682650002002691650001602711650001402727650001202741650001802753650002102771650001702792650001902809651001002828653001002838653002902848653003502877653002402912653002302936653000902959700002502968700002202993700003003015700001903045773010603064856008803170852000903258655001203267IND60779861120221207081710.0221004e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077986112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.1025532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSauer, Jürgen Michael Thomas10aChinese and multilateral development finance in the power sector  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPublic developmental institutions are pivotal in shaping the contours of the electricity sector of the developing world and its associated greenhouse gas emissions pathways. However, we have a fragmented and incomplete picture of the evolution of their investments over time and space. This is particularly the case for the recent rise of various Chinese Developmental Institutions (CDIs) for which infrastructure investment estimates range in the trillions under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and for which data is mostly not publicly disclosed. We address this gap in two ways: first, we compile and analyze a novel dataset that draws on commercial data tracking, publicly available datasets, and more than 1,000 supporting documents to match financial transactions by the main CDIs and traditional Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) to power plant projects worldwide. This allows us to conduct a quantitative, comparative analysis of the role of CDIs and MDBs to understand the relative size, technology, and country focus of such investments in the period 1999–2020. Second, we complement the quantitative dataset with 39 expert interviews to shed light on the drivers behind the Chinese investments, with a particular focus on coal projects. The analysis shows that CDIs have rapidly emerged as the largest public finance provider for the electricity sector in the developing world. We also find that, in contrast with the increasingly green BRI rhetoric, the technology portfolio of CDI investments in power plants is still heavily dominated by coal plants. Over time, however, CDIs have increasingly supported more efficient coal plants and increased the share of their portfolio supporting non-hydro renewables and supported a growing number of projects jointly with MDBs. Steering China’s bilateral coal finance flows through international efforts into a more sustainable direction to meet climate goals will require careful consideration of a set of drivers and enablers of the involvement of CDIs and recipient countries in coal projects, which we discuss, as well as of the role of other finance providers, including traditional MDBs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3acoal 3adata collection 3aelectricity 3aevolution 3afinance 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gases 3apower plants 3apublic finance 3aChina 0aChina 0aBelt and road initiative 0aMultilateral development banks 0aDevelopment finance 0aElectricity sector 0aCoal1 aAnadón, Laura Díaz1 aKirchherr, Julian1 aPlummer Braeckman, Judith1 aSchulhof, Vera0 tGlobal environmental change.g2022 July, v. 75 p.102553-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2063x0959-37807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.1025533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03608naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009100171300001600262520196900278592002802247650001302275650001102288650002402299650002002323650002702343650001502370650002902385650000902414650001502423650001902438650001002457650001902467650002602486650002902512650000902541650001402550650001102564650002202575650001702597650001002614650001502624651001102639653000802650653002702658653003302685653002702718653002402745653002202769653002402791700002002815773010002835856008602935852000903021655001203030IND60634860120221120073223.0201202e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063486012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBérubé, Vicky10aProduction and decomposition rates of different fen species as targets for restoration  ap. 105-115.  aThere is an increasing interest in considering ecosystem processes after fen restoration, and not solely species composition. To evaluate the success of ecological restoration, comparisons with targets from reference ecosystems are required. We documented net primary production (NPP) and decomposition of the main vegetation components in order to describe a reference data set for ecological restoration of moderately rich to rich minerotrophic peatlands (fens) in southeastern Canada. Data collection included three growing seasons for herbs and shrubs and two growing seasons for belowground biomass, trees and bryophytes. Average NPP for above and belowground biomass of three selected natural basin fens were 450 g m⁻² yr⁻¹. Belowground NPP represented 45% of the total NPP. Sphagnum warnstorfii was the most productive bryophyte (140 g m⁻² yr⁻¹) and the slowest plant species to decompose (exponential decomposition constant k = 0.07 yr⁻¹). The brown mosses Tomenthypnum nitens, Campylium stellatum and Scorpidium cossonii had a NPP of 79, 69 and 92 g m⁻² yr⁻¹, respectively, and decomposed at the same rate (identical k values of 0.14 yr⁻¹). Trees covered a large surface area in the fens, with an average NPP of 73 g m⁻² yr⁻¹. S. warnstorfii contributed to hummocks having a higher peat accumulation potential than lawn vegetation. The graminoid Trichophorum cespitosum significantly increased NPP in lawns and should be targeted in restoration plans for fens. To restore peat accumulating processes (production and decomposition) in fens, bryophytes should be the primary focus for re-introduction, specifically species that are adapted to living in drier conditions, such as hummock species. The range of variability for NPP and decomposition established by this study should be considered as a decision tool in restoration projects to monitor restored ecosystems trajectories and successes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphagnum 3abasins 3abelowground biomass 3adata collection 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3afens 3agraminoids 3agrowing season 3aherbs 3alawns and turf 3amosses and liverworts 3anet primary productivity 3apeat 3apeatlands 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3asurface area 3atrees 3avegetation 3aCanada 0aNPP 0aMinerotrophic peatland 0aNPP (net primary production) 0aDecomposition constant 0aBelowground biomass 0aPeatland function 0aReference ecosystem1 aRochefort, Line0 tEcological indicators.g2018 Aug., v. 91 p.105-115dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012600171300001800297520123900315592002801554650001601582650001201598650001101610650001001621650001301631650002001644650002201664650001901686650001301705650001701718650001301735700002901748700006501777773011401842856008401956852000902040655001202049IND60607201620221122104540.0180730e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060720162DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b010362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagidi, Sudhakar10aTriarylboron Anchored Luminescent Probes: Selective Detection and Imaging of Thiophenols in the Intracellular Environment  ap. 8170-8177.  aThe advances in boron incorporated organics have captured overwhelming interest on account of their outstanding properties and promising applications in various fields. Mostly, triarylborane compounds (TAB) are exploited as sensors of F– and CN– anions at the expense of the intrinsic Lewis acidic nature of boron. New molecular probes 1 and 2 for detection of toxic thiophenol were designed by conjugating highly fluorescent borylanilines with the luminescent quencher 2,4-dinitrobenzene based sulfonamides (DNBS), wherein the electrophilicity of the DNBS moiety has been modulated by fine-tuning the intrinsic Lewis acidity of boron. The interplay between PET (photoinduced electron transfer) and ICT have been employed for developing the TAB tethered turn-on fluorescent sensor for thiophenol with high selectivity for the first time. The newly developed probes showed very fast response toward thiophenol (within ∼5 min) with limits of detection (LOD) lying in the micromolar range, clearly pointing to their potential. Further, compounds 1 and 2 were explored for detecting thiophenol in the intracellular environment by discriminating biothiols. DFT and TD-DFT calculations were performed to support the sensing mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aacidity 3aanions 3aboron 3acyanides 3adetection limit 3aelectron transfer 3aimage analysis 3amoieties 3asulfonamides 3atoxicity1 aKalluvettukuzhy, Neena K1 aThilagar, Pakkirisamy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9569-77330 tLangmuir.g2018 June 20, v. 34, no. 28 p.8170-8177dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b010363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245008600158300001800244520066900262592002800931650001700959650001400976650001500990700002001005700001501025700002301040700001901063773013101082856007801213852000901291655001201300IND60563592720221120203016.0170302e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056359272DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b000372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chen10aControlled 2D Assembly of Nickel-Seamed Hexameric Pyrogallol[4]arene Nanocapsules  ap. 2920-2923.  aThe two-dimensional framework of nickel-seamed hexameric metal–organic nanocapsules has been synthesized by connecting the tailed hydroxyl groups of C-propan-3-ol pyrogallol[4]arene with adjacent hexameric capsules via nickel-hydroxyl coordination. In addition, functionalization of nanocapsules with multiple pyridine molecules at the capsule surface prevents them from assembling into hierarchical structures and leads to the formation of discrete nickel-seamed pyrogallol[4]arene nanocapsules. This work shows that surface functionalization of nanocapsules is an effective and innovative method of controlling the assembly of these nanometric building blocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3ananocapsules 3apyridines 3apyrogallol1 aPatil, Rahul S.1 aLiu, Chong1 aBarnes, Charles L.1 aAtwood, J.

Compared to the affinity of CB[7]·Diam(NMe₃)₂, the adamantane diammonium ion complexes (e.g., CB[7]·2,6-Ad(NH₃)₂ and CB[7]·2,6-Ad(NMe₃)₂) are less effective at realizing the potential 1000-fold enhancement in affinity due to ion–dipole interactions at the second ureidyl CO portal. Comparative crystallographic investigation of CB[7]·Diam(NMe₃)₂, CB[7]·DiamNMe₃, and CB[7]·1-AdNMe₃ revealed that the preferred geometry positions the ⁺NMe₃ groups ≈0.32 Å above the CO portal; the observed 0.80 Å spacing observed for CB[7]·Diam(NMe₃)₂ reflects the simultaneous geometrical constraints of CH₂···OC close contacts at both portals. Remarkably, the CB[8]·IsoDiam(NHMe₂)₂ complex displays femtomolar binding affinity, placing it firmly alongside the CB[7]·Diam(NMe₃)₂ complex. Primary or quaternary ammonium ion looping strategies lead to larger increases in binding affinity for CB[8] than for CB[7], which we attribute to the larger size of the carbonyl portals of CB[8]; this suggests routes to develop CB[8] as the tightest binding host in the CB[n] family. We report that alkyl group fluorination (e.g., CB[7]·1-AdNH₂Et versus CB[7]·1-AdNH₂CH₂CF₃) does not result in the expected increase in Kₐ value. Finally, we discuss the role of solvation in nonempirical quantum mechanical computational methodology, which is used to estimate the relative changes in Gibbs binding free energies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbitaceae 3aammonia 3aammonium compounds 3abinding capacity 3ageometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aŠekutor, Marina1 aCao, Liping1 aZavalij, Peter Y.1 aHostaš, Jiří1 aAjani, Haresh1 aHobza, Pavel1 aMlinarić-Majerski, Kata1 aGlaser, Robert1 aIsaacs, Lyle0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 139, no. 8 p.3249-3258dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b000563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245015100168300001600319500002000335520146500355592002801820650002301848650001301871650001401884650002501898650001701923650001801940650001301958650001001971650000901981650001601990650001902006650001602025650001902041650002302060650001702083650001902100700002702119700002402146700002502170773009302195856007802288852000902366655001202375IND60537194220161017000000.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053719422DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2015001542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFabra, María José10aDevelopment of multilayer corn starch‐based food packaging structures containing β‐carotene by means of the electro‐hydrodynamic processing  ap. 603-610.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn antioxidant multilayer structure based on thermoplastic corn starch (TPCS) was developed by means of the electrohydrodynamic process of electrospinning. Firstly, the effect of adding electrospun outer layers made of polycaprolactone (PCL) on the microstructure and barrier properties of a thermoplastic corn starch (TPCS) film was evaluated. Secondly, β‐carotene was encapsulated into PCL matrices by means of the electrospinning technique and these hybrid structures were directly electrospun as coating layers onto both sides of a TPCS based film, thus giving rise to an antioxidant multilayer packaging structure. The influence of β‐carotene on the structural, antioxidant, barrier and optical properties of the developed multilayer systems were studied. Barrier properties of the TPCS based films were improved by the addition of the electrospun coatings. However, β‐carotene addition did not improve barrier properties as compared to their counterparts prepared without the active compound, although both permeability values remained up to 75% lower than those obtained for the pure TPCS. On the other hand, the stability of the β‐carotene was studied using colour assays and the antioxidant activity after the film‐forming process. Results showed that the stability of the β‐carotene was greatly affected by the annealing step (used to improve the adhesion between layers) even when it was encapsulated into the electrospun PCL layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aadhesion 3aannealing 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3acoatings 3acolor 3acorn 3acorn starch 3afood packaging 3amethodology 3amicrostructure 3aoptical properties 3apermeability 3athermoplastics1 aLópez‐Rubio, Amparo1 aSentandreu, Enrique1 aLagaron, Jose Maria,0 tStärke =.g2016 July, v. 68, no. 7-8 p.603-610dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2015001543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010200174300001600276520120100292592002801493650001101521650002201532650003501554650001501589651000901604700002401613773012401637856008101761852000901842655001201851IND60627512520221118080734.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062751252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-018-2111-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsl-Rousta, Bentolhoda12aA TOPSIS-Based Multicriteria Approach to the Calibration of a Basin-Scale SWAT Hydrological Model  ap. 439-452.  aCalibration is one of the most important steps of hydrological modeling and applications. Observed data availability and model parameterization are two important factors affecting the calibration efficiency of the models. This study focuses on the assessment of the effects of the number and location of sites (LoS), number of parameters (NoP), and the calibration method (CM) on the performance of the SWAT hydrological model of a basin. Accordingly, twelve different models with respect to LoS, NoP, and CM are built for the Sirwan River Basin in Iran. NS, R-factor and P-factor efficiency criteria are then used to evaluate how well the models perform both in calibration and validation stages. In order to prioritize the models, TOPSIS multi-criteria decision analysis approach is applied to aggregate different efficiency criteria and to discriminate between the models. Results show the usefulness of the proposed MCDA-based approach to rank different alternatives (settings) of model calibration. Additionally, multi-site calibration is not always better than single-site calibration, and the locations of the sites included in the calibration procedure are also important in this respect.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ahydrologic models 3amulti-criteria decision making 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aMousavi, S.

We identify their three main limitations for characterizing the geographic distributions of species: unknown levels of survey effort, unknown absences of a species from a region, and unknown level of repeated occurrence of a species in different samples collected at the same location. These limitations hinder our ability to distinguish between the actual absence of a species at a given location and its (erroneous) apparent absence as consequence of inadequate surveys. Good practice in biodiversity research requires knowledge of the number, location and degree of completeness of relatively well-surveyed inventories within territorial units. We herein present KnowBR, an application designed to simultaneously estimate the completeness of species inventories across an unlimited number of spatial units and different geographical extents, resolutions and unit expanses from any biodiversity database. We use the number of database records gathered in a territorial unit as a surrogate of survey effort, assuming that such number correlates positively with the probability of recording a species within such area. Consequently, KnowBR uses a “record-by-species” matrix to estimate the relationship between the accumulated number of species and the number of database records to characterize the degree of completeness of the surveys. The final slope of the species accumulation curves and completeness percentages are used to discriminate and map well-surveyed territorial units according to user criteria. The capacity and possibilities of KnowBR are demonstrated through two examples derived from data of varying geographic extent and numbers of records. Further, we identify the main advances that would improve the current functionality of KnowBR.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adatabases 3aenvironmental indicators 3ageographical distribution 3ageographical variation 3ainventories 3aprobability 3asurveys 0aSpatial bias 0aData limitations 0aDatabase records 0aGeographic distribution 0aSurvey completeness 0aWallacean shortfall1 aHortal, Joaquín1 aYela, José Luis,1 aMillán, Andrés,1 aSánchez-Fernández, David1 aGarcía-Roselló, Emilio1 aGonzález-Dacosta, Jacinto1 aHeine, Juergen1 aGonzález-Vilas, Luís1 aGuisande, Castor0 tEcological indicators.g2018 Aug., v. 91 p.241-248dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014000163300001600303520158400319592002801903650002101931650002201952650001901974650001201993650002302005650001902028650002102047650002302068650002102091650002002112650001802132650002602150650002202176650004102198650002002239650002602259650001402285650001302299700001402312700001802326700002002344700001802364773008802382856008102470852000902551655001202560IND60081882420221120025755.0141014e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008188242DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617140501662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Yijun12aA plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) mixture does not display synergistic effects, likely by biofilm but not growth inhibition  ap. 666-673.  aCombination of different PGPR strains with complementary characteristics as a mixture to reduce possible instability under fluctuating environment has been considered practical. However, PGPR mixtures do not always play synergistic roles in growth promotion or biological control as reflected in our previous findings and other publications. In this work, we accidentally discovered that a mixture containing two well compatible PGPR strains, Bacillus pumilus WP8 and Erwinia persicinus RA2, did not synergize in growth promotion or biological control of tomato bacterial wilt under field conditions. Considering the importance of PGPR biofilm formation in growth promotion and biocontrol activities, we hypothesized that this phenomenon may be related to inhibition of biofilm formation. In vitro experiments showed that biofilm-formation ability of WP8 was inhibited by both RA2 cells and filtered supernatants collected from RA2 cultures at 12 h (RA2-12) rather than 48 h (RA2-48), even at high-temperatures (within 100°C). An in vivo experiment derived from crystal violet staining yielded similar results. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we compared primary and secondary metabolites of RA2 (namely RA2-12 and RA2-48) and found D-glutamine, abundant in RA2-12, as the putative inhibitory factor. Trace amounts of jasmonic acid together with viscous extracellular polysaccharides in RA2-48 likely promoted the rescue of robust biofilm formation. This work suggests that inhibition of biofilm formation should be considered in PGPR mixture development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus pumilus 3aErwinia persicina 3abacterial wilt 3abiofilm 3abiological control 3agentian violet 3agrowth promotion 3agrowth retardation 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3ajasmonic acid 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3apolysaccharides 3asecondary metabolites 3asynergism 3atomatoes1 aShen, Min1 aYang, Xiaolan1 aCheng, Daocheng1 aZhao, Qingxin0 tMicrobiology.g2014 Sept., v. 83, no. 5 p.666-673dSpringer-Verlagx0026-26177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00262617140501663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011000171300001600281520105500297592002801352650002301380650000801403650003201411650001701443650002801460650001301488650001501501650001401516650001801530650001501548650001501563700002001578700002201598700006401620700002201684700002201706700006401728773014401792856008401936852000902020655001202029IND60766585720221119181712.0220208e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076658572DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.1c009632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Bridgette10aRespiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) RNA in Wastewater Settled Solids Reflects RSV Clinical Positivity Rates  ap. 173-178.  aWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) uses concentrations of infectious agent targets in wastewater to infer infection trends in the contributing community. To date, WBE has been used to gain insight into infection trends of gastrointestinal diseases, but its application to respiratory diseases has been limited. Here, we report that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genomic ribonucleic acid can be detected in wastewater settled solids at two publicly owned treatment works. We further show that its concentration in settled solids is strongly associated (Kendalls tau = 0.65–0.77, p < 10–⁷) with clinical positivity rates for RSV at sentinel laboratories across the state in 2021, a year with anomalous seasonal trends of RSV disease. Given that RSV infections have similar clinical presentations to COVID-19, can be life threatening for some, and immunoprophylaxis distribution for vulnerable people is based on outbreak identification, WBE represents an important tool to augment current RSV surveillance and public health response efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRNA 3aRespiratory syncytial virus 3aepidemiology 3agastrointestinal system 3agenomics 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apublic health 3atechnology 3awastewater1 aDuong, Dorothea1 aWhite, Bradley J.1 aWigginton, Krista R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6665-51121 aChan, Elana M.

We gathered self‐reported data using a cross‐sectional survey of 405 households in eight communities of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) and five Solomon Islands (SI) communities. Over 90% of households used multiple sources, with differences in sources and uses between wet and dry seasons. Most RMI households had large rainwater tanks and rationed stored rainwater for drinking throughout the dry season, whereas most SI households collected rainwater in small pots, precluding storage across seasons. Use of a source for cooking was strongly positively correlated with use for drinking, whereas use for cooking was negatively correlated or uncorrelated with nonconsumptive uses (e.g., bathing). Dry season water uses implied greater risk of water‐borne disease, with fewer (frequently zero) handwashing sources reported and more unimproved sources consumed. Use of multiple sources is fundamental to household water management and feasible to monitor using electronic survey tools. We contend that recognizing multiple water sources can greatly improve understanding of household‐level and community‐level climate change resilience, that use of multiple sources confounds health impact studies of water interventions, and that incorporating multiple sources into water supply interventions can yield heretofore‐unrealized benefits. We propose that failure to consider multiple sources undermines the design and effectiveness of global water monitoring, data interpretation, implementation, policy, and research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3across-sectional studies 3adrinking water 3adry season 3ahand washing 3aissues and policy 3arain 3aresearch 3arisk 3asurveys 3awater 3awater management 3awater supply 3awaterborne diseases1 aMacDonald, Morgan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9707-57351 aChan, Terence1 aKearton, Annika1 aShields, Katherine F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0625-77231 aBartram, Jamie K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6542-63151 aHadwen, Wade L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5405-232X0 tWater resources research.g2017 Nov., v. 53, no. 11 p.9106-9117dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR0210473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245012400206300001600330520141700346592002801763650002601791650002401817650001001841650001501851650001101866700006101877700006501938700002102003700001702024700005202041700006202093700001802155700002702173700002202200773014402222856008402366852000902450655001202459IND60766585820221119181724.0220208e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076658582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.1c009892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Longxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0893-146X10aRatios between Radon Concentrations in Upstairs and Basements: A Study in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States  ap. 191-197.  aTemporally resolved assessment of residential exposure to radon is essential for investigating radon’s acute health effects. Recent studies have used large numbers of short-term radon measurements to model the spatiotemporal variations in radon concentrations. However, most short-term radon measurements in the northeastern and midwestern United States were conducted in the basements, which were less frequently occupied and had higher average radon concentrations than the upstairs spaces. Disproportionate usage of basement radon measurements in exposure assessment potentially introduces misclassifications. In an effort to mitigate the issue, we investigated the spatiotemporal gradients in ratios between the radon concentrations in the upstairs and basements (hereafter upstairs/basement ratio). Building-specific ratios were calculated on the basis of 10774 pairs of simultaneous short-term measurements and then aggregated by state and season. We found that upstairs/basement ratios of northeastern states are generally lower than those of Midwestern states, a pattern also found in 3508 pairs of simultaneous long-term radon measurements. Ratios in winter are higher than those in other seasons. Our results, in conjunction with behavior data, can improve the assessment of short-term residential exposure to radon and therefore facilitate future studies regarding the acute health effects of radon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental science 3aexposure assessment 3aradon 3atechnology 3awinter1 aStern, Rebecca A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5554-64551 aBlomberg, Annelise J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1360-25801 aKang, Choong-Min1 aWei, Yaguang1 aLiu, Man1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5144-89191 aPeralta, Adjani A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2192-198X1 aLawrence, Joy1 aVieira, Carolina L.

Phase 1 (8 weeks): male Wistar rats were divided into a group fed with an AIN-93 M diet (n = 10) and a group fed with a high-fat (35%) high-fructose (20%) (HFHF) diet (n = 20). Phase 2 (intervention 10 weeks): the control group was continued with the AIN-93 M diet (n = 10) and the HFHF group was divided into HFHF (n = 10) and sorghum flour (n = 10) groups. Sorghum flour decreased the NO, Akt, p65-NFκB, TLR4, and lipid peroxidation in the liver. Furthermore, sorghum flour improved SOD and CAT activities and the total antioxidant capacity of plasma. The phenolic compounds found in sorghum flour interacted in silico with AKT and p65-NFκB, mainly quercetin-3-rutinoside that showed the highest interaction with AKT (EFE −8.0) and procyanidins B1 and B2 that showed the highest interaction with p65-NFκB (EFE −8.9). The consumption of BRS 305 sorghum with a high tannin and resistant starch content improved inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibition of p65-NFκB activation in rats fed a high-fat high-fructose diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acomputer simulation 3ahigh fructose diet 3ahybrids 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3amales 3aoxidative stress 3aprocyanidins 3aresistant starch 3asorghum flour1 aTheodoro, Jaqueline Maciel Vieira1 aGrancieri, Mariana1 aToledo, Renata Celi Lopes1 ade Barros, Frederico Augusto Ribeiro1 aTako, Elad1 aQueiroz, Valéria Aparecida Vieira1 aMartino, Hércia Stampini Duarte0 tFood & function.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 12, no. 18 p.8738-8746dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo00802a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01735naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245006700168500001900235520073800254592002800992650001001020650001901030650001901049650001501068653001001083653000901093653003301102653002001135700005201155773010601207856008701313852000901400655001201409IND60732880620221117031022.0210423e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073288062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanfei10aTiOF2/g-C3N4 composite for visible-light driven photocatalysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel TiOF₂/g-C₃N₄ composite was obtained by hydrothermal formation of TiOF₂ when g-C₃N₄ powders were present.

This paper quantified the provincial energy intensity of COD removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), tracked the sectoral and regional water pollutant (COD) transfers beneath the provincial economic transactions based on the multi-regional input-output analysis, and evaluated the energy saving and loss in different provinces based on an energy-pollutant nexus assessment framework. We found that economic trade could transfer local pollutant reduction pressure to distant regions through the national economic system. The critical VCOD importers (Beijing and Zhejiang) and exporters (Jiangxi and Heilongjiang) highlighted the necessity of emission reduction responsibility assignment from both the demand and the supply side. The VCOD was transferred from higher energy intensity provinces to lower energy intensity provinces, which contributed to a 1.42 × 10⁸ kWh energy loss of COD removal nationally. Our results showed that from the energy-pollutant nexus perspective, some of the energy conservation and pollutant reduction goals were not always consistent. This study may help optimize the spatial regulation of national energy conservation and pollution reduction in a more integrated and systematic way.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical oxygen demand 3aeconomic systems 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3ainput output analysis 3apollutants 3atrade 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aPollutant transfer 0aEnergy saving 0aCOD 0aMulti-regional input-output analysis1 aDuan, Cuncun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9985-34381 aChen, Bin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 363 p.132490-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1324903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245017600208500001900384520191400403592002802317650001202345650001102357650002302368650001302391650001902404650002202423650001802445650002202463650001102485650001502496650001602511653003102527653001902558653002502577653002502602653003702627653004302664700001602707700005802723700001902781700005702800700001802857700006102875700001502936773010602951856008703057852000903144655001203153IND60732880720221117030729.0210423e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073288072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9503-135X10aSilanization of siliceous materials, part 3: Modification of surface energy and acid-base properties of silica nanoparticles determined by inverse gas chromatography (IGC)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSurface modified silica nanoparticles are well-established composite materials.

After surface silylation, the total surface energy (γst) of pyrogenic silica nanoparticles decreased from 225 mJ/m² to 149 mJ/m² referring to both a reduced wettability and an increased hydrophobicity of the MPTMS-modified sample. Moreover, the acidity/basicity parameters according to the van Oss and the Gutmann approach indicated that the acidity of the silica surface decreases by MPTMS grafting. In addition, IGC at finite concentration (using isopropanol as probe molecule) was applied to obtain the energetic heterogeneity of the silica surface. The results showed a bimodal energy distribution with maxima at about 18 and 25 kJ/mol and a reduction of the higher energetic sites from 65% to only 35% after MPTMS treatment. Overall, it can be seen that the dominance of specific interactions on silica surfaces is maintained even after extensive silanization. These findings are in agreement with the results of ²⁹Si CP MAS NMR measurements which confirm the assignment of higher energetic sites to silanol groups. For the interpretation of the IGC results, quantum chemical calculations proved the preferred interaction of isopropanol onto silica surfaces via hydrogen bridging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aenergy 3agas chromatography 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3aisopropyl alcohol 3aleast squares 3aquantum mechanics 3asilica 3asilylation 3awettability 0aInverse gas chromatography 0aSurface energy 0aSilica nanoparticles 0aSurface modification 0a3-Mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane 0aDensity functional theory calculations1 aMeyer, Ralf1 aBertmer, Marko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3208-79271 aNaumov, Sergej1 aAl-Naji, Majd1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5024-04491 aWissel, Julia1 aSteinhart, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5241-84981 aEnke, Dirk0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 June 05, v. 618 p.126472-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245009500156300001600251520059600267592002800863650002000891650002300911650001600934650001000950650001400960650001000974650001700984650001001001651001101011700002401022773012501046856007201171852000901243655001201252IND60636472020221119165856.0190513e20180629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063647202DNAL7 a10.5586/am.11082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiętka, Jacek14aThe first record of Fistulina hepatica (Schaeff.)

To assess the association of overweight [Body condition score (BCS) >5] and glucose metabolism alterations, with established or potential markers of CKD. In addition, fructosamine and fasted blood glucose were compared as predictors of early abnormal glucose metabolism. 54 clinically healthy cats were included in a cross-sectional study comprising 25 neutered males and 29 (28 neutered) females aged 7.2 (5.5–9.4) years. Two potential markers of CKD, namely urinary free active transforming growth factor-β1-creatinine ratio and urinary retinol binding protein-creatinine ratio were measured along with other parameters to assess CKD. A receiver operating curve was used to identify the best sensitivity and specificity of fructosamine to identify cats with fasting glucose >6.5 mmol/L. No association was found between BCS and markers of CKD. Fructosamine was greater in cats with fasting glucose >6.5 mmol/L compared to those with fasting glucose ≤6.5 mmol/L. A fructosamine concentration ≥250 µmol/L was able to detect cats with hyperglycemia with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 65%. Furthermore, fructosamine was more strongly correlated with fasting glucose than albumin-corrected fructosamine (r = 0.43, p = 0.002 vs r = 0.32, p = 0.026). Cats with higher fructosamine had lower serum symmetric dimethylarginine concentrations. The present study does not suggest an effect of obesity on renal function in domestic cats. Fructosamine might be of value for the diagnosis of prediabetes mellitus in cats.  aIdexx laboratories supported SDMA, fructosamine, triglycerides and cholesterol measurements. In addition, a grant was received from Consejo Social of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria to measure other renal biomarkes (uRBP:Cr, uaTGFB1:Cr, UPC); and the study was performed during a pre-doctoral fellowship (LP-L) granted by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abody condition 3across-sectional studies 3aglucose 3ahyperglycemia 3akidney diseases 3ametabolism 3aobesity 3arenal function 3avitamin A 0aCat 0afeline 0ametabolic syndrome 0afructosamine 0adiabetes mellitus 0anephropathy 0asymmetric dimethyl arginine 0aactive transforming growth factor-β1 0aretinol biding protein1 aBoronat, M.1 aMelián, C.1 aBrito-Casillas, Y.1 aWägner, A.

Both were lethargic and emaciated, had dermatitis, and died. Histologic skin lesions in the seals were similar and consisted of epidermal and follicular epithelial hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, degeneration, and necrosis. The most distinctive finding was extensive syncytial zones bounded superficially by hyperkeratosis and deeply by hyperplastic basal cells. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were present in epithelial cells. Morbilliviral antigen was demonstrated in the skin lesions by immunohistochemistry. Phocine distemper virus was detected in the skin by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and a phocine distemper virus-specific probe using the Southern blot technique.

The yield, swelling power, amylose content, paste clarity, and viscosity of yam and cocoyam starches were determined. Likewise, the structural conformation of the starches was evaluated using optical and scanning electron microscopy as well as FTIR spectroscopy. The result showed that, the yield, swelling power, amylose content, and paste clarity of yam and cocoyam starches were 33.38% (217 ± 0.88 g) and 25% (108.75 ± 0.88 g); 38.4 ± 0.2 g/g and 33.4 ± 0.1 g/g; 25.96 ± 0.16 and 22.99 ± 0.04 and 44 ± 2% 34 ± 1% and 350 ± 15.28 and 210 ± 10 mPa.s, respectively. The yield, swelling power, amylose content, paste clarity, and viscosity of yam starch were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than from cocoyam starch. The result of FTIR spectroscopy of yam and cocoyam starches at OH stretch was 3176.45 and 3251.60 cm⁻¹, respectively. At OH stretch cocoyam starch gives higher absorption intensity and broader shape than yam starch, which could be attributed to higher crystallinity of cocoyam starch granules compared to yam starch. The optical and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the granular shape of yam starch was oval whereas cocoyam starch was polygonal with fissures and cavities. In conclusion, from the various functional and structural properties of yam and cocoyam starches evaluated, both could be a cheap and good sources starch, which could be worked for industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColocasia esculenta 3aDioscorea rotundata 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aamylose 3acrystal structure 3aindustrial applications 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch granules 3aswelling (materials) 3aviscosity 3ayams1 aEgwim, Evans C.1 aAdewoyin, Mary A.1 aAwoyinka, Oluwapemi0 tStärke =.g2016 July, v. 68, no. 7-8 p.771-777dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2015002803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245010900204300002000313506007600333520079900409592002801208506003701236650001901273650000901292650001601301650001001317650001401327650000901341650002201350650001201372650001401384650003001398650001201428700001601440700001801456700002101474700002301495700002101518700001301539700001701552700001201569700001501581700002101596700002601617700002101643700002301664700001701687700002101704700001901725773017501744856008301919852000902002655001202011IND4481171420221207065511.0120502e20111206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448117142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11178351082doi7 aPMC32417702pmcid7 a221062892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrebs, Philippe10aLethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy in a hypomorphic Med30 mouse mutant is ameliorated by ketogenic diet  ap. 19678-19682.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDeficiencies of subunits of the transcriptional regulatory complex Mediator generally result in embryonic lethality, precluding study of its physiological function. Here we describe a missense mutation in Med30 causing progressive cardiomyopathy in homozygous mice that, although viable during lactation, show precipitous lethality 2â3 wk after weaning. Expression profiling reveals pleiotropic changes in transcription of cardiac genes required for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial integrity. Weaning mice to a ketogenic diet extends viability to 8.5 wk. Thus, we establish a mechanistic connection between Mediator and induction of a metabolic program for oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, in which lethal cardiomyopathy is mitigated by dietary intervention.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acardiomyopathy 3adiet 3afatty acids 3agenes 3alactation 3amice 3amissense mutation 3amutants 3aoxidation 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aweaning1 aFan, Weiwei1 aChen, Yen-Hui1 aTobita, Kimimasa1 aDownes, Michael R.1 aWood, Malcolm R.1 aSun, Lei1 aLi, Xiaohong1 aXia, Yu1 aDing, Ning1 aSpaeth, Jason M.1 aMoresco, Eva Marie Y.1 aBoyer, Thomas G.1 aLo, Cecilia Wen Ya1 aYen, Jeffrey1 aEvans, Ronald M.1 aBeutler, Bruce0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Dec. 6, v. 108, no. 49 p.19678-19682dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11178351083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01541naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245009100184300001800275520061500293592002800908650001300936650002800949650001100977700001500988700005301003773011301056856008501169852000901254655001201263IND60766586220221119181837.0220208e20220125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076658622DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.1c024422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetiawan, Raymond Christopher10aDependence of Interfacial Adhesion between Substances on Their Electron Work Functions  ap. 1672-1679.  aIn this article, we demonstrate the dependence of the adhesive force (FAd) between two different substances on their electron work functions (EWF or φ) without atomic diffusion involved. The adhesive forces between Si₃N₄ and a number of metals were measured using an atomic force microscope. It is shown that the larger the difference in φ between the two substances in contact, the larger the FAd.

In this approach, starch‐rich potato extract operates as the reducing agent and a stabilizing layer on newly fabricated Fe₃O₄ NPs. Furthermore, the crystal structure, morphology, durability, chemical composition, purity, and magnetite properties of Fe₃O₄ NPs are scrutinized, using XRD, TEM, TGA, FTIR, SEM/EDX, and VSM, respectively. The presence of potato extract functional groups on the surface of the magnetite NPs is confirmed via TGA and FTIR analyses. XRD and TEM probes reveal that the magnetite NPs are face centered cubic (FCC) in a shape with the size of which is about 40 ± 2.2 nm. EDX results demonstrate that the sample contains mainly iron oxide NPs. In addition, VSM measurement confirmed that the powder is superparamagnetic, showing the saturation magnetization value of 28.78 emu/g. UV‐Vis color intensity of increased productivity of NPs was shown at 375 nm. Fe₃O₄ NPs also exhibits fine catalytic activity for the removal of an organic methylene blue contaminant in waste water at room temperature. Finally, a possible mechanism of the as‐synthesized magnetite NPs is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acatalytic activity 3achemical composition 3acolor 3acrystal structure 3adurability 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agreen chemistry 3amagnetite 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3apotatoes 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater1 aBaghlani‐Nejazd, Mina H.1 aBadri, Mohamad1 aKashisaz, Mehdi1 aKhaledi‐Nasab, Ali1 aKroushawi, Feisal0 tStärke =.g2016 July, v. 68, no. 7-8 p.796-804dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2015003473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010400177300001400281520089700295592002801192650002501220650001901245650002901264650001201293650001601305650001201321650001501333651001001348651001401358653003001372653001601402653001801418653002501436653001801461653001801479653001901497653002201516700002201538700002201560700002101582700002301603773009801626856008601724852000901810655001201819IND60634861220221117180347.0201202e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063486122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaid, Suzaini Mohamed10aVertical Greenery System in urban tropical climate and its carbon sequestration potential: A review  ap. 57-70.  aThis article presents a comprehensive literature review of Vertical Greenery System (VGS) in tropical areas, its benefits, its carbon sequestration potential and its calculation methodologies, and its potential for urban heat island (UHI) and climate change mitigation. The contemporary VGS has evolved from the seventh-century beginnings of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to the vertical urban farms of today in Singapore and Japan. The VGS has demonstrated a significant role in mitigating urban climate change impacts by the potential use of carbon sequestration from vegetation. However, studies on carbon sequestration rate and the methodologies used for calculation are still rather vague. Therefore, this paper reviews existing methodologies for evaluating carbon sequestration rates in tropical climate plants and makes suggestions of potential plants for optimum carbon sequestering.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental indicators 3agardens 3aheat island 3atropics 3avegetation 3aJapan 3aSingapore 0aVertical Greenery Systems 0aGreen walls 0aGreen facades 0aCarbon sequestration 0aMethodologies 0aUrban tropics 0aClimate change 0aUrban heat island1 aPerisamy, Eeswari1 aHussein, Hazreena1 aMyeda, Nik Elyna1 aZainon, Nurshuhada0 tEcological indicators.g2018 Aug., v. 91 p.57-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016800155300001800323520116300341592002801504650002201532650001801554650001801572650001301590650002201603650001701625650001301642650001901655650001301674650002001687650001501707700001801722700001901740700002801759700002101787773012701808856007401935852000902009655001202018IND60751035320221122063448.0210921e20210920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075103532DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo00887k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Yipeng10aInhibition and interactions of alpha-amylase by daucosterol from the peel of Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) [Erratum: October 2021, Vol.12(19), p.9503]  ap. 8411-8424.  aThe alpha-amylase inhibitory effect of daucosterol purified from the peel of Chinese water chestnut (CWC), a common Chinese vegetable, was assessed. The alpha-amylase inhibitory properties were elucidated by enzyme inhibition, fluorescence quenching and molecular docking experiments. It was found that three saponins from CWC peel exhibited potent inhibitory activity on alpha-amylase and daucosterol was found to be the main inhibitory factor against alpha-amylase with a mixed-type mode. Strong fluorescence quenching of alpha-amylase was observed under static fluorescence quenching with hydrophobic interactions with daucosterol. Molecular docking revealed that the conformation of daucosterol in the high-affinity sites I and II of alpha-amylase was optimum, and hydrophobic interactions were produced by daucosterol aglycone, and hydrogen bonding by the β-d-glucopyranosyl residue. Ingested daucosterol suppressed the elevation of blood glucose levels through inhibition of alpha-amylase in the small intestine in starch-loaded mice. This study provides data supporting the potential benefit of daucosterol from CWC peel in the treatment of diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleocharis dulcis 3aalpha-amylase 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3aenzyme inhibition 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3asaponins 3asmall intestine 3avegetables1 aYang, Xiaomei1 aShang, Chaojie1 aThao, Truong Thi Phuong1 aKoyama, Tomoyuki0 tFood & function.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 12, no. 18 p.8411-8424dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo00887k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009600168500001900264520092800283592002801211650001301239650001101252650000901263650001301272650003701285653001901322653002401341653002001365653003501385653001801420700002101438700001801459773010601477856008701583852000901670655001201679IND60732881220221117032001.0210423e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073288122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRakov, I.I.10aInteraction of gold and phthalocyanines nanoparticles generated by laser radiation in water  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExperimental results are presented on the interaction of gold nanoparticles (NPs) generated by laser ablation in water and nanoparticles of copper and aluminum phthalocyanine (PC) obtained by laser fragmentation in water. Such particles are characterized by chemical purity, in contrast to NPs synthesized using other techniques. It is found that addition of either AlPC or CuPC colloidal solutions to colloid of Au NPs causes the aggregation of Au NPs. This is confirmed by evolution of extinction spectra of colloids mixture and by Transmission Electron Microscopy. This effect is not observed under addition of the colloid of AlPC to Ag NPs also generated by laser ablation in water. Addition of PC colloids to the mixture of Au and Ag NPs leads to selective aggregation of only Au NPs. Possible mechanisms of aggregation of Au NPs upon mixing with PC NPs that have the dzeta-potentials of different signs are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acopper 3agold 3ananogold 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aLaser ablation 0aLaser fragmentation 0aPhthalocyanines 0aAgglomeration of nanoparticles 0aNanoparticles1 aPridvorova, S.M.1 aShafeev, G.A.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 June 05, v. 618 p.126491-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03794naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245005900176300001600235520176200251592002802013650001202041650001702053650001602070650003102086650001902117650001702136650001102153650001402164650002602178650001202204650002902216650002602245650003302271650003702304650005002341650001102391650004702402650003502449650000902484650005302493650003902546650007202585650004302657650006402700650001202764650001502776651001402791653002202805653001702827653002402844653001202868700001602880700002102896700002002917700001602937773010602953852000903059856007603068655001203144IND2327591820221119113812.0181004e200205  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232759182DNAL7 a120144942pmid7 a10.1354/vp.39-3-3002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJirjis, F.

Sixty turkey poults were reared in isolation conditions. At 3 weeks of age, serum samples were collected and determined to be free of antibodies against APV, avian influenza, hemorrhagic enteritis, Newcastle disease, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, Mycoplasma meleagridis, Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, and Bordetella avium. When the poults were 4 weeks old, they were inoculated with cell culture–propagated APV (APV/Minnesota/turkey/2a/97) via the conjunctival spaces and nostrils. After inoculation, four poults were euthanatized every 2 days for 14 days, and blood, swabs, and tissues were collected. Clinical signs consisting of nasal discharge, swelling of the infraorbital sinuses, and frothy ocular discharge were evident by 2 days postinoculation (PI) and persisted until day 12 PI. Mild inflammation of the mucosa of the nasal turbinates and infraorbital sinuses was present between days 2 and 10 PI. Mild inflammatory changes were seen in tracheas of poults euthanatized between days 4 and 10 PI. Antibody to APV was detected by day 7 PI. The virus was detected in tissue preparations and swabs of nasal turbinates and infraorbital sinuses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, virus isolation, and immunohistochemical staining methods between days 2 and 10 PI. Virus was detected in tracheal tissue and swabs between days 2 and 6 PI using the same methods. In this experiment, turkey poults inoculated with tissue culture-propagated APV developed clinical signs similar to those seen in field cases associated with infection with this virus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aturkeys 3apathogenesis 3aPneumovirus 3arespiratory tract diseases 3adisease course 3ainflammation 3amucosa 3adetection 3atrachea (vertebrates) 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aCytopathogenic Effect, Viral 2aDNA, Viralxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Antibody Techniquexveterinary 2aHistocytochemistryxveterinary 2aMale 2aMetapneumovirusxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aNasal Mucosaxpathologyxvirology. 2aParamyxoviridae Infectionsxbloodxpathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathologyxvirology. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aTurkeys 2aVero Cells 0aMinnesota 0aAvian pneumovirus 0apathogenesis 0arespiratory disease 0aturkeys1 aNoll, S.

The occurrence and distribution of biofilms at microscale as well as their impacts on macroscopic biogeochemical reaction rates are still poorly understood. This paper investigated the formation and distributions of biofilms in heterogeneous sediments using multiscale models and evaluated the effects of biofilm heterogeneity on local and macroscopic biogeochemical reaction rates. Sediment pore structures derived from X‐ray computed tomography were used to simulate the microscale flow dynamics and biofilm distribution in the sediment column. The response of biofilm formation and distribution to the variations in hydraulic and chemical properties was first examined. One representative biofilm distribution was then utilized to evaluate its effects on macroscopic reaction rates using nitrate reduction as an example. The results revealed that microorganisms primarily grew on the surfaces of grains and aggregates near preferential flow paths where both electron donor and acceptor were readily accessible, leading to the heterogeneous distribution of biofilms in the sediments. The heterogeneous biofilm distribution decreased the macroscopic rate of biogeochemical reactions as compared with those in homogeneous cases. Operationally considering the heterogeneous biofilm distribution in macroscopic reactive transport models such as using dual porosity domain concept can significantly improve the prediction of biogeochemical reaction rates. Overall, this study provided important insights into the biofilm formation and distribution in soils and sediments as well as their impacts on the macroscopic manifestation of reaction rates.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Division through Terrestrial Ecosystem Science (TES) program  cSubsurface Biogeochemistry Research (SBR) Science Focus Area (SFA) research program  a41572228cNatural Science Foundation of China  a41521001cNatural Science Foundation of China  aG01296001cSouthern University of Science and Technology  a2016YFA0601000cMinistry of Science and Technology of China  a2016YF0601002cNational Key R&D Program China 3aX-radiation 3abiofilm 3ahydrodynamics 3anitrate reduction 3aporosity 3aprediction 3apreferential flow 3aresearch 3asediments 3awater1 aLiu, Chongxuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7403-60011 aLiu, Yuanyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6076-97331 aBailey, Vanessa L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2248-88900 tWater resources research.g2017 Nov., v. 53, no. 11 p.8698-8714dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR0205703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002600142245008900168300001800257520085000275592002801125650001401153650001201167650002401179650001301203650001501216650001601231650002001247650002401267700001401291700001601305773013101321856007801452852000901530655001201539IND60563593720221122060217.0170302e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056359372DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b004282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEsfandiarfard, Keyhan10aUnsymmetrical E-Alkenes from the Stereoselective Reductive Coupling of Two Aldehydes  ap. 2940-2943.  aThe unprecedented formation of unsymmetrical alkenes from the intermolecular reductive coupling of two different aldehydes is described. In contrast to the McMurry reaction which affords statistical product mixtures, selectivity in the reported procedure is achieved by a sequential ionic mechanism in which a first aldehyde is reacted with a phosphanylphosphonate to afford a phosphaalkene intermediate which, upon activation by hydroxide, reacts with a second aldehyde to the unsymmetrical E-alkenes. The described reaction is free of transition metals and proceeds under ambient temperature within minutes in good to excellent overall yields. It is a new methodology to use feedstock aldehydes for the direct production of CC double bond-containing products and may impact how chemists think of multistep synthetic sequences in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3aalkenes 3aambient temperature 3achemists 3afeedstocks 3amethodology 3astereochemistry 3atransition elements1 aMai, Juri1 aOtt, Sascha0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 139, no. 8 p.2940-2943dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b004283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245010100219520139300320592002801713650001601741650001101757650001101768650002201779650002601801650001701827650001601844650002601860650002001886650002401906650001901930650002901949651000901978653002201987653001002009653001102019653000802030653001902038700002202057700003102079700002202110773011302132856008602245852000902331655001202340IND60779862720221122043705.0220628e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077986272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1325622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemi-Mobtaker, Hassan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7074-707912aA new method for green forage production: Energy use efficiency and environmental sustainability  aIn recent decades, hydroponic fodder has been widely used for livestock feed. Studying the energy indicators and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the hydroponic fodder can result in applying the best method for higher production with less environmental impacts. Hence the aims of this study are to evaluate energy and water use and environmental indicators for hydroponic fodder production in central region of Iran. Data collected using oral questionnaire from hydroponic fodder greenhouses in Isfahan province. The results demonstrated that total energy for production of one ton hydroponic fodder is 5060.40 MJ. Also energy ratio (ER) and energy productivity (EP) were calculated as 0.33 and 0.20 kg MJ⁻¹, respectively. The water productivity (WP) was about 287 kg m⁻³ which indicates that about 287 kg of forage is produced per each m³ of water consumed. The results also showed that despite the many benefits of hydroponic fodder on livestock nutrition, its greenhouse cultivation imposes many adverse effects on the environment. Human health damage categories was calculated as 0.00434 DALY t⁻¹ which was much more than other similar products. Cumulative exergy demand (CExD) results showed that the percentage of Non-renewable, fossil for hydroponic fodder production mainly result from electricity which can be decreased via using renewable energy (RE) technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aexergy 3aforage 3aforage production 3agreenhouse production 3ahuman health 3ahydroponics 3alife cycle assessment 3alivestock feeds 3alivestock nutrition 3aquestionnaires 3arenewable energy sources 3aIran 0aHydroponic fodder 0aWater 0aEnergy 0aLCA 0aSustainability1 aSharifi, Mohammad1 aTaherzadeh-Shalmaei, Nahid1 aAfrasiabi, Sadegh0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Aug. 20, v. 363 p.132562-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1325623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008100167300001600248520108300264592002801347650003101375650001601406650002401422650001701446650001201463650002201475650003201497650001101529650000701540650001901547650001301566650002501579700002001604700001601624700001301640700001701653700001901670700001801689773010601707856008101813852000901894655001201903IND60081883420221123041749.0141014e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008188342DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617140502942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeb, Bibi Saima10aAssessment of toxicity of volatile fatty acids to Photobacterium phosphoreum  ap. 510-515.  aThe toxicity of four volatile fatty acids (VFAs) as anaerobic digestion (AD) intermediates was investigated at pH 7. Photobacterium phosphoreum T3 was used as an indicator organism. Binary, ternary and mixtures of AD intermediates were designated by letters A (acetic acid + propionic acid), B (acetic acid + butyric acid), C (acetic acid + ethanol), D (propionic acid + butyric acid), E (propionic acid + ethanol), F (butyric acid + ethanol), G (acetic acid + propionic acid + butyric acid), H (acetic acid + propionic acid + ethanol), I (acetic acid + butyric acid+ ethanol), J (propionic acid + butyric acid + ethanol) and K (acetic acid + propionic acid + butyric acid + ethanol) to assess the toxicity through equitoxic mixing ratio method. The IC₅₀ values of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and ethanol were 9.812, 7.76, 6.717 and 17.33 g/L respectively, displaying toxicity order of: butyric acid > propionic acid > acetic acid > ethanol being additive in nature.

However, a sub-population of colon cancer patients do not respond to 5-FU and this treatment does not provide survival benefit due to chemo resistance. The mechanisms involved in 5-FU resistance are not fully understood and multiple factors have been involved in the sensitivity of cancer cells to 5-FU. We previously reported that β6-integrin plays an important role in invasion, metastasis and degradation of extracellular matrix of colon cancer. In this study, we investigated whether β6-integrin is associated with chemo resistance in colon cancer. We found that over-expression of β6-integrin protected SW480 and HT-29 colon cancer cells from 5-FU-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, which were accompanied by changes in cytochrome C released from the mitochondria and activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Moreover, β6-integrin resulted in up-regulation of Bcl-2 and down-regulation of Bax. We also found that β6-integrin induced 5-FU resistance through the ERK/MAP kinase pathway and the β6-ERK2 direct binding. The results indicate β6-integrin might be a novel therapeutic target in colon cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-9 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytochrome c 3adrug therapy 3aextracellular matrix 3agrowth retardation 3ametastasis 3amitochondria 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apatients 2aAntimetabolites, Antineoplasticxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aCaspase 9xmetabolism 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aColonic Neoplasmsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCytochromes cxmetabolism 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasmxgenetics 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxmetabolism 2aFluorouracilxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHT29 Cells 2aHumans 2aIntegrin beta Chainsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMAP Kinase Signaling System 2aMitochondriaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2xmetabolism 2abcl-2-Associated X Proteinxmetabolism1 aWang, Jian1 aNiu, Weibo1 aLiu, Enyu1 aWang, Jiayong1 aPeng, Cheng1 aLin, Pengfei1 aWang, Ben1 aKhan, Abdul Qadir1 aGao, Huijie1 aLiang, Benjia1 aShahbaz, Muhammad1 aNiu, Jun0 tCancer letters.g2013 Jan. 28, v. 328, no. 2 p.325-334dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.10.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009400170500001900264520090800283592002801191650001401219650001401233650002301247650003001270650001101300650002201311650001301333653001801346653001101364653003201375653002601407700001601433773010601449856008701555852000901642655001201651IND60732881620221117030834.0210423e20210605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073288162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xuening12aA DFT study of graphene-FeNx (x = 4, 3, 2, 1) catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, we used density functional theory (DFT) to systematically study the mechanism and activity of a graphene-FeNx (x = 4, 3, 2, 1) series of non-noble metal catalysts for acetylene hydrochlorination at the B3LYP/6–31 G** level, and the LANL2DZ effective core pseudo-potentials basis set was applied to Fe atom. Dispersion-corrected DFT-D3 was considered in the calculation. In the process of the graphene-FeNx catalytic reaction, all the catalysts adsorbed acetylene first and adsorbed hydrogen chloride later to form a co-adsorption structure. The calculation results displayed that with a decrease in doped nitrogen atoms in the catalyst, the activity of the reaction decreased successively. Graphene-FeN₄ showed excellent catalytic performance, and its energy barrier was only 16.80 kcal/mol. Accordingly, it is a latent non-noble metal catalyst for hydrochlorination of acetylene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylene 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3ahydrochloric acid 3anitrogen 0aGraphene-FeNx 0aDFT-D3 0aAcetylene hydrochlorination 0aCatalytic performance1 aKang, Lihua0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 June 05, v. 618 p.126495-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1264953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245010700161300001600268520197700284592002802261650001902289650000902308650001402317650001902331650001402350650001602364650001902380650001202399650001102411650001402422650001302436650001002449650001602459650002002475650001602495650002202511651001002533651001602543653001002559653002502569653001402594653001002608653002502618700001802643700005702661773009902718856008102817852000902898655001202907IND60564799720221122221837.0190417e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056479972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cj.2017.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, Dana10aResponse of phenology- and yield-related traits of maize to elevated temperature in a temperate region  ap. 305-316.  aExtreme high temperatures detrimental to maize production are projected to occur more frequently with future climate change. Phenology and yield-related traits were investigated under several levels of elevated temperature in two early-maturing hybrid cultivars: Junda 6 (grown in northeastern China) and Chalok 1 (grown in South Korea). They were cultivated in plastic houses in Suwon, Korea (37.27°N, 126.99°E) held at target temperatures of ambient (AT), AT+1.5°C, AT+3°C, and AT+5°C at one sowing date in 2013 and three different sowing dates in 2014. Vegetative and reproductive growth durations showed variation depending on sowing date, experimental year, and cultivar. Growth duration tended to decrease, but not necessarily, with temperature elevation, but somewhat increased again above a certain temperature. High temperature-dependent variation was greater during grain filling than in the vegetative period before anthesis. Elevated temperature showed no significant effects on duration or peak dates of silking and anthesis, and thus on anthesis–silking interval. Grain yield tended to decrease with temperature elevation above ambient, showing a sharper linear decrease with mean growing season temperature increase in Junda 6 than in Chalok 1. The decrease in kernel number accounted for a much greater contribution to the yield reductions due to temperature elevation than did the decrease in individual kernel weight in both cultivars. Individual harvestable kernel weight was not significantly affected by temperature elevation treatments. Kernel number showed a linear decrease with mean growth temperature from early ear formation to early grain-filling stage, with Junda 6 showing a much severer decrease than Chalok 1. Kernel number reduction due to temperature elevation was attributable more to the decrease in differentiated ovule number than to the decrease in kernel set in Chalok 1, but largely to the decrease of kernel set in Junda 6.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acorn 3acultivars 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3agrowing season 3ahybrids 3aovules 3aphenology 3aseed set 3aseeds 3asowing date 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 3avegetative growth 3aChina 3aSouth Korea 0aMaize 0aElevated temperature 0aPhenology 0aYield 0aYield-related traits1 aLee, Kyu-Jong1 aLee, Byun-Woo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2284-13480 tcrop journal.g2017 Aug., v. 5, no. 4 p.305-316dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23202x2214-51417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cj.2017.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010600160300001600266520105700282592002801339650001801367650001101385650001901396650001801415650001301433650001201446650001101458650002601469650001601495650001201511700002001523700001801543700001501561700002101576700002001597773009901617856008101716852000901797655001201806IND60081883720221123041625.0141014e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008188372DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-014-9775-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz, V.10aComparison of Strategies for the Production of FMDV Empty Capsids Using the Baculovirus Vector System  ap. 963-970.  aRecombinant FMDV empty capsids have been produced in insect cells and larvae using the baculovirus expression system, although protein yield and efficiency of capsid assembly have been highly variable. In this work, two strategies were compared for the expression of FMDV A/Arg/01 empty capsids: infection with a dual-promoter baculovirus vector coding for the capsid precursor (P12A) and the protease 3C under the control of the polyhedrin and p10 promoters, respectively (BacP12A-3C), or a single-promoter vector coding the P12A3C cassette (BacP12A3C). Expression levels and assembly into empty capsids were analyzed in insect cells and larvae. We observed that the use of the single-promoter vector allowed higher levels of expression both in insect cells and larvae. Recombinant capsid proteins produced by both vectors were recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against conformational epitopes of FMDV A/Arg/01 and proved to self-assemble into empty capsids (75S) and pentamers (12S) when analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaculoviridae 3acapsid 3acentrifugation 3acoat proteins 3aepitopes 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aproteinases 3asucrose1 aMignaqui, A.

By explicitly modeling coarse-grained ligands that cap the NP surface, it is shown that differences in NP shapes and time-dependent facet-specific ligand densities give rise to drastically different transformation mechanisms. Our results indicate that the extent of screening of the inter-particle interactions by the surrounding solvation environment has a significant impact on reversibility and ultimately the coherence of the final two-dimensional superlattice obtained. For the particle shapes examined, a hexagonal pre-assembly and a square superlattice final assembly (upon preferential ligand desorption from {100} facets) were prevalent; however, cuboctahedral NPs formed intermediate epitaxially bonded branched clusters, which eventually grew and rearranged into a square lattice; in contrast, truncated octahedral NPs exhibited an abrupt rhombic-to-square transition driven by the clustering of their numerous {111}-ligands that favored the stacking of linear NP rods. To track the incipient order in the system, we also outline a set of novel order parameters that measure the local orientation alignment between nearest-neighbor pairs. The simulation protocols advanced in this work could pave the way forward for exploration of the vast phase space associated with the interfacial self-assembly of NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesorption 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 3asolvation1 aEscobedo, F.

We hypothesized that a dry therapeutic urinary diet combined with targeted antimicrobial therapy can effectively dissolve presumptive struvite cystolithiasis in dogs with naturally occurring urease-producing bacterial UTI. RESULTS: Ten dogs with presumed infection-induced struvite cystolithiasis based on lower urinary tract signs (LUTS), radiodense cystoliths, and urease-producing bacterial UTI were enrolled. At enrollment, antimicrobials and dry therapeutic urinary diet were dispensed. In addition to lack of radiographic resolution of urolithiasis, dogs with persistent clinical signs were considered non-responders. There was no significant difference in pH between responders and non-responders; USG was significantly higher in the responder group. Recheck visits continued until radiographic dissolution or failure was documented. Five of the 10 dogs achieved radiographic dissolution of cystolithiasis within a median of 31 days (range 19–103). In the other 5 dogs, surgical urolith removal was necessary due to persistent LUTS (3 dogs within 2 weeks) or lack of continued dissolution noted radiographically (1 dog with numerous cystoliths failed at day 91; 1 dog failed by day 57 with questionable owner compliance). CONCLUSIONS: Dissolution of urinary tract infection induced struvite cystoliths can be accomplished in some dogs fed this dry therapeutic urinary diet in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy. Case selection could increase the likelihood of successful dissolution; however, if calcium phosphate is present, this could also prevent stone dissolution. If clinical signs persist despite diet and antimicrobials, stone removal is advised.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanti-infective agents 3abladder calculi 3acalcium phosphates 3acompliance 3adiet 3adog feeding 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3apH 3aradiography 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aurinary tract1 aLarsen, Jennifer A.1 aBannasch, Michael1 aHulsebosch, Sean E.1 aGagne, Jason W.1 aJohnson, Eric G.1 aWestropp, Jodi L.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1287-39790 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.273-273dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1992-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245010800181300001800289520156400307592002801871650000801899650002901907650001001936650001301946650002501959650002701984650001902011650001602030650001102046650002002057650001502077650001402092650001202106650001602118650001802134650002602152650001502178650002302193650002302216650002102239650001702260650002002277650004302297650002102340650003202361650001202393653000802405653001502413653001702428653002102445653001402466700002202480773012902502856008502631852000902716655001202725IND60624648420221121182142.0181204e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062464842DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2018.14616292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Mandrawy, Shefaa A. M.10aHematological, biochemical and oxidative stress studies of lumpy skin disease virus infection in cattle  ap. 1073-1077.  aLumpy skin disease (LSD) is an important disease of cattle. This study was conducted to determine alterations in hematological, biochemical and oxidative stress markers in cattle that have been naturally infected with LSD virus (LSDV). Blood samples and skin nodular lesions were collected from clinically infected, recovered and healthy animals. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to screen for Capripoxvirus DNA in samples from clinically infected animals. Hematological, biochemical and oxidative stress markers were measured. LSDV nuclic acids were detected in the collected samples using PCR. Hematological results revealed erythrocytosis, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in infected cattle. Biochemical analyses showed that total protein and globulin levels were significantly elevated, while albumin and glucose were significantly reduced in these cattle. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and creatinine levels were markedly elevated. Moreover, serum levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were markedly lowered, whereas lipid peroxidation (MDA) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and TNF-α) were elevated. Recovered cattle exhibited significant amelioration of the alterations resulting from LSDV infection. The results of this study suggest that LSDV infection induces changes in hematological and biochemical parameters and stimulates oxidative stress; these findings may be helpful for choosing a good strategy for rapidly detecting and diagnosing LSDV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aLumpy skin disease virus 3aacids 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acattle 3acreatine kinase 3acreatinine 3aglobulins 3aglucose 3aglutathione 3ainterleukin-4 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aleukopenia 3alipid peroxidation 3alumpy skin disease 3aoxidative stress 3apolycythemia 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3athrombocytopenia 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aviruses 0aLSD 0ahematology 0abiochemistry 0aoxidative stress 0acytokines1 aAlam, Rasha T.

Thirty-four cases are initially selected for the practical application. Based on the classical CBR, the performance forecast is added, an improved continuous variable interpolation scoring method is proposed, and three types of manual revision methods are proposed: owner&rsquo;s preference for the project transaction mode, extreme value, and secondary learning. The innovative method is verified with Nanjing HF Project as an example, and the results show that the case-based reasoning system can optimize the selection and design of the project transaction mode, providing a certain guarantee for project performance and facilitating the transfer of construction experience and knowledge within the construction industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aconstruction industry 3aprediction1 aJia, Jianyao1 aJin, Chenhao1 aWang, Na0 tSustainability.g2018 Nov. 09, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101141273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012300173300001800296520120400314592002801518650001301546650001101559650001001570650001801580650001401598650001601612650000901628650001101637650001101648650001601659650000901675650000701684650001901691650002001710650001101730650002101741650002501762650001001787653001801797653001701815653003101832653002201863700003101885773012901916856008502045852000902130655001202139IND60624648520221121053653.0181204e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062464852DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2018.14649272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDirekvandi, Ehsan10aFecal volatile fatty acids and blood metabolites in the Turkmen horse associated with type and source of cereal grains  ap. 1078-1083.  aIn this experiment, corn – oat, barley – wheat and barley – oats were used as a source of starch in 1, 2 and 3 rations respectively.

Endogenic OM accumulation in peaty sediments is not related to the climate but to felling of the alder forest and its substitution by Cyperaceae and paludal taxa in the marsh (Iron Age and Middle Ages). MM accumulation expresses mainly the sediment yield on the slopes, determined by landuse. During an initial phase (from the late Neolithic to the early Middle Ages), land-use change from crop cultivation to pastureland, possibly related to climate deterioration, led to a decrease in the sediment yield. During a second phase, since the early Middle Ages, the considerable development of crop cultivation over pasturing, even during periods of climate deterioration (such as the ‘Little Ice Age’), led to a sharp increase in sediment yield. However, although sediment yield was high, the hydrodynamics in the fen did not favour particle retention. Thus, since the Neolithic, yield and storage of OM and MM sediment have been marked by human activities, initially with high climatic stress, but since the Middle Ages without significant climatic stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyperaceae 3aHolocene epoch 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3aclimate 3afelling 3afloodplains 3aforests 3ahydrodynamics 3aland use change 3amarshes 3aorganic matter 3apastures 3asediment yield 3asediments 3astorage conditions 3aFrance 0aFlood plain 0aalluvium 0apeat 0aquantification of sedimentation 0asediment yield 0aresponse to climate and land-use change 0alate Holocene 0aParisian basin 0aFrance1 aBernard, Jacques1 aDi-Giovanni, Christian1 aHinschberger, Florent1 aLimondin-Lozouet, Nicole1 aVisset, Lionel0 tHolocene.g2006 July, v. 16, no. 5 p.647-660dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683606hl961rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245010800184300001400292520148600306592002801792650001001820650002101830650000901851650001301860650002501873650002401898650001901922650004101941650002101982650001102003650001802014650002602032650001202058650001302070650001002083653002002093653001802113653002602131653003402157653003302191700003102224700003302255700002702288700003202315700004002347700003902387773013702426856008502563852000902648655001202657IND60559977920221121035957.0190417e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055997792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jarmap.2016.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, Paula Cristina Souza10aNew and sustainable essential oils obtained from the long-term explored cinnamomum-like Aniba canelilla  ap. 60-71.  aThe traditional approach to extract the essential oils from precious-wood (Aniba canelilla), implies in obtaining it from the bark of the trunk of adult trees, usually resulting on the dead of the tree. In order to investigate the effect of seasonality, pruning and leaf development stages, essential oils from leaves and branches were obtained and the chemical composition analyzed by GC-FID and GC–MS. Multivariate analysis, PCA and HCA, allowed the distinction of three different types of essential oils from leaves and branches, with different chromatographic profiles. In general, 1-nitro-2-phenylethane contents were significantly higher in branches and have lower internal variation of this constituent than in leaves. The multivariate analysis also allowed the observation that seasonality and the stage of development did not influence the chemical composition of essential oils, as leaves and twigs were collected in different seasons, at different stages of development in the same area, are in a same group of similar chemical compositions, particularly characterized by the predominance of 1-nitro-2-phenylethane. Although variable, the levels of 1-nitro-2-phenylethane in leaves and twigs are comparable to the levels of 1-nitro-2-phenylethane observed in the stem wood and bark of A. canelilla. Thus, the extraction of essential oil of its leaves and branches may be an alternative way to prevent the overthrow of the trunk to produce essential oils of the specie.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAniba 3aapplied research 3abark 3abranches 3achemical composition 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aleaf development 3aleaves 3amature plants 3amultivariate analysis 3apruning 3astemwood 3atrees 0aAniba canelilla 0aPrecious bark 0aMultivariate analysis 0ahierarchical cluster analysis 0aprincipal component analysis1 aFernandes, Karenn Silveira1 aManhães, Adriana Pellegrini1 aCarneiro, Simone Braga1 aSampaio, Paulo de Tarso B.,1 aWiedemann, Larissa Silveira Moreira1 aVeiga Junior, Valdir Florêncio da0 tJournal of applied research on medicinal and aromatic plants.g2017 May, v. 5 p.60-71dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23209x2214-78617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmap.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012500170300001800295520123400313536009201547592002801639596007501667650002201742650002401764650001601788650001201804650002101816650002001837650002801857650001101885650002001896650001601916650002101932650001401953650002301967650001001990650001402000650001602014653002102030653001402051653002402065700002102089700002102110700002502131773012902156856008502285852000902370655001202379IND60624648620221121090105.0181204e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062464862DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2018.14667072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJelveh, Keyvan10aComparative effects of Chinese green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract and powder as feed supplements for broiler chickens  ap. 1114-1117.  aThe comparative effects of green tea extract (GTE) and powder (GTP) on performance of broilers were studied. A total of 405-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 9 groups containing 3 replicates of 15 chicks each. The treatments consisted of a control and diets supplemented with 4 levels (10, 20, 30 and 40 g/kg) of GTP and GTE. Feed intake and body weight gain were suppressed (P < .05) by GTP supplementation (P < .05). The best feed conversion ratio was observed on the GTE supplemented group. The highest mortality rate was recorded on the control and the lowest on the GTP groups (P < .05). The best economic index was achieved with GTE supplementation of the diet (P < .05). Relative weights of carcass, breast and drumstick were significantly reduced on GTP compared to GTE (P < .05). GTE up to 40 g/kg diet will maintain growth and feed utilization but inclusion of the powder even as low as 10 g/kg the diet may compromise feed intake, growth performance and carcass traits. Differences in the polyphenol content of the extract (10.2%) and powder (14.9%) may be reasons these performance results. Further studies on green tea source and method of processing are recommended.  aThis work was supported by Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University [grant number 4.5830].  aPublisher supplied data  a4.5830cIslamic Azad Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002660 3aCamellia sinensis 3abody weight changes 3abreast meat 3abreasts 3abroiler chickens 3abroiler feeding 3acarcass characteristics 3achicks 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeed supplements 3agreen tea 3agrowth performance 3amales 3amortality 3apolyphenols 0aNatural products 0agreen tea 0abroiler performance1 aRasouli, Behrouz1 aSeidavi, Alireza1 aDiarra, Siaka Seriba0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 46, no. 1 p.1114-1117dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2018.14667073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009600173300001600269500125800285520033701543592002801880650001301908650001701921650002101938650001701959650002101976650001401997650001202011700002002023700002402043773011502067852000902182856008902191990002302280655001202303IND4387001620221119140038.0180906e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438700162DNAL7 a10.1097/00017285-200605000-000092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrivetti, Louis,10aFood in American History: Part 8.

The morphological resemblance between A. princeps and A. capillaris makes it difficult to properly identify species properly. It occasionally leads to misuse or misapplication in Korean traditional medicine. In the study, the discrimination between A. princeps and A. capillaris was optimally performed by the developed validation method, which resulted in definitely a difference between two species.

Leptin is an adipokine involved in metabolic status and appetite, with marked crosstalk with other systems. Available data suggest that curcumin may affect leptin levels; therefore, this meta‐analysis was performed to evaluate this. A systematic review and meta‐analysis were undertaken on all randomized controlled trials of curcumin studies that included the measurement of leptin. The search included PubMed‐Medline, Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar databases. Quantitative data synthesis was performed by using a random‐effects model, with standardized mean difference and 95% confidence interval as summary statistics. A funnel plot, Begg's rank correlation, and Egger's weighted regression tests assessed the presence of publication bias. Four eligible articles comprising five treatment arms were selected for the meta‐analysis. Meta‐analysis showed a significant decrease in plasma leptin concentrations following curcumin treatment (standardized mean difference: −0.69, 95% confidence interval: −1.16, −0.23, p = 0.003; I² = 76.53%). There was no evidence of publication bias. This meta‐analysis showed that curcumin supplementation is associated with a decrease in leptin levels that may be regarded as a potential mechanism for the metabolic effects of curcumin.

The increasing demand for its fruit is all coming from wild collection. The ongoing domestication process is seeking for better fruit quality and sustainability of the production. The present research studies the response of cultivated maqui to different pruning treatments: spring heading, summer heading and renewal cuts. Spring pruning favored the appearance of vegetative and reproductive shoots. This treatment also improved the fruit yield of the following season compared with summer pruning. Vegetative shoots sprout mainly on two year old branches, while reproductive shoots appear also from recently grown plant sections. To achieve high fruit yields, maqui should be pruned in spring and branches renewed constantly to maintain a small plant size.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAristotelia chilensis 3aantioxidant activity 3aapplied research 3abranches 3adomestication 3aessential oil crops 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3aheading 3ashoots 3aspring 3asummer 3aChile 0aAristotelia chilensis 0aSpring heading 0aSummer heading 0aRenewal cuts 0aYield1 aMosqueira, Daniela1 aMosqueira, Javiera1 aGonzález, Benita1 aVogel, Hermine0 tJournal of applied research on medicinal and aromatic plants.g2017 Sept., v. 6 p.10-14dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23209x2214-78617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmap.2016.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245007700163506010400240506007600344520119900420592002801619506003701647650002201684650001701706650001901723650001401742650001601756650002501772650000901797650001501806650001101821650001101832650002101843650001501864651001101879653002001890653001801910653001701928653002301945653001801968653002101986700002602007700002202033700002402055773010102079856008302180852000902263655001202272IND60793719320221207112139.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079371932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1012142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerz, Adam10aCopula-based geohazard assessment – case of flood-prone area in Poland  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUpper Nysa Kłodzka River (NKR) catchment, Poland Floods are one of the most important geohazards, because they can cause negative consequences for human health and life, environment, cultural heritage, economic activity and infrastructure. This study presents a comprehensive assessment methodology of the summer (rainfall-driven) flood hazard applying a probabilistic approach. The research considers interdependencies between flood characteristics (peak flow and flood wave volume) and their relations with the cumulative rainfall recorded before flood events in the upper NKR catchment, one of the most flood-prone areas in Poland. The research is based on daily values of rainfall and river flow for the warm half-year (i.e. from the 1st May to the 31st October) in the multi-annual period 1971–2019. The research allowed to formulate the spatio-temporal rules and dependencies between significant floods characteristics and rainfall, e.g. in terms of the coincidence of flood waves occurrence along the main water course and its tributaries. The research contributes to solving flood management issues in concentric river systems in mountainous areas, such as the upper NKR catchment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acultural heritage 3ahuman health 3ainfrastructure 3amountains 3aprobability 3aprobability analysis 3arain 3ariver flow 3arivers 3asummer 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aPoland 0aKłodzka Valley 0aSummer floods 0aFlood hazard 0aArchimedean copula 0aSynchronicity 0aFloods Directive1 aWrzesiński, Dariusz,1 aSobkowiak, Leszek1 aStodolak, Radosław0 tJournal of hydrology.g2022 Dec., v. 44 p.101214-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23229x2214-58187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.1012143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012000171300001800291520142900309592002801738650001401766650003601780650002101816650002301837650002701860650001901887650002101906650004401927650001401971650001201985650001301997650001602010650003702026700002002063700002202083700002202105700002002127700001902147700002002166773010502186856008602291852000902377655001202386IND60578116420180713000000.0170811e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057811642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b018432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroll, Sebastian10aDefect Analysis of High Electron Mobility Diketopyrrolopyrrole Copolymers Made by Direct Arylation Polycondensation  ap. 7481-7488.  aDefect structures in high-performance conjugated polymers are generally known but still challenging to characterize on a quantitative basis. Here, we present a detailed analysis of backbone topology of a series of copolymers PDPPTh₂F₄ having alternating dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole (DPPTh₂) and tetrafluorobenzene (F₄) units made by direct arylation polycondensation (DAP). In contrast to early expectations of unselective C–H activation during the DAP of monomers with multiple C–H bonds, detailed structure analysis by high-temperature ¹H NMR spectroscopy reveals well-defined and alternating backbones with a quantifiable amount of 0–12% DPPTh₂ homocouplings as the only defect structure in the main chain. Homocoupled −DPPTh₂–DPPTh₂– structural units are additionally characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy. While −DPPTh₂–H end groups are inert to other side reactions, −F₄–Br end groups are weakly susceptible to both dehalogenation and reaction with toluene. However, despite the presence of DPPTh₂ homocouplings, high field-effect transistor electron mobilities up to ∼0.6 cm²/(V s) are achieved. This study highlights both that DPPTh₂ homocouplings pose a prevalent structural defect in DPPTh₂-based conjugated polymers made by DAP and that a very simple four-step DAP protocol can yield materials with varying molar mass and excellent n-type transistor performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarylation 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3achemical bonding 3acomposite polymers 3acondensation reactions 3adehalogenation 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprotocols 3atoluene 3atopology 3atransistors 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aNübling, Fritz1 aLuzio, Alessandro1 aLentzas, Dimitros1 aKomber, Hartmut1 aCaironi, Mario1 aSommer, Michael0 tMacromolecules.g2015 Oct. 27, v. 48, no. 20 p.7481-7488dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b018433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014000168300001600308520135600324592002801680650000801708650001401716650001501730650001501745650001101760650001801771650001001789650003001799650001801829650001201847650001101859650001201870650001601882650002501898653001901923653002301942653002501965653004101990700001602031700001502047700001402062700001502076700002002091700001802111773011602129856008602245852000902331655001202340IND60607711420221118021905.0180801e20160615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060771142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Yunfei10aNumerical study of effect of wall parameters on catalytic combustion characteristics of CH4/air in a heat recirculation micro-combustor  ap. 474-484.  aPremixed combustion of methane/air mixture in heat recuperation micro-combustors made of different materials (corundum, quartz glass, copper and ferrochrome) was investigated. The effects of wall parameters on the combustion characters of a CH4/air mixture under Rhodium catalyst as well as the influence of wall materials and convection heat transfer coefficients on the stable combustion limit, temperature field, and free radicals was explored using numerical analysis methodology. The results show that with a decrease of thermal conductivity of wall materials, the temperature of the reaction region increases and hot spots becomes more obvious. The combustor with copper baffles has uniform temperature distribution and best preheating effectiveness, but when inlet velocity is too small, the maximum temperature in the combustor with copper or ferrochrome baffles is well beyond the melting point of the materials. With an increase in thermal conductivity, the preheat zone for premixed gas increases, but the influence of thermal conductivity on OH(s) coverage is negligible. With an increase of the wall convection heat transfer coefficient, the methane conversion rate firstly increases, then decreases reaching a maximum value at h=8.5W/m²K, however, the average temperature of both the axis and exterior surface of the combustor decrease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3aconvection 3acopper 3afree radicals 3aglass 3aheat transfer coefficient 3amelting point 3amethane 3aquartz 3arhodium 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 0aWall parameter 0aHeat recirculation 0aCatalytic combustion 0aConvection heat transfer coefficient1 aWang, Haibo1 aPan, Wenli1 aZhang, Li1 aLi, Lixian1 aYang, Zhongqing1 aLin, Changhai0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 June 15, v. 118 p.474-484dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.04.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245015500179300001600334520208200350592002802432650001602460650001702476650002002493650002102513650001602534650002202550650001202572650002702584650001602611650001002627650002902637650001802666650001502684650001402699650002602713650001102739650001302750650001302763650001202776650001302788651000902801653002702810653001702837653002502854653003302879700002002912700002102932700002002953773011302973856008603086852000903172655001203181IND60565560420221117233702.0181015e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056556042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlimagham, Seyyed Majid10aEnergy flow analysis and estimation of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in different scenarios of soybean production (Case study: Gorgan region, Iran)  ap. 621-628.  aSoybean (Glycine max L.) is grown in cropping systems of Gorgan (northeast of Iran) as an oil crop. Energy flow and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of soybean production were analyzed based on four major production scenarios in this region. The study aimed to evaluate fuel and energy consumption and GHG emissions in order to identify and introduce the most efficient and environmentally friendly scenarios in the region. Four scenarios were included: Scenarios I, II, III and IV. The first two scenarios are known as mechanized scenarios and constitute the production systems adopted by the practices of local farmers in recent years. Scenario I included modern equipment, e.g. no-till, gun-sprinklers system, and high amount of chemical use. Scenario II, encompassed combination machine, center pivot-sprinklers system, and high consumption of fertilizers and chemicals applied by most of the farmers. Scenarios III and IV are known as conventional scenarios: where all operations (i.e. tillage, sowing and spraying) were done with less powerful tractors (60–75 hp) with manually performed fertilizer treatments. These scenarios were different only in terms of tillage operation. In this research, data were collected from 26 farmers using a face-to-face questionnaire-based survey, in 2015. Results revealed that the highest (3.18) energy use efficiency was obtained in Scenario IV (conventional scenario). Water consumption in Scenario II was less than other scenarios. Also, the lowest amount of GHG emissions was 1265.1 kg eq-CO2 ha⁻¹ in Scenario IV and the highest amount belonged to Scenario II (2969.2 kg eq-CO2 ha⁻¹). These results demonstrate that electricity accounted for the highest energy use in Scenarios I (78%) and II (48%), while fuel was the predominant energy consumed in Scenarios III (44%) and IV (37%). In general, conventional scenarios were found to be more environmentally friendly in Gorgan. These results revealed that there is a huge potential for improving energy efficiency in studied scenarios, especially in mechanized scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3acase studies 3acrop production 3acropping systems 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3afarmers 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amechanization 3ano-tillage 3aoil crops 3aproduction technology 3asowing 3asoybeans 3aspraying 3asurveys 3atractors 3aIran 0aConventional scenarios 0aEnergy ratio 0aMechanized scenarios 0aSprinkler irrigation systems1 aSoltani, Afshin1 aZeinali, Ebrahim1 aKazemi, Hossein0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.621-628dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245013000157300001800287500002000305520139000325592002801715650002201743650003101765650002301796650001901819650002801838650001401866650001301880650001401893650001701907650001101924650001101935650001301946650002601959650002701985650003702012650002102049650001902070700001902089700001802108700001902126700002202145700002802167700002602195700002402221773010602245856007202351852000902423655001202432IND60587253020221116143902.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058725302DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.59272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChhabra, Stuti10aChebulinic Acid Isolated From the Fruits of Terminalia chebula Specifically Induces Apoptosis in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells  ap. 1849-1857.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChebulinic acid, an ellagitannin found in the fruits of Terminalia chebula, has been extensively used in traditional Indian system of medicine. It has shown to have various biological activities including antitumor activity. The present study aims to investigate the cytotoxic potential of chebulinic acid in human myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, chebulinic acid caused apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia HL‐60 and NB4 cells but not K562 cells. In vitro antitumor effects of chebulinic acid were investigated by using various acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Chebulinic acid treatment to HL‐60 and NB4 cells induced caspase activation, cleavage of poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and changes in the mitochondrial membrane permeability. Additionally, inhibition of caspase activation drastically reduced the chebulinic acid‐induced apoptosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Our data also demonstrate that chebulinic acid‐induced apoptosis in HL‐60 and NB4 cells involves activation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinases, which, when inhibited with ERK inhibitor PD98059, mitigates the chebulinic acid‐induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings exhibit the selective potentiation of chebulinic acid‐induced apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.

We compared invasion success (the probability of establishing a wild reproducing population) for bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) introduced to enclosures on 26 farms on islands in the Zhoushan archipelago and 15 farms in neighboring mainland China. Bullfrogs were more likely to invade farms located on islands with lower native frog species richness than mainland farms, consistent with the biotic resistance hypothesis. However, human frog hunting pressure also differed between islands and the mainland and, along with the number of bullfrogs raised in enclosures, was a stronger predictor of invasion success than native frog richness in multiple regression. Variation in hunting pressure was also able to account for the difference in invasion success between islands and mainlands: islands had lower hunting pressure and thus higher invasion probability. We conclude that the ease with which bullfrogs have invaded islands of the Zhoushan archipelago relative to the mainland has little to do with biotic resistance but results from variation in factors under human control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3acolonizing ability 3afarms 3afrogs 3ahumans 3aislands 3aprobability 3aspecies diversity1 aZhengjun, Wu1 aDuncan, Richard P.0 tOecologia.g2006 May, v. 148, no. 1 p.129-136dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0355-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013000159520113100289592002801420650001001448650002501458650001501483650002501498650001401523650001201537650001101549651001101560700002601571700003701597700002401634773012801658856007401786852000901860655001201869IND60652693820221122032035.0190713e20181110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065269382DNAL7 a10.3390/su101141342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAquino, Simone10aReverse Logistics of Postconsumer Medicines: The Roles and Knowledge of Pharmacists in the Municipality of São Paulo, Brazil  aEnvironmental contamination due to the disposal of expired or obsolete drugs is a concern, since there is no specific Brazilian legislation, regarding disposal by the final consumer, thus reflecting the need for reverse logistics of medicines, after their consumption.

Hence, knowledge of the compaction of the fabric preforms is important for improving the composite product quality and developing the mold filling simulation. In this paper, the compaction behavior of four types of carbon non-crimp fabrics (NCFs) was experimentally studied. The investigation of compaction behavior included the influence of number of cyclic compaction, number of layers, stitching pattern, compaction speed, and the lubrication (wet states). The results show that the compaction curves tend to be stable and repeatable with an elastic deformation from the third cycle. Other factors affecting the compaction behavior can be explained by the nesting effect, considering the special structure of the NCFs. Gaps between fiber tows created by the stitches may provide room for the adjacent fibers to embed or nest in. Meanwhile, the relaxation of the preforms after compaction was discussed in terms of the energy dissipation. The results elucidate that the lubrication and compaction speed have no significant effect on the compaction process, but exhibit influence on the relaxation. Finally, the microstructural observation of the laminates backs up the experimental analysis and highlights the deformation of fibers at the tow gaps. The change of the internal parameters, including the shape and dimensions of the tows and the gaps, with the compaction degree was statistically studied. It also provides geometrical parameters for establishing predictive models of carbon NCFs with different compaction degrees.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aelastic deformation 3aenergy 3afabrics 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3aproduct quality1 aZhao, Yan1 aYang, Jin1 aZhang, Jindong1 aDuan, Yuexin0 tJournal of materials science.g2015 Apr., v. 50, no. 7 p.2960-2972dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-8860-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003000138245016000168300001800328500002000346520147100366592002801837650001201865650001801877650001501895650001601910650001901926650001401945650001701959650001601976650001501992650002002007650003802027650002002065650002302085650001402108650001602122650001702138650002202155650001802177650001102195650001002206650001802216650003002234650001702264650001902281650000902300700001902309700002102328773010602349856007202455852000902527655001202536IND60587253120221116143951.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058725312DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.59492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan Osman, Wan Nurfarahin10aScopoletin‐standardized Morinda elliptica leaf extract suppressed inflammation and cartilage degradation to alleviate osteoarthritis: A preclinical study  ap. 1954-1961.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe effect of scopoletin‐standardized Morinda elliptica leaf extract against osteoarthritis was investigated in ex vivo explant culture and preclinical rodent model. Thirty male rats were grouped (n = 6) into untreated osteoarthritis (OA), OA + Diclofenac (5 mg/kg), and OA + extract (200 and 400 mg/kg) and compared with healthy control. Monosodium iodoacetate were injected into the right intra‐articular knee joints to induce OA. The rats were evaluated for OA severity via physical (micro‐CT and histological observations), biochemical, ELISA, and mRNA expression analysis (for inflammation and cartilage degradation biomarkers), after 28 days of treatment. The extract suppressed glycosaminoglycan release from the cartilage explant in the presence of Interleukin‐1β. The 200 mg/kg dose appeared better than 400 mg/kg dose, at reducing cartilage and subchondral bone erosions in OA‐induced rats, by significantly down‐regulating the collagenases and aggrecanase. The extract dose‐dependently reduced serum inflammation biomarkers and increased bone formation biomarkers to near normal levels in the OA‐induced rats. M. elliptica leaf scopoletin‐standardised extract alleviated OA progression and articular cartilage structure, by ameliorating cartilage degradation, nitric oxide levels, inflammation, bone /cartilage homeostasis, collagenase/aggrecanase activities, chondrocytes survival, subchondral bone structure and integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorinda 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abone formation 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3acollagenase 3adiclofenac 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene expression 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amicro-computed tomography 3anitric oxide 3aosteoarthritis 3arats1 aLau, Seng Fong1 aMohamed, Suhaila0 tPhytotherapy research.g2017 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.1954-1961dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.59493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245017700172300001600349520143000365592002801795650002101823650001301844650001501857650001701872650001201889650001501901650001601916650001701932650001301949650002001962650001701982650001401999700002102013700001902034773013402053856008102187852000902268655001202277IND60746222320221120123658.0210729e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074622232DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838210401532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkorokhodova, A.

During nitrate respiration in a minimal salt medium lacking ammonium ions, the core E. coli strain MG1655 ∆ackA-pta, ∆poxB, ∆ldhA, ∆adhE, ∆ptsG, PLglk, PₜₐcgalP, ∆frdAB, ∆pflB, ∆sdhAB, ∆aceEF converted glucose into pyruvic acid with a yield of 1.72 mol/mol, secreting lactic acid as the only detected byproduct. The deletion of the lldD and dld genes blocked the secretion of this byproduct. The corresponding strain lacking the respiratory L- and D-lactate dehydrogenases LldD and Dld synthesized pyruvic acid from glucose with a yield of 1.76 mol/mol, consuming the available carbohydrate substrate incompletely. Enforced ATP hydrolysis due to the action of the pyruvic acid–oxaloacetic acid–malic acid–pyruvic acid or pyruvic acid–phosphoenolpyruvate–pyruvic acid futile cycles led to a drastic increase in glucose consumption by recombinants while maintaining the levels of substrate to the target product conversion. As a result, during anaerobic nitrate respiration and enforced ATP hydrolysis pyruvic acid was produced from glucose with a yield of 1.77–1.78 mol/mol with almost exhaustive consumption of the substrate by recombinants and no or minimal byproduct formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aammonium 3abyproducts 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3amicrobiology 3anitrates 3aoxidoreductases 3apyruvic acid 3asecretion1 aGulevich, A.

Consequently, our effort focuses on developing PbTe-based TE modules, which requires developing novel approaches for bonding metallic contacts to PbTe. In this study, Fe, Mo, and NiFeMo alloy foils were directly bonded to n-type PbTe using a rapid hot press at 600, 700, or 800 °C under a pressure of 40 MPa and for various holding times. We find that in the case of Fe and Mo, it is difficult to form a metallurgically bonded high strength joint with PbTe. However, we find that NiFeMo alloy does effectively bond to PbTe at 700 °C, but not at 600 °C. Significant liquid Pb, which might be due to the reaction of PbTe with Ni, is found that penetrates along the NiFeMo grain boundaries near NiFeMo/PbTe joints during bonding at 700 °C where the extent of liquid Pb penetration can be controlled with the time of bonding. Furthermore, the Seebeck coefficient of bulk PbTe with NiFeMo contacts is similar to that without NiFeMo contacts. Finally, the accelerated thermal aging of NiFeMo/PbTe elements at 600 °C for 240 h shows that the failure mechanism of NiFeMo/PbTe joints under operating conditions is the continued formation and penetration of eutectic liquid NiFeMo–PbTe and liquid Pb along the NiFeMo grain boundaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3airon 3alead 3amolybdenum 3anickel1 aDrymiotis, Fivos1 aChen, Cheng-Lung1 aWu, Aiping1 aChen, Yang-Yuan1 aJeffrey Snyder, G.0 tJournal of materials science.g2015 Apr., v. 50, no. 7 p.2700-2708dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-8820-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03398naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245012200212300001100334506007600345520183200421592002802253596007502281506003702356650002502393650001702418650001002435650001902445650001602464650001002480650000702490650001902497650002102516700002102537700002402558700002202582700002302604700001902627700002302646700002602669773014302695856008102838852000902919655001202928IND60655656920221207110938.0200104e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065565692DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-019-0297-42doi7 aPMC66765312pmcid7 a313708962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Vivian C.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SC on skilled tennis performance. METHODS: Ten Brazilian nationally-ranked young male tennis players (age: 17 ± 1 yrs.; stature: 176.7 ± 5.2 cm; body mass: 68.4 ± 7.9 kg) participated in this crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Upon arrival, at baseline, in both experimental sessions blood was collected, then subjects ingested either sodium citrate (SC - 0.5 g.kg⁻¹BM in capsules of 500 mg) or a placebo (PLA). Two hours later, pre-match blood was collected then skills tests (skill tennis performance test - STPT, repeated-sprint ability shuttle test - RSA) were performed followed by a 1-h simulated match. Immediately following the match, blood was again collected, and STPT, and RSA were administered. RESULTS: All metabolic parameters (i.e. base excess, pH, bicarbonate, and blood lactate) increased (p < 0.001) from baseline to pre-match and post-match in SC condition. Each metabolic parameter was greater (p < 0.001) in SC compared to PLA condition at both pre- and post-match. The SC condition elicited a greater (p < 0.01) shot consistency at post-match in the STPT vs. PLA condition (SC: 58.5 ± 14.8% vs. PLA: 40.4 ± 10.4%). A greater (p < 0.001) amount of games won was observed in the simulated match for SC condition vs. PLA condition (SC: 8.0 ± 1.6 vs. PLA: 6.0 ± 1.7). Additionally, the games won during the simulated match in SC condition was positively correlated with percentage shot consistency (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that SC supplementation is an effective ergogenic aid to enhance skilled tennis performance.  aPublisher supplied data  a2012/19529-9cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aathletic performance 3abicarbonates 3ablood 3aergogenic aids 3alactic acid 3amales 3apH 3asodium citrate 3asports nutrition1 aAoki, Marcelo S.1 aZourdos, Michael C.1 aGomes, Rodrigo V.1 aBarbosa, Wesley P.1 aMassa, Marcelo1 aMoreira, Alexandre1 aCapitani, Caroline D.0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.32-32dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-019-0297-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011100164300001600275520044200291592002800733650001500761650002300776650002300799650002200822653001300844653002300857653002600880653002000906700001800926700006000944773008701004856008401091852000901175655001201184IND60551580020221121175336.0161019e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055158002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Xu10aExpanded dipyrrins with electron-withdrawing substituents: broad range of absorption in the visible region  ap. 256-258.  aReaction of meso-aryl-substituted dipyrromethanes with tetracyanoethylene led to generation of a mono-tricyanovinyl-substituted species as well as an expanded dipyrrin analogue bearing both a dicyanomethylene and a tricyanovinyl substituent at the α-positions.

This report explores a hard-template-assisted pyrolysis method to fabricate IrO₂electrocatalyst powders with hierarchically ordered porous structure. The effect of the calcination temperature on the pore structure and electrocatalytic property of periodically ordered macroporous IrO₂material is studied. XRD, BET, and SEM characterizations show that the templated IrO₂powders at 450 °C exhibit the honeycomb array of macropores with cross-linking mesopores on the pore walls. The calcination temperature above 450 °C will further lead to a growth of crystallite size and a loss of surface area. Once the calcination temperature exceeds 700 °C that is higher than the glass-transition temperature of the SiO₂template, the ordered porous structures of IrO₂material are prohibited from the formation. The templated IrO₂at 450 °C shows substantially reduced electrocatalytic overpotentials for the OER, i.e., the efficiency increases as compared with other samples treated at higher calcination temperatures. As compared with the untemplated IrO₂prepared by a simple pyrolysis method at 450 °C, the 3-DOM IrO₂(450 °C) exhibited more than 2 times enhancement in BET area, voltammetric charges, and OER activity. It clearly reveals the control effect of the pore structure on the surface catalytic properties of iridium oxide. The present method is effective in improving the utilization of precious metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acatalysts 3acombs (social insects) 3acost effectiveness 3acrosslinking 3acrystallites 3aglass transition temperature 3airidium 3amacropores 3aoxygen production 3apowders 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area1 aZhou, Peng1 aXu, Shuai1 aChen, Shengli1 aXia, Qinghua0 tJournal of materials science.g2015 Apr., v. 50, no. 7 p.2984-2992dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-8863-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04438naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245017300209300001100382506007600393520239500469592002802864506003702892650001102929650003802940650002502978650001903003650001803022650001703040650001403057650001303071650001303084650002203097650001303119650001203132650001703144650001203161650001503173650001603188650001003204650002003214650001503234650001603249650002103265650002603286650001103312650001203323651001603335700001503351700002003366700002103386700002203407700002103429700001703450700002203467700002003489700002203509773014303531856008103674852000903755655001203764IND60655657020221207104340.0200104e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065565702DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-019-0300-02doi7 aPMC66794812pmcid7 a313751282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLomiwes, Dominic10aTimed consumption of a New Zealand blackcurrant juice support positive affective responses during a self-motivated moderate walking exercise in healthy sedentary adults  ap. 33.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Affective responses experienced during exercise are a significant determinant on exercise adherence. We have previously demonstrated that consumption of New Zealand (NZ) blackcurrants preserves cognition by attenuating the feeling of fatigue. This positive affective response correlated with the ability of blackcurrant polyphenols to support monoamine neurotransmission via inhibition of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) activity. Here we explore how the consumption of a NZ blackcurrant juice (BJ) influenced affective responses and potential ergogenic action on the motivation to adhere to a low impact walking exercise. METHODS: In a parallel randomized controlled study (Trial registration #: ACTRN12617000319370p, registered 28th February 2017, http://www.anzctr.org.au/), 40 healthy sedentary male and female participants drank a BJ or matched placebo (PLA) (n = 20 per group), 1 h prior to a self-motivated treadmill walk, where heart rate and affective responses (exertion [ES] or feeling / mood [FS]) scores) were recorded at 3 or 5 min intervals. Blood glucose, lactate, malondialdehyde (MDA) and platelet MAO-B activity were measured pre- and post-exercise and comparisons were conducted using with Student’s t-tests. Subjective data were analysed using 2-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests. RESULTS: Consuming a BJ 1 h prior to exercise caused a 90% decline in platelet MAO-B activity. The exercise had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on blood lactate, glucose or plasma MDA levels. Assessment of affective responses over the first 60 mins (adjusting for participant drop-out) revealed a time-dependent ES increase in both groups, with ES reported by participants in the BJ group consistently lower than those in the PLA group (p < 0.05). FS declined in PLA and BJ groups over 60 mins, but an inverse relationship with ES was only observed within the PLA group (r² = 0.99, p = 0.001). Whilst the average time walked by participants in the BJ group was 11 mins longer than the PLA group (p = 0.3), and 30% of the BJ group achieving > 10 km compared to only 10% for the PLA group (p = 0.28), statistical significance was not achieved. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that drinking a polyphenolic-rich NZ blackcurrant juice 1 h prior to exercise supports positive affective responses during a self-motivated exercise.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3aanalysis of variance 3ablack currants 3ablood glucose 3ablood plasma 3acognition 3adrinking 3aemotions 3aenzyme inhibition 3aexercise 3afemales 3afruit juices 3aglucose 3aheart rate 3alactic acid 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amotivation 3apolyphenols 3asports nutrition 3asynaptic transmission 3at-test 3awalking 3aNew Zealand1 aHa, Birgit1 aNgametua, Nayer1 aBurr, Natalie S.1 aCooney, Janine M.1 aTrower, Tania M.1 aSawyer, Greg1 aHedderley, Duncan1 aHurst, Roger D.1 aHurst, Suzanne M.0 tJournal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.33-33dBioMed CentralwJournal:21397x1550-27837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12970-019-0300-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009300175506011700268506007600385520085000461592002801311506003701339650001101376650002101387650001701408650001201425650000901437650002101446650001001467650001001477650001201487700002801499700002401527773011101551856008301662852000901745655001201754IND60793719920221207104201.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079371992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cofs.2022.1009242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarowicz, Małgorzata10aWhat are the main sensory attributes that determine the acceptance of meat alternatives?  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe market for meat substitutes (mainly consisting of vegetable-based products) is ever growing. However, ‘cultured meat’ and ‘edible insects’ should also be considered as potential meat alternatives. These products are popular among vegans or vegetarians, however, flexitarians are also likely to purchase meat alternatives to reduce their meat consumption. Therefore, the topic of flexitarians as a target group has been discussed. Moreover, we share insights into the main expectations of consumers toward meat alternatives in terms of taste, aroma, and texture in the scientific perspective and producers' possibilities. The future of the meat-free products’ sector may involve 3D printing, and in our opinion, studies should focus on alternative ingredients with special input of sensory aspects to mimic meaty and fatty flavor.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflavor 3aflexitarian diet 3afood science 3amarkets 3ameat 3ameat consumption 3aodors 3ataste 3atexture1 aKubara Poznar, Karolina1 aZieliński, Henryk,0 tCurrent opinion in food science.g2022 Dec., v. 48 p.100924-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23210x2214-79937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cofs.2022.1009243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245008500181500002200266520179600288592002802084653001102112653003202123653001102155653002502166653001802191700002102209700002002230700003102250773013402281856008302415852000902498655001202507IND60559978720221121024859.0170731s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055997872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxac.2016.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumestre-Toulet, Véronique10aMadness with five dollars: Two new cases of non-lethal poisoning flakka (α-PVP)  aPre-press version  aWe reported the case of two young men, known to be polydrug abusers, arrested in possession of plastic bags of crystals and capsules (total about 300 grams) suspected to be narcotics or new psychoactive substances (NPS). Placed in custody, they will quickly hospitalize for their bad condition (tachycardia, dysarthria, great excitement) where blood samples are taken. Hair samples will be taken for the two subjects, respectively, 1 month and 4 months after hospitalization. Analyses of seized materials, blood and hair samples were requested by the justice and sent to the laboratory for identification and document the drug exposure. Identification of seized materials was performed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using commercial and free specialized mass spectra libraries. Blood toxicological analysis was performed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID), high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Several hair segments were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone or alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (α-PVP, also known as street name “flakka”) and pyrrolidinoheptiophenone (PV8, also known as α-PHpP or α-PEP) were identified in seized materials. Toxicological analysis in peripheral blood revealed the presence of α-PVP (100 and 70ng/mL, respectively), 2-oxo-PVP (50.4 and 22.7ng/mL, respectively), PV8, diazepam and metabolites for the two subjects. Hair analysis demonstrated the presence of α-PVP (0.88 and 0.19 to 1.99ng/mg, respectively), 2-oxo-PVP, morphine, cocaine and metabolites, amphetamine, MDMA, methadone and EDDP and suggested a repeated consumption of these substances.  aPublisher supplied data 0aα-PVP 0aNew psychoactive substances 0aFlakka 0aSynthetic cathinones 0aHair analysis1 aBrault, Sandrine1 aLabadie, Magali1 aPenouil-Pucheu, Françoise0 tToxicologie Analytique et Clinique.g2016, dElsevier Masson SASaSociété Française de Toxicologie Analytiquex2352-00787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxac.2016.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04458naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013500172300001600307500001500323520288800338592002803226650002103254650001603275650002103291650002303312650001903335650003003354650001503384650001103399650003003410650001603440650001503456650001803471650001503489650001103504653004503515653001403560653001703574653003903591653003003630653003103660653004103691700002103732773011603753856008603869852000903955655001203964IND60607711820221118021907.0180801e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060771182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharaf, Omar Z.10aThermodynamic analysis and optimization of densely-packed receiver assembly components in high-concentration CPVT solar collectors  ap. 113-144.  a2019-12-06  aConcentrated photovoltaic thermal (CPVT) solar collectors are one of the most promising solar concepts due to their compactness, multi-output nature, and high exergy efficiencies. However, accurate design models and clear simulation algorithms on the component-level are critical for the proper system-level engineering and evaluation of CPVT collectors. In this study, detailed design models and simulation algorithms of three state-of-the-art components commonly incorporated into the densely-packed receiver assemblies of high-concentration CPVT solar collectors are presented. These components, namely multi-junction photovoltaic cells, segmented thermoelectric generators with interconnectors, and finned minichannel heat extractors, could be integrated to form CPVT receiver assemblies in a number of different configurations. Thermodynamic component-level analyses that avoid oversimplified as well as computationally-expensive modeling approaches and provide clear and robust simulation algorithms with reasonable accuracy are separately developed for the three addressed components. Performance variations of InGaP/InGaAs/Ge cells with respect to cell temperature and flux concentration ratio are identified using a two-diode equivalent circuit model and relations for the irradiance-dependent temperature coefficients are provided. The effects of heat source/sink temperature and thermal impedance, load resistance, thermal and electrical contact resistance, and geometrical parameters on the performance of segmented thermoelectric generators are identified using a 1D thermoelectric model. The thermal and hydraulic performance of minichannel heat extractors when designed under fixed mass flowrate or fixed HTF velocity operation modes, as the number of minichannels is varied and using pure and nanoparticles-suspended HTFs, are studied to find their optimum geometries using a 1D total effective thermal resistance model. The obtained results provide valuable insight into the critical factors to be taken into account in the engineering of the addressed CPVT receiver assembly components. The separately-series equivalent thermal resistance network technique is employed in the thermal analyses in order to treat two-dimensional steady-state heat transfer in composite structures with different thermal conductivities as one-dimensional without a loss of accuracy. Finally, using the developed design models and simulation algorithms, constrained non-linear multi-variable geometric optimization of the assembly components has been carried out to obtain minimum pumping power, maximum extractor heat transfer coefficient, and maximum thermoelectric power output. Results show the existence of optimum geometrical design vectors, given a set of operation conditions, ensuring that the system-level performance of a CPVT employing the optimized components is maximized.  aPublisher supplied data 3asolar collectors 3aengineering 3athermal analysis 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aheat tolerance 3athermoelectric generators 3aextractors 3amodels 3aheat transfer coefficient 3atemperature 3acollectors 3aheat transfer 3aalgorithms 3aexergy 0aConcentrated photovoltaic thermal (CPVT) 0aimpedance 0aOptimization 0aSegmented thermoelectric generator 0aMulti-junction solar cell 0aMinichannel heat exchanger 0aSeparately-series resistance network1 aOrhan, Mehmet F.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 121 p.113-144dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008200165300001800247520187400265592002802139650002202167650002302189650001702212650001302229650000902242650002202251650001102273650001302284650001302297650003302310650001602343650001402359700001902373700001202392773010502404856008602509852000902595655001202604IND60578116920221118032432.0170811e20151027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057811692DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b019222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Sijun10aRheological Properties and Scaling Laws of κ-Carrageenan in Aqueous Solution  ap. 7649-7657.  aRheological properties, gel network structures, and scaling laws for κ-carrageenan in aqueous solution were studied by rheology and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The FESEM micrographs verified that the κ-carrageenan gels were formed by the formation of fibrils. The critical gel concentration, cg, obtained using the Winter–Chambon criterion, was found to be proportional to temperature as expressed by cg ∼ T⁰.⁸⁵ where T is the temperature in °C. At the gel point, the critical relaxation exponent n obtained was a constant (n = 0.62) and independent of temperature. The critical gel strength Sg increased with increasing cg. A constant gel strength Sg/cg was obtained by normalizing Sg with cg to eliminate the effect of temperature, showing a unique character of κ-carrageenan in aqueous solution during gelation. The molecular structure of the junctions at the gel point was analyzed using the modified Eldridge–Ferry model, which supported the similarity of the fractal structure in the κ-carrageenan gels. Before the gel point, the zero shear viscosity η₀ of κ-carrageenan solutions diverged as the gelling system approached to the gel point, and a scaling law, η₀ ∼ ε–ᵞ, was established, where ε is the relative distance of κ-carrageenan concentration c from cg and γ is the scaling exponent that was found to be 1.6. Beyond the gel point, the plateau modulus Gₑ of κ-carrageenan gels depended on the polymer concentration according to a power law, Gₑ ∼ εᶻ, where z was found to be 2.7. The critical gel exponent n evaluated from γ and z agreed well with the value of n determined from the Winter–Chambon criterion, further indicating that the characteristic relaxation time of the pregel and the postgel follows the same power law (symmetry at c = cg) for κ-carrageenan in aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical structure 3agel strength 3agelation 3agels 3akappa carrageenan 3amodels 3apolymers 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aChan, Wai Luen1 aLi, Lin0 tMacromolecules.g2015 Oct. 27, v. 48, no. 20 p.7649-7657dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b019223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134110003500152245014100187300001600328520111200344592002801456650003201484650002101516650002101537650002301558650002301581650003301604773011501637852000901752856008801761990002301849655001201872IND4390306720221119140226.0180906e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439030672DNAL7 a10.1097/00017285-200609000-000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL2 aNIH State-of-the-Science Panel10aNational Institutes of Health State-of-the-Science Conference Statement: Multivitamin/Mineral Supplements and Chronic Disease Prevention  ap. 196-206.  aNational Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus and state-of-the-science statements are prepared by independent panels of health professionals and public representatives on the basis of 1) the results of a systematic literature review prepared under contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), 2) presentations by investigators working in areas relevant to the conference questions during a 2-day public session, 3) questions and statements from conference attendees during open discussion periods that are part of the public session, and 4) closed deliberations by the panel during the remainder of the second day and the morning of the third.

This study explores the friction response of NCD coatings in sliding contact with 319 Al. NCD coatings were grown using microwave plasma CVD with a range of growth conditions to explore key growth modulators governing the tribological response of this material. These coatings were then characterized with Raman spectroscopic analysis at three different wavelengths. Pin-on-disc friction response of these coatings with 319 Al showed that the trans-polyacetylene content as determined by the respective Raman spectrum in NCD is the critical factor controlling friction behavior. This finding can have significant implications in other similar applications where friction response of NCD is a key design factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3acoatings 3afriction 3ananocrystals 3aspectroscopy 3awavelengths1 aXiao, Xingcheng1 aSheldon, Brian W.1 aChintapenta, Viswanath0 tJournal of materials science.g2015 Apr., v. 50, no. 7 p.2993-3003dSpringer-Verlagx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-8864-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245013100155300001800286520110300304650001301407650001801420650002901438650002601467650003201493650001301525650001601538650002201554650002901576650001501605650001001620700001201630700001701642700001801659700002301677773016201700856004001862852000901902655001201911IND4535080420221117020534.0160226e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453508042DNAL7 a10.1021/jf502746n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jiajiang10aVertical Profiles of Pentachlorophenol and the Microbial Community in a Paddy Soil: Influence of Electron Donors and Acceptors  ap. 9974-9981.  aVertical variations of pentachlorophenol (PCP) dissipation and microbial community were investigated in a paddy soil with the addition of electron acceptors (NO3â, SO42â) and donors (crop residues). Crop residues enhanced PCP dissipation by supplying dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as an electron donor, whereas NO3â and SO42â inhibited it. The dissipation of PCP in electron donor treatments resulted in the accumulation of 3,4,5-trichlorophenol (3,4,5-TCP) except for wheat residues. The abundance and diversity of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) decreased with increasing soil depth. The succession of predominant PLFAs shifted from aerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria when electron acceptors were changed to electron donors. The saturated/monounsaturated fatty acids (S/M) ratio increased with soil depth, which probably implied that nutrient turnover rate declined after the accumulation of 3,4,5-TCP. The results showed that the addition of electron donors and acceptors modified the microbial communities, which then further influenced the degradation pathway of PCP. 3abacteria 3acrop residues 3adissolved organic carbon 3amicrobial communities 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anitrates 3apaddy soils 3apentachlorophenol 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3asoil depth 3awheat1 aHe, Yan1 aXu, Jianming1 aChen, Zuliang1 aBrookes, Philip C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 62, no. 41 p.9974-9981dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf502746n  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245014900179500001900328520145500347592002801802650001601830650002601846650002201872650001801894650001701912650001701929650003901946650001601985650002802001650002102029650001202050650001302062650001402075650001702089650002002106650001802126650001902144650001502163653001402178653000702192653000802199653001102207653001102218653000802229653000902237653000802246653001002254653001002264653001002274653001202284653000802296653001502304653002602319700002002345700002002365700001802385700001802403700002402421700002102445700001802466700001902484700002402503773012302527856008902650852000902739655001202748IND60713339620221119143831.0201202e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071333962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2020.1113192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkumadu, Blessing O.10aMolecular basis of inhibition of Schistosoma japonicum glutathione transferase by ellagic acid: Insights into biophysical and structural studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSchistosoma japonicum glutathione transferase (Sj26GST), an enzyme central to detoxification of electrophilic compounds in the parasite, is upregulated in response to drug treatment. Therefore, Sj26GST may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of schistosomiasis. Herewith, we describe the structural basis of inhibition of Sj26GST by ellagic acid (EA). Using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and reduced glutathione (GSH) as Sj26GST substrates, EA was shown to inhibit Sj26GST activity by 66 % with an IC₅₀ of 2.4 μM. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that EA altered the polarity of the environment of intrinsic tryptophan and that EA decreased (in a dose-dependent manner) the interaction between Sj26GST and 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS), which is a known GST H-site ligand. Thermodynamic studies indicated that the interaction between Sj26GST and EA is spontaneous (ΔG = -29.88 ± 0.07 kJ/mol), enthalpically-driven (ΔH = -9.48 ± 0.42 kJ/mol) with a favourable entropic change (ΔS = 20.40 ± 0.08 kJ/mol/K), and with a stoichiometry of four EA molecules bound per Sj26GST dimer. The 1.53 Å-resolution Sj26GST crystal structure (P 21 21 21 space group) complexed with GSH and EA shows that EA binds primarily at the dimer interface, stabilised largely by Van der Waal forces and H-bonding. Besides, EA bound near the H-site and less than 3.5 Å from the ε-NH₂ of the γ-glutamyl moiety of GSH, in each subunit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3acrystal structure 3adose response 3adrug therapy 3aellagic acid 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3ahydrogen bonding 3aligands 3amoieties 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aschistosomiasis 3astoichiometry 3athermodynamics 3atryptophan 0aSj26GST26 0aEA 0aITC 0aH-site 0aG-site 0aGSH 0aCDNB 0aANS 0aΔG° 0aΔH° 0aΔS° 0aSj26GST 0aGST 0aInhibition 0aX-ray crystallography1 aPandian, Ramesh1 aOlfsen, Jessica1 aWorth, Roland1 aThulo, Monare1 aMentor, Tshireletso1 aFanucchi, Sylvia1 aSayed, Yasien1 aDirr, Heini W.1 aAchilonu, Ikechukwu0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2020 Nov., v. 240 p.111319-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32344x0166-68517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2020.1113193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245006300168300001600231500039200247520104800639592002801687650001901715650001201734650001901746650002201765650001101787650002901798650001901827650002001846650002301866700002101889773011501910852000902025856008802034990002302122655001202145IND4390306920221119140324.0180906e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439030692DNAL7 a10.1097/00017285-200609000-000072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Julie10aNutrition in Infant Allergy: A Step in the Right Direction  ap. 215-218.  aAffiliations: Julie Wang, MD, is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology, Jaffe Institute of Food Allergy.

Many risk factors have been implicated and the possibility of modifying some of these factors through nutritional interventions has sparked great interest. Breast-feeding and use of hypoallergenic formulas have been shown to provide some protective effects against the development of atopy in high-risk infants. In addition, the timing of solid food introduction to infants may play a role in the development of allergy for some. Based on these findings, the American Academy of Pediatrics has established guidelines for feeding infants who are at high risk for developing allergies, including exclusive breast-feeding in the first year, use of hydrolyzed formulas if supplementation is necessary, delayed introduction of solids until 6 months of age, and consideration of maternal dietary avoidance of certain allergenic foods during pregnancy and lactation  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfant feeding 3ainfants 3afood allergies 3aatopic dermatitis 3aasthma 3anutritional intervention 3abreast feeding 3ainfant formulas 3aDietary Guidelines1 aSampson, Hugh A.0 tNutrition today.g2006 , v. 41, no. 5 p.215-218dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:13904x1538-98397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00017285-200609000-000073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01831naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245006100212300001600273520056700289592002800856650002300884650001700907650002200924650002000946650001600966653001900982653002401001653002701025653003801052653001501090700001801105700002001123700002201143700006201165700002601227773008701253856008401340852000901424655001201433IND60551580420221121142317.0161019e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055158042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorisue, Mitsuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7783-249210aChirality induction in binuclear phthalocyanine tweezers  ap. 271-274.  aA novel binuclear phthalocyanine tweezers, in which two zinc-phthalocyanine rings are linked to an optically active binaphthyl group through triazolyl linkages, was self-cyclized through triazolyl-to-zinc coordination bonds.

The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of serum uric acid levels on mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients. METHODS: Data on 9405 peritoneal dialysis patients from the Zhejiang Renal Data system were retrospectively analyzed. All demographic and laboratory data were recorded at baseline. The study cohort was divided into quintiles according to baseline uric acid level (mg/dL): Q1 (< 6.06), Q2 (6.06–6.67), Q3 (6.68–7.27) (reference), Q4 (7.28–8.03), and Q5 (≥8.04). Hazards ratio (HR) of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was calculated. RESULTS: Mean serum uric acid was 7.07 ± 1.25 mg/dL. During a median follow-up of 29.4 (range, 3.0 to 115.4) months, 1226 (13.0%) patients died, of which 515 (5.5%) died of cardiovascular events. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients in the middle uric acid quintile (Q3: 6.68–7.27) exhibited the highest patient and cardiovascular survival rates (log-rank test P < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that, using Q3 as the reference, in the fully adjusted model, a higher uric acid level (Q4: 7.28–8.03, and Q5: ≥8.04) was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality (Model 3; Q4: HR, 1.335, 95% CI, 1.073 to 1.662, P = 0.009; Q5: HR, 1.482, 95% CI, 1.187 to 1.849, P = 0.001), but not with cardiovascular mortality. The adverse effect of higher uric acid level (≥7.28 mg/dL) on all-cause mortality was more prominent in groups such as male, hypoalbuminemia, normal weight, non-diabetes mellitus at baseline rather than in their counterparts respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A higher uric acid level was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFC1314003cthe National Key R&D Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadverse effects 3ablood serum 3acohort studies 3adialysis 3ahypoalbuminemia 3amales 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asurvival rate 3auric acid 3aChina1 aZhang, Xiaohui1 aXie, Xishao1 aWang, Junni1 aZhou, Qin1 aChen, Zhimin1 aWang, Yaomin1 aLiu, Guangjun1 aHan, Fei1 aChen, Jianghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3282-39980 tNutrition & metabolism.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.52-52dBioMed CentralwJournal:2211x1743-70757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12986-019-0379-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010900167300001600276520177500292592002802067650002102095650001702116650001002133650001102143650000902154650001202163650001302175650001102188650001402199650001602213650001302229650001902242650001602261650002502277650001202302653002902314653003502343653001602378653002002394653001602414700001402430700001502444700001802459773011302477856008602590852000902676655001202685IND60565561220221117233529.0181015e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056556122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Yunjie10aOptimization of natural anthocyanin efficient extracting from purple sweet potato for silk fabric dyeing  ap. 673-679.  aThe main objective of this study is to extract natural colorant anthocyanin from purple sweet potato powder via ultrasound-assisted ammonium sulfate/ethanol aqueous two-phase system, and this method can avoid the serious environment pollution during the preparation and use process of synthetic dye, reduce the solvent and simplify the abstraction procedures. The extracted natural colorant anthocyanin was used to dye silk fabric in a relatively ecological approach. Based on the single-factor extracting experiment, central composite design-response surface methodology was employed to optimize the ultrasound-assisted aqueous two-phase system extracting conditions including ultrasound temperature, ultrasound time and dosage of purple sweet potato powder. The binomial model was highly significant and applied to fit the experimental data, due to its higher related coefficient. Via optimizing, a dosage of 1.60 g purple sweet potato powder was dispersed in ultrasound bath at 52.48 °C for 48.19 min. In the case of extracting conditions, 191.09 mg.L⁻¹ natural colorant anthocyanin was produced in the upper ethanol-rich phase of the aqueous two-phase system. The color strength value of the silk fabric treated with mordant dyeing method was 4.5, and increased by 40.6% compared to that of the direct dyeing method. The dry and wet rubbing fastness using mordant dyeing method were 4–5 and 4 grade, respectively. The change and stain washing fastness using mordant dyeing method were 3–4 and 4–5 grade, respectively. This study demonstrates that developed natural colorant extracted from plant could be successfully employed as an effective and eco-friendly alternative cleaner to replace synthetic colorant gradually using in textile dyeing industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium sulfate 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3adyeing 3adyes 3aethanol 3aindustry 3amodels 3apollution 3asilk fabric 3asolvents 3asweet potatoes 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3awashing 0aAqueous two-phase system 0aUltrasound-assisted extraction 0aAnthocyanin 0aDyeing property 0aSilk fabric1 aJia, Jiru1 aWang, Ting1 aWang, Chaoxia0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 149 p.673-679dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.02.1343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015000171300001800321520131500339536030601654592002801960596010301988596006502091650002102156650001602177650001702193650001602210650000902226650002902235650002202264650002802286650002002314650002002334650001702354650001702371650001402388650002202402650002302424650002002447650001502467650001302482650001702495650001002512650001602522650001402538651001302552653001602565653001502581653002802596653001902624700001702643700002002660700002202680700001102702700001702713773012902730856008502859852000902944655001202953IND60624649820221122055611.0181204e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062464982DNAL7 a10.1080/09712119.2018.14804872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Yuan-Guang10aEffects of substitution of Bermuda grass hay with Trichoderma fermented rice straw on growth, blood, and rumen fluid parameters in Barbados sheep  ap. 1162-1168.  aThe study was to ascertain the feasibility of using rice straw fermented by Trichoderma as ruminant roughage. Three species or three strains of Trichoderma (NTLg-Te S5-1, NTLg-Te S9-1, and Tien Chung Ca6-1) were used to inoculate hot water-sterilized rice straw. Result showed that rice straw fermented with Trichoderma NTLg-Te S5-1 had the highest cellulase and xylanase activity. Antioxidant ferulic acid content of water extract was improved after fermentation. Eighteen Barbados sheep were randomly distributed into one of three dietary groups. Ration of Bermuda hay group (BER) is 90% Bermuda hay with 10% concentrate. Unfermented rice straw (RS) group and fermented rice straw (FRS) group substituted 25% of Bermuda hay with rice straw or fermented rice straw. Dry matter intake, daily weight gain, blood analysis, and feed conversion ratio were not significantly different among groups after 4 weeks of trial. Dry matter digestibility of BER was the highest, and of FRS was significantly higher than RS. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content in serum of FRS and BER was lower than RS. These results indicated that 25% substitution of Bermuda hay with Trichoderma-fermented rice straw in the diet of Barbados sheep could increase digestibility and inhibit lipid oxidation when compared to unfermented rice straw.  aThe authors thank the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 106-2313-B-005-048) and the iEGG and Animal Biotechnology Center from The Feature Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan to Prof. Tzu-Tai Lee.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOST 106-2313-B-005-048cMinistry of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003711  cMinistry of Educationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002701 3aCynodon dactylon 3aTrichoderma 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3adiet 3adry matter digestibility 3adry matter intake 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afermentation 3aferulic acid 3agrass hay 3ahematologic tests 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3arice straw 3aroughage 3arumen fluids 3asheep 3aweight gain 3axylanases 3aBarbados 0aTrichoderma 0arice straw 0alignocellulosic enzymes 0aBarbados sheep1 aLin, Weizhi,1 aLo, Chaur-Tsuen1 aChang, Shen-Chang1 aYu, Bi1 aLee, Tzu-Tai0 tJournal of applied animal research.g2018 Jan. 1, v. 46, no. 1 p.1162-1168dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11632x0974-18447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09712119.2018.14804873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245010500177300001400282520115200296592002801448650001301476650001301489650001601502650001401518650000901532650004401541650001301585650001701598700002801615700002101643773011501664856008201779852000901861655001201870IND60100795720221121013029.0141105e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010079572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Aparicio, Carlos10aDiffusion of small molecules in a chitosan/water gel determined by proton localized NMR spectroscopy  ap. 14-20.  aProton localized NMR spectroscopy (MRS) has been applied to study the diffusion of three small molecules, caffeine, theophylline and caprolactam, in chitosan gels with different concentration of water. This technique allows the non-destructive monitorization of diffusant concentration as a function of time and location. Concentration profiles were compared with theoretical curves based on solutions of Fick’s diffusion equation for the best fitting, with the appropriate boundary conditions. The measured concentration profiles show a good agreement with the Fickian law. Values of the diffusion coefficients D ranging from 6.1×10⁻⁶ to 3.4×10⁻⁶cm²s⁻¹ depending on chitosan concentration and type of diffusant molecule were determined. In addition, measurements of diffusion coefficients at equilibrium conditions with proton pulsed field gradient NMR methods supported the observed Fickian behavior and showed values of D in excellent agreement with those determined by proton MRS. All these facts demonstrate that proton MRS is an appropriate method for investigating diffusion process in complex systems, such as polymer gels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaffeine 3achitosan 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3agels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3atheophylline1 aQuijada-Garrido, Isabel1 aGarrido, Leoncio0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 368, no. 1 p.14-20dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012100164300001600285520184300301592002802144650002302172650001302195650001602208650002102224650002802245650001102273650001602284650001402300650001402314700001802328700002002346700003202366700002402398700002402422700002502446700002202471700002102493700003502514773009202549856008102641852000902722655001202731IND60103533220221119182341.0141106e20120409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010353322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2012.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Wenxia10aInotropic effects of prokinetic agents with 5-HT₄ receptor agonist actions on human isolated myocardial trabeculae  ap. 538-544.  aAIMS: Besides acting as gastrointestinal prokinetic agents, 5-hydroxytryptamine₄ (5-HT₄) receptor agonists can induce positive inotropism in human isolated atrium, but not in ventricles. We pharmacologically evaluated the gastroprokinetic 5-HT₄ receptor agonists tegaserod, prucalopride, R199715, cisapride, the cisapride metabolite norcisapride, and the 5-HT₃ receptor agonist MKC773 on human isolated myocardial trabeculae, and compared their effects with those induced by 5-HT and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT). MAIN METHODS: Atrial and ventricular trabeculae were paced and changes in contractile force were studied in the absence or presence of the 5-HT₄ receptor antagonist GR113808. Partial agonism was assessed using 5-HT₄ receptor agonists as antagonists against 5-HT. To test the contribution of L-type calcium channels, the inotropic responses to 5-HT and 5-MeOT were studied in the absence or presence of verapamil. KEY FINDINGS: Like 5-HT and 5-MeOT, cisapride and tegaserod, but not prucalopride, R19971 and MKC­733, induced concentration-dependent positive inotropic responses on atrial trabeculae, which were abolished by GR113808. The L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil attenuated inotropic responses to 5-HT and 5-MeOT. None of the agonists affected the contraction of left ventricular trabeculae. Concentration response curves to 5-HT were shifted to the right in the presence of prucalopride, cisapride, tegaserod and R199715, but not MKC-773. SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that (i) inotropic responses to 5-HT and 5-MeOT seem to depend on L-type calcium channels, (ii) tegaserod and cisapride behave as partial 5-HT₄ receptor agonists, while prucalopride, norcisapride and MKC-733 cause no significant effects on human atrial trabeculae, (iii) R199715 seems to behave as a 5-HT₄ receptor antagonist.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonistic behavior 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3acalcium channels 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3ametabolites 3aserotonin 3averapamil1 aChan, Kayi Y.1 ade Vries, René1 avan den Bogeardt, Antoon J.1 ade Maeyer, Joris H.1 aSchuurkes, Jan A.J.1 aVillalón, Carlos M.1 aSaxena, Pramod R.1 aDanser, A.H.

Different pretreatment strategies were tried using sodium hydroxide in a high pressure reactor equipped with a pitch blade turbine stirrer, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis using cellulases; the process optimization was carried out using Taguchi experimental design. Best results were achieved when the pretreatment was carried out at 180°C for 45min with mixing of substrate at 100rpm. The sugar yield was evaluated based on pretreatment severity. The hydrolysis efficiency of pretreated cotton plant waste was very good (96%), showing the excellent efficiency of the method in removing the lignin. The material balance in each stage of the process was estimated and the total process efficiency was found to be 53% based on glucose conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulases 3acotton 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol production 3aexperimental design 3afeedstocks 3aglucose 3aharvesting 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3amixing 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3awastes1 aKuttiraja, Mathiyazhakan1 aArchana, Mohan1 aJanu, Kanakambaran Usha1 aSindhu, Raveendran1 aSukumaran, Rajeev K.1 aPandey, Ashok0 tFuel.g2012 Feb., v. 92, no. 1 p.340-345dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.07.0443Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009000167300001400257520146200271592002801733650000801761650002201769650002001791650002401811650003101835700001801866700001301884773008201897856008401979852000902063655001202072IND60106009920221121045602.0141108e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010600992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2012.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qiang10aTurbo air classifier guide vane improvement and inner flow field numerical simulation  ap. 10-15.  aThe straight guide blade of a turbo air classifier was modified to obtain ultrafine powder with narrow particle size distribution, and to improve classification precision. The modification involved positively or negatively curving the straight blade. The structural effects of the straight, positively bowed, and negatively bowed blades on the inner flow field of a turbo air classifier were all simulated with the FLUENT® software. The numerical simulations indicate great improvement in the annular region tangential and radial velocity distributions of the positively bowed guide blade, compared with the straight and negatively bowed blades. Air velocity fluctuations on the outer cylinder of the improved guide blade are decreased in the height direction. Also, the radial velocity is decreased and the tangential velocity is increased using the positively bowed blade. As a result, the classified particles are cut smaller than with the straight and negatively bowed blades. The inertia rotating vortex between blades is decreased, and the flow field becomes stable. Material classification performance experiments were also performed. The results thereof demonstrate that the positively bowed guide blade improves the classification precision and decreases the particle cut size. These actual experimental results confirm the computational fluid dynamics simulation results and the feasibility of the modified guide vane in engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acomputer software 3afluid mechanics 3amathematical models 3aparticle size distribution1 aLiu, Jiaxiang1 aYu, Yuan0 tPowder technology.g2012 Aug., v. 226 p.10-15dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2012.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245005800167300001600225520147000241592002801711650004401739650001601783650002301799650002201822650001101844650003701855650002101892650001801913650002201931650003301953700002901986700002502015700001802040700002002058773011502078856008202193990002302275852000902298655001202307IND60102999620221118050125.0141106e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010299962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2013.02.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPajander, Jari10aForeign matter identification from solid dosage forms  ap. 116-125.  aDespite the increased request for robust quality systems, the end product may contain unidentified defects or discoloured regions. The foreign matter has to be monitored, identified and its source defined in order to prevent further contamination. However, the identification task can be complicated, since the origin and nature of foreign matter are various. The aim of this study is to provide an efficient foreign matter identification procedure for various substances possibly originating from pharmaceutical manufacturing environment. The surface or cross-section of the uncoated and coated tablets was analysed by utilization of different analytical techniques, such as light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM/EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The results indicate that the combination of different analytical techniques proved to be a powerful approach in foreign matter identification. Light microscopy and SEM generate information on the morphology of foreign matter particles. EDX provides elemental analysis, which most often serves as final confirmation of the identification. However, FT-IR can be used to obtain information on the compounds chemical structure and conformation, and ToF-SIMS provides sensitivity in cases, where the entire solid dosage form is contaminated with foreign matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3achemical structure 3adrug formulations 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3alight microscopy 3amanufacturing 3amass spectrometry 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aHaugshøj, Kenneth Brian1 aBjørneboe, Kathrine1 aWahlberg, Pia1 aRantanen, Jukka0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2013 June, v. 80 p.116-125dElsevier B.V.x0731-70857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2013.02.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01715naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008900165300001800254520070200272592002800974650001501002650001301017650001401030650001301044650001301057700001801070700001801088700001801106700001901124700001901143773009001162856008101252990002301333852000901356655001201365IND60108700820221119144137.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010870082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimura, Yasuo10aMicro-scaled hydrogen gas sensors with patterned anodic titanium oxide nanotube film  ap. 1156-1160.  aWe have fabricated gas sensors with micro-scale-patterned anodic titanium oxide nanotube films formed by local anodization of titanium wires using a hybrid process between top-down (photolithography) and bottom-up (anodization) processes.

These extremely fine nanofibers, no more than 2.5nm in diameter and a few micrometers in length, form spontaneously in aqueous solutions of certain transition metal ions (Cd²⁺, Cu²⁺ and Zn²⁺). They typically possess a significant quantity of positive charges, a property which renders them highly dispersible in water, much like organic polyelectrolytes. Various composite fibers are obtainable from combinations of metal hydroxide nanostrands and negatively charged compounds, and these fibers may be converted into ultrathin free-standing membranes with a variety of useful applications. In addition, the nanostrands themselves can be formed into uniform nanofibrous sheet structures through a filtration process. These sheets are useful as sacrificial layers in the fabrication of free-standing polymer and nanoparticle membranes and are also stable substrates for the plasma deposition of metals and diamond-like carbon (DLC). DLC membranes exhibit surprisingly high permeation with organic solvents, and they are also expected to be useful in industry as filtration membranes for organic solvents and water contaminated with oil. This article reviews the initial work associated with the discovery of metal hydroxide nanostrands, fundamental properties and various applications to separation technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3awater pollution 3ahydroxides 3ananofibers 3aaqueous solutions 3acopper 3azinc 3aindustry 3acadmium 3acarbon 3aoils 3afiltration 3asolvents 3apolymers 3ananoparticles 3ametal ions 0aelectrolytes1 aWang, Qifeng1 aSamitsu, Sadaki1 aFujii, Y.q(Yoshihisa),1 aIchinose, Izumi0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 448 p.270-291dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.07.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01242naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017800167300001800345520021300363592002800576650002300604650002300627650002300650650001100673700001200684700002200696700001300718700002000731773008700751856008100838852000900919655001200928IND60109464620221120150636.0141109e20120204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010946462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.12.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Peng-Shuai10aNew light on an old reaction: phase-transfer-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of propargyl compounds for synthesis of indene derivatives and disubstituted benzo[b]furans  ap. 1367-1370.  aA variety of indene derivatives and disubstituted benzo[b]furans are readily prepared under the mild reaction condition from propargylic compounds by phase-transfer catalysis (PTC) instead of metal catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3afurans1 aHu, Jie1 aWang, Xiang-Chuan1 aLiu, Lei1 aLiang, Yong-Min0 tTetrahedron.g2012 Feb. 4, v. 68, no. 5 p.1367-1370dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2011.12.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012400167300001400291520184900305592002802154650001402182650001302196650001202209650001202221650000902233650001702242650000902259650001002268650001102278650000902289653002702298653000902325653001002334653001302344653001102357653001802368700001502386700001802401700001702419773010502436856008402541852000902625655001202634IND60111655820221122200735.0160903e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011165582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianguo10aGenotypic differences among rice cultivars in lead accumulation and translocation and the relation with grain Pb levels  ap. 35-40.  aIn order to understand the differences among rice cultivars and genotypes in lead (Pb) uptake and translocation, and their relationship with Pb accumulation in rice grains, pot soil experiments were carried out with six rice cultivars of diverse types under different soil Pb levels. The results showed that the differences among rice cultivars in Pb concentrations varied largely with plant organs, and the magnitudes of the differences were larger in ears and grains than in shoots and roots. Pb concentrations in ears and grains differed significantly (p<0.05) between rice types, and were in the order: Hybrid Indica>Indica>Japonica. Grain Pb concentrations were correlated significantly (p<0.05) with shoot Pb concentrations, and highly significantly (p<0.01) with ear Pb concentrations, but generally not with root Pb concentrations. The differences among rice cultivars in translocation factors (TF) of Pb from shoots to ears/grains were generally larger than the TF of Pb from roots to shoots. The differences among rice types in TF of Pb from shoots to ears/grains were generally significant (p<0.01 or 0.05), and the TF were in the order Hybrid Indica>Indica>Japonica. But the differences between rice types in the TF of Pb from roots to shoots were mostly insignificant (p>0.05). In general, grain Pb concentrations were correlated significantly (p<0.01 or 0.05) with the TF of Pb from shoots to ears/grains, but insignificantly (p>0.05) with the TF of Pb from roots to shoots. So the Pb in shoots, but not in roots, may be the main sources of Pb transferred to the grains. Pb concentrations in rice grains are likely to be determined mainly by the translocations of Pb from shoots to the grains, and little by the transport from roots to shoots.

Wistar rats were divided in 4 groups: sedentary control (SC), trained control (TC), sedentary diabetic (SD) and trained diabetic (TD). Diabetes was induced with alloxan (35mg/kg). Training program consisted of swimming 1h/day with a load of 4.8% of body weight for TD and 5.2% for TC, during 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, samples of the left ventricle were collected, fixed in Bouin and processed on historesin. Sections were stained with periodic acid of Schiff, picrosirius-hematoxylin and ammoniacal silver. The PAS technique shows that individuals of group SD presented more intense reaction that the other groups. Picrosirius-hematoxylin technique showed a possible deposition of collagen fibers in SD. The TD group presented a reaction a lot similar to the controls’ for both techniques’, showing a possible prevention of this deposition. These results indicate that physical exercises might have an important role on the prevention of some negative alterations caused by experimental diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloxan 3aanimal disease models 3abody weight 3acardiomyopathy 3acollagen 3adiabetes mellitus 3aeducation programs 3aexercise 3amortality 3amuscles 3amyocardium 3arats 3asilver 3aswimming1 aRemedio, R.N.1 aBarbosa, R.A.1 aGomes, R.J.1 aCaetano, F.H.0 tTissue and cell.g2011 Feb., v. 43, no. 1 p.24-28dElsevier Ltdx0040-81667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tice.2010.11.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02466naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007800162300001800240500001500258520136400273592002801637650002001665650002201685650001701707650000901724650001501733650002101748650001101769650001501780653000901795653001701804700001501821700001401836700001501850773009001865856008101955990002302036852000902059655001202068IND60108701020221119143957.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010870102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yang10aMetal–organic framework modified carbon paste electrode for lead sensor  ap. 1161-1166.  a2019-12-04  aMetal–organic framework (MOF) is a relatively new group of interesting materials for specific electrochemical sensing because of its electrocatalytic activity and large surface area. Here, a Zn₄O(BDC)₃ (MOF-5; BDC²⁻=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) modified carbon paste electrode for lead detection was developed. The electroanalytical procedure comprised two steps: chemical accumulation of the adsorbed metal ions at the modified electrode surface, followed by electrochemical detection of the pre-concentrated species using differential pulse stripping voltammetry. It was found that the MOF-5 was capable of adsorbing lead ions from aqueous solutions and could determine the ions prominently at optimum experimental conditions. Many important parameters to acquire the best electrochemical response were carried out, including the amount of MOF-5, different electrolyte solutions, pH, deposition potential, deposition time, and interferences due to other ions. Finally, a calibration graph was obtained with a linear range from 1.0×10⁻⁸ to 1.0×10⁻⁶molL⁻¹ (R²=0.9981) and detection limit was found to be 4.9×10⁻⁹molL⁻¹. The relative standard deviation (for n=11) was 3.4% at 1.0×10⁻⁷molL⁻¹ of lead level. The proposed method was used for the determination of lead in the real water samples and standard reference materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aaqueous solutions 3asurface area 3alead 3aelectrodes 3aelectrochemistry 3acarbon 3ametal ions 0aions 0aelectrolytes1 aWu, Yichun1 aXie, Jing1 aHu, Xiaoya0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Feb., v. 177 p.1161-1166dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.12.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009400166300001600260520116300276592002801439650002301467650002401490650002201514650001901536650001901555650002601574650001801600650002701618650001401645650002101659650002601680650001601706700001701722700001801739773011701757856008201874852000901956655001201965IND60100796020221121080415.0141105e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010079602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2011.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Mengjin10aFacile control of surface wettability in TiO₂/poly(methyl methacrylate) composite films  ap. 603-607.  aA facile method to produce very hydrophobic surface was developed simply using the mixture of TiO₂ nanoparticles and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). When the volume ratio of TiO₂ to PMMA is between 35vol.% and 50vol.%, the mixture of two hydrophilic materials became very hydrophobic. Analysis of the molecular structure by infrared spectroscopy shows that the preferential orientation and attachment of a carbonyl group of a polymer molecule to the surface of TiO₂ nanoparticles play a critical role in the appearance of the strong hydrophobicity. When this composite was exposed to UV light, PMMA on the surface of the mixture film was decomposed through a photocatalytic reaction and the very hydrophobic surface turned to the superhydrophilic one. The superhydrophilic property of UV-irradiated composite lasts as long as several months. This long lasting superhydrophilicity is ascribed to the porous structure, which provides high roughness and strong capillary interaction. Easy transition from strong hydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity in TiO₂/PMMA composites could be applied to designing high contrast hydrophilic/hydrophobic patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3acomposite materials 3afilms (materials) 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ananoparticles 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aroughness 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 3awettability1 aDi, Zengfeng1 aLee, Jung-Kun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 368, no. 1 p.603-607dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02016naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245011000176300001800286520093800304592002801242650001501270650002401285650001201309650001701321650001101338650001401349650001601363650002001379700001701399700002001416773010801436856009001544990002301634852000901657655001201666IND60110961320221119071640.0141109e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011096132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHudson, John M.14aThe Lognormal Perfusion Model for Disruption Replenishment Measurements of Blood Flow: In Vivo Validation  ap. 1571-1578.  aDynamic contrast enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) is evolving as a promising tool to noninvasively quantify relative tissue perfusion in organs and solid tumours. Quantification using the method of disruption replenishment is best performed using a model that accurately describes the replenishment of microbubble contrast agents through the ultrasound imaging plane. In this study, the lognormal perfusion model was validated using an exposed in vivo rabbit kidney model. Compared against an implanted transit time flow meter, longitudinal relative flow measurement was (×3) less variable and correlated better when quantification was performed with the lognormal perfusion model (Spearman r = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.05) vs. the prevailing mono-exponential model (Spearman r = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.18).

This is partly due to their high reported toxicity of N-DBPs. In this review paper information about the formation yields of N-DBPs from model precursors, and about environmental precursor occurrence, has been employed to assess the amount of N-DBP formation that is attributable to known precursors. It was calculated that for HANs and HAcAms, the concentrations of known precursors – mainly free amino acids are insufficient to account for the observed concentrations of these N-DBP groups. However, at least in some waters, a significant proportion of CNX and NDMA formation can be explained by known precursors. Identified N-DBP precursors tend to be of low molecular weight and low electrostatic charge relative to bulk natural organic matter (NOM). This makes them recalcitrant to removal by water treatment processes, notably coagulation, as confirmed by a number of bench-scale studies. However, amino acids have been found to be easier to remove during water treatment than would be suggested by the known molecular properties of the individual free amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3aamino acids 3abyproducts 3acoagulation 3acyanogen 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3afree amino acids 3ahalides 3amolecular weight 3aorganic matter 3atoxicity 3awater treatment1 aTempleton, Michael R.1 aGraham, Nigel0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 235-236 p.1-16dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009500167300001600262520150000278592002801778650001101806650001901817650001401836650002001850650001401870650001201884650002301896650001801919650001401937650001101951650001501962650001101977650001101988653001901999653001402018653001202032653001402044653001802058700002402076700002002100700004002120773008102160856008402241852000902325655001202334IND60111514520221119233312.0160903e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011151452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2012.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratt, Chris10aCH4/CO2 ratios indicate highly efficient methane oxidation by a pumice landfill cover-soil  ap. 412-419.  aLandfills that generate too little biogas for economic energy recovery can potentially offset methane (CH4) emissions through biological oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria in cover soils. This study reports on the CH4 oxidation efficiency of a 10-year old landfill cap comprising a volcanic pumice soil. Surface CH4 and CO2 fluxes were measured using field chambers during three sampling intervals over winter and summer. Methane fluxes were temporally and spatially variable (−0.36 to 3044mgCH4m−2h−1); but were at least 15 times lower than typical literature CH4 fluxes reported for older landfills in 45 of the 46 chambers tested. Exposure of soil from this landfill cover to variable CH4 fluxes in laboratory microcosms revealed a very strong correlation between CH4 oxidation efficiency and CH4/CO2 ratios, confirming the utility of this relationship for approximating CH4 oxidation efficiency. CH4/CO2 ratios were applied to gas concentrations from the surface flux chambers and indicated a mean CH4 oxidation efficiency of 72%. To examine CH4 oxidation with soil depth, we collected 10 soil depth profiles at random locations across the landfill. Seven profiles exhibited CH4 removal rates of 70–100% at depths <60cm, supporting the high oxidation rates observed in the chambers. Based on a conservative 70% CH4 oxidation efficiency occurring at the site, this cover soil is clearly offsetting far greater CH4 quantities than the 10% default value currently adopted by the IPCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3aemissions 3aenergy recovery 3alandfills 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanotrophs 3aoxidation 3apumice 3asoil depth 3asummer 3awinter 0aCarbon dioxide 0aLandfills 0aMethane 0aOxidation 0aVolcanic soil1 aWalcroft, Adrian S.1 aDeslippe, Julie1 aTate, K.

The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and microbiologic characteristics patients of P agglomerans bacteremia. METHODS: We studied all adult patients with P agglomerans bacteremia at a medical center from 2000 to 2010. The isolates were identified using two commercial identification systems. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients identified, 72% (n = 13) had active gastroesophageal disease treated with antacids. Two-thirds of patients had indwelling central lines and advanced cancers. None of the removed catheter tips yielded P agglomerans and line persistence was not associated with adverse outcomes. Initial disease severity was low, hypotension was uncommon and no patient died of bacteremia. Recurrence of bacteremia occurred in one patient with deep-seated infection. 16srRNA gene sequencing identified only half of the isolates as P agglomerans. The remaining nine isolates were Enterobacter species for six, Pantoea ananatis for two, and Exiguobacterium profundum for one. There were no significant differences between the characteristics of the subgroup molecularly identified as P agglomernas and the overall group characteristics. Eleven (61%) of the 18 isolates were susceptible to cefazolin, six (33%) susceptible to fosfomycin (MIC ≤ 64 mg/ml). Two isolates had colistin MICs ≥ 4 mg/ml. CONCLUSION: Bacteremia caused by P agglomerans is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease and receipt of antacids. 16srRNA gene sequencing should not be used as the sole basis for its identification and we have highlighted the need for another molecular-based technique to conclusively characterize P agglomerans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter 3aExiguobacterium 3aPantoea agglomerans 3aPantoea ananatis 3aadults 3aantacids 3abacteremia 3acase studies 3acefazolin 3acolistin 3adisease severity 3afosfomycin 3agastroesophageal reflux 3agenes 3ahypotension 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aTaiwan1 aLiu, Chia-Ying1 aTsai, Hsih-Yeh1 aHsu, Meng-Shuian1 aYang, Jiarui,1 aHuang, Yu-Tsung1 aLiao, Chun-Hsing1 aHsueh, Po-Ren0 tJournal of microbiology, immunology and infection.g2013 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.187-194dElsevier B.V.x1684-11827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2012.05.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01846naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009000170300001400260520068000274592002800954650002200982650001501004650003701019650002601056650001701082650001701099650001601116650003701132700001601169700001601185700001701201700001801218700002501236773008301261856008401344990002301428852000901451655001201460IND60103771020221120144024.0141106e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010377102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavaneethan, M.10aSynthesis of highly size confined ZnS quantum dots and its functional characteristics  ap. 78-81.  aZnS quantum dots have been synthesized at room temperature using N-Methylaniline by wet chemical route.

The momentum decay and droplet size characteristics of the four fuels have been compared as a function of Reynolds number, mass loading, and radial position for a number of downstream locations. The PDA/LDA results suggest that the spray characteristics are very similar past x/D=5 showing that the majority of break-up occurs in the near exit plane region, with minimal secondary atomization occurring further downstream. Microscopic high speed imaging has revealed qualitative information on the breakup structure as a function of physical properties and downstream locations showing significantly different atomization behaviour at the exit plane. An automated image processing technique has been applied to calculate the liquid blockage area as a measure of the spray density and degree of atomization. The technique has revealed the dependence of liquid blockage area on the fuel physical properties, showing that the long chain length biodiesel has more unbroken liquid at the exit plane. Furthermore, a manual processing method has been used to provide detailed statistical information on the probability of occurence of shapes such as long ligaments, short ligaments, unbroken liquid volumes, and deformed droplets appearing in the spray. The probability of a long ligament appearing in the long chain biodiesel is much higher while ethanol and the short chain biodiesel have yielded very similar results. In addition to revealing information on the atomization characteristics of these biodiesels, the two image processing techniques suggest a simple and alternative way of characterizing atomizing sprays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aair 3aatomization 3abiodiesel 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aethanol 3afatty acid methyl esters 3aimage analysis 3aligaments 3amomentum 3aprobability1 aPham, P.X.1 aMasri, A.R.0 tFuel.g2013 June, v. 108 p.758-770dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.01.0693Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017200171300001600343520130200359592002801661650001601689650001101705650004401716650002301760700002201783700001701805700002501822773010101847856008601948990002302034852000902057655001202066IND60102413920221116142733.0141106e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010241392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aİnkaya, Ersin10aN′-(2-methoxy-benzylidene)-N-[4-(3-methyl-3-phenyl-cyclobutyl)-thiazol-2-yl]-chloro-acetic hydrazide: X-ray structure, spectroscopic characterization and DFT studies  ap. 117-126.  aIn this work, the structure of N′-(2-methoxy-benzylidene)-N-[4-(3-methyl-3-phenyl-cyclobutyl)-thiazol-2-yl]-chloro-acetic hydrazide, (C₂₄H₂₄ClN₃O₂S), was characterized by X-ray single crystal diffraction technique, IR-NMR spectroscopy and quantum chemical computational methods as both experimental and theoretically. The compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P na2₁ with a=14.4170 (4)Å, b=11.5441 (4)Å, c=27.8420 (8)Å and Z=8. X-ray study shows that crystal has two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. The molecular geometry was also optimized using density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) method with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set and compared with the experimental data. To determine conformational flexibility, molecular energy profile of the tittle compound was obtained by semi-empirical (AM1) with respect to selected degree of torsional freedom, which was varied from −180° to +180° in steps 10°. From the optimized geometry of the molecule, vibrational frequencies, gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) ¹H and ¹³C NMR chemical shift values, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) distribution, non-linear optical properties, frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the title compound have been calculated in the ground state theoretically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aenergy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoptical properties1 aDinçer, Muharrem1 aEkici, Öner1 aCukurovali, Alaaddin0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2012 Oct. 24, v. 1026 p.117-126dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.05.0593Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013900164300001300303520086200316592002801178650001301206650002201219650001901241650001601260700001501276700001201291700001301303700001501316773008201331856008401413990002301497852000901520655001201529IND60103771120221120144009.0141106e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010377112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.09.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuo, S.X.10aCrystal structure and multiferroic properties of BiFeO₃–Na₀.₅K₀.₅NbO₃ solid solution ceramics prepared by Pechini method  ap. 8-10.  aA series of solid solution ceramics of (1−x)BiFeO₃–xNa₀.₅K₀.₅NbO₃ (0.06≤x≤0.30) were successfully synthesized by Pechini method.

Short-day (SD) conditions induce tuberization and long-day (LD) inhibits the process. Recent studies have implicated a mobile RNA, StBEL5, as a potential signal in this process. The petiole constitutes an important vascular channel for the transport of light-mediated signals originating from the leaf blade and is also the transcriptional source of StBEL5 RNA. Hence, identifying the proteins in the petiole and their differential expression under SD and LD photoperiods will be helpful in further understanding the downstream signaling process. Thus, we have undertaken a proteomic analysis of proteins isolated from potato petioles (PP) grown under LD and SD photoperiod conditions using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by mass spectrometry based identification of proteins (a total of 125 proteins were identified from 185 spots). Sixty-seven differentially expressed proteins were identified in response to SD or LD photoperiods and an additional 43 putative phosphoproteins were identified through affinity enrichment. Numerous poly(U)-binding proteins which contain RNA recognition motifs have also been isolated and identified. This is the first comprehensive proteomics study that examines and catalogs proteins present in the potato petiole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aSolanum tuberosum 3agene expression regulation 3aleaf blade 3amass spectrometry 3apetioles 3aphosphoproteins 3aphotoperiod 3apotatoes 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aMass Spectrometry 2aPhosphoproteinsxanalysisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhotoperiod 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aRNAxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSolanum tuberosumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aTime Factors1 aLee, Young Jin,1 aHannapel, David J.1 aRao, A.

This is essential if capabilities are to be employed optimally and risks reduced in a way that reflects their severity. Although other considerations such as good practice and socio-political influences may affect a final decision on the resources to be sanctioned, the incorporation of these additional factors should be made transparent if the decision is no longer to be based on cost effectiveness. The J-value provides an objective criterion by which to judge when “reasonable practicability” has been achieved in committing resources for safety improvement, which is the legal requirement under health and safety law in the UK. Moreover, the J-value methodology also allows other related issues to be addressed objectively. Regulatory bodies apply different limits for workers and the general public, with higher risks being permitted for workers. Although a factor of about 10 has been used in several contexts, no objective rationale has been developed for this particular figure until now. However, it is shown that application of the J-value analysis can provide a justification for a ratio of workers’ risk to public risk of approximately this size if certain reasonable assumptions are made. Thus the paper provides the first quantitative explanation for the different levels of protection demanded by regulators nationally and internationally for workers and public.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3aUnited Kingdom1 aTaylor, R.H.0 tProcess safety and environmental protection.g2012 July, v. 90, no. 4 p.285-294dElsevier B.V.x0957-58207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2011.11.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01710naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011800164300001800282520074700300592002801047650001401075650001301089650001701102700001501119700001801134700001601152700001601168773009601184856008401280990002301364852000901387655001201396IND60103695320221121012020.0141106e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010369532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiang10aBimodal mesoporous γ-Al₂O₃: A promising support for CoMo-based catalyst in hydrodesulfurization of 4,6-DMDBT  ap. 1765-1767.  aBimodal mesoporous γ-Al₂O₃ (BMA) synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route was applied as support for CoMo-based catalyst. The materials were characterized and evaluated for hydrodesulfurization of 4,6-Dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) in a fixed-bed reactor. BMA displayed simultaneously high surface area, large porosity and particular hierarchically mesoporous structure after calcination at 550°C. By taking advantage of these properties, CoMo-BMA catalyst bearing high active species dispersion, good reducibility and enhanced diffusibility was used in this work to compare with commercial γ-Al₂O₃ supported catalyst. The obtained results showed that BMA had a good potential as support for hydrodesulfurization catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aporosity 3asurface area1 aHan, Dezhi1 aXu, Yongqiang1 aLiu, Xinmei1 aYan, Zifeng0 tMaterials letters.g2011 June 30, v. 65, no. 12 p.1765-1767dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.03.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245007800162300001400240520083200254592002801086650002601114650002401140650001901164650001601183650003301199650001601232650002301248650003701271700001501308700001901323700001401342700001701356700001801373700001801391773008301409856008401492990002301576852000901599655001201608IND60103771320221120143924.0141106e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010377132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, He10aPreparation and characterization of polyimide magnetic hollow nanospheres  ap. 86-89.  aPolyimide based hollow magnetic nanospheres were successfully prepared by combining the situ and template methods together.

Nevertheless, the gene silencing efficiency mediated by this sort of vehicles has not been systematically investigated yet. In this work, through quantifying gene silencing efficiency by flow cytometry (FCM) and performing intracellular tracking by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we found that the RNA interference (RNAi) efficiency mediated by MSNs-based delivery vehicles was strongly dependent on their endosomal escape capability. Thereafter, we investigated the correlation between the gene knockdown efficiency and the endosomal escape kinetics of such carriers. The results indicated that highly efficient MSNs-based siRNA delivery vectors must possess the capability of initiating effectively endosomal escape before the degradation of their packaged siRNA in endolysosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aencapsulation 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3ananoparticles 3apackaging 3asilica 3asmall interfering RNA1 aLi, Xu1 aMa, Yongjie1 aGu, Hongchen0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 May 1, v. 448, no. 1 p.51-57dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.03.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245008800179300001300267520137900280592002801659650001901687650002401706650001101730650002101741650001801762650001201780650002201792650001801814650001201832650002301844650001001867650000901877650002301886650000901909650003401918650002001952650001101972700001701983700001902000700002102019700001802040700001502058700001802073700002102091773009902112856008402211990002302295852000902318655001202327IND60110632420221118104750.0141109e20121123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011063242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbrahim, Mohammad Madani10aMetabolic impacts of high dietary exposure to persistent organic pollutants in mice  ap. 8-15.  aPersistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been linked to metabolic diseases. Yet, the effects of high exposure to dietary POPs remain unclear. We therefore investigated whether elevated exposure to POPs provided by whale meat supplementation could contribute to insulin resistance. C57BL/6J mice were fed control (C) or very high-fat diet (VHF) containing low or high levels of POPs (VHF₊POPₛ) for eight weeks. To elevate the dietary concentrations of POPs, casein was replaced by whale meat containing high levels of pollutants. Feeding VHF₊POPₛ induced high POP accumulation in the adipose tissue of mice. However, compared with VHF-fed mice, animals fed VHF₊POPₛ had improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and reduced body weight. Levels of ectopic fat in skeletal muscles and liver were reduced in mice fed VHF₊POPₛ. These mice also gained less adipose tissue and had a tendency to reduced energy intake. In pair-feeding experiments, improved insulin action and reduced body weight gain were still observed in VHF₊POPₛ compared to VHF pair-fed mice. We concluded that mice fed VHF contaminated with POPs derived from whale meat remain sensitive to insulin and glucose tolerant despite significant body burden of POPs. This indicates complex interactions between organic pollutants and nutrition in the development of metabolic disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3abody weight changes 3acasein 3adietary exposure 3aenergy intake 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3aliver 3ameat 3ametabolic diseases 3amice 3apersistent organic pollutants 3askeletal muscle 3awhales1 aFjære, Even1 aLock, Erik-Jan1 aFrøyland, Livar1 aJessen, Niels1 aLund, Sten1 aVidal, Hubert1 aRuzzin, Jérôme0 tToxicology letters.g2012 Nov. 23, v. 215, no. 1 p.8-15dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.09.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245014400172300001800316520105500334592002801389650001501417650001701432650002101449650001601470650002001486650002801506650001101534650002801545650001801573650001501591700002601606773008601632856008501718852000901803655001201812IND60109142120221119001847.0141109e20110930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010914212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.07.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaghighi, Behzad10aFabrication of a highly sensitive electrochemiluminescence lactate biosensor using ZnO nanoparticles decorated multiwalled carbon nanotubes  ap. 2189-2193.  aZnO nanoparticles (nanoZnO) were decorated on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and then the prepared nano-hybrids, nanoZnO-MWCNTs, were immobilized on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to fabricate nanoZnO-MWCNTs modified GCE. The prepared electrode, GCE/nanoZnO-MWCNTs, showed excellent electrocatalytic activity towards luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction. The electrode was then further modified with lactate oxidase and Nafion to fabricate a highly sensitive ECL lactate biosensor. Two linear dynamic ranges of 0.01–10μmolL⁻¹ and 10–200μmolL⁻¹ were obtained for lactate with the correlation coefficient better than 0.9996. The detection limit (S/N=3) was 4nmolL⁻¹ lactate. The relative standard deviation for repetitive measurements (n=6) of 10μmolL⁻¹ lactate was 1.5%. The fabrication reproducibility for five biosensors prepared and used in different days was 7.4%. The proposed ECL lactate biosensor was used for determination of lactate in human blood plasma samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3ablood plasma 3acarbon nanotubes 3acorrelation 3adetection limit 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahumans 3alactate 2-monooxygenase 3ananoparticles 3azinc oxide1 aBozorgzadeh, Somayyeh0 tTalanta.g2011 Sept. 30, v. 85, no. 4 p.2189-2193dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.07.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011300163300001600276520169700292592002801989650001402017650001702031650001902048650001302067650001302080650001202093650001502105650001902120650001302139650001102152650001102163650001902174650001402193650001302207700002302220700001802243700002602261700001902287700001902306700001902325700001802344700001702362773011102379856008102490852000902571655001202580IND60101640520221118020827.0141106e20110831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010164052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2011.06.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, Ryan12aA filtration-based protocol to isolate human Plasma Membrane-derived Vesicles and exosomes from blood plasma  ap. 143-151.  aThe methods of Plasma Membrane-derived Vesicle (PMV) isolation and quantification vary considerably in the literature and a new standard needs to be defined. This study describes a novel filtration method to isolate PMVs in plasma, which avoids high speed centrifugation, and to quantify them using a Becton Dickinson(BD) FACS Calibur™ flow cytometer, as annexin V-positive vesicles, larger than 0.2μm in diameter. Essentially microvesicles (which comprise a mixture of PMVs and exosomes) from citrate plasma were sonicated to break up clumped exosomes, and filtered using Millipore 0.1μm pore size Hydrophilic Durapore membranes in Swinnex 13mm filter holders. Phosphatidylserine-positive PMVs detected with annexin V-PE were quantified using combined labelling and gating strategies in conjunction with Polysciences Polybead Microspheres (0.2μm) and BDTrucount tubes. The PMV absolute count was calculated on the analysis template using the Trucount tube lot number information and expressed in PMV count/ml. Having estimated a normal reference range (0.51×10⁵–2.82×10⁵ PMVs/ml) from a small sample of human donors, using the developed method, the effect of certain variables was investigated. Variations such as freezing of samples and gender status did not significantly alter the PMV absolute count, and with age plasma PMV levels were only marginally reduced. Smokers appeared to have reduced PMV levels. Nicotine, as for calpeptin was shown to dose-dependently (from 10 up to 50μM) reduce levels of early apoptosis in THP-1 monocytes and to decrease the level of PMV release. Fasting individuals had 2–3 fold higher PMV absolute counts compared to non-fasting subjects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablood plasma 3acentrifugation 3acitrates 3aexosomes 3afasting 3afiltration 3aflow cytometry 3afreezing 3agender 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3amonocytes 3anicotine1 aAnsa-Addo, Ephraim1 aStratton, Dan1 aAntwi-Baffour, Samuel1 aJorfi, Samireh1 aKholia, Sharad1 aKrige, Lizelle1 aLange, Sigrun1 aInal, Jameel0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2011 Aug. 31, v. 371, no. 1-2 p.143-151dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2011.06.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007500169300001600244520094700260592002801207650001201235650002501247650001101272650001101283650001201294650001401306700002001320700002201340700002201362700001301384700001801397773007001415856008201485990002301567852000901590655001201599IND60102835720221121023943.0141106e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010283572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.01.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorganti, Kai J.14aThe Research and Motor octane numbers of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)  ap. 797-811.  aThis paper presents an experimental study of the Research (RON) and Motor (MON) octane numbers of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). A comprehensive set of RON and MON data for mixtures of propane, propylene (propene), n-butane and iso-butane are presented, using a method that is consistent with the currently active ASTM Research and Motor test methods for liquid fuels. Empirical models which relate LPG composition to its RON and MON are then developed, such that the simplest relationships between the constituent species’ mole fractions and the mixture octane rating are achieved. This is used to determine the degree of non-linearity between the composition and the RON and MON of different LPG mixtures. Finally, implications for LPG fuel quality standards are discussed briefly, as part of a suggested, more substantial undertaking by the community which also revisits the standard test procedures for measuring the RON and MON of LPG.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanes 3aliquid petroleum gas 3amodels 3aoctane 3apropane 3apropylene1 aFoong, Tien Mun1 aBrear, Michael J.1 ada Silva, Gabriel1 aYang, Yi1 aDryer, F.

As proof, the authentic Coco Mademoiselle women perfume by Chanel perfumes, two counterfeit and five inspired perfumes were used. Two different methods for the perfume sample preparation, in absence and in presence of ethanol, were compared. The best results were obtained in absence of ethanol. In this case, the fingerprint of the authentic sample obtained with the EOS was very characteristic, showing distinctive sets of radar plots for each perfume sample. To extract the available information from the resistance (R) change of each sensor, the classical feature selection (R/R₀) has been employed. The principal component analysis (PCA) placed the samples of the eight perfumes into well-defined groups. The counterfeit and inspired samples were also clearly detected by comparison of their respective fingerprints, with PCA placing these samples into well separated groups. Finally, the results have been contrasted by a triangle test performed by trained panelists familiarized with perfumes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethanol 3aperfumes 3aprincipal component analysis 3aradar 3asemiconductors 3awomen1 aBorrego, Virginia1 aRoales, Javier1 aIdígoras, Jesús1 aLopes-Costa, Tania1 aMendoza, Palma1 aPedrosa, José M.0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Aug. 10, v. 156, no. 1 p.319-324dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.04.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245011700168300001400285520074500299592002801044650000801072650002401080650001001104650003601114650001301150650001001163650001901173650000901192650001801201650002401219650003701243700001401280700002001294700001501314700001401329700001901343700001501362700001301377773008301390856008401473990002301557852000901580655001201589IND60103771520221120143946.0141106e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010377152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Xin-hua10aBlood–brain barrier transport of Tat peptide and polyethylene glycol decorated gelatin–siloxane nanoparticle  ap. 94-96.  aContemporary treatment of brain diseases has been hampered by limited drug delivery across the blood–brain barrier (BBB).

In vivo imaging and TEM results indicated Tat–PEG–GS NPs could not only escape the capture by reticulo-endothelial system but also cross BBB and reach central nervous system of mice. Hence, Tat–PEG–GS NPs might represent a new type of non-viral vector for the delivery of drug or therapeutic DNA to brain by crossing BBB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acentral nervous system diseases 3acrossing 3adrugs 3aimage analysis 3amice 3ananoparticles 3apolyethylene glycol 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWei, Feng1 aWang, Tian-xiao1 aWang, Dong1 aWang, Jun1 aLin, Xiao-ning1 aWang, Peng1 aRen, Lei0 tMaterials letters.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 68 p.94-96dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2011.10.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245015400164300001600318520116200334592002801496650001701524650001501541650001501556650001301571650001101584650001301595650001901608650001901627650001001646650001301656650000901669650001001678650000701688650001301695650001301708650001601721700001901737700001601756700001401772700001401786700001801800773009401818856008401912852000901996655001202005IND60105927920221118114133.0141108e20110130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010592792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2010.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lin10aOptimization of a Fe–Al–Ce nano-adsorbent granulation process that used spray coating in a fluidized bed for fluoride removal from drinking water  ap. 291-296.  aA coating granulation technology comprising the spraying of a Fe–Al–Ce nano-adsorbent suspension onto glass beads in a fluidized bed was developed. An acrylic-styrene copolymer latex was used as a binder. The granulated adsorbent was used in a packed bed for fluoride removal from drinking water. The effects of coating temperature, latex/Fe–Al–Ce ratio, and coating amount on granule compressive strength and adsorption capacity were investigated. With increased coating temperature, cross linking in the polymer in the coated layer increased, which resulted in increased granule strength but decreased adsorption capacity. With increased latex/Fe–Al–Ce ratio, more active sites were covered by the polymer, which also resulted in increased granule strength but decreased adsorption capacity. The optimal parameters for making high performance adsorbent granules were for the granules to be coated at 65°C using a latex/Fe–Al–Ce ratio of 0.5:1 and a coating amount of 27.8%. These granules had a fluoride adsorption capacity of 2.77mg/g (coated granules) for water with an initial fluoride concentration of 0.001M that was treated at pH 7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acerium 3acoatings 3adrinking water 3afluidized beds 3aglass 3agranules 3airon 3alatex 3apH 3apolymers 3aspraying 3atemperature1 aWang, Ting-Jie1 aWu, Hai-Xia1 aJin, Yong1 aZhang, Yu1 aDou, Xiao-Min0 tPowder technology.g2011 Jan. 30, v. 206, no. 3 p.291-296dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2010.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245012800169300001600297520122000313592002801533650001801561650001401579650001501593650001601608650001701624650002001641650000901661650001901670650001101689650002101700650002101721650001601742650000901758650002001767650001401787650002201801700001701823700001601840700002001856700002001876700001801896700001601914700003101930773011101961856008302072990002302155852000902178655001202187IND60107799620221116151004.0141108e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010779962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yrtph.2011.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrivalle, Laura10aHeat stability, its measurement, and its lack of utility in the assessment of the potential allergenicity of novel proteins  ap. 292-295.  aThermal stability has been reported as a shared characteristic among some of the major food allergens and appears to have originated from the observation that some cooked foods retain their ability to cause allergic reactions by Immunoglobulin E (IgE) binding and the subsequent cascade of events that mediate allergic reactions. Based on this observation, the thermal stability of novel food proteins, like those in transgenic crops, is considered correlative with allergenic risk and has prompted requests from some regulatory agencies for additional testing to address safety concerns. Because human testing and serum IgE screening are not feasible nor are they necessarily useful for evaluating the thermal stability of a novel food protein, a protein function assay is often used to assess the thermal stability in the context of an allergenicity risk assessment. Some regulatory authorities also require immunodetection using polyclonal IgG antibodies and gel based methods. Here we review why heat stability as measured by these functional and immunodetection assays does not correlate with allergenicity and provides no useful safety information in assessing the allergenic potential of novel food proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acooked foods 3adietary protein 3agels 3aheat stability 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3anovel foods 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ascreening 3atransgenic plants1 aBannon, Gary1 aHerman, Rod1 aLadics, Gregory1 aMcClain, Scott,1 aStagg, Nicola1 aWard, Jason1 aHerouet-Guicheney, Corinne0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology.g2011 Dec., v. 61, no. 3 p.292-295dElsevier Inc.x0273-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yrtph.2011.08.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01947naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012100168300001800289520100000307592002801307650002301335650002401358650001501382650001101397700002501408773011101433856008101544990002301625852000901648655001201657IND60104087620221119195609.0141107e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010408762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.01.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarabacak, Murat10aSpeed and current regulation of a permanent magnet synchronous motor via nonlinear and adaptive backstepping control  ap. 2015-2030.  aThis paper proposes a new speed and current control scheme for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) by means of a nonlinear and adaptive backstepping design. All the parameters in both PMSM and load dynamics are considered unknown. It is assumed that all state variables are measurable and available for feedback in the controller design. The final control and parameter estimation laws are derived by the design of the virtual control inputs and the Lyapunov function candidate. The overall control system is asymptotically stable according to stability analysis results based on Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results clearly show that the controller guarantees tracking of a time varying reference speed owing to the fact that the speed and current tracking errors asymptotically converge to zero despite all the parameter uncertainties/perturbations and load torque disturbance variation. Numerical simulations reveal the performance and feasibility of the proposed controller.  aPublisher supplied data 3amagnetic materials 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3atorque1 aEskikurt, H.

The use of primary phagocytes in these investigations however, are limited by their inherent resistance to transfection with DNA constructs. As a result, the use of phagocyte-like immortalized cell lines is widespread. While these cell lines are transfection permissive, they are generally regarded as poor biological substitutes for primary phagocytes. By exploiting the phagocytic machinery of primary phagocytes, we developed a non-viral method of DNA transfection of macrophages that employs intraphagosomal sonoporation mediated by internalized lipid-based microbubbles. This approach enables the transfection of primary phagocytes in vitro, with a modest, but reliable efficiency. Furthermore, this methodology was readily adapted to transfect murine peritoneal macrophages in vivo. This technology has immediate application to current research efforts and has potential for use in gene therapy and vaccination strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adendritic cells 3agene therapy 3aimmunology 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicrobubbles 3atransfection 3avaccination1 aMcFarland, Ryan J.1 aRybicka, Joanna M.1 aBalce, Dale R.1 aMcKeown, Kyle R.1 aKrohn, Regina M.1 aMatsunaga, Terry O.1 aYates, Robin M.0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2011 Aug. 31, v. 371, no. 1-2 p.152-158dElsevier B.V.x0022-17597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2011.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013100167300001600298520127200314592002801586650001301614650000901627650002001636650001101656650001601667650001401683650001101697650001301708650001201721650001201733700002901745773009401774856008401868852000901952655001201961IND60105928020221122124816.0141108e20110130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010592802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2010.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, M.F.10aDensification of Al powder and Al–Cu matrix composite (reinforced with 15% Saffil short fibres) during axial cold compaction  ap. 297-305.  aPure Al, Alumix 13 (Al–4.5wt.% Cu 0.5Mg 0.2 Si) powders and Alumix13 reinforced with 15wt.% Saffil short fibers were compacted up to 250–386MPa in an axial die to study their compacting behavior. The final relative densities D were higher than 0.95 for all unreinforced powders and 0.86 for the composite. Different micromechanical and phenomenological models were used to fit density–pressure relations. Arzt model describes the powder compaction with good agreement up to D ~ 0.85. Kawakita equation results as a best linear fit for all tests, but its compressibility parameter b is not in agreement with the hardening behavior of the composite. Panelli and Ambrosio equation could describe the data fairly well qualitatively for all compactions tests, however, over a limited pressure range. Finally, Konopicky relationship turned out to be very useful and fitted the densification data of all three materials quite well. Its slope from linear P vs. ln (1/(1−D)) plots, is related to the yield stress and characterizes the work hardening developed during plastic deformation while the density was increased. Microhardness values increase with the compacting pressure and such tendency agrees with the rising values of yield stresses, obtained by Konopicky.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acold 3acompressibility 3acopper 3adeformation 3aequations 3amodels 3aplastics 3apowders 3asilicon1 aGonzález Oliver, C.J.R.0 tPowder technology.g2011 Jan. 30, v. 206, no. 3 p.297-305dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2010.09.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001800167245009800185300001600283520066900299592002800968650000800996650001601004650002001020650002501040650001401065650002601079650001201105650001801117650001801135650002801153650003201181650002201213650001401235650003601249650002401285700001901309700001901328773010601347856008201453990002301535852000901558655001201567IND60107379120221120040131.0141108e20110121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010737912DNAL7 a210407332pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yujuan10aPhylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences based on the generalized pseudo-amino acid composition  ap. 217-223.  aThe main work of this paper is to propose a new theory and method, which is based on the idea of the pseudo-amino acid composition, for phylogenetic analysis of DNA primary sequences.

Owing to this physiological relevance of salicylate and oxalate ions, critical micelle concentration (cmc) values of sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) were determined in aqueous sodium oxalate, sodium salicylate, and sodium chloride solutions by using surface tension, fluorescence, and EMF methods. The results indicate, besides a counterion effect, the influence of coanions on the cmc. In the range from 25 to 40°C, cmc increases almost linearly with temperature. In the temperature range from 30 to 40°C, the counterion binding constant β of NaDC micelles has the same value (0.17±0.01) in the presence of sodium chloride and sodium salicylate. On the other hand, in sodium oxalate solution β=0.05±0.02 when oxalate concentration is less than or equal to c* and β=0.48±0.04 above c*, where c*≈0.038molkg⁻¹. EMF measurements also supported this type of counterion binding to NaDC micelles in sodium oxalate solutions. In sodium oxalate solution, at c* a change in the shape of deoxycholate micelles is expected to take place. Salicylate, oxalate, and chloride coanions have a similar effect on the adsorption of NaDC. This study reveals that the choleretic effect of salicylate is not due to the influence of salicylate ions on the micellization of NaDC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abile 3abile salts 3afluorescence 3aions 3amicelles 3asodium chloride 3asodium salicylate 3asurface tension 3atemperature1 aDey, Jahar1 aMukhim, Teiborlang1 aIsmail, Kochi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 May 15, v. 357, no. 2 p.434-439dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245014700161300001400308520136700322592002801689650002201717650001401739650001401753650001301767650001901780650002101799650001401820650001101834650001601845650002201861650001601883650003001899700001701929700001501946700001701961773010001978856008402078990002302162852000902185655001202194IND60110632620221118104615.0141109e20121123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011063262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Yu10aPhycocyanin may suppress d-galactose-induced human lens epithelial cell apoptosis through mitochondrial and unfolded protein response pathways  ap. 25-30.  aApoptosis of lens epithelial cell (LEC) plays an important role in cataract formation, and its prevention may be one of the therapeutic strategies in treating cataract. This study used human lens epithelial cell (hLEC) line SRA01/04 to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of phycocyanin on glactose-induced apoptosis in hLEC. hLECs were cultured in D/F₁₂-10% FBS medium containing 125mM d-galactose with or without phycocyanin. Cell viability was assessed by methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was elevated with Wright–Giemsa staining, AO/EB double staining, and DNA fragmentation assay. Mitochondrial apoptosis-associated molecules and unfolded protein response-associated molecules from cultured SRA01/04 cells were quantified using protein blot analysis. The results demonstrated that phycocyanin suppressed SRA01/04 cells’ morphologic changes and apoptosis induced by d-galactose, inhibited the expression and activation of caspase 3, alternated the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and down-regulated the level of p53, GRP78, and CHOP in d-galactose-treated SRA01/04 cells. These results suggest that phycocyanin might suppress d-galactose-induced hLEC apoptosis through two pathways: mitochondrial pathway, involving p53 and Bcl-2 family protein expression, and unfolded protein response pathway, involving GRP78 and CHOP expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acataract 3acell viability 3aepithelial cells 3agalactose 3ahumans 3aphycocyanin 3aprotective effect 3atetrazolium 3aunfolded protein response1 aYuan, Zhijun1 aLi, Kepeng1 aYang, Xuegan0 tToxicology letters.g2012 Nov. 23, v. 215, no. 1 p.25-30dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2012.09.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01637naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245005600174300001800230520054600248592002800794650001600822650002600838650002100864650002300885650002100908650004400929650001400973650001000987650001400997700002001011700003301031700002201064773009601086856008401182852000901266655001201275IND60109767120221120191327.0141109e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010976712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.03.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDüker, Matthias H.10aUpper rim tetrathiafulvalene-bridged calix[4]arenes  ap. 2881-2884.  aThe synthesis of novel upper rim calix[4]arene–tetrathiafulvalene conjugates 1a–d has been performed by bridging the tetrachloromethylated calix[4]arene derivative 4 with the corresponding tetrathiafulvalene-dithiolates.

The efficiency and efficacy of extraction methods were evaluated and compared in number of extracted mycotoxins and obtained recoveries. From the one point of view, QuEChERS procedure was fast and easy, as well as it was able to successfully extract all selected mycotoxins. On the other hand, SLE method, MSPD and SPE clean-up method did not extract adequately all selected mycotoxins and recoveries were not suitable enough. Thereby, method employing QuEChERS extraction connected with UHPLC-Orbitrap® MS was developed to quantify 32 mycotoxins in barley within this study. Analytical method was validated and recoveries ranged from 72% to 101% for selected mycotoxins with only one exception nivalenol (NIV) and deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (D3G), which were lower than 67%. Relative standard deviations (RSD) were lower than 17.4% for all target mycotoxins. The lowest calibration levels (LCLs) ranged from 1 to 100μg/kg. Validated method was finally used for monitoring mycotoxins in a total of 15 Czech barley samples, when only Fusarium toxins representatives were detected in 53% of samples and the mycotoxins with the highest incidence were enniatins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aAspergillus 3aClaviceps 3aFusarium 3aPenicillium 3abarley 3adeoxynivalenol-3-glucoside 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3anivalenol 3asolid phase extraction1 aDzuman, Zbynek1 aVaclavikova, Marta1 aZachariasova, Milena1 aSoler, Carla1 aHajslova, Jana0 tTalanta.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 99 p.712-719dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2012.07.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014600166300001600312520094200328592002801270650001501298650002101313650001501334650001901349650001301368650001101381650001601392700002001408773008801428856008101516990002301597852000901620655001201629IND60108767420221117184541.0141108e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010876742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2013.05.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Tzu-Ching10aTemperature effect on hydrogen response for cracked carbon nanotube/nickel (CNT/Ni) composite film with horizontally aligned carbon nanotubes  ap. 548-552.  aWe have developed a free lithography technique for hydrogen sensors using a cracked carbon nanotube/nickel (CNT/Ni) film with horizontally aligned CNT (HA-CNT). Cracks were induced on CNT/Ni film by simple hydrogen absorption and desorption processes to enhance sensor response using heat treatment. Gas sensing measurements taken with various concentrations (200–16,000ppm) of hydrogen at room temperature revealed that the sensors based on cracks in CNT/Ni film exhibit promising results for response, response time, and recovery time. Compared to CNT/Ni sensors fabricated without heat treatment, the hydrogen sensors fabricated at 350°C on cracked CNT/Ni film with HA-CNT exhibited a much more response (14.1% vs. 0.6%) and a faster response time (422s vs. 1095s) at 200ppm H₂ gas. The heat treatment method used to form cracks in the HA-CNT is relatively simple and effectively improved the response of CNT/Ni hydrogen sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3adesorption 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3atemperature1 aHuang, Bohr-Ran0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Aug., v. 185 p.548-552dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2013.05.0673Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010300163300001400266520097300280592002801253650001201281650001901293650001201312700002401324700002301348700002201371700001401393773009901407856008101506990002301587852000901610655001201619IND60108440720221119210925.0141108e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010844072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sna.2012.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Ryan10aFabrication, assembly, and testing of a MEMS-enabled micro gas compressor for a 4:1 pressure ratio  ap. 84-89.  aThis study describes the fabrication, assembly, and testing of a micro gas compressor. The compressor is formed by MEMS-based check valves coupled to a Kapton membrane driven by a mechanically amplified piezoelectric actuator. The valves are surface machined on a silicon substrate using polyimide as the structural material and copper as the sacrificial material. This design allows valves with low leak rates, low compressor dead volume, and the high compressible volume required to generate the pressure levels required of numerous applications including cryogenic cooling. The assembled compressor is tested with voltages over the range of 25–180V and frequencies over the range of 25–700Hz. A maximum pressure ratio of 4.3:1 is found when the actuator provides a maximum displacement of 156μm, while the maximum flow-rate through the compressor of 51 standard cubic cm per minute (sccm) is observed when the compressor is operating at its resonant frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aelectric power 3asilicon1 aCoolidge, Collin J.1 aSchroeder, Paul J.1 aBright, Victor M.1 aLee, Y.C.0 tSensors & Actuators: A.

The title salt crystallizes in the monoclinic system (space group P2₁, Z=2). The asymmetric unit contains L-histidinium(+) and L-histidinium(2+) cations as well as nitrate and hexafluorosilicate anions. L-histidinium(+) and L-histidinium(2+) cations form short hydrogen bond with an O⋯O distance equal to 2.507(2)Å, thus forming a (L-His⁺⋯L-His²⁺) dimeric cation, therefore the formula is correctly given as (L-His⁺⋯L-His²⁺)·NO₃ ⁻·SiF₆ ²⁻. This is the first observation of the (L-His⁺⋯L-His²⁺) dimeric cation. The presence of the OH⋯O hydrogen bond of the (L-His⁺⋯L-His²⁺) dimeric cation is reflected in the infrared spectrum as a broad absorption band centered at ca. 1300cm⁻¹ caused by stretching vibration of OH bond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aamino acids 3aanions 3acations 3acrystals 3ahydrogen bonding 3anitrates 3avibration1 aFleck, M.1 aPetrosyan, A.M.0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2012 Oct. 24, v. 1026 p.140-144dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.05.0523Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01939naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009400163300001600257520078700273592002801060650001701088650002201105650001201127650001201139650001001151650001001161650001901171650001301190650001801203650001801221650002101239650001601260700001801276700001801294700001501312773008601327856008401413990002301497852000901520655001201529IND60103844720221119093533.0141107e20120715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010384472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bo10aStudy of Foam Glass with High Content of Fly Ash Using Calcium Carbonate as Foaming Agent  ap. 263-265.  aThe foam glasses with high content (50–70%) of fly ash are successfully prepared at a low temperature (800°C) using fly ash as main raw materials, with calcium carbonate and sodium borate as foaming agent and flux agent, respectively.

METHODS: We surveyed a sample of 453 adults ≤18 years from areas of high poverty and high HIV prevalence in metro Atlanta and differentiated the effects of individual-, social/organizational-, and community-level characteristics on participation in HIV vaccine research via multilevel modeling techniques that incorporated questionnaire, program, and census data. RESULTS: Models that adjusted for both individual-level covariates (such as race, gender, attitudes, and beliefs concerning HIV research), social/organizational- and community-level factors such as local HIV prevalence rates, revealed that the extent of HIV prevention-related programs and services in census tracts contributed to individuals’ likelihood of participation in an HIV vaccine study. Additionally, neighborhood-based organizations offering HIV medical and treatment programs, support groups, and services (e.g., food, shelter, and clothing) encourage greater HIV vaccine research participation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the hypothesis that community-level factors facilitate participation in HIV vaccine research independent of both individual- and social/organizational-level factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aattitudes and opinions 3acensus data 3acommunity service 3agender 3amedical treatment 3amodels 3apoverty 3aquestionnaires 3avaccines1 aArchibald, Matthew1 aHixson, Brooke1 adel Rio, Carlos0 tVaccine.g2011 Aug. 18, v. 29, no. 36 p.6136-6143dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245009000176300001600266520141900282592002801701650002701729650001201756650002301768650001401791650001301805650002201818650000901840650001601849650001401865650001601879650001101895650001101906650001301917700002501930773009601955856008202051852000902133655001202142IND60100241020221120123021.0141105e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010024102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2011.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrieto-Centurion, Dario10aSurface speciation and alkane oxidation with highly dispersed Fe(III) sites on silica  ap. 103-110.  aWhen highly dispersed, supported Fe oxides are selective alkane oxidation catalysts, but new syntheses are required to reliably produce such materials. Here, highly dispersed, supported Fe³⁺ catalysts are prepared via incipient wetness impregnation of SiO₂ with aqueous Fe complexes of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (FeEDTA), followed by calcination. With Na⁺ countercations, UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra are entirely below 300nm and H₂ temperature-programmed reduction only shows reduction at ∼630°C for all loadings up to 2.15wt%, the maximum loading for a single impregnation cycle. These characteristics indicate isolated sites not seen for Fe(NO₃)₃ precursors even at 0.3wt%. NH₄ ⁺ countercations lead to amorphous oxide oligomers and a minority species with unusual reducibility at 310°C. Na⁺ countercations produce ‘single-site’ behavior in adamantane oxidation using H₂O₂ with a specific turnover frequency of 9.2±0.8ks⁻¹, constant for all Fe loadings and approximately 10 times higher than that of other well-dispersed Fe/SiO₂ materials. Similar turnover frequencies are obtained when counting only the highly reducible species on the NH₄ ⁺-derived catalyst, allowing these sites to be tentatively assigned as small, undercoordinated clusters that are both easily reduced and participate in alkane oxidation, reminiscent of Fe-exchanged MFI zeolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aalkanes 3aammonium compounds 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3airon oxides 3aoxidation 3areflectance 3asilica 3asodium 3azeolites1 aNotestein, Justin M.0 tJournal of catalysis.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 279, no. 1 p.103-110dElsevier Inc.x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2011.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245011400179300001600293520108200309592002801391650001401419650001801433650002201451650002001473650001901493650001601512650003101528650001501559651002101574700001901595700002001614773007701634856008501711852000901796655001201805IND60109214120221120075605.0141109e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010921412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2012.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYılmaz Civan, Mihriban10aImprovement of uptake rate equations depending on meteorological conditions for 25 volatile organic compounds  ap. 720-729.  aStainless steel passive (diffusive) sampling tubes manufactured by Gradko International Ltd.

The URs have been calculated, and dependence on such meteorological parameters as temperature, relative humidity and wind speed has been established for the 31 VOCs. The URs of the 31 VOCs measured in this study showed a statistically significant decreasing trend with rising temperature; and weaker, but again statistically significant, increasing trends with increasing relative humidity and wind speed. This study has demonstrated that the URs of VOCs are affected by meteorological parameters, and this dependence should be taken into account when attempting to generate reliable data through passive sampling.

Several sequence-based methods mainly rely on utilizing various types of complementary features to design accurate classifiers for predicting non-classical secretory proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) terms are increasing informative in predicting protein functions. However, the number of used GO terms is often very large. For example, there are 60,020 GO terms used in the prediction method Euk-mPLoc 2.0 for subcellular localization. This study proposes a novel approach to identify a small set of m top-ranked GO terms served as the only type of input features to design a support vector machine (SVM) based method Sec-GO to predict non-classical secretory proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. To evaluate the Sec-GO method, two existing methods and their used datasets are adopted for performance comparisons. The Sec-GO method using m=436 GO terms yields an independent test accuracy of 96.7% on mammalian proteins, much better than the existing method SPRED (82.2%) which uses frequencies of tri-peptides and short peptides, secondary structure, and physicochemical properties as input features of a random forest classifier. Furthermore, when applying to Gram-positive bacterial proteins, the Sec-GO with m=158 GO terms has a test accuracy of 94.5%, superior to NClassG+ (90.0%) which uses SVM with several feature types, comprising amino acid composition, di-peptides, physicochemical properties and the position specific weighting matrix. Analysis of the distribution of secretory proteins in a GO database indicates the percentage of the non-classical secretory proteins annotated by GO is larger than that of classical secretory proteins in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Of the m top-ranked GO features, the top-four GO terms are all annotated by such subcellular locations as GO:0005576 (Extracellular region). Additionally, the method Sec-GO is easily implemented and its web tool of prediction is available at iclab.life.nctu.edu.tw/secgo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3abacterial proteins 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3amammals 3apeptides 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprediction 3aprokaryotic cells 3aprotein secretion 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aComputational Biologyxmethods 2aDatabases, Protein 2aEukaryotic Cellsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aInformation Storage and Retrievalxmethods 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProkaryotic Cellsxmetabolism 2aProteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSupport Vector Machine. 2aVocabulary, Controlled0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2012 Nov. 7, v. 312 p.105-113dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.07.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03541naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011900182300001600301500001500317520185800332592002802190650002602218650002102244650002102265650001902286650001502305650003702320650002502357650002002382650001002402650001602412650001902428650002002447650001702467650001702484650001802501650002402519650001302543650001102556650001802567650001902585650001402604653002002618700001802638700002602656700002802682700002802710700002002738773010102758856008402859990002302943852000902966655001202975IND60104462820221120032858.0141107e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010446282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micinf.2011.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez-Tirado, Carolina10aNeisseria gonorrhoeae induced disruption of cell junction complexes in epithelial cells of the human genital tract  ap. 290-300.  a2019-12-04  aPathogenic microorganisms, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, have developed mechanisms to alter epithelial barriers in order to reach subepithelial tissues for host colonization. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of gonococci on cell junction complexes of genital epithelial cells of women. Polarized Ishikawa cells, a cell line derived from endometrial epithelium, were used for experimental infection. Infected cells displayed a spindle-like shape with an irregular distribution, indicating potential alteration of cell–cell contacts. Accordingly, analysis by confocal microscopy and cellular fractionation revealed that gonococci induced redistribution of the adherens junction proteins E-cadherin and its adapter protein β-catenin from the membrane to a cytoplasmic pool, with no significant differences in protein levels. In contrast, gonococcal infection did not induce modification of either expression or distribution of the tight junction proteins Occludin and ZO-1. Similar results were observed for Fallopian tube epithelia. Interestingly, infected Ishikawa cells also showed an altered pattern of actin cytoskeleton, observed in the form of stress fibers across the cytoplasm, which in turn matched a strong alteration on the expression of fibronectin, an adhesive glycoprotein component of extracellular matrix. Interestingly, using western blotting, activation of the ERK pathway was detected after gonococcal infection while p38 pathway was not activated. All effects were pili and Opa independent. Altogether, results indicated that gonococcus, as a mechanism of pathogenesis, induced disruption of junction complexes with early detaching of E-cadherin and β-catenin from the adherens junction complex, followed by a redistribution and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and fibronectin within the extracellular matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeisseria gonorrhoeae 3aepithelial cells 3aWestern blotting 3acell membranes 3aepithelium 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aextracellular matrix 3afallopian tubes 3awomen 3aendometrium 3amicrofilaments 3atight junctions 3apathogenesis 3afibronectins 3aglycoproteins 3aconfocal microscopy 3afimbriae 3ahumans 3afractionation 3amicroorganisms 3aoccludins 0aFallopian tubes1 aMaisey, Kevin1 aRodríguez, Felipe E.1 aReyes-Cerpa, Sebastián1 aReyes-López, Felipe E.1 aImarai, Mónica0 tMicrobes and Infection.g2012 Mar., v. 14, no. 3 p.290-300dElsevier Masson SASx1286-45797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2011.11.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013700171300001600308520119400324592002801518650001701546650001501563650001601578650001201594650001101606650001101617650001601628650002201644650001501666650001101681650001001692651001401702700001601716700002501732773008801757856008701845990002301932852000901955655001201964IND60108194120221121225925.0141108e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010819412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resourpol.2013.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkbar, Delwar10aPredicting impacts of major projects on housing prices in resource based towns with a case study application to Gladstone, Australia  ap. 481-489.  aThe resources sector in Australia makes a major contribution to the national economy, and underpins employment and population in the mining and mineral processing towns. For those towns, rapid growth in employment can generate particular pressures in local housing markets because of the relatively large size of the industry and the small housing stocks involved. Through a case study of Gladstone, the study provides a dynamic five-step population and housing model, to estimate short to medium term mining impacts of major resource developments. The model includes both the direct and indirect labour force generated by new resource sector developments and their flow-on effects on population increases. Sensitivity testing has allowed for different levels of resource development, employment multipliers and labour inflows. Three different approaches have then been applied to predict the housing price impacts of the expected population growth. The results of the study show that the model can efficiently predict population and housing market dynamics where there is a resource boom and bust cycle, and can potentially be applied to other resource regions in Australia and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aemployment 3alabor force 3amarkets 3amining 3amodels 3amultipliers 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3aprices 3atowns 3aAustralia1 aRolfe, John1 aKabir, S.M.

Thus, the Au/SnO₂/n-LTPS Schottky diode has the potential to develop a low cost high performance CO sensor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acarbon monoxide 3aglass 3asilicon 3atemperature1 aFang, Yean-Kuen1 aChiang, Yen-Ting1 aChou, Tse-Heng1 aLin, Cheng-I.1 aLin, Cheng-Wei0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Aug. 10, v. 156, no. 1 p.338-342dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.04.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009200167300001600259520108000275592002801355650002601383650001501409650002401424650001701448650001101465650001401476650002501490700002201515700002001537700002101557773009801578856008101676990002301757852000901780655001201789IND60104156820221116184125.0141107e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010415682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mbs.2011.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCacace, Filippo10aObserver-based techniques for the identification and analysis of avascular tumor growth  ap. 147-153.  aCancer represents one of the most challenging issues for the biomedical research, due its large impact on the public health state. For this reason, many mathematical methods have been proposed to forecast the time evolution of cancer size and invasion. In this paper, we study how to apply the Gompertz’s model to describe the growth of an avascular tumor in a realistic setting. To this aim, we introduce mathematical techniques to discretize the model, an important requirement when discrete-time measurements are available. Additionally, we describe observed-based techniques, borrowed from the field of automation theory, as a tool to estimate the model unknown parameters. This identification approach is a promising alternative to traditional statistical methods, and it can be easily extended to other models of cancer growth as well as to the evaluation of not measurable variables, on the basis of the available measurements. We show an application of this method to the analysis of solid tumor growth and parameters estimation in presence of a chemotherapy agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3aautomation 3abiomedical research 3adrug therapy 3amodels 3aneoplasms 3astatistical analysis1 aCusimano, Valerio1 aDi Paola, Luisa1 aGermani, Alfredo0 tMathematical biosciences.g2011 Dec., v. 234, no. 2 p.147-153dElsevier Inc.x0025-55647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2011.10.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011600169300001600285520145100301592002801752650001501780650000801795650001901803650001501822650001701837650001701854650002001871650003701891650003101928650000901959650002001968650000901988650002301997650001302020700002602033700001902059700002202078700001802100700002002118773011102138856008202249990002302331852000902354655001202363IND60110471320221121033451.0141109e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011047132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.taap.2012.11.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJarvis, Ian W.H.10aPersistent activation of DNA damage signaling in response to complex mixtures of PAHs in air particulate matter  ap. 408-418.  aComplex mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are present in air particulate matter (PM) and have been associated with many adverse human health effects including cancer and respiratory disease. However, due to their complexity, the risk of exposure to mixtures is difficult to estimate. In the present study the effects of binary mixtures of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP) and complex mixtures of PAHs in urban air PM extracts on DNA damage signaling was investigated. Applying a statistical model to the data we observed a more than additive response for binary mixtures of BP and DBP on activation of DNA damage signaling. Persistent activation of checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) was observed at significantly lower BP equivalent concentrations in air PM extracts than BP alone. Activation of DNA damage signaling was also more persistent in air PM fractions containing PAHs with more than four aromatic rings suggesting larger PAHs contribute a greater risk to human health. Altogether our data suggests that human health risk assessment based on additivity such as toxicity equivalency factor scales may significantly underestimate the risk of exposure to complex mixtures of PAHs. The data confirms our previous findings with PAH-contaminated soil (Niziolek-Kierecka et al., 2012) and suggests a possible role for Chk1 Ser317 phosphorylation as a biological marker for future analyses of complex mixtures of PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aair 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abiomarkers 3ahuman health 3aparticulates 3aphosphorylation 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arespiratory tract diseases 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asoil 3astatistical models 3atoxicity1 aBergvall, Christoffer1 aBottai, Matteo1 aWesterholm, Roger1 aStenius, Ulla1 aDreij, Kristian0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 266, no. 3 p.408-418dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.11.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003400113040001800147100001900165245009200184300001600276520089600292592002801188650003101216650001001247650002701257650001701284650001801301650001401319650001301333650001201346650002301358650007201381650001101453650002601464650000901490650004701499650005201546650005201598700002001650700002101670773009201691856008001783990002301863852000901886655001201895IND60110797020221118045918.0141109e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011079702DNAL7 a231165492pmid7 a10.1016/j.it.2012.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCodarri, Laura10aCommunication between pathogenic T cells and myeloid cells in neuroinflammatory disease  ap. 114-119.  aClinical and experimental data suggest that T helper (TH) cells are involved in the pathogenicity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and multiple sclerosis (MS), but it is unlikely that they are directly responsible for the observed demyelination and axonal loss. Instead, the cell population that targets the destruction of oligodendrocytes and axons, and the mechanism exploited by central nervous system (CNS)-invading encephalitogenic TH cells to instruct these cells to mediate tissue damage, are still under debate. Mature myeloid cells form a prominent component of the neuroinflammatory infiltrates and are the suspected culprits behind the CNS injury due to their arsenal of toxic factors. Here, we describe the process of encephalitogenic TH cell activation followed by their entry into the CNS and discuss how pathogenic TH cells influence the myeloid compartment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aaxons 3acentral nervous system 3aencephalitis 3apathogenicity 3asclerosis 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aCell Communication 2aEncephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimentalximmunologyxpathology. 2aHumans 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMice 2aMultiple Sclerosisximmunologyxpathology. 2aMyeloid Cellsxcytologyximmunologyxpathology. 2aT-Lymphocytesxcytologyximmunologyxpathology.1 aGreter, Melanie1 aBecher, Burkhard0 tTrends in immunology.g2013 Mar., v. 34, no. 3 p.114-119dElsevier Ltdx1471-49067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2012.09.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245025700160300001800417520077300435592002801208650001401236650002301250650002301273650001201296650001701308650001201325650001201337700001901349700001801368700001701386773008701403856008101490852000901571655001201580IND60109463620221120150808.0141109e20120204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010946362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhen10aFacile synthesis of sulfenyl-substituted isocoumarins, heterocycle-fused pyrones and 3-(inden-1-ylidene)isobenzofuranones by FeCl₃-promoted regioselective annulation of o-(1-alkynyl)benzoates and o-(1-alkynyl)heterocyclic carboxylates with disulfides  ap. 1552-1559.  aReported herein is the FeCl₃-promoted intermolecular sulfoesterification of o-(1-alkynyl)benzoates with disulfides, which provides a convenient and efficient method for synthesis of 4-sulfenylisocoumarins.

FTIR measurement evidenced the occurrence of amidation reaction between the anhydride group of PSMA and the secondary amino group of POSS. This reaction turned out to promote POSS well dispersed in the polymer matrix, and the PSMA-POSS hybrids showed no macro phase separation even if POSS concentration was up to 30 wt%. DSC results showed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased to 168 °C with the increase of POSS loading. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) revealed the storage modulus at high temperature increased with the addition of POSS due to the formation of a permanent network.

The majority of the steel produced today is based on the use of virgin raw materials such as iron ore and fossil-based energy sources such as coal and oil. Recently, emphasis has been laid on the possibility to replace part of the fossil-based energy sources in ironmaking with renewable, biomass-derived reducing agents (bio-reducers). Modern thermochemical conversion processes could be utilized to produce solid, liquid and gaseous bio-reducers from biomass feedstock. This paper provides an in-depth review, first of its kind, of the possibility to replace part of the fossil-based reducing agents with bio-reducers in the blast furnace ironmaking route. In the first part of the paper, blast furnace process and the role of the reducing agents are discussed. In the second part of the paper, thermochemical biomass conversion technologies and resulting product properties are reviewed. Chemical and physical properties of the bio-reducers are compared to fossil-based reducing agents. In the third part of the paper, the implications related to bio-reducer use are evaluated in separate system levels including unit process assessment (blast furnace), process integration opportunities, biomass availability, life cycle impact and economic evaluations. The fourth part of the paper is dedicated to the discussion of the future of bio-reducers in ironmaking applications. It is concluded that bio-reducers can contribute to more environmentally sound steelmaking.

RESV mediates a wide-range of biological activities, which comprise an increased life span, anti-ischemic, anti-cancer, antiviral, anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties. Studies in several animal prototypes of brain injury suggest that RESV is an effective neuroprotective compound. Ability to enter the brain after a peripheral administration and no adverse effects on the brain or body are other features that are appealing for using this compound as a therapy for brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases. The goal of this review is to discuss the promise of RESV for treating acute seizures, preventing the acute seizure or status epilepticus induced development of chronic epilepsy, and easing the chronic epilepsy typified by spontaneous recurrent seizures and cognitive dysfunction. First, the various beneficial effects of RESV on the normal brain are discussed to provide a rationale for considering RESV treatment in the management of acute seizures and epilepsy. Next, the detrimental effects of acute seizures or status epilepticus on the hippocampus and the implications of post-status epilepticus changes in the hippocampus towards the occurrence of chronic epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction are summarized. The final segment evaluates studies that have used RESV as a neuroprotective compound against seizures, and proposes studies that are critically needed prior to the clinical application of RESV as a prophylaxis against the development of chronic epilepsy and cognitive dysfunction after an episode of status epilepticus or head injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute effects 3aadverse effects 3aanimals 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acognition 3adisease control 3aepilepsy 3agrapes 3ahead 3ahippocampus 3alongevity 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aphytoalexins 3aprototypes 3ared wines 3aresveratrol 3aseizures 3atherapeutics0 tPharmacology and therapeutics.g2011 Sept., v. 131, no. 3 p.269-286dElsevier Inc.x0163-72587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.04.0083Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245009700172300001600269500001500285520165100300592002801951650002901979650001302008650002102021650003702042650001102079650002402090650002002114650001402134650002202148650001202170650002302182651001102205653002102216700002402237700002102261700002402282700002102306700002302327700002002350700001702370773011902387856008202506990002302588852000902611655001202620IND60100172720221120052750.0141105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010017272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2011.09.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenz, H.q(Harald),10aGene-environment interaction in chronic disease: A European Science Foundation Forward Look  ap. S27-S49.  a2019-12-04  aOver the last half century, a dramatic increase in the incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, allergy, and irritable bowel syndrome, has rightfully led to concern about how the modern lifestyle might inappropriately trigger innate physiologic defense mechanisms. Health care research in the Western world is faced with a significant challenge if it is to meet the needs of its populations in the decades ahead. The tools with which we hope to advance our understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of chronic inflammatory diseases must therefore be adequately exploited and further developed to identify treatment and prevention strategies. There is an urgent need to prioritize resources and identify the most efficient scientific and societal initiatives to be adopted within this area. In this context national collaboration within Europe and beyond to establish state-of-the-art practices with an interdisciplinary perspective and promote an efficient exchange of best practices is essential. Such an approach likely represents the most efficient manner in which strategies for amelioration of the increase of chronic inflammatory diseases in the Western world can be achieved. The present report is based on a Forward Look initiative conducted by the European Medical Research Councils under the European Science Foundation. Experts from industry and academia, as well as relevant interest organizations, have been consulted in the process of conducting this initiative and have, based on this work, developed a set of final recommendations that target academic research, science funders, and policy makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3airritable bowel syndrome 3aindustry 3achronic diseases 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aasthma 3abiomedical research 3ahealth services 3alifestyle 3aissues and policy 3aexperts 3adefense mechanisms 3aEurope 0ahypersensitivity1 aAutenrieth, Ingo B.1 aBrandtzaeg, Per,1 aCookson, William O.1 aHolgate, Stephen1 aMutius, Erika von,1 aValenta, Rudolf1 aHaller, Dirk0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2011 Dec., v. 128, no. 6S p.S27-S49dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2011.09.0393Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014000170300001600310520116300326592002801489650001501517650001001532650001101542650001301553650001101566650000801577700002901585700002101614700001801635700001801653700002801671700002201699773008801721856008101809990002301890852000901913655001201922IND60108699620150407000000.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010869962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.11.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaacob, Mohd Hanif10aOptical response of WO₃ nanostructured thin films sputtered on different transparent substrates towards hydrogen of low concentration  ap. 981-988.  aThe gasochromic response of WO₃ nanostructured films coated with a catalytic Pt or Pd layer on different transparent substrates upon exposure to H₂ gas was investigated. WO₃ nanostructured films with 500nm thickness were coated with a 25Å thick Pt or Pd layer. The films were prepared on quartz, glass, indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass. The nanostructured WO₃ was deposited by RF magnetron sputtering, and the Pt or Pd layer was deposited by DC sputtering. Characterization of the film revealed that the WO₃ was deposited as nanoscale grains of varied size depending on the substrate. WO₃ grains on quartz and glass were 30–40nm in size. WO₃ grain sizes on ITO and FTO were 40–60nm and 300–500nm, respectively. The WO₃ films were observed to show strong gasochromic response, with absorbance changes measured in the Vis-NIR (500–1100nm) range. The cumulative absorbance response towards H₂ is the highest and more stable for Pd/WO₃ films on quartz, glass and ITO, compared to the FTO substrate. The gasochromic effect was also stronger in Pd/WO₃ films compared to Pt/WO₃ films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aglass 3agrains 3ahydrogen 3aquartz 3atin1 aAhmad, Muhammad Zamharir1 aSadek, Abu Zafar1 aOu, Jian Zhen1 aCampbell, Jos1 aKalantar-zadeh, Kourosh1 aWlodarski, Wojtek0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Feb., v. 177 p.981-988dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.11.0983Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008300174300001800257520113600275592002801411650001501439650002201454650001101476650001101487650001001498650001201508700002001520700002101540773009201561856008601653990002301739852000901762655001201771IND60110872420221121043451.0141109e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011087242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBachmann, Florian10aGrain detection from 2d and 3d EBSD data—Specification of the MTEX algorithm  ap. 1720-1733.  aWe present a fast and versatile algorithm for the reconstruction of the grain structure from 2d and 3d Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) data. The algorithm is rigorously derived from the modeling assumption that grain boundaries are located at the bisectors of adjacent measurement locations. This modeling assumption immediately implies that grains are composed of Voronoi cells corresponding to the measurement locations. Thus our algorithm is based on the Voronoi decomposition of the 2d or 3d measurement domain. It applies to any geometrical configuration of measurement locations and allows for missing data due to measurement errors. The definition of grains as compositions of Voronoi cells implies another fundamental feature of the proposed algorithm—its invariance with respect to spatial displacements, i.e., rotations or shifts of the specimen. This paper also serves as a reference paper for the texture analysis software MTEX, which is a comprehensive and versatile, freely available MATLAB toolbox that covers a wide range of problems in quantitative texture analysis, including the analysis of EBSD data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3agrains 3amodels 3apaper 3atexture1 aHielscher, Ralf1 aSchaeben, Helmut0 tUltramicroscopy.g2011 Dec., v. 111, no. 12 p.1720-1733dElsevier B.V.x0304-39917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.08.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009100161300001600252520186000268592002802128650001202156650001402168650001302182650001302195650001602208650001702224650001202241650002302253650001102276650001702287650000902304650001802313650001302331650001802344650001402362650001102376650001802387651001402405651001302419651001402432700002402446700001902470700001602489773010402505856008202609990002302691852000902714655001202723IND60108048520221119175839.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010804852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCutz, L.10aBioenergy production in Central America: Integration of sweet sorghum into sugar mills  ap. 529-542.  aThis paper aims to evaluate the potential for electricity and ethanol production in Central America using sweet sorghum as an energy crop. Three scenarios were built to analyse sweet sorghum production in terms of the land where it can be cultivated: cropland, sugarcane land in fallow and land in continuous production (intercropping system). The land under permanent crops was not considered for this evaluation. We propose the integration of sweet sorghum into Central American sugar mills, by using the existing machinery to process it. The short growing period of sweet sorghum would allow the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants and distilleries to operate outside the sugarcane crushing season using sorghum bagasse and molasses as raw materials. This production could be performed 1month before, and 1month after the sugarcane season. Results indicate that by growing sweet sorghum on 5% of Central America's cropland, sorghum could supply around 10% of region's electricity demand. Thus, Central America could increase its CHP share of electricity supply from 4.4% to 5.6%. The increase in renewable electricity production would allow countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua to reduce fossil fuel bills by USD$ 13, 10 and 20 million, respectively. The ethanol produced from sweet sorghum during off-season can help to implement and maintain a sustainable ethanol program in the region that does not only depend on sugarcane. Sweet sorghum would allow distilleries to easily supply the ethanol required to implement an E5 or ED3 program. Central America could produce about 387 million liters of ethanol by growing sweet sorghum on 5% of its cropland. This ethanol production would help the region to reduce fossil fuel bills by USD$ 517 million by using ethanol–gasoline blends or USD$ 463 million by using ethanol–diesel blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3abagasse 3abioenergy 3acropland 3acrushing 3aelectricity 3aenergy crops 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afallow 3afossil fuels 3aheat 3aintercropping 3amolasses 3araw materials 3asugarcane 3asugars 3asweet sorghum 3aGuatemala 3aHonduras 3aNicaragua1 aSanchez-Delgado, S.1 aRuiz-Rivas, U.1 aSantana, D.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Sept., v. 25 p.529-542dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245018300173300001600356520166500372592002802037650001702065650001402082650001202096650002302108650002502131650001702156650001702173650001702190650002202207650001402229650001102243651001102254700002802265700002402293700002502317700002402342700002802366773007602394856008202470990002302552852000902575655001202584IND60102684020221117230834.0141106e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010268402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2011.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Marina C.10aAcetaldehyde and formaldehyde concentrations from sites impacted by heavy-duty diesel vehicles and their correlation with the fuel composition: Diesel and diesel/biodiesel blends  ap. 258-263.  aThe increasing of both industrialization and motorization of the world has led to a sharp rise in the demand for fossil fuels. Concern about the environmental impact caused by burning of these fuels has involved researchers that became engaged in assessing the damages of pollution not only to environment, but also to human health. In this study, carbonyl compounds (CC) were measured in vapor samples from a place impacted by heavy-duty vehicles (Bus Station) fuelled with diesel/biodiesel fuel blend (B5) in Salvador, Brazil. Among them, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and propanone were the most abundant quantified compounds. Concentration levels (ppbV) for major CC detected during the sampling period ranged from 28.45 to 287.3 (formaldehyde), 24.91 to 171.3 (acetaldehyde) and 5.835 to 72.29 (propanone). The obtained data in this site was compared to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations found in other sites impacted by heavy-duty vehicles fuelled with pure diesel and diesel/biodiesel blends. All data were used to make a possible correlation with formaldehyde/acetaldehyde ratio and the relationship with the kind of fuel used by these vehicles. PCA was used to verify possible grouping among 19 sites impacted by heavy-duty vehicles and showed two major groups, one characterized by being strongly impacted and the other with a low contribution of heavy-duty vehicles. Thus, the addition of higher concentrations of biodiesel to diesel showed an improvement in the carbonyl concentration profile at places with high circulation of heavy-duty vehicles, which had similar profile to those found for sites less impacted by these kind of vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3abiodiesel 3aburning 3acarbonyl compounds 3aenvironmental impact 3aformaldehyde 3afossil fuels 3ahuman health 3aindustrialization 3apollution 3avapors 3aBrazil1 aGuarieiro, Lílian L.N.1 aCardoso, Manuela P.1 aCarvalho, Luiz Souza1 ada Rocha, Gisele O.1 aAndrade, Jailson B. de,0 tFuel.g2012 Feb., v. 92, no. 1 p.258-263dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2011.07.0233Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009000175300001600265520096400281592002801245650001001273650002601283650002201309650003301331650001001364700001901374700001601393700002401409700002001433700001801453700002201471773008801493856008101581990002301662852000901685655001201694IND60108699720221120061612.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010869972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.11.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez, Juan Manuel10aHybrid electronic tongue based on multisensor data fusion for discrimination of beers  ap. 989-996.  aThis paper reports the use of a hybrid electronic tongue based on data fusion of two different sensor families, applied in the recognition of beer types. Six modified graphite-epoxy voltammetric sensors plus 15 potentiometric sensors formed the sensor array. The different samples were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry and direct potentiometry without any sample pretreatment in both cases. The sensor array coupled with feature extraction and pattern recognition methods, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), was trained to classify the data clusters related to different beer varieties. PCA was used to visualize the different categories of taste profiles, while LDA with leave-one-out cross-validation approach permitted the qualitative classification. The aim of this work is to improve performance of existing electronic tongue systems by exploiting the new approach of data fusion of different sensor types.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeers 3adiscriminant analysis 3aelectronic tongue 3aprincipal component analysis 3ataste1 aHaddi, Zouhair1 aAmari, Aziz1 aBouchikhi, Benachir1 aMimendia, Aitor1 aCetó, Xavier1 aValle, Manel del,0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Feb., v. 177 p.989-996dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2012.11.1103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013500167300001600302500001500318520168700333592002802020650001302048650001502061650001602076650001702092650002502109650001802134650001902152650001402171650003102185650001702216650002102233650001302254650002102267650002002288650001602308650001702324650002702341650000902368650001302377653001702390700002402407700001902431700002002450700001902470700002002489700001902509773009302528856008102621852000902702655001202711IND60103532420221119182328.0141106e20120310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010353242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2011.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzikora, Ágnes10aVascular metabolism of anandamide to arachidonic acid affects myogenic constriction in response to intraluminal pressure elevation  ap. 407-415.  a2019-12-04  aAIMS: We hypothesized that arachidonic acid produced by anandamide breakdown contributes to the vascular effects of anandamide. MAIN METHODS: Isolated, pressurized rat skeletal muscle arteries, which possess spontaneous myogenic tone, were treated with anandamide, arachidonic acid, capsaicin (vanilloid receptor agonist), WIN 55-212-2 (cannabinoid receptor agonist), URB-597 (FAAH inhibitor), baicalein (lipoxygenase inhibitor), PPOH (cytochrome P450 inhibitor), and indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor). Changes in the arteriolar diameter in response to the various treatments were measured. To assess the effect of anandamide metabolism, anandamide was applied for 20min followed by washout for 40min. This protocol was used to eliminate other, more direct effects of anandamide in order to reveal how anandamide metabolism may influence vasodilation. KEY FINDINGS: Anandamide at a low dose (1μM) evoked a loss of myogenic tone, while a high dose (30μM) not only attenuated the myogenic response but also evoked acute dilation. Both of these effects were inhibited by the FAAH inhibitor URB-597 and were mimicked by arachidonic acid. The CB1 and CB2 agonist R-WIN 55-212-2 and the vanilloid receptor agonist capsaicin were without effect on the myogenic response. The inhibition of the myogenic response by anandamide was blocked by indomethacin and PPOH, but not by baicalein or removal of the endothelium. FAAH expression in the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. SIGNIFICANCE: Anandamide activates the arachidonic acid pathway in the microvasculature, affecting vascular autoregulation (myogenic response) and local perfusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3ametabolism 3aendothelium 3acannabinoids 3aimmunohistochemistry 3asmooth muscle 3aautoregulation 3acapsaicin 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aindomethacin 3aarachidonic acid 3amyocytes 3acytochrome P-450 3askeletal muscle 3ablood cells 3avasodilation 3aprostaglandin synthase 3arats 3aarteries 0alipoxygenase1 aLizanecz, Erzsébet1 aBoczán, Judit1 aDaragó, Andrea1 aPapp, Zoltán,1 aÉdes, István,1 aTóth, Attila,0 tLife sciences.g2012 Mar. 10, v. 90, no. 11-12 p.407-415dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2011.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01150naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008700167300001800254520024000272592002800512650001400540650002300554650002300577650001100600650001300611650001400624700002000638773009700658856008400755852000900839655001200848IND60109846420221119123838.0141109e20111116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010984642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.09.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandi, Sukla10aCopper catalyzed synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole and isoindole derivatives  ap. 6203-6206.  aWe have developed an efficient synthesis of highly substituted pyrrole and isoindole derivatives using copper(I) catalyst.

Selected residues were examined by XRD, SEM, TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Results indicate that the dehydration process is a topotactic reaction which brings about γ-Al₂O₃ with porous microstructure and poor crystallinity. The kinetic data were analysed using the model-free (isoconversional) methods. The results indicate that the activation energy of the dehydration process depends on the reaction extent, signifying the dehydration process is chemical controlled with a diffusion complication as the reaction extent increases. Prediction of the dehydration extent was accomplished using the kinetic parameter of the non-isothermal process and the isoconversional method. The predicted rate is in a reasonably good agreement with the measured values. Finally the mechanism of the dehydration process is discussed based on the auxiliary results from the physical examination of the reacted residues and the kinetic behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3aclinical examination 3acrystal structure 3agibbsite 3amicrostructure 3aprediction 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSmith, Peter0 tThermochimica acta.g2012 Mar. 10, v. 531 p.46-53dElsevier B.V.x0040-60317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2011.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013700176300001300313520131600326592002801642650002201670650002101692650001201713650001101725650001301736650001301749650001801762650001701780650001701797650001301814650000901827650002101836650001301857650001401870650001301884650000901897700002301906700002101929700001901950773010201969856008502071852000902156655001202165IND60101491020221119171531.0141106e20120930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010149102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasheras-Zubiate, M.10aEncapsulation, solid-phases identification and leaching of toxic metals in cement systems modified by natural biodegradable polymers  ap. 7-17.  aCement mortars loaded with Cr, Pb and Zn were modified by polymeric admixtures [chitosans with low (LMWCH), medium (MMWCH) and high (HMWCH) molecular weight and hydroxypropylchitosan (HPCH)]. The influence of the simultaneous presence of the heavy metal and the polymeric additive on the fresh properties (consistency, water retention and setting time) and on the compressive strength of the mortars was assessed. Leaching patterns as well as properties of the cement mortars were related to the heavy metals-bearing solid phases. Chitosan admixtures lessened the effect of the addition of Cr and Pb on the setting time. In all instances, chitosans improved the compressive strength of the Zn-bearing mortars yielding values as high as 15Nmm⁻². A newly reported Zn phase, dietrichite (ZnAl₂(SO₄)₄·22H₂O) was identified under the presence of LMWCH: it was responsible for an improvement by 24% in Zn retention. Lead-bearing silicates, such as plumalsite (Pb₄Al₂(SiO₃)₇), were also identified by XRD confirming that Pb was mainly retained as a part of the silicate network after Ca ion exchange. Also, the presence of polymer induced the appearance and stabilization of some Pb(IV) species. Finally, diverse chromate species were identified and related to the larger leaching values of Cr(VI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiodegradability 3acalcium 3acement 3achitosan 3achromium 3aencapsulation 3aheavy metals 3aion exchange 3aleaching 3alead 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3asilicates 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aNavarro-Blasco, I.1 aFernández, J.M.1 aÁlvarez, J.I.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Sept. 30, v. 233-234 p.7-17dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009900168300001400267520118900281592002801470650002201498650001801520650001101538650001401549650002501563650001201588650001201600700001901612700001601631700001901647700002001666773011701686856008101803852000901884655001201893IND60104626220221119202945.0141107e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010462622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Meenal10aProliferation and plasticity of human beta cells on physiologically occurring laminin isoforms  ap. 78-86.  aWe have previously characterized the molecular composition of human islet basement membranes and shown that human beta cells bind to laminin 511 (LM511) through integrin α3β1 and Lutheran glycoprotein. We have now investigated the impact of physical contact between cultured human beta cells and the laminin isoforms occurring in their natural niche. Human islet preparations derived from 15 donors were used, beta cells and duct cells were purified by magnetic sorting. Overall beta-cell proliferation was low or undetectable. However, in many experiments the only proliferating beta cells were detected in contact with the laminin isoforms that are found in the human islets in vivo (511 and 411). Purified ductal and beta cells underwent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). LM511 partially blocked this dedifferentiation of purified beta cells, and did not affect purified duct cells. Interactions with the surrounding basement membrane are important for the growth and function of human beta cells. However, only a very limited level of beta-cell proliferation can be induced by exogenous factors. LM511 may be a useful substrate for human beta-cell maintenance in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasement membrane 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3aislets of Langerhans 3alaminin 3asorting1 aVirtanen, Ismo1 aPalgi, Jaan1 aKorsgren, Olle1 aOtonkoski, Timo0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 May 15, v. 355, no. 1 p.78-86dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012800167300001600295520158400311592002801895650000901923650002501932650001601957650001101973650001801984650000902002651001602011651001502027651001102042651001002053651001302063651001002076651001302086651001402099700001802113773010402131856008202235990002302317852000902340655001202349IND60108048820221119175850.0141108e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010804882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhmat, Ghulam10aNuclear energy consumption, commercial energy consumption and economic growth in South Asia: Bootstrap panel causality test  ap. 552-559.  aThe objective of the study is to investigate the causal relationship among nuclear energy consumption, commercial energy consumption (i.e., oil consumption, gas consumption, electricity consumption and coal consumption) and economic growth in South Asian countries; namely, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka; over the period of 1975 to 2010. Data is analyzed by bootstrap panel Granger causality method. The results reveal that nuclear energy consumption Granger causes economic growth in Nepal and Pakistan; while, commercial energy consumption i.e., oil consumption Granger causes economic growth in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Srilanka; gas consumption Granger causes economic growth in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Maldives; electricity consumption Granger causes economic growth in India and Srilanka, finally, coal consumption Granger causes economic growth in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Srilanka. On the other side, economic growth Granger causes nuclear energy consumption in Pakistan; economic growth Granger causes oil consumption in Bhutan, Maldives and Srilanka; economic growth Granger causes gas consumption in Nepal, Srilanka and Pakistan; finally, economic growth Granger causes electricity consumption. Economic growth Granger causes coal consumption in all South Asian countries. The findings show that the nature of causality between nuclear energy consumption & economic growth; and commercial energy consumption & economic growth is in favor of the neutrality hypothesis in most of the countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aeconomic development 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3anuclear power 3aoils 3aAfghanistan 3aBangladesh 3aBhutan 3aIndia 3aMaldives 3aNepal 3aPakistan 3aSri Lanka1 aZaman, Khalid0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2013 Sept., v. 25 p.552-559dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2013.05.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013600166300001600302520114000318592002801458650002301486650002301509650001501532650002801547650001201575650001101587650003101598650001401629650001701643650001201660700001801672700001801690700001501708700001801723700001701741700001301758773011001771856008501881990002301966852000901989655001201998IND60102266620221118093127.0141106e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010226662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcata.2013.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Kemeng10aOne-pot hydrothermal preparation and catalytic performance of porous strontium ferrite hollow spheres for the combustion of toluene  ap. 189-196.  aStrontium ferrite (SFO) hollow spheres with or without porous shells were fabricated via a novel one-pot hydrothermal route with the assistance of glucose and/or ethylenediamine. Physicochemical properties of the materials were characterized by means of a number of analytical techniques, and their catalytic performance was evaluated for the combustion of toluene. It is shown that the SFO samples possessed an orthorhombic structure and displayed a porous hollow spherical morphology with a surface area of 18–27m²/g. The SFO sample (SFO-3) derived hydrothermally at 170°C with a glucose/ethylenediamine volumetric ratio of 0.3/1.0 exhibited the highest surface area and oxygen adspecies concentration and the best low-temperature reducibility. Among the SFO samples, the SFO-3 sample showed the best catalytic activity for toluene combustion, and the T₁₀%, T₅₀%, and T₉₀% were ca. 145, 255, and 298°C at a space velocity of 20,000mL/(gh), respectively. It is concluded that the good catalytic performance of SFO-3 was associated with its surface oxygen species concentration and better low-temperature reducibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acatalytic activity 3acombustion 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aglucose 3aoxygen 3aphysicochemical properties 3astrontium 3asurface area 3atoluene1 aDai, Hongxing1 aDeng, Jiguang1 aZhang, Lei1 aJiang, Haiyan1 aXie, Shaohua1 aHan, Wen0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the outcomes and overall survival in patients with CGD after HSCT. METHODS: We report the outcomes for 11 children undergoing HSCT from an MRD (n = 4) or an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) (n = 7); 9 children were boys, and the median age was 3.8 years (range, 1-13 years). We treated both X-linked (n = 9) and autosomal recessive (n = 2) disease. Nine children had serious clinical infections before transplantation. The conditioning regimens contained busulfan, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, or fludarabine according to the donor used. All patients received alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody). Additional graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis included cyclosporine and methotrexate for MUD recipients and cyclosporine and prednisone for MRD recipients. RESULTS: Neutrophil recovery took a median of 16 days (range, 12-40 days) and 18 days (range, 13-24 days) for MRD and MUD recipients, respectively. Full donor neutrophil engraftment occurred in 9 patients, and 2 had stable mixed chimerism; all patients had sustained correction of neutrophil oxidative burst defect. Four patients had grade I skin acute GVHD responding to topical treatment. No patient had grade II to IV acute GvHD or chronic GvHD. All patients are alive between 1 and 8 years after HSCT. CONCLUSION: For CGD, equivalent outcomes can be obtained with MRD or MUD stem cells, and HSCT should be considered an early treatment option.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aboys 3abusulfan 3acell transplantation 3achildren 3achimerism 3acyclophosphamide 3acyclosporine 3adisease control 3amethotrexate 3aneutrophils 3apatients 3aprednisone 3astem cells1 aShah, Sweta1 aShearer, William T.1 aRosenblatt, Howard M.1 aPaul, Mary E.1 aChinen, Javier1 aLeung, Kathryn S.1 aKennedy-Nasser, Alana1 aBrenner, Malcolm K.1 aHeslop, Helen E.1 aLiu, Hao1 aWu, Meng-Fen1 aHanson, Imelda C.1 aKrance, Robert A.0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Jan., v. 129, no. 1 p.176-183dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2011.10.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245013100176300001400307520150900321592002801830650002101858650002001879650002801899650001301927650001401940650001401954650001501968650001001983650002301993650001702016650001502033650002802048650001402076650001502090650001602105650002202121653001902143653001102162653001002173653001602183653002302199653001302222700002502235700002102260700002002281773010502301856008402406852000902490655001202499IND60111655020221122165830.0160903e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011165502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.10.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanckenhorn, Wolf U.10aEvaluation of eco-toxicological effects of the parasiticide moxidectin in comparison to ivermectin in 11 species of dung flies  ap. 15-20.  aA standardized bioassay previously developed with ivermectin for the yellow dung fly (Scathophagidae) and the face fly (Muscidae) was applied to test the response of 11 dung fly species to the presumably less toxic parasiticide moxidectin. The results were compared to existing data for the same species tested with ivermectin, albeit two new species (Scathophaga suilla and Musca domestica) were tested here with both the substances. Estimated lethal effect concentrations LC50 at which 50% of the flies died ranged more than tenfold from 0.012mg moxidectin/kg fresh dung for Sepsis neocynipsea (Sepsidae) to 0.140mg moxidectin/kg fresh dung for the house fly Musca domestica (Muscidae). In most of the species, we additionally revealed sub-lethal effects at lower moxidectin concentrations in terms of retarded growth and development and reduced body size. Mortality thresholds were about ten times higher for moxidectin than for ivermectin, hence moxidectin is indeed less toxic than ivermectin in absolute terms. Crucially, we obtained strong correlations among the 11 tested fly species in both lethal and sub-lethal responses to the two substances, such that species relatively sensitive to ivermectin were also relatively sensitive to moxidectin. Such correlations are expected if the two substances are structurally related and function in the same manner by disturbing ion channel transport. Methodologically speaking, all species used proved suitable for toxicological testing of parasiticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusca autumnalis 3aMusca domestica 3aScathophaga stercoraria 3aSepsidae 3abioassays 3abody size 3adung flies 3afeces 3agrowth retardation 3aion channels 3aivermectin 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3amoxidectin 3anew species 3asublethal effects 0aDung community 0aInsect 0aMusca 0aScathophaga 0aToxicological test 0aSepsidae1 aPuniamoorthy, Nalini1 aScheffczyk, Adam1 aRömbke, Jörg,0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 89 p.15-20dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.10.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100002500195245008900220300001600309500001500325520154600340592002801886650002101914650002001935650002501955650001301980650002201993650002002015650002402035650002002059650001002079650002002089650001202109650001302121650001702134650002802151650001402179650002002193650001302213650003302226650001302259650003202272650001402304650001302318653002402331700001702355700001902372700002202391773010402413856008802517990002302605852000902628655001202637IND60105531020221118145353.0141108e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010553102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.04.0072doi7 aPMC71125632pmcid7 a215704242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercorelli, Beatrice10aEarly inhibitors of human cytomegalovirus: State-of-art and therapeutic perspectives  ap. 309-329.  a2019-12-04  aHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, mainly transplant recipients and AIDS patients, and is the most frequent cause of congenital malformations in newborn children. To date, few drugs are licensed for the treatment of HCMV infections, most of which target the viral DNA polymerase and suffer from many drawbacks, including long-term toxicity, low potency, and poor bioavailability. In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains is becoming an increasing problem for disease management. Finally, none of the current anti-HCMV drugs have been approved for the treatment of congenital infections. For all these reasons, there is still a strong need for new anti-HCMV drugs with novel mechanisms of action. The first events of the virus replication cycle, including attachment, entry, immediate-early gene expression, and immediate-early functions—in particular that of Immediate-Early 2 protein—represent attractive targets for the development of novel antiviral compounds. Such inhibitors would block not only the expression of viral immediate-early proteins, which play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCMV infection, but also the host immunomodulation and the changes to cell physiology induced by the first events of virus infection. This review describes the current knowledge on the initial phases of HCMV replication, their validation as potential novel antiviral targets, and the development of compounds that block such processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunomodulation 3acell physiology 3aabnormal development 3aneonates 3avirus replication 3adrug resistance 3amechanism of action 3abioavailability 3adrugs 3agene expression 3aviruses 3apatients 3apathogenesis 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3amorbidity 3adisease control 3achildren 3aimmunocompromised population 3atoxicity 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3amortality 3aproteins 0aHuman herpesvirus 51 aLembo, David1 aPalù, Giorgio1 aLoregian, Arianna0 tPharmacology and therapeutics.g2011 Sept., v. 131, no. 3 p.309-329dElsevier Inc.x0163-72587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007200167300001200239520152300251592002801774650001501802650001201817650001401829650001201843650001701855650001801872650001501890650001501905650001001920650000901930650001201939650001601951651001001967700001701977700001701994700001602011700001102027700001602038773007702054856008402131961001202215852000902227655001202236IND60108116820221119042456.0141108e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010811682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2012.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhijia,10aEffects of carbonization conditions on properties of bamboo pellets  ap. 1-6.  aBamboo is a biomass material and has great potential as a bio-energy resource of the future in China. Bamboo pellets were successfully manufactured using a laboratory pellet mill in preliminary work. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the effect of carbonization conditions (temperature and time) on properties of bamboo pellets and to evaluate product properties. It was concluded that carbonization conditions affected the properties of bamboo pellets. The effects of carbonization temperature on some properties such as unit mass loss, pellet absorption, bulk density, unit density, gross calorific value and combustion rate, were significant at p = 0.05. But there were not significant differences between carbonization time and all properties of bamboo pellets. After being carbonized, the properties of bamboo pellets, such as pellet absorption, durability, fine, gross calorific value, combustion rate and heat release rate, were improved. All properties of carbonized pellets meet the requirement of the Pellet Fuels Institute Standard Specification for Residential/Commercial Densified and the gross calorific value also meets the minimum requirement for making commercial pellets of DIN 51731 (>17,500 J/g) even though the properties of carbonized pellets, such as bulk density, unit density and inorganic ash, had poor quality compared with untreated pellets.

The experiment studied the influence of types of extractants, the concentration of selected extractants, setting modules, operating time together with flow rates of feed and stripping solutions. The mathematical model used to predict the concentration of Pb(II) and Hg(II) in both feed and stripping solutions was developed based on chemical reactions. The results clearly showed that a double-module HFSLM can selectively separate Pb(II) and Hg(II) at a very low concentration. Optimum condition was achieved using 0.03M D2EHPA and 0.06M Aliquat 336 as the extractant for first and second modules. The flow rates of the feed and stripping solutions were 100mL/min. The complicated series of differential equations arising from the model was solved using the concept of Generating Function. The concentration of Pb(II) and Hg(II) in feed and stripping solutions, obtained from the model, fitted well with that from the experimental results as shown in Fig. 10. This indicated that the extraction and stripping reactions were important factors that governed the rate of Pb(II) and Hg(II) transport across the liquid membrane phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aequations 3alead 3aliquid membranes 3amathematical models 3amercury1 aPancharoen, Ura1 aThamphiphit, Nopphawat1 aLeepipatpiboon, Natchanun0 tJournal of membrane science.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 448 p.23-33dElsevier B.V.x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.07.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01919naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009300166300001600259520099800275592002801273650001401301650001601315650001101331650001601342650001201358700001701370700001701387773008501404856008401489990002301573852000901596655001201605IND60103932320221116212439.0141107e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010393232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Lifeng10aCrystalline transformation and photocatalytic performance of Bi₂O₃ by yttrium doping  ap. 372-375.  aY (yttrium)-doped Bi₂O₃ was prepared by the solvothermal synthesis method, followed by annealing at high temperature. With the increase of the annealing temperature, the crystalline phase transformed from Bi₂O₂CO₃ to β-Bi₂O₃, Bi₁₉YO₃₀, α-Bi₂O₃, and Bi₁₅YO₂₄; the morphology changed from irregular particles to thin sheets. The photoabsorptivity of these samples for visible light was strengthened compared with pure Bi₂O₃. Among them, the mixture of α-Bi₂O₃ and Bi₁₅YO₂₄ anneal at 600°C showed the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol under visible light irradiation (>420nm). The pseudo-first-order kinetics rates of photocatalytic reactions by using the samples prepared at 200–600°C were 0.014, 0.018, 0.0407, 0.079, and 0.0969min⁻¹. The improved photocatalytic activity and photoabsorptivity are ascribed to the modified electron structure, oxygen vacancy, and surface defect induced by Y-doping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3airradiation 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3ayttrium1 aDai, Yunrong1 aNiu, Junfeng0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 92 p.372-375dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.11.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008900170300001600259500001500275520114900290592002801439650001401467650002201481650002801503650002201531650002101553650001601574650002301590650001101613653001401624700001801638700001901656700003201675700002101707700002401728773008801752856008101840990002301921852000901944655001201953IND60108700020221119144312.0141108e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010870002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2012.10.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekhar, Praveen K.10aImpedance spectroscopy based characterization of an electrochemical propylene sensor  ap. 111-115.  a2019-12-04  aIn this investigation, an electrochemical mixed potential type gas sensor was characterized using impedance spectroscopy. Specifically, the effect of operating temperature (435–610°C) on sensor response and response time was studied. Propylene was used as the analyte to test the ‘La₀.₈Sr₀.₂CrO₃/YSZ/Pt’ sensor configuration. Two-electrode AC impedance measurement was performed with a frequency sweep from 13MHz down to 10mHz and excitation voltage of 10mV. For a fixed propylene concentration, the bulk and interfacial resistances was seen to decrease with increase in the sensor operating temperature. An Arrhenius behavior of the bulk and interfacial resistance was observed. The activation energy for O₂ ion conduction and charge transfer was found to be 0.94eV and 1.54eV respectively. For a 150°C rise in operating temperature from 485 to 585°C, a 26-fold improvement in response rise time was observed while an 82% reduction in sensor response was recorded. It is postulated that the increase in operating temperature results in faster reaction kinetics, faster oxygen reduction and greater heterogeneous catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3apropylene 3areaction kinetics 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aelectrochemistry 3atemperature 3acatalytic activity 3aoxygen 0aimpedance1 aSarraf, Hamid1 aMekonen, Hanna1 aMukundan, R.q(Rangachary),1 aBrosha, Eric.

The GPx, a major class of antioxidants involved in H₂O₂ and lipid hydroperoxides neutralization, showed an age- and sex-specific expression in many adult organs including the lung. High levels of androgens in the male lung are known to delay the surge of surfactant synthesis during gestation in several species. However, the impact of male androgens on antioxidant GPx early in life remains to be determined. The objective was to study the lung sex-specific expression of GPx during BALB/c mouse perinatal development. The mRNA expression of four seleno-dependent Gpx (Gpx1 to 4) in the lung of both sexes was characterized by real-time PCR from gestational day 15 to postnatal day 30, covering the entire canalicular, saccular and alveolar stages. Immunohistochemistry of GPx-1, -3 and -4, and seleno-dependent GPx enzymatic assays were also performed in the lung. We found a transient lower Gpx1 mRNA level in male than in female lungs during the first 5 days after birth, corresponding to the saccular phase. This dimorphic expression was concomitant to a sex difference in GPx enzymatic activity corrected for blood. It is, to our knowledge, the first report of a sex dimorphism for murine lung enzymatic antioxidant defenses during the perinatal period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aneutralization 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aandrogens 3aglutathione 3adimorphism 3amessenger RNA 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ahydrogen peroxide 3asurfactants 3agene expression 3amice 3aperinatal period 3aperoxidases 3apregnancy 3alungs 3aenzyme activity 3ablood 3ahydroperoxides 3aadults 0aantioxidants1 aBiafra, Jello,1 aSimard, Marc1 aTremblay, Yves1 aBilodeau, Jean-François0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2012 May 15, v. 355, no. 1 p.87-95dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01472naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009600168300001800264520034100282592002800623650002200651650002300673650002300696650002200719653002300741653002300764653001800787653001400805653002300819700002600842700002100868700001700889700002100906773008100927856008101008852000901089655001201098IND60109621920221118054247.0161018e20130610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010962192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2013.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaoua, Rachedine10aElectroactive 1,5-benzodiazepines bearing either a tetrathiafulvalene or a ferrocene moiety  ap. 4636-4640.  aThe synthesis of a series of electroactive 1,5-benzodiazepines bearing either a ferrocene or tetrathiafulvalene core, acting as the electroactive moiety, is reported.

Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have been attributed to the nitrone spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), commonly used in free radical analysis, but these aspects of DMPO have been little explored. In this study, we sought to establish the anti-inflammatory activity of DMPO, presumably by removing free radicals which otherwise help activate inflammatory response and damage cells. MAIN METHODS: RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS and/or DMPO for different time points, cell damage, production of inflammatory mediators, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, NF-κB p65 activation, phosphorylation of MAPKs and Akt, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined. KEY FINDINGS: After cells were treated with LPS and/or DMPO for 24h, DMPO reduced the LPS-induced inflammatory response as indicated by downregulated iNOS expression and production of inflammatory mediators. Accordingly, DMPO protected cells from LPS-induced cytotoxicity. In order to understand the mechanistic basis of these DMPO effects, the NF-κB p65 activation and the phosphorylation of MAPKs and Akt were examined. We found, by assaying cells treated with LPS and/or DMPO for 15–60min, that DMPO inhibited the phosphorylation of MAPKs, Akt, and IκBα, and reduced the NF-κB p65 translocation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DMPO inhibited LPS-induced ROS production.

Our proposed tulip-shaped design is thus a hybrid between the single-sideband (ssb) aperture, which blocks a full half-plane of the diffraction pattern, and the conventional (i.e. fully open) double-sideband (dsb) aperture. The benefits of this hybrid design include the fact that such an aperture allows one to obtain high-contrast images of weak-phase objects with the objective lens set to Scherzer defocus. We further demonstrate that such apertures can be fabricated from thin-foil materials by milling with a focused ion beam (FIB), and that such apertures are fully compatible with the requirements of imaging out to a resolution of at least 0.34nm. As is known from earlier work with single-sideband apertures, however, the edge of such an aperture can introduce unwanted, electrostatic phase shifts due to charging. The principal requirement for using such an aperture in a routine data-collection mode is thus to discover appropriate materials, protocols for fabrication and processing and conditions of use such that the hybrid aperture remains free of charging over long periods of time.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aelectron microscopy 3aelectrons 3aimage analysis 3amilling1 avan Laarhoven, Frank M.H.M.1 aSchmid, Andreas K.1 aCambie, Rossana1 aCabrini, Stefano1 aJin, Jian1 aGlaeser, Robert M.0 tUltramicroscopy.g2011 Dec., v. 111, no. 12 p.1688-1695dElsevier B.V.x0304-39917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.09.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011400168300001400282520127400296592002801570650001501598650001601613650002101629650002301650650001901673650001601692650001401708650001101722650001701733700001201750700001201762700001401774700001401788700001801802773010301820856008501923852000902008655001202017IND60101491320221119171738.0141106e20120930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010149132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Hongbo10aAdsorption of ofloxacin and norfloxacin on carbon nanotubes: Hydrophobicity- and structure-controlled process  ap. 89-96.  aAdsorption of antibiotics on solid particles is a key process controlling their fate in the subsurface. This study compared the adsorption of ofloxacin and norfloxacin (NOR) on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to evaluate the role of structural and hydrophobic properties in regulating their adsorption. A significant relationship was observed between single-point adsorption coefficients (Kd) and specific surface area (highly hydrophobic), but not between Kds and oxygen content. This result suggested that site-specific adsorption was not important but hydrophobic effect may have an important contribution to OFL and NOR adsorption on CNTs. However, normalizing the adsorption coefficients by OFL and NOR solubilities enlarged their adsorption difference indicating that hydrophobicity was not the only factor controlling the difference between OFL and NOR adsorption on CNTs. Their chemical structures show that both chemicals could interact with CNTs through an electron-donor–acceptor mechanism. This mechanism was correlated with the different adsorption of OFL and NOR on functionalized CNTs (namely hydroxylized, carboxylized, and graphitized CNTs). This study revealed that OFL and NOR adsorption was controlled by their both structural- and hydrophobic-properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical structure 3ahydrophobicity 3anorfloxacin 3aofloxacin 3aoxygen 3asurface area1 aPan, Bo1 aWu, Min1 aLiu, Ying1 aZhang, Di1 aXing, Baoshan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Sept. 30, v. 233-234 p.89-96dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.06.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245013600174300001800310520122800328592002801556650001501584650001001599650001101609650001101620700001301631700001601644773010801660856009001768990002301858852000901881655001201890IND60110960720221119071213.0141109e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011096072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaojun10aAnalysis of Superimposed Ultrasonic Guided Waves in Long Bones by the Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigen-matrices Algorithm  ap. 1704-1713.  aThe parameters of ultrasonic guided waves (GWs) are very sensitive to mechanical and structural changes in long cortical bones. However, it is a challenge to obtain the group velocity and other parameters of GWs because of the presence of mixed multiple modes. This paper proposes a blind identification algorithm using the joint approximate diagonalization of eigen-matrices (JADE) and applies it to the separation of superimposed GWs in long bones. For the simulation case, the velocity of the single mode was calculated after separation. A strong agreement was obtained between the estimated velocity and the theoretical expectation. For the experiments in bovine long bones, by using the calculated velocity and a theoretical model, the cortical thickness (CTh) was obtained. For comparison with the JADE approach, an adaptive Gaussian chirplet time-frequency (ACGTF) method was also used to estimate the CTh. The results showed that the mean error of the CTh acquired by the JADE approach was 4.3%, which was smaller than that of the ACGTF method (13.6%). This suggested that the JADE algorithm may be used to separate the superimposed GWs and that the JADE algorithm could potentially be used to evaluate long bones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abones 3acattle 3amodels1 aTa, Dean1 aWang, Weiqi0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2011 Oct., v. 37, no. 10 p.1704-1713dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2011.06.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01710naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245006200166300001600228520074400244592002800988650001301016650001801029650001301047650001401060650003301074650001601107650001101123700001701134700002001151773008501171856008401256990002301340852000901363655001201372IND60103932520221116212459.0141107e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010393252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.10.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jinshan14aThe formation of nanographites supported by SiC particles  ap. 379-381.  aNanostructured graphite flakes supported by SiC particles were prepared through a simple one-step pyrolysis of a polymer precursor.

This can lead to difficult problems of parameter determination. However, molecular networks give rise, through mass-action kinetics, to polynomial dynamical systems, whose steady states are zeros of a set of polynomial equations. These equations may be analysed by algebraic methods, in which parameters are treated as symbolic expressions whose numerical values do not have to be known in advance. For instance, an “invariant” of a network is a polynomial expression on selected state variables that vanishes in any steady state. Invariants have been found that encode key network properties and that discriminate between different network structures. Although invariants may be calculated by computational algebraic methods, such as Gröbner bases, these become computationally infeasible for biologically realistic networks. Here, we exploit Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) to develop an efficient procedure for calculating invariants that are linear combinations of “complexes”, or the monomials coming from mass action. We show how this procedure can be used in proving earlier results of Horn and Jackson and of Shinar and Feinberg for networks of deficiency at most one. We then apply our method to enzyme bifunctionality, including the bacterial EnvZ/OmpR osmolarity regulator and the mammalian 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase glycolytic regulator, whose networks have deficiencies up to four. We show that bifunctionality leads to different forms of concentration control that are robust to changes in initial conditions or total amounts. Finally, we outline a systematic procedure for using complex-linear invariants to analyse molecular networks of any deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aglycolysis 3amammals 3amathematical models 3aosmolarity 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGlycolysisxphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aMultienzyme Complexesxmetabolism 2aPhosphofructokinase-2xmetabolism 2aTrans-Activatorsxmetabolism1 aPérez Millán, Mercedes1 aDasgupta, Tathagata1 aDickenstein, Alicia1 aGunawardena, Jeremy0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2012 Oct. 21, v. 311 p.130-138dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.07.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008800166300001600254520083700270592002801107650002601135650002301161650001201184650001801196650001401214650002001228650001901248650001401267650001301281700001901294700001601313700001401329700001801343700001701361773009601378856008501474990002301559852000901582655001201591IND60100034620221120104438.0141105e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010003462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.03.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Iljae10aKetal containing amphiphilic block copolymer micelles as pH-sensitive drug carriers  ap. 259-266.  apH-Responsive linkages have been widely exploited in the development of polymeric drug delivery systems, which trigger drug release selectively at tumor tissues or endosomes and lysosomes of cells.

PKA-PEG copolymers self-assemble to form stable micelles with a mean diameter of ~175nm, which can encapsulate a payload of anticancer drugs and rapidly dissociate to release drug payload at the acid environment.

In contrast to previous studies, we employ an integrated framework combining a multisector general equilibrium model with a stochastic dominance analysis using household-level data. We consider three policy instruments in a domestic emission trading system: (i) an output-based allocation (OBA) of permits; (ii) the use of the proceeds of permit sales to reduce payroll taxes (RPT); (iii) and the use of these proceeds to reduce consumption taxes instead (UCS). The general equilibrium results suggest that the return to capital is more negatively affected than the wage rate in all simulations, since polluting industries are capital intensive. Abstracting from pollution externalities, the dominance analysis suggests that all three policies have a normatively robust negative (positive) impact on welfare (poverty). Formal dominance tests indicate that RPT first-order welfare dominates OBA over all values of household incomes. UCS also first-order poverty dominates RPT for any choice of poverty line below $CAN 18,600, and poverty dominates for any poverty line (and thus welfare dominates) at the second order. Finally, while the three pollution control policies do not have a numerically large impact on inequality (in comparison to the base run), statistical tests indicate that inequality increases significantly more with OBA and RPT than with UCS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3ahouseholds 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3apollution 3apollution control 3apoverty 3asales 3astatistical analysis 3astochastic processes 3ataxes1 aDissou, Yazid1 aDuclos, Jean-Yves0 tJournal of Environmental Economics and Management.g2011 Mar., v. 61, no. 2 p.227-243dElsevier Inc.x0095-06967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2010.12.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006600153245010800219300001600327520129300343592002801636650001301664650001201677650001101689650001801700650001801718650002001736650002001756650001101776650001101787650002601798650001401824650002501838650001101863653002601874653003701900653003701937653001901974773012301993856008802116852000902204655001202213IND60585781220221123033545.0201111e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058578122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerrano, Maria-Antonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1508-689310aContribution of sun exposure to the vitamin D dose received by various groups of the Spanish population  ap. 545-551.  aAlthough the harmful effects of excessive exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation are well known, the recommended dose of UV radiation is beneficial for the synthesis of vitamin D by the skin, in addition to being useful in the treatment of various illnesses and mental problems. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin D performs important functions in the human organism, such as absorbing calcium and phosphorous and contributing to the immune system, among others. Several studies have found that a high percentage of various groups of the Spanish population suffer from vitamin D deficiency, and since very few natural foods contain vitamin D, it was considered important to determine whether groups such as schoolchildren, outdoor workers and athletes, receive enough solar radiation to produce adequate levels of vitamin D in their daily activities. It was found that the amount of vitamin D (in IU) produced by personal effective solar UV doses could exceed the recommended dose of 1000IU/day in spring and summer, while the winter estimate (about 220IU/day) is only one quarter of the recommended dose. These results suggest that most people would not receive the recommended daily vitamin D dose in winter from exposure to solar UV radiation, the main source of vitamin D.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3acalcium 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3anatural foods 3aschool children 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3aultraviolet radiation 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency 3awinter 0aUltraviolet radiation 0aUltraviolet erythemal irradiance 0aUltraviolet vitamin D irradiance 0aVitamin D dose0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 619-620 p.545-551dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03844naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245009900162300001200261500001400273520225500287592002802542596005102570650001602621650002502637650001402662650001502676650001402691650002002705650001902725650001002744650002402754650002702778650001302805650001402818650001902832650001902851650003002870650001102900650001202911650001402923650001802937650001302955650001402968650002202982700002003004700002103024700005803045773010703103856008303210852000903293655001203302IND60715666120221122223258.0210210e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071566612DNAL7 a10.1186/s13007-020-00683-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Ying10aRapid, high efficiency virus-mediated mutant complementation and gene silencing in Antirrhinum  ap. 145.  aNAL-light  aBACKGROUND: Antirrhinum (snapdragon) species are models for genetic and evolutionary research but recalcitrant to genetic transformation, limiting use of transgenic methods for functional genomics. Transient gene expression from viral vectors and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) offer transformation-free alternatives. Here we investigate the utility of Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) for homologous gene expression in Antirrhinum and VIGS in Antirrhinum and its relative Misopates. RESULTS: A. majus proved highly susceptible to systemic TRV infection. TRV carrying part of the Phytoene Desaturase (PDS) gene triggered efficient PDS silencing, visible as tissue bleaching, providing a reporter for the extent and location of VIGS. VIGS was initiated most frequently in young seedlings, persisted into inflorescences and flowers and was not significantly affected by the orientation of the homologous sequence within the TRV genome. Its utility was further demonstrated by reducing expression of two developmental regulators that act either in the protoderm of young leaf primordia or in developing flowers. The effects of co-silencing PDS and the trichome-suppressing Hairy (H) gene from the same TRV genome showed that tissue bleaching provides a useful marker for VIGS of a second target gene acting in a different cell layer. The ability of TRV-encoded H protein to complement the h mutant phenotype was also tested. TRV carrying the native H coding sequence with PDS to report infection failed to complement h mutations and triggered VIGS of H in wild-type plants. However, a sequence with 43% synonymous substitutions encoding H protein, was able to complement the h mutant phenotype when expressed without a PDS VIGS reporter. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate an effective method for VIGS in the model genus Antirrhinum and its relative Misopates that works in vegetative and reproductive tissues. We also show that TRV can be used for complementation of a loss-of-function mutation in Antirrhinum. These methods make rapid tests of gene function possible in these species, which are difficult to transform genetically, and opens up the possibility of using additional cell biological and biochemical techniques that depend on transgene expression.  aPublisher supplied data  aPhD studentshipcThe Darwin Trust of Edinburgh 3aAntirrhinum 3aTobacco rattle virus 3ableaching 3acomplement 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agene silencing 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic transformation 3agenomics 3ainfection 3ainflorescences 3aleaf primordia 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amodels 3amutants 3aphenotype 3arapid methods 3aresearch 3aseedlings 3asequence homology1 aBukys, Alfredas1 aMolnár, Attila,1 aHudson, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9049-01000 tPlant methods.g2020 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.145-145dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4337304x1746-48117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13007-020-00683-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009900173300001600272520180500288592002802093650002202121650001102143650002702154650003002181650002502211650001602236650001002252650001002262650001902272650000902291650001102300650001802311650002802329650001502357650002102372650001602393650002202409650001502431651001002446653002302456653002202479653002802501700001602529700001402545700001802559700001402577773012302591856008802714852000902802655001202811IND60585781320221123024042.0201111e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058578132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mengmeng10aEcological effects and potential risks of the water diversion project in the Heihe River Basin  ap. 794-803.  aTo curb the severe ecological deterioration in the lower Heihe River Basin (HRB) in northwest China, a water diversion project was initiated in 2000. A comprehensive analysis of the ecological effects and potential risks associated with the project is needed. We assessed the hydrological and ecological achievements, and also analyzed the potential problems after the project was completed. We found that since the project began the hydrological regime has changed, with more than 57.82% of the upstream water being discharged to the lower reaches on average. As a result, the groundwater level in the lower reaches has risen; the terminal lake has gradually expanded to a maximum area in excess of 50km² since 2010, and there has been a significant recovery of vegetation in the riparian zone and the Ejin core oases, which represents the initial rehabilitation of the degraded downstream environment. Additionally, the economy of Ejin has developed spectacularly, with an annual growth rate of 28.06%. However, in the middle reaches, the average groundwater level has continuously declined by a total of 5.8m and significant degradation of the vegetation has occurred along the river course. The discrepancy in the water allocation between the middle and lower reaches has intensified. This highlights the inability of the current water diversion scheme to realize further ecological restoration and achieve sustainable development throughout the whole basin. In future water management programs, we recommend that water allocation is coordinated by considering the basin as an integrated entity and to scientifically determine the size of the midstream farmland and downstream oasis; restrict non-ecological water use in the lower reaches, and jointly dispatch the surface water and groundwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abasins 3aecological restoration 3aenvironmental degradation 3aenvironmental impact 3agroundwater 3alakes 3aoases 3ariparian areas 3arisk 3arivers 3asurface water 3asustainable development 3avegetation 3awater allocation 3awater table 3awater utilization 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aEcological effects 0aHeihe River Basin 0aWater diversion project1 aWang, Shuai1 aFu, Bojie1 aGao, Guangyao1 aShen, Qin0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 619-620 p.794-803dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012800163300001300291520121200304592002801516650001701544650001501561650002501576650002301601650001301624650001901637650002301656650001301679653001301692653001901705653001201724653001501736653001501751653001401766653002101780700001301801700001801814773008801832856008101920852000902001655001202010IND60528553020221118103452.0160716e20160530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052855302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.03.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xuwei10aGraphene/graphene oxide and their derivatives in the separation/isolation and preconcentration of protein species: A review  ap. 1-10.  aThe distinctive/unique electrical, chemical and optical properties make graphene/graphene oxide-based materials popular in the field of analytical chemistry.

In the present study, applying the linear relationship ε b– σ b to data obtained from field capacitance sensors resulted in strong positive autocorrelations between the residuals of that regression. We were able to derive an accurate offset of the relationship ε b–σ b and to estimate the evolution of σ ₚ over time by including a stochastic component to the linear model, rearranging it to a time-varying dynamic linear model (DLM), and using Kalman filtering and smoothing. The offset proved to vary for each depth in the same soil profile. A reason for this might be the changes in soil temperature along the soil profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3acapacitance 3aelectrical conductivity 3alinear models 3asoil profiles 3asoil temperature 0acapacitance sensor 0asoil dielectric 0atime-varying dynamic linear modelling (DLM) 0aKalman filtering 0aoffset 0apore water electrical conductivity1 aSànchez-Espigares, Jose A.1 aCañameras, Nuria1 aJosa, Ramon0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2015 Oct. 3, v. 60, no. 10 p.1828-1839dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2014.9320533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245012800207300001400335520197400349592002802323650002502351650001702376650001302393650001902406650002302425650002202448650002602470650001502496650003302511650001802544650001102562650001702573650001002590650001502600653002802615653003202643653004402675653003402719653002402753653004302777700002002820700001902840700002102859700002202880700002002902773008902922856008103011852000903092655001203101IND60528553120221118103615.0160716e20160530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052855312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlladio, Eugenio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9362-690710aApplication of multivariate statistics to the Steroidal Module of the Athlete Biological Passport: A proof of concept study  ap. 19-29.  aThe Technical Document TD2014EAAS was drafted by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in order to fight the spread of endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids (EAAS) misuse in several sport disciplines. In particular, adoption of the so-called Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) – Steroidal Module allowed control laboratories to identify anomalous EAAS concentrations within the athletes' physiological urinary steroidal profile. Gas chromatography (GC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS), indicated by WADA as an appropriate technique to detect urinary EAAS, was utilized in the present study to develop and fully-validate an analytical method for the determination of all EAAS markers specified in TD2014EAAS, plus two further markers hypothetically useful to reveal microbial degradation of the sample. In particular, testosterone, epitestosterone, androsterone, etiocholanolone, 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol, 5β-androstane-3α,17β-diol, dehydroepiandrosterone, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, were included in the analytical method. Afterwards, the multi-parametric feature of ABP profile was exploited to develop a robust approach for the detection of EAAS misuse, based on multivariate statistical analysis. In particular, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was combined with Hotelling T2 tests to explore the EAAS data obtained from 60 sequential urine samples collected from six volunteers, in comparison with a reference population of single urine samples collected from 96 volunteers. The new approach proved capable of identifying anomalous results, including (i) the recognition of samples extraneous to each of the individual urine series and (ii) the discrimination of the urine samples collected from individuals to whom “endogenous” steroids had been administrated with respect to the rest of the samples population. The proof-of-concept results presented in this study will need further extension and validation on a population of sport professionals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aandrosterone 3aathletes 3abiodegradation 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amultivariate analysis 3aprasterone 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprofessionals 3asports 3atestosterone 3aurine 3avolunteers 0aMultivariate statistics 0aAthlete Biological Passport 0aEndogenous anabolic androgenic steroids 0aPrincipal components analysis 0aHotelling's T2 test 0aGas chromatography–mass spectrometry1 aCaruso, Roberto1 aGerace, Enrico1 aAmante, Eleonora1 aSalomone, Alberto1 aVincenti, Marco0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 May 30, v. 922 p.19-29dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.03.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013200173300001600305520107900321592002801400650002101428650002401449650001801473650002701491650001501518650001301533650001201546650002301558650001101581653002701592653002301619653002101642653001301663653001501676653002201691700002101713773011301734856008601847852000901933655001201942IND60570379920221122024757.0180831e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057037992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.2012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaur, Rubia Zahid10aAnaerobic digestion of activated sludge, anaerobic granular sludge and cow dung with food waste for enhanced methane production  ap. 557-566.  aThe effect of inoculum [cow dung (CD), acclimatized anaerobic granular sludge (AAGS) and waste activated sludge (WAS)] on co-digestion of food waste (FW) was investigated in this study. Seven batch reactors were prepared using the different combinations of FW and inoculums and methane (CH4) generation was monitored for 30 d. Results suggested that inoculum type and combination cause significant effect on biomethanation process. The reactor with CD: AAGS: WAS: FW in 1:1:1:1 ratio showed the maximum CH4 generation (109 mL CH4 g⁻¹ VS removed). There was reduction in volatile solids (VS) (16.24–56.58%) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) (20.54–66.24%) during the AD process in all batch reactors. The results suggested that type and combination of inocula with FW was the prime factor in improving the co-digestion process. A combination of AAGS, CD and WAS with FW (1:1:1:1) appeared as the best co-digestion inocula for enhanced biomethanation process. Experimental results fits well with Gompertz and first order (FO) model for all waste combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3acattle manure 3achemical oxygen demand 3afood waste 3ainoculum 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 0aAnaerobic co-digestion 0aMethane generation 0aKinetic constant 0aInoculum 0aFood waste 0aGompertz equation1 aSuthar, Surindra0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 164 p.557-566dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.2013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245019200171300001400363520139800377592002801775650002101803650002901824650002701853650002301880650001201903650002001915650001701935650003501952650001001987650001201997650001502009650000902024650001702033650002802050650001302078650001102091653000802102653000802110653000802118653000902126653000902135653001202144653001102156653000802167653000802175653000802183653000902191653000802200653000802208653000902216653000702225653001502232653001402247653001102261653000802272653001402280653000902294653000802303653000902311653000802320653000702328653001102335653001802346653001502364653000802379653001502387653003102402653001802433653002602451653001802477653002902495653002602524700001902550773009202569856008502661852000902746655001202755IND60552066920221120181548.0161020e20140210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055206692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenisch, Feline14aThe bacterial Entner–Doudoroff pathway does not replace glycolysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to the lack of activity of iron–sulfur cluster enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase  ap. 45-55.  aReplacement of the glycolytic pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by a bacterial Entner–Doudoroff pathway (EDP) would result in lower ATP production and therefore a lower biomass yield is expected that would further allow higher products yields in the fermentation of sugars. To establish catabolism of glucose via the EDP in S. cerevisiae requires expression of only two additional enzyme activities, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (PGDH) and KDPG aldolase. In this work, KDPG aldolase from Escherichia coli could be successfully expressed in the yeast cytosol with very high enzyme activity. Nevertheless, simultaneous expression of KDPG aldolase and a codon optimized PGDH gene of E. coli could not replace glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway in growth experiments. It could be shown that this was due to the very low enzyme activity of PGDH. This bacterial enzyme is a [4Fe–4S] iron–sulfur cluster protein. Several attempts to improve the availability of iron–sulfur clusters or iron in the yeast cells, to attract the iron–sulfur cluster assembly machinery to Leu1-PGDH fusion proteins or to localize the PGDH in the mitochondria did not result in improved enzyme activities. From our results we conclude that establishing functional expression of iron–sulfur cluster enzymes will be a major task for the integration of the EDP and other biochemical pathways in yeast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abiomass production 3acytosol 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3airon 3amitochondria 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aproteins 3ayeasts 0aBSA 0aCAI 0aCIA 0aDAPI 0aDHAD 0aE. coli 0aEDA-Ec 0aEDP 0aEMP 0aGAP 0agDNA 0aISC 0aKDG 0aKDPG 0aLB 0amitoOptEDD 0aN. crassa 0aoptEDD 0aORF 0aP. putida 0aPGDH 0aPIC 0aPMSF 0aPPP 0aRT 0aRT-PCR 0aS. cerevisiae 0aSEM buffer 0aSEM 0aZ. mobilis 0aEntner–Doudoroff pathway 0aProduct yield 0aMetabolic engineering 0aKDPG aldolase 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0aIron–sulfur cluster1 aBoles, Eckhard0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2014 Feb. 10, v. 171 p.45-55dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03308naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245016300183520168200346592002802028650001502056650002502071650001802096650003302114650001502147650001502162650001602177650002302193650001802216650002302234650001102257650002402268650001902292650002502311650002102336650001702357650001702374650001502391650001902406650001802425653002502443653002102468653002202489653002302511653001902534700002502553773012202578856008102700852000902781655001202790IND60717070020221120072953.0211030e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071707002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1105102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Matheus Henrique Gouveia10aInfluence of rice protein hydrolysate on lipid oxidation stability and physico-chemical properties of linseed oil microparticles obtained through spray-drying  aIn recent years, the use of plant protein in various food applications is an increasing trend in the food industry. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of rice protein hydrolysate as an encapsulating material on lipid oxidation stability and the physico-chemical properties of linseed oil microparticles obtained through spray-drying. Rice protein isolate was hydrolyzed to an 8% degree of hydrolysis by the proteases Alcalase and Flavourzyme. Linseed oil was microencapsulated using protein hydrolysate or intact protein combined with maltodextrin. Sorption isotherms and glass transition temperature of microparticles were determined by the static gravimetric method and differential scanning calorimetry. Lipid oxidation stability of microparticles, evaluated by peroxide value, was carried out at 45 °C for 55 days. The sorption isotherms corresponded to the characteristics of BET II type isotherm and the GAB model was used to calculate thermodynamic properties of water adsorption. The monolayer moisture content values were between 3.76 and 4.96 g/100 g dry matter. Protein hydrolysates obtained by Alcalase and Flavourzyme did not significantly depress the glass transition temperature of microparticles (~98 °C and 103 °C, respectively) and did not change the structure of microparticles. On the contrary, the Alcalase protein hydrolysate improved the protection of the microparticles against lipid oxidation in approximately 95% when compared to the intact protein. This result can be due to the higher antioxidant capacity of Alcalase protein hydrolysate (3239 μmol TE/g protein) when compared to the intact protein (352 μmol TE/g protein).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3afood industry 3aglass transition temperature 3agravimetry 3ahydrolysis 3alinseed oil 3alipid peroxidation 3amaltodextrins 3amicroencapsulation 3amodels 3aoxidative stability 3aperoxide value 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aprotein isolates 3arice protein 3aspray drying 3asubtilisin 3athermodynamics 3awater content 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aGlass transition 0aSorption isotherm 0aMicroencapsulation 0aPeroxide value1 aKurozawa, Louise Emy0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 Mar., v. 139 p.110510-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.1105103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011900167300001500286500001500301520125000316592002801566650001701594650002001611650001601631650001701647650002001664650002501684650001101709650002501720650002201745650001201767650002301779650001001802650001901812650002501831650001501856650001101871650001501882653002101897653001201918653001901930653001601949653001701965653001401982700001701996700001702013773009902030856008502129852000902214655001202223IND60546516320221120211008.0160903e20140715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054651632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, M.P.10aPhosphorous and sulfur nutrition modulate antioxidant defenses in Myracrodruom urundeuva plants exposed to arsenic  ap. 97-104.  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated if plant nutrition and antioxidant system activation are correlated features of arsenic (As)-tolerance in Myracrodruom urundeuva. Plants were grown for 120 days in substrates with 0, 10, 50 and 100mg Askg−1 and its As-tolerance was demonstrated. As-concentrations greater than 10mgkg−1 decreased plant growth and photosynthesis but did not induce plant death. Plants coupled alterations in stomatal conductance and transpiration to avoid As-deleterious effects to the photosynthetic apparatus. As-toxicity in M. urundeuva was due to lipid peroxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide accumulation. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and gluthatione peroxidase (GPX) had central roles in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging in leaves, and their activities were linked to changes in redox potentials (ascorbate and glutathione pools). APX and GPX inactivation/degeneration led to H2O2 accumulation and related lipid peroxidation. Increased phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) concentrations in leaves were related to increased APX and GPX activities by stimulating increases in glutathione biosynthesis. We concluded that P and S nutrition were directly linked to As-tolerance in M. urundeuva plants by increasing antioxidant system activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant growth 3aredox potential 3aglutathione 3abiosynthesis 3aplant nutrition 3astomatal conductance 3asulfur 3aascorbate peroxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aarsenic 3alipid peroxidation 3adeath 3aphotosynthesis 3aantioxidant activity 3aperoxidase 3aleaves 3aphosphorus 0aPhytoremediation 0aEnzymes 0aTrace elements 0aGlutathione 0aantioxidants 0aAscorbate1 aSoares, A.M.1 aGarcia, Q.S.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2014 July 15, v. 276 p.97-104dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017900169300001400348520094800362592002801310650001701338650002201355650001201377650001701389650001801406653002501424653003101449653000901480653002101489700001901510700002401529773012801553856008501681852000901766655001201775IND60587175920221119160346.0171215e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058717592DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2017.13227372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehnam, Donya10aValue stream mapping approach and analytical network process to identify and prioritize production system’s Mudas (case study: natural fibre clothing manufacturing company)  ap. 64-72.  aThe current research has been done to identify and prioritize the Mudas of the production line of a natural fibre clothing manufacturing company; in this way, value stream mapping has been used to identify the Mudas, then analytical hierarchy method has been used to screen the Mudas.

The catalytic performance of MIL-88A series for degrading Orange gelb (OG) through persulfate activation were also tested at temperature of 25 °C and the results were shown in the following sequence: 85 °C/2 h > 65 °C/2 h > 105 °C/2 h > 65 °C/6 h > 65 °C/12 h. MIL-88A produced at the synthesis temperature of 85 °C and in the crystallization time of 2 h (85 °C/2 h) was the best one with a removal rate of 96.4% mainly due to high SBET and much greater leach-out of Fe. An optimal dosage (0.3 g L⁻¹) for MIL-88A in the MIL-88A/PS/OG system exists because of inhibition and promotion by fumaric acid. The filtrate experiment indicated that the catalytic activation involved heterogeneous reactions on the surface of the catalyst and homogeneous reactions in solutions. But the heterogeneous reaction occupied the principal position and the probable mechanism was obtained. Moreover, only solution pH < 4 could show a high degradation effect without the help of temperature. Comparing two different methods in the recycling experiment, the removal rate of OG decreased after the fourth run in both. Loss of active catalytic sites for Fe(iii) in MIL-88A in the process of separating and sampling was responsible for activity decay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoordination polymers 3acrystallization 3afiltrates 3afumaric acid 3airon 3apH 3arecycling 3atemperature1 aWan, Jinquan1 aMa, Yongwen1 aWang, Yan1 aPu, Mengjie1 aGuan, Zeyu0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 28, v. 6, no. 113 p.112502-112511dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra24429g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245008700209300002000296520128500316592002801601650001501629650002001644650001201664650001201676650001401688650001701702650000901719650001501728650001801743650003301761650002501794700001701819700001601836700005601852700001601908700005301924773011601977856008402093852000902177655001202186IND60678855820221116215856.0191218e20191120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067885582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b030802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Tae-hŭi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6570-257010aFree-Standing Ion-Conductive Gels Based on Polymerizable Imidazolium Ionic Liquids  ap. 16624-16629.  aA free-standing ion-conductive gel is formed by spontaneous self-assembly of the amphiphilic ionic liquid 1-tetradecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C₁₄MIm·Cl) and the cross-linkable monomer 6-hexanediol diacrylate (HDODA) in a mixed solvent of 1-octene, 1-butanol, and water. The ionic conductivity of this ion gel is 24 mS cm–¹ at 33 °C. To enhance the mechanical strength of the ion gels, the acrylate ionic liquid 1-(2-acryloyloxyundecyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide (A-C₁₁MIm·Br) was added, leading to significant morphological changes of the HDODA phase from spherical, ellipsoid, angular platelets to interconnected with increasing addition of the acrylate ionic liquid and consequent enhancement in the mechanical strength of the resulting ion gels. Small angle X-ray scattering data reveal that the ion gels are composed of bicontinuous phase. The formation of the anisotropic HDODA structures upon introduction of the acrylate ionic liquid was accompanied by a change of the bicontinuous phase to be undulated, which increased the ionic path through the formed film, resulting in reduced ionic conductivity. Such coaxial structured gels may be a promising route for developing highly ion-conductive as well as mechanically stable solid electrolyte systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3ablood platelets 3abromine 3abutanol 3achlorides 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3aimidazoles 3aionic liquids 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3astrength (mechanics)1 aChae, Hyunho1 aAhn, Yeonho1 aKim, Dukjoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6187-07371 aLee, Minjae1 aYi, Gi-Ra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1353-89880 tLangmuir.g2019 Nov. 20, v. 35, no. 50 p.16624-16629dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b030803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017500168300001600343520204700359592002802406650001202434650001902446650001302465650001002478650001302488650001802501650001102519650001102530650001402541650003002555650001202585651002102597651001102618651001402629651001602643653003202659653001102691653004002702653002202742653001002764653001402774700001502788773011902803856008402922852000903006655001203015IND60544961920221116231759.0160901e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054496192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Jungjae10aPollen-based temperature reconstructions from Jeju island, South Korea and its implication for coastal climate of East Asia during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene  ap. 445-457.  aWe derived statistically robust, Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares (WAPLS) transfer functions using modern surface pollen samples from Mt. Halla in Jeju Island, Korea. Pollen-based temperature reconstructions were performed by applying the best transfer function to lake sediments from Hanon maar paleolake in the southern part of Jeju Island. These quantitatively reconstructed temperatures were thereafter adjusted for the lack of warm analogue with the aid of Japanese and Russian transfer functions. Our temperature reconstructions demonstrated that annual mean temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) were ~8.5°C, i.e., about 8°C lower than the present, and that the Younger Dryas (YD) cooling amplitude was ~1.5°C between Bølling–Allerød (BA) (~11.3°C) and YD (~9.8°C). Spectral and wavelet analyses on detrended paleotemperatures identified significant periodicities at 1340years, primarily after 13,000calyr BP. The influence of Antarctic deglacial climate on the western North Pacific probably decreased with increasing northern latitude, as expected. Our results and Borneo oxygen isotope data showed very high correlation, indicating that Jeju Island was substantially influenced by the deglacial variabilities of the western Pacific warm pool via the Kuroshio Current. The climate of the study area seemed to have been mainly controlled by variation in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) before the beginning of the last deglaciation and subsequently by variation in the Western Tropical Pacific (WTP) Sea Surface Temperature (SST). We present significant information on the correlation of the late Pleistocene climate change with the Greenland oxygen isotope data and western North Pacific SST records. This correlation bridges the gap between terrestrial records, which mostly show AMOC variability, and oceanic records, which show WTP variability. These study results will increase our understanding of regional-scale climate change during the late Pleistocene and Early Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aisotopes 3alakes 3alatitude 3aleast squares 3aoxygen 3apollen 3asediments 3asurface water temperature 3awavelet 3aAntarctic region 3aBorneo 3aGreenland 3aSouth Korea 0aTemperature reconstructions 0aPollen 0aLate Pleistocene and early Holocene 0aLast deglaciation 0aKorea 0aEast Asia1 aPark, Jina0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 417 p.445-457dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011700169300002000286520135500306592002801661650001101689650001101700650001701711650001901728650000901747650000901756650001201765650001301777650001801790650001301808650001501821650001301836650001601849700001701865700006101882700006201943773011602005856008402121852000902205655001202214IND60678855920221116220417.0191218e20191205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067885592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b031922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLapp, Aliya S.10aCombined Experimental and Theoretical Study of the Structure of AuPt Nanoparticles Prepared by Galvanic Exchange  ap. 16496-16507.  aIn this article, experiment and theory are combined to analyze Pb and Cu underpotential deposition (UPD) on ∼1.7 nm Au nanoparticles (NPs) and the AuPt structures that result after galvanic exchange (GE) of the UPD layer for Pt. Experimental Pb (0.49 ML) and Pt (0.50 ML) coverages are close to values predicted by density functional theory-molecular dynamics (DFT-MD, 0.59 ML). DFT-MD reveals that the AuNPs spontaneously reconstruct from cuboctahedral to a (111)-like structure prior to UPD. In the case of Pb, this results in the random electrodeposition of Pb onto the Au surface. This mechanism is a consequence of opposing trends in Pb–Pb and Pb–Au coordination numbers as a function of Pb coverage. Cu UPD is more complex, and agreement between theory and experiment takes into account ligand effects (e.g., SO₄²– present as the electrolyte) and the electric double layer. Importantly, AuPt structures formed upon Pt GE are found to differ markedly depending on the UPD metal. Specifically, cyclic voltammetry indicates that the Pt coverage is ∼0.20 ML greater for Cu UPD/Pt GE (0.70 ML) than for Pb UPD/Pt GE (0.50 ML). This difference is corroborated by DFT-MD theoretical predictions. Finally, DFT-MD calculations predict the formation of surface alloy and core@shell structures for Pb UPD/Pt GE and Cu UPD/Pt GE, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3acopper 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroplating 3agold 3alead 3aligands 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aplatinum 3aprediction 3asulfates 3avoltammetry1 aDuan, Zhiyao1 aHenkelman, Graeme1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0336-71531 aCrooks, Richard M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5186-48780 tLangmuir.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 35, no. 50 p.16496-16507dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b031923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245005300210300001600263506007600279520077600355592002801131506003701159650001201196650001301208650001501221650001601236650001401252650001101266650001401277653002301291653001501314653001201329653001301341773010901354856008201463852000901545655001201554IND60591465720221207122713.0180904e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059146572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2016.07.0012doi7 aPMC51209862pmcid7 a274501112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarillà, Daniela10aDriving Apart and Segregating Genomes in Archaea  ap. 957-967.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome segregation is a fundamental biological process in organisms from all domains of life. How this stage of the cell cycle unfolds in Eukarya has been clearly defined and considerable progress has been made to unravel chromosome partition in Bacteria. The picture is still elusive in Archaea. The lineages of this domain exhibit different cell-cycle lifestyles and wide-ranging chromosome copy numbers, fluctuating from 1 up to 55. This plurality of patterns suggests that a variety of mechanisms might underpin disentangling and delivery of DNA molecules to daughter cells.

In this study, the effect of wettability on electrochemical impedance was experimentally investigated to obtain a better understanding of the effective wetting area. We demonstrate that the water contact angle decreases significantly at hydrophilic surfaces with denser nano/microstructures. Based on the analysis of equivalent electrical circuits, we found that the electrochemical impedance decreases with reducing the water contact angle, showing a dependence on the effective wetting area, i.e., the real solid–liquid contact area. Also, the charge transfer resistance at low frequency was found to be the dominant parameter to estimate the effective wetting area at the solid–liquid interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectronic circuits 3ahydrophilicity 3aliquid-solid interface 3amicrostructure 3awettability1 aNagayama, Gyoko0 tLangmuir.g2019 Nov. 22, v. 35, no. 50 p.16508-16513dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b033493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009200164300001600256520188000272592002802152650001502180650002802195650001102223650001402234650001002248650002102258650001102279650001702290650001802307650002102325650001802346650001002364650001202374650001702386650001602403650001002419650003102429653001702460653001202477653001802489653002002507653002502527653000902552653000702561653000802568700001502576700001202591700001702603773012802620856005102748852000902799655001202808IND50087670120221119105056.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008767012DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2011.6078312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, S.,10aInfluence of soil pH on NOx and N2O emissions from bovine urine applied to soil columns  ap. 285-301.  aThe nitrous oxide (N₂O) molecule is both a greenhouse gas and a precursor to the formation of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere, which is subsequently involved in catalytic destruction of ozone (O₃). Tropospheric NO can form NO₂ with both gases (NOₓ) able to react with volatile organic compounds to produce the detrimental O₃ molecule. Information on how NO and N₂O emissions respond to agricultural management is lacking. Limited data suggest N₂O emissions following bovine urine deposition may vary with soil pH. This work hypothesised that soil liming would also reduce NOₓ emissions due to enhanced nitrification and reduced opportunity for HNO₂ formation as soil pH increased. Bovine urine was applied (575 kg N/ha) to repacked soil cores (34% water-filled pore space) that ranged in pH from 4.4 to 7.6, and these were maintained at 21°C. With the exception of the pH 4.4 treatment, increases in NO–N fluxes occurred during the first 11 days, when nitrification was proceeding. Increasing the initial soil pH enhanced the net ammonium depletion rate. The loss of NO–N, expressed as a percentage of the net ammonium depletion rate, decreased with increasing initial pH during this first 11 days with NO–N fluxes reduced due to competition between abiotic and biological demands for . After 21 days, the optimal pH for the net NO–N flux was observed to be 5.7 to 6.0. However, cumulative NO–N fluxes after 35 days showed little variation due to initial soil pH and ranged from 0.02 to 0.05% of urine–N applied. The cumulative N₂O–N flux ranged from 0.04 to 0.09% of urine–N applied with a linear increase from pH 5.7 to pH 7.6. Based on these results, where soils are relatively dry, liming acid soils from pH 5.5 to pH 6.5 will not affect cumulative NO fluxes from urine patches. However, cumulative N₂O fluxes may be enhanced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid soils 3aagricultural management 3acattle 3aemissions 3agases 3agreenhouse gases 3aliming 3anitric oxide 3anitrification 3anitrogen dioxide 3anitrous oxide 3aozone 3asoil pH 3astratosphere 3atroposphere 3aurine 3avolatile organic compounds 0abovine urine 0asoil pH 0anitrification 0adenitrification 0achemodenitrification 0aHNO2 0aNO 0aN2O1 aClough, TJ1 aGoh, KM1 aSherlock, RR0 tNew Zealand journal of agricultural research.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 54, no. 4 p.285-301dTaylor & Francis Groupx1175-87757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2011.607831  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245005800169300001400227520085500241592002801096650001201124650001801136650002601154650002201180650001401202650002001216650001001236653002301246653001701269653001001286653002201296700001501318700001301333700001401346773012801360856008501488852000901573655001201582IND60587176220221119160351.0171215e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058717622DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2017.13296452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Shuang13aAn improved viscoelastic model for tufted carpet yarn  ap. 85-91.  aTo overcome the problem that the existing mathematical model cannot characterize the viscoelastic properties of tufted carpet yarn completely and accurately, an improved viscoelastic model is built using the semi-empirical method.

The results show that compared with the standard linear model, the improved model is more suitable to characterize viscoelastic mechanical properties of tufted carpet yarns, such as the creep and stress relaxation properties, which provides a solid theoretical foundation for analysis of vibration characteristics and dynamic tension control of tufted carpet yarn.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3alinear models 3amechanical properties 3astress relaxation 3avibration 3aviscoelasticity 3ayarns 0aTufted carpet yarn 0aviscoelastic 0acreep 0astress relaxation1 aChi, Xinfu1 aXu, Yang1 aSun, Yize0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 109, no. 1 p.85-91dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2017.13296453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009800168300002000266520181800286592002802104650001202132650002402144650001402168650001602182650002202198650001402220650001402234650002602248650001202274650002002286650002602306650001502332650000902347650001102356650001502367650002302382650001502405651001402420700002102434700002602455700002402481700002002505700001702525700002302542700001602565700002302581700002402604700002302628700002602651700002702677773013802704856008102842852000902923655001202932IND60091426520221116232613.0150131e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009142652DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3235-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, Philip D.13aAn assessment of endocrine activity in Australian rivers using chemical and in vitro analyses  ap. 12951-12967.  aStudies on endocrine disruption in Australia have mainly focused on wastewater effluents. Limited knowledge exists regarding the relative contribution of different potential sources of endocrine active compounds (EACs) to the aquatic environment (e.g., pesticide run-off, animal farming operations, urban stormwater, industrial inputs). In this study, 73 river sites across mainland Australia were sampled quarterly for 1 year. Concentrations of 14 known EACs including natural and synthetic hormones and industrial compounds were quantified by chemical analysis. EACs were detected in 88 % of samples (250 of 285) with limits of quantification (LOQ) ranging from 0.05 to 20 ng/l. Bisphenol A (BPA; LOQ = 20 ng/l) was the most frequently detected EAC (66 %) and its predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) was exceeded 24 times. The most common hormone was estrone, detected in 28 % of samples (LOQ = 1 ng/l), and the PNEC was also exceeded 24 times. 17α-Ethinylestradiol (LOQ = 0.05 ng/l) was detected in 10 % of samples at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.17 ng/l. It was detected in many samples with no wastewater influence, and the PNEC was exceeded 13 times. In parallel to the chemical analysis, endocrine activity was assessed using a battery of CALUX bioassays. Estrogenic activity was detected in 19 % (53 of 285) of samples (LOQ = 0.1 ng/l 17β-estradiol equivalent; EEQ). Seven samples exhibited estrogenic activity (1–6.5 ng/l EEQ) greater than the PNEC for 17β-estradiol. Anti-progestagenic activity was detected in 16 % of samples (LOQ = 8 ng/l mifepristone equivalents; MifEQ), but the causative compounds are unknown. With several compounds and endocrine activity exceeding PNEC values, there is potential risk to the Australian freshwater ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aaquatic environment 3abioassays 3abisphenol A 3achemical analysis 3aeffluents 3aestradiol 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrone 3afarming systems 3afreshwater ecosystems 3apesticides 3arisk 3arivers 3astormwater 3asynthetic hormones 3awastewater 3aAustralia1 aBartkow, Michael1 aBlockwell, Stephen J.1 aColeman, Heather M.1 aKhan, Stuart J.1 aLim, Richard1 aMcDonald, James A.1 aNice, Helen1 aNugegoda, Dayanthi1 aPettigrove, Vincent1 aTremblay, Louis A.1 aWarne, Michael St. J.1 aLeusch, Frederic D.

The phase formation and structural properties were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction. The XRD results and SEM images show that the Y³⁺ can be substituted by Tb³⁺ for the max content of x = 1.5 and the most suitable sintering temperature is about 1500 °C. The PLE spectra of Y₄₋ₓSiAlO₈N:xTb³⁺ phosphors exhibit a wide excitation band ranging from 200 to 500 nm, which matches well with the characteristic emission of n-UV chips. Under excitation of 380 nm, the phosphor shows four intense emission bands with emission peaks at 488 nm, 543 nm, 585 nm and 624 nm, respectively. These emissions were attributed to the characteristic ⁵D₄ → ⁷FJ (J = 6, 5, 4, 3) transitions of Tb³⁺ ions. The optimum doping concentration of Tb³⁺ was found to be x = 2.0 which indicated that the concentration quenching effect in the Y₄₋ₓSiAlO₈N:xTb³⁺ phosphor is very weak. The critical distance for the Tb³⁺ ions calculated by the concentration quenching is 3.64 Å. The detailed nonradiative energy transfer mechanism between Tb³⁺ ions is confirmed to be via a dipole–dipole interaction by the fluorescence decay analysis. Furthermore, with the introduction of Tb³⁺ ions, the reflectance spectra shows an obvious increment of reflectance in the region of 200–250 nm, which is due to the variation of electronic structure in the conductance band derived from Y³⁺ ions. Finally, the excellent thermal stability of the phosphors was demonstrated by the temperature dependence of the PL spectra. Compared to the initial intensity at room temperature (293.0 K), the relative PL intensity maintains high value of 96.5% at 475.2 K. The detailed thermal quenching behavior has also been interpreted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aemissions 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aions 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aterbium 3athermal stability 3ayttrium1 aZhang, Dawei1 aMa, Hongping1 aDeng, Degang1 aXu, Shiqing0 tRSC advances.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 6, no. 114 p.113249-113259dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra24438f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01967naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012400166300001600290520065800306592002800964650002600992650002201018650001401040650001301054650001201067650001101079650001301090650001701103650001001120650001001130651001601140653001401156653001501170653002101185653001801206653002601224653002201250700001801272700001501290700001601305773012801321856005101449852000901500655001201509IND50087670220221119105034.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008767022DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2011.6086862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatchett, B10aEffects of loline-producing endophyte-infected meadow fescue ecotypes on New Zealand grass grub (Costelytra zealandica)  ap. 303-313.  aLoline alkaloids produced by endophyte-infected meadow fescue were high (>1000 µg/g) in roots. The larvae of New Zealand grass grub are major subterranean pasture pests. In laboratory and field studies, grass grub larvae feeding on roots of endophyte-infected meadow fescue containing lolines at concentrations >450 µg/g either lost weight or gained less weight than the corresponding controls feeding on endophyte-free or low-loline meadow fescue. These results demonstrate that loline alkaloids in roots of meadow fescue have the potential to deter grass grub larvae from feeding and could contribute to control of this pest in a sustainable manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCostelytra zealandica 3aFestuca pratensis 3aalkaloids 3aecotypes 3agrasses 3alarvae 3apastures 3apest control 3apests 3aroots 3aNew Zealand 0aendophyte 0agrass grub 0aloline alkaloids 0ameadow fescue 0aCostelytra zealandica 0aFestuca pratensis1 aGooneratne, R1 aChapman, B1 aFletcher, L0 tNew Zealand journal of agricultural research.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 54, no. 4 p.303-313dTaylor & Francis Groupx1175-87757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2011.608686  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012900167300001400296520106800310592002801378650002401406650003701430650001201467650001901479650001801498650001301516650001501529650003301544650002101577650001101598650002101609650002901630650000901659650001501668653001501683653001801698653002401716653002101740653001801761700002401779700001701803773012801820856008501948852000902033655001202042IND60587176320221119160732.0171215e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058717632DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2017.13296462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorouzi, N.10aReducing drag force on polyester fabric through superhydrophobic surface via nano-pretreatment and water repellent finishing  ap. 92-97.  aEnergy saving is a very important factor for athletics that works in high speed and award winning competition. Drag force is of prime importance for determining the speed of objects that moves in the fluid. Nanotechnology is of great potential among the methods for reducing drag force. Enhancing the fabric speed in the fluids could be achieved using superhydrophobic surfaces to reduce the drag force. A simple and versatile method was utilized for the fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces via pad-dry-cure and in situ synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles as a pre-treatment. The treated samples were examined by SEM for assessing the structure and size of nanoparticles and mapping and EDX analysis was carried out for further characterization. A novel method was designed based on the tensile tester apparatus for studying the changes in drag force. The results indicated a reduction of 80% in drag force of the treated fabric in the optimum conditions of pre-treatment with 10% zinc nitrate (Zn(NO ₃) ₂) and 5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 130 °C for 1 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afabrics 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoparticles 3anitrates 3apolyesters 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3asports 3atextile finishes 3awater repellent finishes 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aDrag force 0ananoparticles 0asuperhydrophobicity 0aair permeability 0aenergy saving1 aGharehaghaji, A.

Herein, the design and fabrication of a heterogeneous catalyst with an ultrathin CeO₂ overlayer via atomic layer deposition (ALD) on Pt electrodes for low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs) is reported. The cell with a CeO₂-overcoated (five ALD cycles) Pt cathode shows lower activation resistance by 50% after a 10 h operation and higher thermal stability by a factor of 2 compared with the cell with a Pt-only cathode, which is known to be the best single catalyst at 450 °C. Eventually, a thin-film SOFC with a highly active and stable CeO₂-overcoated cathode based on an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) substrate demonstrates a high peak power density of 800 mW cm–² at 500 °C, which is the highest performance ever reported for an AAO-based SOFC at this temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3aceric oxide 3aenergy conversion 3afilms (materials) 3afuel cells 3aplatinum 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0asolid oxide fuel cell 0athin-film solid oxide fuel cell 0aoxygen reduction reaction 0aatomic layer deposition 0acerium oxide1 aOh, Seongkook1 aLee, Sungje1 aYu, Jin-Geun1 aPark, Joonsuk1 aGo, Dohyun1 aYang, Byung Chan1 aKim, Hyong June1 aAn, Jihwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7697-99350 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 07, v. 11, no. 50 p.46651-46657dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b105723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245009500164300002000259520042100279592002800700650003600728650002300764650002300787650001100810650001200821700002400833700002900857700002000886700002000906773013600926856007401062852000901136655001201145IND60660720220221122221853.0190827e20141014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066072022DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc06522k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyall, Catherine L.10aDirect core functionalisation of naphthalenediimides by iridium catalysed C–H borylation  ap. 13837-13840.  aWe report the first boron-substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs), prepared by iridium catalysed C–H activation.

In order to know whether N₂ fixers could invest fixed N₂ in extracellular phosphatase production and could stimulate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to acquire soil P in N-rich subtropical China, an open-air greenhouse experiment was carried out. Two N₂ fixers (Acacia mangium and Ormosia pinnata) and two non-N₂ fixers (Schima superba and Pinus massoniana) were exposed to three levels of N addition: 5.6 kg ha⁻¹ a⁻¹ (ambient N), 15.6 kg ha⁻¹ a⁻¹ (middle N), and 20.6 kg ha⁻¹ a⁻¹ (high N). We found that the capacity of plants to acquire soil P in N-rich subtropical China is species specific. The higher P uptake rates were found for N₂ fixers than non-N₂ fixers under N addition, which were related to the greater soil APA and higher AMF (p < 0.01) in the soil of N₂ fixers. However, with time, high N addition decreased more significant quantities of soil microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) in the soil of N₂ fixers than that of non-N₂ fixers (p < 0.05). We conclude that N₂ fixers have higher P uptake capacity than non-N₂ fixers under ambient N deposition in subtropical China. However, continuing N deposition in the future might affect P uptake ability of N₂ fixers as high N addition would decrease soil microbial PLFAs of N₂ fixers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia mangium 3aOrmosia 3aPinus massoniana 3aSchima superba 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aphosphorus 3asoil 3atrees 3aChina1 aLi, Yiyong1 aXu, Yue1 aLiu, Shuange1 aHuang, Wenjuan1 aFang, Xiong1 aYin, Guangcai0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Aug., v. 24, no. 24 p.20005-20014dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9633-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016100166520176800327592002802095650001002123650002102133650001302154650002202167650001602189650001302205650001802218650001902236650001302255650001002268650002002278650001502298650001102313650001202324650002102336650001902357650001702376653001102393653000802404653000802412653001102420653000802431653001202439653001002451653001302461653001002474653000902484653000702493653000702500653000702507653002202514653001302536653003402549653002102583653003102604700002102635700002202656700002302678700001902701773009802720856008202818852000902900655001202909IND60765934520221120135542.0220719e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076593452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1203552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawashita, Eri10aEndothelial group IVA phospholipase A2 promotes hepatic fibrosis with sinusoidal capillarization in the early stage of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice  aNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by steatosis, inflammatory responses and fibrosis. Our previous studies provided evidence that group IVA phospholipase A₂ (IVA-PLA₂), a key PLA₂ isozyme in the arachidonic acid cascade, is involved in the development of NASH. However, which types of cells are critical for the IVA-PLA₂-dependent onset and progression of NASH is unclear. We elucidated the effects of the cell-type-specific deficiency of IVA-PLA₂ in mice on the development of NASH. Cell-type-specific IVA-PLA₂-conditional knockout (cKO) mice and littermate controls were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino-acid-defined, high-fat diet with 0.1% methionine as a NASH model. The degree of hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by staining with picric acid-Sirius red, and the number of activated hepatic stellate cells was determined by immunoblotting and immunostaining for α-smooth muscle actin. Sinusoidal capillarization was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The deposition of collagen and number of activated hepatic stellate cells were markedly reduced in endothelial cell/liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (EC/LSEC)-specific IVA-PLA₂ cKO mice but not in hepatocyte-, monocyte/macrophage-, or hepatic stellate cell-specific IVA-PLA₂ cKO mice. In addition, EC/LSEC-specific IVA-PLA₂-deficient mice showed more fenestrae than control mice fed a CDAHFD, indicating suppression of sinusoidal capillarization. These results suggest that ECs/LSECs contribute to the IVA-PLA₂-dependent onset and/or progression of NASH. Endothelial IVA-PLA₂ is a promising factor for promoting sinusoidal capillarization and the ensuing HSC activation and fibrosis; thus IVA-PLA₂ in ECs/LSECs is a potential therapeutic target for NASH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aarachidonic acid 3acollagen 3aendothelial cells 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3ahigh fat diet 3aimmunoblotting 3aisozymes 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amethionine 3amodels 3amuscles 3aphospholipase A2 3aphospholipases 3atherapeutics 0aα-SMA 0aALT 0aAST 0aCDAHFD 0acKO 0aEC/LSEC 0aGAPDH 0aIVA-PLA2 0aNAFLD 0aNASH 0aND 0aPG 0aTG 0aEndothelial cells 0aFibrosis 0aNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis 0aPhospholipase A2 0aSinusoidal capillarization1 aOzaki, Takeyoshi1 aIshihara, Keiichi1 aKashiwada, Chihiro1 aAkiba, Satoshi0 tLife sciences.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 294 p.120355-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.1203553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04330naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100001100189245013100200506007600331520203000407592002802437506003702465650002202502650002802524650001202552650001302564650001302577650001502590650001202605650002602617650002402643650003302667650001702700650001102717650001802728650001902746650001502765650001002780650002102790650001002811650001402821650005202835650001302887650002002900650001702920653004302937653002402980653002603004653001303030653002303043653001003066653001003076653001103086653000703097653000703104653000703111653000803118653000803126653000803134700001403142700001603156700006103172700005903233700006403292773012403356856008303480852000903563655001203572IND60685624320221207085011.0220404e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068562432DNAL7 aPMC71610932pmcid7 a321262762pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.1033602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Zi10aHeterogeneous expression of the ammonium transporter AgAmt in chemosensory appendages of the malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmmonia is one of the principal kairomones originating from human and other animal emanations and in that context, plays an essential role in the host-seeking behaviors of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Nevertheless, despite its importance in directing host-seeking, the mechanisms underlying ammonia detection in the mosquito olfactory system remains largely unknown. In addition to ongoing efforts to identify and characterize the molecular receptors that underlie ammonia sensitivity, previous studies have revealed a prominent role for ammonium transporters (Amt) in modulating antennal and behavioral responses in Drosophila melanogaster and An. gambiae. In the former, localization of DmAmt in antennal sensilla to auxiliary cells surrounding the ammonia sensory neurons led to the hypothesis that its role was to clear excess ammonium ions in the sensillar lymph. In the latter, RT-PCR and heterologous expression have been used to examine the expression and functional characteristics of the An. gambiae ammonium transporter, AgAmt. We now employ advanced transgenic tools to comprehensively examine AgAmt spatial localization across the peripheral chemosensory appendages in larvae and adult female An. gambiae. In the larval antennae, AgAmt appears localized in both neuronal and auxiliary cells. In contrast to D. melanogaster, in the adult antennae, AgAmt-derived signals are observed in both non-neuronal auxiliary cells and in sensory neurons in ammonia-responsive basiconic and coeloconic sensilla. In the maxillary palps, labella, and tarsi, AgAmt appears restricted to sensory neurons. We have also characterized the responses to ammonia of adult antennal coeloconic sensilla and maxillary palp capitate pegs revealing a correlation between sensillar AgAmt expression and ammonia sensitivity. Taken together, these data suggest that AgAmt may play heterogeneous roles in the adult and larval chemosensory apparatus and potentially broad utility as a supra-receptor target in mosquito control.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aammonia 3aammonium 3aantennae 3aappendages 3afemales 3afunctional properties 3agenetic engineering 3aheterologous gene expression 3ahost seeking 3aimagos 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect vectors 3akairomones 3alymph 3amosquito control 3apalps 3areceptors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asensilla 3asensory neurons 3atransporters 0aAnopheles gambiae ammonium transporter 0aChemosensory system 0aCellular organization 0aQ system 0aphiC31 integration 0aAgAmt 0aDmAmt 0aAgAmtP 0aIR 0aOR 0aGR 0aORN 0aIRN 0aOSN1 aLiu, Feng1 aSun, Huahua1 aBarker, Mackenzie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1808-72821 aPitts, R.

However, their ability to coexist in the crowns of the same trees during the shoot-feeding phase has not been elucidated. In our study, we investigated and compared the shoot-feeding ecology of the three species of pine shoot beetle in P. yunnanensis in Anning County, Yunnan Province. Shoot-feeding by T. yunnanensis, T. minor, and T. brevipilosus initiated in April, May, and June, and ended in February, April, and May, respectively. Individual T. yunnanensis and T. minor adults fed in shoots for about seven months, and T. brevipilosus for nine months, before initiating reproduction. All three Tomicus species fed in the current-year shoots close to the apical bud. No specific overwintering behavior was observed prior to reproduction. The entrance hole of T. yunnanensis was furthest away from the apical bud, and T. minor was the closest to the apical bud. Differences in the spatial distribution of these shoot-feeding sites might reduce competition among the three beetle species.

For longer nerve gaps and multiple injury sites, it is essential to use nerve guidance conduits for healthy pathfinding of regenerating axons. Here, extracellular matrix mimetic peptide nanofiber hydrogels were used for functionalizing guidance conduits to enhance neuronal regeneration in the distal stump of full transaction sciatic nerve injury in rats with functional repair. Conduits filled with heparan sulfate and laminin mimetic peptide nanofibers significantly improved electromyography response and promoted neuronal regeneration in a rat model of sciatic nerve defect. In addition, Schwann cells cultured on these nanofibers showed increased viability and significantly enhanced nerve growth factor (NGF) release.

Four types of EPS with different molecular composition from Lactobacillus rhamnosus ZFM231 were identified. In this work, we evaluated the potential of EPS on human gut microbiota by in vitro fermentation model. It was found that purified EPS fractions were degraded effectively by human gut microbiota. Gas chromatography (GC) assay revealed that EPS could be fermented to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut microbiota in human fecal samples from twelve healthy volunteers. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that EPS mainly increased the abundance of Ruminococcus, Dorea, Butyricicoccus, Blautia and others.

These records were also used to evaluate beetle sampling efficiency by comparing collected beetles to historic county records and to identify limitations of wasp-mediated sampling in study areas. Overall, 1,530 beetles representing three families and 44 beetle species were collected from C. fumipennis. Five of these species (Agrilus cuprescens (Ménétriés) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), A. pensus Horn, Buprestis nutalli Kirby, Chrysobothris scabripennis Gory and Laporte, Dicerca pugionata (Germar)) were new prey records for C. fumipennis. The wasps exhibited a strong preference for larger beetle genera (e.g., Dicerca, Buprestis), which accounted for 68% of beetles caught. Agrilus and Chrysobothris were the next dominant genera, accounting for 16% and 11%, respectively. A 4–19 mm prey size range is proposed, as all beetles collected were within this range despite the availability of prey outside of this range. Cerceris fumipennis caught 43% of the 42 buprestids species present in museum records from the four census counties as well as an additional 23 buprestid species that were not represented in museum records. Of the 22 buprestid species identified in museum collections that were not caught by C. fumipennis in the census counties, only one was within the proposed size range and active during the C. fumipennis flight season (late June through August). Overall, sampling C. fumipennis colonies over two summers at five sites resulted in 32% of the recorded buprestid species in New York State being caught, indicating that monitoring colonies is an efficient and viable means of quantifying buprestid assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrilus cuprescens 3aBuprestis 3aCerceris 3aChrysobothris 3aflight 3amonitoring 3amorphometry 3asummer 3aNew York 0abiomonitoring 0abiosurveillance 0aCrabronidae 0ainsect museum collections 0anest provisioning 0awasp foraging behavior1 aFierke, Melissa K.0 tJournal of insect science .g2014 Jan., v. 14, no. 4 p.1-18dUniversity of Wisconsin Libraryx1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673%2F031.014.043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245007500161300001800236520114700254592002801401650001501429650001501444650001901459650001901478650001401497650001301511650001701524650001901541650001801560650002001578700001601598700002501614773015001639856008101789852000901870655001201879IND60440780120221116185033.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044078012DNAL7 a10.1007/s13762-014-0653-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomar, G.10aEnhanced fluoride removal by hydroxyapatite-modified activated alumina  ap. 2809-2818.  aFluoride in drinking water is beneficial at low concentrations but is considered harmful for the human health when present at concentrations exceeding 1.5 mg/L. Prevalence of high concentration of fluoride in drinking water, combined with the nonavailability of alternate viable sources, makes the treatment of the contaminated water an essential task. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid adsorbent; hydroxyapatite-modified activated alumina (HMAA) prepared by dispersing nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite inside activated alumina granules. The composite adsorbent provided a synergy toward fluoride removal from contaminated drinking water. The hybrid adsorbent possesses a maximum adsorption capacity of 14.4 mg F/g which is at least five times higher than the virgin-activated alumina, which has been used extensively for fluoride removal. HMAA was regenerated using six bed volumes of a solution containing commonly available innocuous chemicals. The adsorbent was subjected to multiple numbers of operating cycles within a column, each cycle consisting of one adsorption run followed by regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaluminum oxide 3adrinking water 3afluorides 3agranules 3ahuman health 3ahydroxyapatite 3ananoparticles 3awater pollution1 aThareja, A.1 aSarkar, Shondeep L.,0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2015 Sept., v. 12, no. 9 p.2809-2818dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1735-14727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-014-0653-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005600188245007600244300001600320506007600336520140500412592002801817506003701845650002201882650001901904650001601923650002701939650003901966650001102005650001302016650001302029650001202042650001602054650002502070650001202095650001802107650001402125700002802139700001802167700002302185773010502208856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60590120820221207075844.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059012082DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-017-1161-52doi7 aPMC58304802pmcid7 a288843452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajka, Joanna1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9918-298010aKaryotype reshufflings of Festuca pratensis × Lolium perenne hybrids  ap. 451-458.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany different processes have an impact on the shape of plant karyotype. Recently, cytogenetic examination of Lolium species has revealed the occurrence of spontaneous fragile sites (FSs) associated with 35S rDNA regions. The FSs are defined as the chromosomal regions that are sensitive to forming gaps or breaks on chromosomes. The shape of karyotype can also be determined by interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs), what was recognized for the first time in this paper in chromosomes of Festuca pratensis × Lolium perenne hybrids. Both FSs and ITSs can contribute to genome instabilities and chromosome rearrangements. To evaluate whether these cytogenetic phenomena have an impact on karyotype reshuffling observed in Festuca × Lolium hybrids, we examined F₁ F. pratensis × L. perenne plants and generated F₂-F₉ progeny by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using rDNA sequences, telomere and centromere probes, as well as by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). Analyses using a combination of FISH and GISH revealed that intergenomic rearrangements did not correspond to FSs but overlapped with ITSs for several analyzed genotypes. It suggests that internal telomeric repeats can affect the shape of F. pratensis × L. perenne karyotypes. However, other factors that are involved in rearrangements and have a more crucial impact could exist, but they are still unknown.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFestuca pratensis 3aLolium perenne 3acentromeres 3achromosome aberrations 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenome 3agenomics 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3akaryotyping 3anucleotide sequences 3aprogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3atelomeres1 aZwierzykowski, Zbigniew1 aMajka, Maciej1 aKosmala, Arkadiusz0 tProtoplasma.g2018 Mar., v. 255, no. 2 p.451-458dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl44608x0033-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-017-1161-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010900169300002000278520149500298592002801793650002301821650004401844650002201888650001501910650001501925650000901940650001001949650002001959650001301979650000701992650003301999650002302032650001102055650001702066650002702083700001802110700002002128700001902148700002202167700002402189700002702213700006302240700002302303773016902326856008202495852000902577655001202586IND60679792120221120145109.0191231e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067979212DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-06792-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeorgin, Jordana10aApplication of Beauveria bassiana spore waste as adsorbent to uptake acid red 97 dye from aqueous medium  ap. 36967-36977.  aThe adsorption of acid red 97 dye (RED 97) by the waste of the filamentous fungus Beauveria bassiana was analyzed. The adsorbent was obtained as a waste of a fermentative process, and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR), X–ray powder diffractometry (XRD), and specific surface area (BET). After the characterization, adsorption tests were carried out to determine the ideal conditions of pH, adsorbent mass, and contact time for the process. Adsorption isotherms, thermodynamic studies, and the treatment of textile effluent were also investigated. The adsorbent characterization allowed the visualization of its amorphous structure, with irregular and heterogeneous particles. The pore diameter was 51.9 nm and the surface area was 0.247 m² g⁻¹. 1.2 g L⁻¹ of the adsorbent and pH of 2.0 were the ideal conditions for RED 97 adsorption. The pseudo–second–order kinetic model was the most appropriate to represent the experimental data, being the equilibrium reached in about 110 min. The Langmuir model was the most suitable to represent the equilibrium data, with maximum adsorption capacity of 194.1 mg g⁻¹ at 45 °C. The adsorption processes was thermodynamically spontaneous, favorable, and exothermic. In the treatment of a real textile effluent, 5 g L⁻¹ of the spores was capable to decolorize 70% of the solution. Therefore, spore wastes of Beauveria bassiana were promising for RED 97 adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3adyes 3afungi 3aheat production 3akinetics 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3aspores 3asurface area 3atextile mill effluents1 aAlves, Eliana1 aDrumm, Fernanda1 aTonato, Denise1 aGrassi, Patrícia1 aPiccin, Jeferson S.1 aOliveira, Marcos L.

A woman’s risk of developing depression increases steadily with age, and higher incidence is associated with the onset of menopause. Here we evaluated the antidepressant properties of Asparagus cochinchinensis (AC) extract and investigated its underlying mechanisms in a rat menopausal depression model. METHODS: To model this menopausal depression, we induced a menopause-like state in rats via ovariectomy and exposed them to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 6 weeks, which promotes the development of depression-like symptoms. During the final 4 weeks of CUMS, rats were treated with either AC extract (1000 or 2000 mg/kg, PO), which has been reported to provide antidepressant effects, or with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (10 mg/kg, IP). RESULTS: We report that CUMS promotes depression-like behavior and significantly increases serum corticosterone and inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. We also found that CUMS decreases the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its primary receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), in OVX rats, and treatment with AC extract rescues both BDNF and TrkB expression levels. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that AC extract exerts antidepressant effects, possibly via modulation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway, in a rat model of menopausal depression.  aPublisher supplied data  aC0541691cKorea Technology and Information Promotion Agency for SMEs  aNRF-2019R1A2C1009006cNational Research Foundation of Korea  aKK-1811-03cKorea Institute of Toxicology  aKK-1908-03cKorea Institute of Toxicology 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal models 3aantidepressants 3abehavior disorders 3ablood serum 3acorticosterone 3acytokines 3amenopause 3aovariectomy 3arats 3arisk 3atropomyosins 3awomen1 aLee, Young-Ju1 aKim, Tae-Wan1 aLim, Ri-Na1 aHwang, Dae Youn1 aMoffat, Jeffrey J.1 aKim, Soonil1 aSeo, Joung-Wook1 aKa, Minhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2336-41840 tBMC complementary medicine and therapies.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.325-325dBioMed CentralwJournal:27308x2662-76717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-03121-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03261naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245017100207300001800378500002000396520137700416592002801793596009501821650003101916650002101947650001701968650002301985650002902008650002002037650001502057650001302072650001702085650001402102650000902116650001602125650002102141650001002162700001902172700005902191700001802250700005902268700006102327700002102388700006102409700006502470773013102535856008002666852000902746655001202755IND60772827520221118010555.0220410e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077282752DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.157602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFouché, Guillaume1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4029-838510aDirected evolution predicts cytochrome b G37V target site modification as probable adaptive mechanism towards the QiI fungicide fenpicoxamid in Zymoseptoria tritici  ap. 1117-1132.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAcquired resistance is a threat to antifungal efficacy in medicine and agriculture. The diversity of possible resistance mechanisms and highly adaptive traits of pathogens make it difficult to predict evolutionary outcomes of treatments. We used directed evolution as an approach to assess the resistance risk to the new fungicide fenpicoxamid in the wheat pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. Fenpicoxamid inhibits complex III of the respiratory chain at the ubiquinone reduction site (Qi site) of the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b, a different site than the widely used strobilurins which inhibit the same complex at the ubiquinol oxidation site (Qₒ site). We identified the G37V change within the cytochrome b Qᵢ site as the most likely resistance mechanism to be selected in Z. tritici. This change triggered high fenpicoxamid resistance and halved the enzymatic activity of cytochrome b, despite no significant penalty for in vitro growth. We identified negative cross‐resistance between isolates harbouring G37V or G143A, a Qₒ site change previously selected by strobilurins. Double mutants were less resistant to both QiIs and quinone outside inhibitors compared to single mutants. This work is a proof of concept that experimental evolution can be used to predict adaptation to fungicides and provides new perspectives for the management of QiIs.  aPublisher supplied data  aCONVENTION CIFRE N° 2017/1255cAssociation Nationale de la Recherche et de la Technologie 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3across resistance 3acytochrome b 3adirected evolution 3aelectron transport chain 3aenzyme activity 3afungicides 3amedicine 3amicrobiology 3aoxidation 3arisk 3aubiquinones 3avirulent strains 3awheat1 aMichel, Thomas1 aLalève, Anaïs1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5425-51031 aWang, Nick X.1 aYoung, David H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4877-55481 aMeunier, Brigitte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6988-46631 aDebieu, Danièle1 aFillinger, Sabine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4683-08031 aWalker, Anne‐Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1246-246X0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 Mar., v. 24, no. 3 p.1117-1132dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.157603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245013700211300001600348500001500364520110900379592002801488650004301516650001301559650001501572650001001587650002801597653000801625653000801633653002401641653002601665653000901691653003101700653001101731653000701742653000701749653001601756653000801772653000701780700002201787700001601809700002701825773011201852856008601964852000902050655001202059IND60601202520221117164624.0180706e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060120252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.10.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurtler, Volker1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0248-314114aThe increased sensitivity of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) PCR quantitation in whole blood affects reproductive rate (Ro) measurement  ap. 179-184.  a2019-12-06  aIn order to determine the effect of the increase in sensitivity of HCMV detection in whole blood compared to plasma on reproductive rate (Ro) measurement, an optimized human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) quantitative PCR assay was developed. The results presented in this study are summarized by the following three methodological improvements: (i) at values below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 60copies/ml, determination of HCMV load was more sensitive with whole blood than plasma, (ii) for the determination of viral load, whole blood was more sensitive than plasma below 1000copies/ml but little difference was observed above 1000copies/ml and (iii) the measurement of “Reproductive Rate” can be affected by imprecise measurement of HCMV viral load in either plasma or whole blood compartments depending on whether samples were taken from patients on antiviral treatment or from patients where HCMV load was rising. Taken together this study provides methodological improvements suggesting that below HCMV viral load levels of 1000copies/ml (1640IU/ml) both plasma and whole blood should be tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3apatients 3aviral load 3ablood 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0aHuman herpesvirus 5 0aHuman cytomegalovirus 0aHCMV 0aQuantitative real-time PCR 0aPlasma 0aIU 0aWB 0aWhole blood 0aSNP 0aRo1 aMayall, Barrie C.1 aWang, Jenny1 aGhaly-Derias, Shahbano0 tJournal of virological methods.g2014 Feb., v. 196 p.179-184dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245012100196300001400317520131200331592002801643650002501671650001001696650001101706650000901717650001601726650000901742650002101751650001901772650003501791650001201826650001801838650002001856650002901876650001101905650004301916650002301959650005001982650000902032650000902041650002802050650002102078650003602099650002702135700002402162700001902186700002302205773008902228856004802317852000902365655001202374IND50073269120221118003341.0140222e200202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007326912DNAL7 a118895542pmid7 a10.1007/s00335-001-2102-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliamson, Christine M. 10aAlternative non-coding splice variants of Nespas, an imprinted gene antisense to Nesp in the Gnas imprinting cluster  ap. 74-79.  aThe Gnas locus on mouse Chr 2 represents a unique cluster of overlapping imprinted genes. Three of these in the order Nesp–Gnasxl–Gnas are transcribed in the sense direction with Nesp having maternal-specific expression, Gnasxl having paternal expression, and Gnas as being biallelically expressed in most tissues. A fourth imprinted gene, Nespas, is paternally expressed, lies antisense to Nesp, and expresses an unspliced transcript. Large unspliced antisense transcripts are emerging as a feature of imprinted gene clusters, and such non-coding RNAs may have a cis-regulatory function. Here we show that, in addition to an unspliced form of Nepas, we can detect five alternatively spliced forms of Nespas up to 1.4 kb in length that are non-coding. The splice variants are paternally expressed; they start approximately 2 kb upstream of Gnasxl in a region of maternal methylation and end 2.5 kb beyond the ATG of Nesp. These variants do not correspond to exons of the human antisense transcript although they start in the same region; the Nespas transcript, like its human counterpart, is spliced in various alternative patterns. The identification of a set of small spliced imprinted transcripts in the human and now in the mouse suggests that these antisense transcripts are functionally important.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative splicing 3aexons 3ahumans 3aloci 3amethylation 3amice 3amultigene family 3anon-coding RNA 2aAlternative Splicingxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Methylation 2aDNA, Antisensexgenetics 2aFemale 2aGTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs 2aGenomic Imprinting 2aHeterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aMale 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aSkinner, Judith A. 1 aKelsey, Gavin 1 aPeters, Josephine 0 tMammalian genome.g2002 Feb., v. 13, no. 2 p.74-79dSpringer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-001-2102-2  aDNAL 7aarticle04003naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005700188245009000245300001100335506007600346520236300422592002802785596006202813506003702875650001702912650001702929650001102946650002302957650002002980650001103000650001303011650001703024650001503041650002703056650000903083650001103092650001303103650003503116700002203151700001703173700002303190700002303213700002103236700001503257773012203272856008203394852000903476655001203485IND60588764220221207100943.0200605e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058876422DNAL7 a292730002pmid7 aPMC57418602pmcid7 a10.1186/s12711-017-0370-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolé, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7884-105110aAge-based partitioning of individual genomic inbreeding levels in Belgian Blue cattle  ap. 92.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Inbreeding coefficients can be estimated either from pedigree data or from genomic data, and with genomic data, they are either global or local (when the linkage map is used). Recently, we developed a new hidden Markov model (HMM) that estimates probabilities of homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) at each marker position and automatically partitions autozygosity in multiple age-related classes (based on the length of HBD segments). Our objectives were to: (1) characterize inbreeding with our model in an intensively selected population such as the Belgian Blue Beef (BBB) cattle breed; (2) compare the properties of the model at different marker densities; and (3) compare our model with other methods. RESULTS: When using 600 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the inbreeding coefficient (probability of sampling an HBD locus in an individual) was on average 0.303 (ranging from 0.258 to 0.375). HBD-classes associated to historical ancestors (with small segments ≤ 200 kb) accounted for 21.6% of the genome length (71.4% of the total length of the genome in HBD segments), whereas classes associated to more recent ancestors accounted for only 22.6% of the total length of the genome in HBD segments. However, these recent classes presented more individual variation than more ancient classes. Although inbreeding coefficients obtained with low SNP densities (7 and 32 K) were much lower (0.060 and 0.093), they were highly correlated with those obtained at higher density (r = 0.934 and 0.975, respectively), indicating that they captured most of the individual variation. At higher SNP density, smaller HBD segments are identified and, thus, more past generations can be explored. We observed very high correlations between our estimates and those based on homozygosity (r = 0.95) or on runs-of-homozygosity (r = 0.95). As expected, pedigree-based estimates were mainly correlated with recent HBD-classes (r = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Although we observed high levels of autozygosity associated with small HBD segments in BBB cattle, recent inbreeding accounted for most of the individual variation. Recent autozygosity can be captured efficiently with low-density SNP arrays and relatively simple models (e.g., two HBD classes). The HMM framework provides local HBD probabilities that are still useful at lower SNP densities.  aPublisher supplied data  aJ.0134.16cFonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS (BE)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBelgian Blue 3aMarkov chain 3acattle 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic markers 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahomozygosity 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding coefficient 3aloci 3amodels 3apedigree 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aGori, Ann-Stephan1 aFaux, Pierre1 aBertrand, Amandine1 aFarnir, Frédéric1 aGautier, Mathieu1 aDruet, Tom0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2017 Dec., v. 49, no. 1 p.92-92dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350896x1297-96867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-017-0370-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007300169300001600242520130400258592002801562650001201590650001101602650001901613650001301632650001201645650000901657650001201666650001201678650001701690650001801707653000901725653002501734653001701759653001401776653000801790700002601798700002201824700001601846700002201862773009101884856008501975852000902060655001202069IND60551263420221120042602.0161018e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055126342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.04.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLerch, Sandra10aMice age — Does the age of the mother predict offspring behaviour?  ap. 157-162.  aIncreasing paternal age is known to be associated with a great variety of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or autism. Hence the factor “age” may be taken as strategic tool to analyse specific scientific hypotheses. Additionally, this finding also needs to be addressed in rather pragmatically performed breeding protocols of model organisms, since otherwise artefacts may challenge the validity of the results.Our study was performed to investigate influences of advanced age of mouse dams (30 vs. 16weeks) on maternal- and offspring behaviour. Adult offspring of both sexes was analysed in a test battery comprising paradigms for exploration, anxiety and depressive-like behaviours. Final blood sampling was conducted for stressphysiological analysis.Interestingly, advanced age of the mothers was associated with increased nest-building quality while maternal activity was unaffected. Moreover “maternal (mice) age” (MA) affected emotionality in the offspring, which became apparent in the dark–light box and the social recognition paradigm.These findings not only emphasize MA to model a potent risk factor with regard to emotional stability, but also underscore the vast necessity to include information about breeding protocols into the methods section of any animal study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanxiety 3aautism 3ablood sampling 3abreeding 3aelderly 3amice 3amothers 3aprogeny 3arisk factors 3aschizophrenia 0aMice 0aMaternal environment 0aEmotionality 0aSociality 0aAge1 aBrandwein, Christiane1 aDormann, Christof1 aGass, Peter1 aChourbaji, Sabine0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 147 p.157-162dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.04.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04749naa a2201045 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245015800204300001400362506007600376520196300452592002802415506003702443650002502480650002202505650001802527650001002545650002502555650002602580650001302606650001702619650001202636650002602648650001002674650001602684650000902700650001102709650002402720650001402744650001702758650002902775650001802804650001202822653001702834653002402851653001902875653001902894653002202913653001902935653002102954653000802975653000702983653000802990653000802998653000803006653000803014653000803022653000903030653000903039653000803048653000803056653000703064653000903071653001003080653000803090653000803098653000803106653000803114653000703122653001203129653000703141653001203148653000703160653001003167653000803177653000803185653000803193653000803201653000803209700002403217700005703241700001803298700002303316700001803339700002603357700002003383700002103403700002003424700006803444773008903512856008103601852000903682655001203691IND60528550420221207144151.0160716e20160519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052855042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.03.0242doi7 aPMC55176222pmcid7 a271267892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupuy, Aude10aSimultaneous quantitative profiling of 20 isoprostanoids from omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids by LC–MS/MS in various biological samples  ap. 46-58.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIsoprostanoids are a group of non-enzymatic oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It belongs to oxylipins group, which are important lipid mediators in biological processes, such as tissue repair, blood clotting, blood vessel permeability, inflammation and immunity regulation. Recently, isoprostanoids from eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, adrenic and α-linolenic namely F3-isoprostanes, F4-neuroprostanes, F2-dihomo-isoprostanes and F1-phytoprostanes, respectively have attracted attention because of their putative contribution to health. Since isoprostanoids are derived from different substrate of PUFAs and can have similar or opposing biological consequences, a total isoprostanoids profile is essential to understand the overall effect in the testing model. However, the concentration of most isoprostanoids range from picogram to nanogram, therefore a sensitive method to quantify 20 isoprostanoids simultaneously was formulated and measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The lipid portion from various biological samples was extracted prior to LC–MS/MS evaluation. For all the isoprostanoids LOD and LOQ, and the method was validated on plasma samples for matrix effect, yield of extraction and reproducibility were determined. The methodology was further tested for the isoprostanoids profiles in brain and liver of LDLR−/− mice with and without docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation. Our analysis showed similar levels of total F2-isoprostanes and F4-neuroprostanes in the liver and brain of non-supplemented LDLR−/− mice. The distribution of different F2-isoprostane isomers varied between tissues but not for F4-neuroprostanes which were predominated by the 4(RS)-4-F4t-neuroprostane isomer. DHA supplementation to LDLR−/− mice concomitantly increased total F4-neuroprostanes levels compared to F2-isoprostanes but this effect was more pronounced in the liver than brain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood coagulation 3ablood vessels 3abrain 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aimmunity 3ainflammation 3aisomers 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3ametabolites 3amice 3amodels 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aoxylipins 3apermeability 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissue repair 3atissues 0aIsoprostanes 0aDihomo-isoprostanes 0aNeuroprostanes 0aPhytoprostanes 0aMass spectrometry 0aQuantification 0aOxidative stress 0aROS 0aAA 0aAdA 0aALA 0aBHT 0aCSF 0aDHA 0aDPDS 0aEGTA 0aEPA 0aESI 0aHP 0aHPLC 0aIsoPs 0aLOD 0aLOQ 0am/z 0aMRM 0aMS 0aNeuroPs 0aOS 0aPhytoPs 0aPA 0aPUFAs 0aROS 0aSPE 0aSRM 0aS/N 0aTPP1 aLe Faouder, Pauline1 aVigor, Claire1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1569-04251 aOger, Camille1 aGalano, Jean-Marie1 aDray, Cédric1 aLee, Jetty Chung-Yung1 aValet, Philippe1 aGladine, Cécile1 aDurand, Thierry1 aBertrand-Michel, Justine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9815-15170 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 May 19, v. 921 p.46-58dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245012200176300001600298520138500314592002801699650002201727650001601749650002301765650002001788650002701808650002001835650001301855650001501868650001801883650001401901650004301915650005201958650000902010653001802019653002302037653001902060653002102079653002502100700002502125700003302150773011202183856008602295852000902381655001202390IND60601202720221120105958.0180706e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060120272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavalieva, Katarina10aFast, reliable and low cost user-developed protocol for detection, quantification and genotyping of hepatitis C virus  ap. 104-112.  aEarly detection and genotyping of HCV infection is important for disease management. It is important to develop fast and cost-effective semi-automated techniques allowing an accurate and reproducible detection, quantification and genotyping of HCV.The proposed protocol includes a real-time RT-PCR assay for HCV detection/quantification and a type-specific one-tube RT-PCR assay for genotyping. Both assays detect genotypes 1–4 as intended. The limit of detection was 112IU/ml for the real-time assay and 600±278IU/ml (mean±SD) for the genotyping assay. Concordance between the real-time assay and AMPLICOR HCV v2.0 test was 100%. The real-time assay has wide linear dynamic range of detection and quantification and excellent reproducibility with 2% and 0.75% coefficients of variations, for inter- and intra-assays, respectively. The observed correlation with AMPLICOR HCV Monitor v2.0 kit was linear with the correlation coefficient of 0.988. The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the genotyping assay, tested on 102 samples, was 100% and 95%, respectively.The overall procedure of HCV diagnosis is completed within 6h in a closed system with minor contamination risk. In addition to being fast and cost-effective, this approach is reproducible and avoids post-PCR enzymatic and hybridization steps while detecting and genotyping HCV with high clinical sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3acorrelation 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic specificity 3adisease control 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahybridization 3aprotocols 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 0aHCV detection 0aHCV quantification 0aHCV genotyping 0aReal-time RT-PCR 0aType-specific RT-PCR1 aKiprijanovska, Sanja1 aPlaseska-Karanfilska, Dijana0 tJournal of virological methods.g2014 Feb., v. 196 p.104-112dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245006400157300001600221500002000237520069200257592002800949650002700977650002001004650001601024650002201040650001101062773015001073856007101223852000901294655001201303IND60680248220221122075816.0200104e197311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068024822DNAL7 a10.2307/12383432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKofi, Tetteh A.12aA Framework for Comparing the Efficiency of Futures Markets  ap. 584-594.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEmpirical observation and theoretical analyses show that the allocative and forward pricing functions of futures markets are more reliable for continuous than for discontinuous inventory markets.

With emerging technologies, product embedded information devices such as radio frequency identification tags and smart sensors are widely used to improve the efficiency of enterprises' routine management on an operational level. Manufacturing enterprises need a more advanced analysis approach to develop a solution on a strategic level from using such lifecycle Big Data. However, the application of Big Data in lifecycle faces several challenges, such as the lack of reliable data and valuable knowledge that can be employed to support the optimized decision-making of product lifecycle management. In this paper, a framework for Big Data driven product lifecycle management was proposed to address these challenges. Within the proposed framework, the availability and accessibility of data and knowledge related to lifecycle can be achieved. A case study was presented to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework was feasible to be adopted in industry, and can provide an overall solution for optimizing the decision-making processes in different phases of the whole lifecycle. The key findings and insights from the case study were summarized as managerial implications, which can guide manufacturers to ensure improvements in energy saving and fault diagnosis related decisions in the whole lifecycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aenergy conservation 3amanufacturing 3aradio frequency identification 0aMaintenance 0aService 0aMacro level analysis 0aMicro level analysis 0aEconomic impact1 aRen, Shan1 aLiu, Yang1 aSakao, Tomohiko1 aHuisingh, Donald0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 159 p.229-240dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.04.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010100163520088300264592002801147650001501175650002001190650001401210650001701224650001901241650001501260650001201275650001301287650001001300650001001310650001001320651001801330700002001348700001901368700001701387700002001404773012901424856007501553852000901628655001201637IND60759360220221118000855.0211209e20211129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075936022DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132348422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKönig, Christine,10aCombined Use of Space Borne Optical and SAR Data to Improve Knowledge about Sea Ice for Shipping  aAs a first step towards a new combined product for sea ice classification based on optical/thermal data collected by Sentinel-3 satellites and SAR data from Sentinel-1 satellites, which can be used as an appropriate support for navigation in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters, two existing classification algorithms are adapted to these data. The classification based on optical data has improved, so it is expected that the results will be ideally suited to be processed together with SAR data into significantly improved sea ice information products to support marine navigation.

This disposable electrode shows excellent conductivity and fast electron transfer kinetics. By in situ plating with a bismuth film (BiF), the developed electrode exhibited well-defined and separate peaks for Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) by square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV). Analytical characteristics of the BiF/N/IL/G/SPCE were explored with calibration curves which were found to be linear for Zn(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) concentrations over the range from 0.1 to 100.0 ng L−1. With an accumulation period of 120 s detection limits of 0.09 ng mL−1, 0.06 ng L−1 and 0.08 ng L−1 were obtained for Zn(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II), respectively using the BiF/N/IL/G/SPCE sensor, calculated as 3σ value of the blank. In addition, the developed electrode displayed a good repeatability and reproducibility. The interference from other common ions associated with Zn(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II) detection could be effectively avoided. Finally, the proposed analytical procedure was applied to detect the trace metal ions in drinking water samples with satisfactory results which demonstrates the suitability of the BiF/N/IL/G/SPCE to detect heavy metals in water samples and the results agreed well with those obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aanalytical chemistry 3abismuth 3azinc 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aelectrodes 3acadmium 3adrinking water 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aionic liquids 3ametal ions 0aBismuth film 0aNafion/ionic liquid/graphene composite 0aZinc 0aLead 0aScreen-printed carbon electrode 0aions 0aCadmium1 aMehmeti, Eda1 aŽagar, Kristina1 aSiangproh, Weena1 aChailapakul, Orawon1 aKalcher, Kurt0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 Apr. 28, v. 918 p.26-34dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009500171300001600266520157800282592002801860650001101888650002001899650001201919650002701931650000901958650001201967650001401979650002101993650001402014650001502028650001002043650001202053650001402065650001202079650000902091650000902100650001302109650001202122653001302134653002502147653002702172653002302199653001202222653000802234700002202242700001902264700002602283700002002309700002402329700002302353773009102376856008502467852000902552655001202561IND60551263720221120120617.0161018e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055126372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.04.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartos, Mariana10aNeurobehavioural effects of exposure to fluoride in the earliest stages of rat development  ap. 205-212.  aIt is known that exposure to high concentrations of Fluoride (F) produces deleterious health effects in human population. However, in the last years it has been concluded that low concentrations of F may have adverse health effects as well. Transplacental passage of F and its incorporation into foetal tissues has been demonstrated. Therefore, the purpose of the present work was to study the effects of the exposure to low levels of F during pregnancy and lactation on the central nervous system functionality. Wistar rats were exposed to low F concentrations (5 and 10mg/l) during pregnancy and lactation. Sensorimotor reflexes in the each pup were analysed and the postnatal day on which both eyes and auditory canals were opened was recorded. Locomotor activity and anxiety were subsequently analysed in 45- and 90-day-old offspring by an open field test and plus maze test, respectively. A significant delay in the development of eye opening was observed in all offspring whose mothers had been exposed to the two F concentrations tested. Exposure to 5 and 10mg/lF was also found to significantly decrease locomotor activity only in 90-day-old male and female offspring. A low index of anxiety in the young females and in all adult offspring exposed to the two F concentrations tested was also detected. Taken together, findings from the present study show that exposure to low F concentrations during pregnancy and lactation produces dysfunction in the central nervous system mechanisms which regulate motor and sensitive development, locomotor activity and anxiety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aanxiety 3acentral nervous system 3aeyes 3afemales 3afluorides 3ahuman population 3alactation 3alocomotion 3amales 3amothers 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3apups 3arats 3areflexes 3atissues 0aFluoride 0aDevelopment exposure 0aSensory-motor reflexes 0aLocomotor activity 0aAnxiety 0aRat1 aGumilar, Fernanda1 aBras, Cristina1 aGallegos, Cristina E.1 aGiannuzzi, Leda1 aCancela, Liliana M.1 aMinetti, Alejandra0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 147 p.205-212dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245010200203520113500305592002801440650003401468650001201502650001401514650001601528650002801544650001701572651001201589651001201601651001301613653011701626700001401743700001401757700001501771700005201786773011601838856008501954852000902039655001202048IND60748106920221118041342.0211017e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074810692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1018062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgyed, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8621-863010aAnalysing the genomes of two tick-borne encephalitis viruses isolated in Hungary in 1952 and 2019  aThe genomes of two Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) strains were fully sequenced and compared to those of known Hungarian strains. One was a laboratory strain (KEM-1) isolated in 1952, which had gone through hundreds of passages both on Vero cell cultures and in laboratory mice, while the other was a recent isolate (2019) from questing female ticks. The laboratory strain formed a monophyletic group with the already published 4 Hungarian strains on the evolutionary tree, located relatively close to Finnish (Kumlinge) and Russian (Absettarov) strains. This KEM-1 strain was phylogenetically distantly related both to the geographically close reference strain Neudörfl and the chronologically close Czech isolates from 1953. The 2019 isolate, KEM-195 was related to TBEV isolates from Southern Slovakia and Styria, and had the longest (328 nucleotides) deletion in its 3’-non-coding region among published sequences of strains of European subtype. Our results show that decades of laboratory passage have not altered the viral genome too much and that at least two distinct branches of TBEV strains circulate in Hungary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTick-borne encephalitis virus 3afemales 3amonophyly 3anucleotides 3atick-borne encephalitis 3aviral genome 3aAustria 3aHungary 3aSlovakia 0aTick borne encephalitis virus; Isolations; Sequencing; Analyzing of isolates; Migrating birds; Laboratory strain1 aBiksi, I.1 aVarga, T.1 aZöldi, V.1 aDan, A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7849-77210 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2021 Nov., v. 12, no. 6 p.101806-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2021.1018063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010000168300001400268500001500282520132600297592002801623650001901651650001701670650001101687650001801698650001201716650001401728650001701742650001901759650001501778650001501793653002601808653001801834653002001852653001501872653002201887653001401909700001501923700001601938700001401954773011101968856008602079852000902165655001202174IND60569179220221116171021.0180831e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056917922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Fengfeng10aElectrofluidic pretreatment for enhancing essential oil extraction from citrus fruit peel waste  ap. 85-94.  a2019-12-06  aPretreatment technologies make pressed fruit peel more valuable both nutritionally and economically. Robust electrofluidic systems, in particular, can facilitate clean and efficient production of valuable compounds from these byproducts. In this study, a multi-series system was designed with a combination of pipeline flow and induced electric field (IEF), then applied to pretreat citrus peel for enhancing the extraction of essential oils. The essential oil yield increased significantly from 0 V to 1 kV. There was a decrease in fluid impedance during the IEF-pretreatment period owing to the dissolution of cell contents, as well as a slight decrease in essential oil yield as frequency increased. Forty components were identified in the essential oils representing over 97% of the total GC peak areas for both procedures. We also observed significant effect on the essential oil yield between the IEF-pretreatments in different winding direction of the sample coils. High throughput was achieved by arbitrarily increasing the reactors within a compact system. In effect, the IEF-pretreatment is an effective, innovative, and ecologically sustainable technique for intensifying essential oil extraction without necessitating metal electrodes, thus avoids electrode surface corrosion, and heavy metal contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3acitrus peels 3awastes 3acitrus fruits 3apeeling 3acorrosion 3aheavy metals 3aessential oils 3aelectrodes 3abyproducts 0aElectrofluidic system 0aEssential oil 0aHigh throughput 0aExtraction 0aCitrus fruit peel 0aimpedance1 aJin, Yamei1 aXu, Xueming1 aYang, Ne,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 159 p.85-94dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005900094040001800153100001900171245007500190300001600265520155200281592002801833650002001861650002501881650001501906650001401921650002001935650000901955651001101964653002201975653001701997653001802014653002102032653001802053700003902071773010702110856007302217852000902290655001202299IND60773222320221119065520.0220412e20071201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077322232DNAL7 a10.2980/1195-6860(2007)14%5B452:TCRODA%5D2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVéran, Sophie14aThe critical role of dependence among individuals in extinction models  ap. 452-462.  aWe analyze the potential effect of a general dependence among individuals in population extinction models. We conduct this analysis using Branching Processes as extinction models. In Branching Processes, each individual is replaced at each step of time, independently of all others, by a contribution to the population made of an integer random number of individuals. We introduce dependence among individuals as a uniform positive correlation between contributions of all pairs of individuals. This general form of dependence between individuals is shown to be equivalent to environmental stochasticity. The correlation coefficient among individuals' contributions is then shown to be equivalent to an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient in an analysis of variance with a random effect. This property makes it possible to estimate the intensity of environmental stochasticity in natural populations in a simple fashion. As an example, we show that in the Alsace (eastern France) white stork population the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for fecundity is estimated to be 0.79. With such a high value one may expect environmental stochasticity to strongly influence extinction risk. We therefore analyze the impact of increasing correlation among individual contributions on extinction risk: first, conditional on population size and, second, incorporating all sources of variation in numbers through the Quasi-Stationary Distribution of population size. Our approach should facilitate the development of sensitivity analyses of extinction risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiconia ciconia 3aanalysis of variance 3aextinction 3afecundity 3apopulation size 3arisk 3aFrance 0aBranching Process 0adistribution 0aenvironmental 0aquasi-stationary 0astochasticity1 aLebreton, J.

As it will continue to play a vital role in meeting current and future needs, significant efforts have been made to address this problem. Over the past few years, extensive studies on the development of heterogeneous catalysts for CO₂ methanation have been investigated and reported in the literatures. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of methanation research studies over lanthanide oxide catalysts has been reviewed. The utilisation of lanthanide oxides as CO₂ methanation catalysts performed an outstanding result of CO₂ conversion and improvised the conversion of acidity from CO₂ gas to CH₄ gas. The innovations of catalysts towards the reaction were discussed in details including the influence of preparation methods, the structure-activity relationships as well as the mechanism with the purpose of outlining the pathways for future development of the methanation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3alanthanides 3amethane 3amethane production 3anatural gas 3astructure-activity relationships1 aToemen, Susilawati1 aIqbal, Malik Muhammad Asif1 aBakar, Wan Azelee Wan Abu1 aMokhtar, Wan Nur Aini Wan1 aAziz, Md Maniruzzaman A.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2019 Dec., v. 26, no. 36 p.36124-36140dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06607-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008000166300001600246520186200262592002802124650002502152650001202177650001302189650001402202650001802216650001702234653002202251653004002273653002702313653001902340653003402359653002202393700002002415700002402435700002102459773011402480856008602594852000902680655001202689IND60569179620221118130453.0180831e20170920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056917962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajeev, A.10aEvolution of sustainability in supply chain management: A literature review  ap. 299-314.  aAn ever-increasing demand for products and their consumption has put pressure on industrial output and their supply chains, and that demand has resulted in negative impacts on the environment and society. Increasing rates of pollution and environmental calamities caused by industrial production have urged several researchers and industry experts to work on Sustainable Production and Consumption issues within the context of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). This paper comprehensively covers the exponential growth of the topic through an evolutionary lens. This article attempts to understand the evolution of sustainability issues by analysing trends across industries, economies, and through the use of various methodologies. A comprehensive thematic analysis was performed on 1068 filtered articles from 2000 to 2015, highlighting the development and importance of the body of knowledge. The study proposes a conceptual framework to classify various factors along the triple bottom line pillars of sustainability issues in the context of supply chains. An in-depth study is conducted on 190 articles covering all pillars of sustainability (as per the proposed conceptual framework) on SSCM. We observe that studies focusing on all three dimensions of sustainability are comparatively scarce. More focus on industry-specific studies is required because problems addressing industries that are serious polluters, especially those in emerging economies, remains largely unaddressed. It is observed that the studies addressing social issues are scarce, and more focus is required on the measurement of social impacts along the supply chain. Finally, we propose future avenues to extend research on the SSCM domain while keeping in mind the need to address industry specific and economy specific problems from the triple bottom line perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3aexperts 3aindustry 3apollution 3asocial impact 3asupply chain 0aLiterature review 0aSustainable supply chain management 0aSustainable operations 0aSustainability 0aGreen supply chain management 0aThematic analysis1 aPati, Rupesh K.1 aPadhi, Sidhartha S.1 aGovindan, Kannan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 162 p.299-314dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245010400161300001200265520134800277592002801625650004401653650002201697650001201719650001401731650001501745650001901760650001301779650002101792650001401813650003401827650001601861650002201877700001801899700001901917700001701936700001801953773014201971856008102113852000902194655001202203IND60462084320221120073525.0160112e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046208432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2677-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yanke10aNew Insight into the Effect of Potassium on Commercial SCR Catalyst: Promotion of Thermal Stability  ap. 410.  aThermal stability is one of the most important indexes determining the practical applications of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts. The influence of typical alkali element on the thermal stability of industrial V₂O₅-WO₃/TiO₂ catalyst is first reported in this work. The activity of the sample is measured, and physicochemical properties are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectrum, field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), N₂ adsorption-desorption, temperature programmed desorption of NH₃ (NH₃-TPD), and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS). The sintering and anatase-to-rutile phase transformation at high temperature will cause deactivation of SCR catalyst, and low concentration of K can increase the thermal stability. Under the same thermal treatment, the activity (380 °C) of sample deposited by K is more than three times higher than that of the fresh sample without K. Aggregation of vanadia in conventional SCR catalyst favors the sintering and anatase-to-rutile phase transformation of catalysts. Incorporation of K can modify the structure of partial V-OH and form V-OK, which hinders the aggregation of vanadia species and further increases the thermal stability of catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3adesorption 3aheat treatment 3anitrogen 3aphase transition 3apotassium 3ascanning electron microscopes 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aMeng, Xiaoran1 aChen, Jinsheng1 aWang, Jinxiu1 aChen, Yanting0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Dec., v. 226, no. 12 p.410-410dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2677-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04132naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245009500205300001600300500002000316520213500336592002802471596010002499596009102599596007902690650001702769650001202786650001702798650002002815650001802835650001602853650001202869650001802881650001302899650001002912650001602922650001102938650001402949650001102963650002402974650001602998650001603014650001303030650001203043700006103055700005903116700006503175700005703240700006603297773013203363856007403495852000903569655001203578IND60772828320221118010615.0220410e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077282832DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.134692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Nicolay Leme da1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5509-675710aIncreasing pollen production at high latitudes across animal‐pollinated flowering plants  ap. 940-953.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Plant reliance on animal mutualists is expected to decrease with latitude owing to increasing environmental instability. As a consequence, more erratic animal pollination in the temperate zones than in the tropics could translate into lower efficiency in pollen transfer, and thus increasing pollen wastage. Despite the relevance of this hypothesis for plant reproductive evolution, the implications of a proposed latitudinal gradient in pollinator reliability for pollen and ovule production, traits directly affecting seed siring and seed set, respectively, remain unresolved. LOCATION: Global. TIME PERIOD: 1971–2020. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Angiospermae. METHODS: Based on a bibliographic survey and our own data, we collated a dataset with information on pollen production (P) and ovule number (O) per flower from 419 studies, including a total of 1,392 animal‐pollinated angiosperm species from 141 families distributed worldwide and sampled between the equator and 68.35° latitude. Using phylogenetic general linear mixed models, we investigated latitudinal variation in P and O. We also tested a latitudinal effect on several ancillary plant traits associated with a plant’s mating system and pollinator specialization that might confound any latitudinal effect on gamete production. RESULTS: P but not O was positively associated with latitude, a trend that even became stronger after including the latitudinally varying ancillary traits (i.e., growth form, flower size, flower symmetry and number of pollinator orders). The latitudinal effect on P was more pronounced among species producing large flowers, a trait that could be linked to self‐incompatibility and thus outcrossing. A weak phylogenetic patterning of P also indicates high evolvability potential of this trait, which may have an effect on both male and female plant fitness. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Even though a latitudinal trend in pollinator reliability still awaits direct testing, the observed latitudinal increase in P across angiosperms can be interpreted as an evolutionary consequence of an increasingly unpredictable pollination environment.  aPublisher supplied data  aBeca posdoctoral/10520170300865COcConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aPIP 112‐200801‐01623cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas  aPICT 2007‐01300cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica 3aAngiospermae 3aanimals 3abiogeography 3adata collection 3afemale plants 3aflower size 3aflowers 3agametogenesis 3alatitude 3amales 3aoutcrossing 3aovules 3aphylogeny 3apollen 3apollen productivity 3apollination 3apollinators 3aseed set 3asurveys1 aGleiser, Gabriela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4178-67031 aSáez, Agustín1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6461-28881 aChalcoff, Vanina Ruth1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5777-81371 aTur, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8059-75371 aAizen, Marcelo Adrián1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9079-97490 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2022 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.940-953dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.134693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01720naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245010200155300001400257500001700271520070300288592002800991650002701019650000901046650002201055650001801077650001201095650000901107650001501116650001101131651001901142773014101161856007101302852000901373655001201382IND60680248820221122075806.0200104e197402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068024882DNAL7 a10.2307/12393442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Martin10aGuaranteed Price Adjustment and Market Stability in the United Kingdom: The Case of Beef and Milk  ap. 26-37.  aCase Reports  aThe dynamic properties of a producer‐government interaction model are investigated to show why the United Kingdom's policy of regulating its agricultural markets by annually adjusting guaranteed prices failed to control persistent fluctuations in supplies, market prices, and subsidy costs of beef and milk during the fifties and sixties.

Surprisingly, implementation rates remain low. Academia argues that this energy efficiency gap is due to SMEs’ resource constraints and a lack of managerial awareness regarding energy-related patterns. In order to address these constraints, this article presents a six-step energy management framework tailor-made for SMEs. Therefore, this framework specifically focuses on the measurement and visualization of real-time energy flows to create managerial awareness. Moreover, the framework utilizes internal human capabilities and minimizes resource-intensive management procedures to enable an implementation which is less resource-demanding than existing approaches. Following this framework, companies continuously apply steps of staff sensitization, energy measurement, analyses, optimization, reflection and strategy alignment. Empirically, this framework was developed using an action research approach in a German SME, where energy and carbon saving potentials of 37% were realized. The case study highlights how increased managerial awareness triggers the implementation of energy efficiency practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumans 0aEnergy management framework 0aSmall- and medium-sized enterprises 0aEnergy awareness 0aReal-time energy measurement 0aCase study0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 164 p.221-229dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002200188245011300210300001200323506007600335520191800411592002802329596005102357596005802408506003702466650003402503650002802537650002602565650002302591650002402614650001302638650002402651650002602675650001202701650001302713650002102726650001502747650001402762650002202776650001402798650001002812651001302822700002002835700002002855700003002875700002002905700005902925773010802984856008203092852000903174655001203183IND60588765020221207100945.0220818e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058876502DNAL7 aPMC57419142pmcid7 a292730642pmid7 a10.1186/s13071-017-2541-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoonthai, Traimat14aThe Asian fish tapeworm Schyzocotyle acheilognathi is widespread in baitfish retail stores in Michigan, USA  ap. 618.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Asian fish tapeworm Schyzocotyle acheilognathi (Yamaguti, 1934) is an important fish pathogen because of its wide range of intermediate and definitive hosts and its pathological consequences. This study was designed to determine if baitfish are a likely vector contributing to the expansion of the invasive Asian fish tapeworm. RESULTS: We collected live baitfish for examination from 78 retail stores in Michigan between September 2015 and June 2016. A total of 5400 baitfish (90 lots, 60 fish/lot) were examined, including 42 emerald shiners [Notropis atherinoides (Rafinesque, 1818)] lots, 30 fathead minnow [Pimephales promelas (Rafinesque, 1820)] lots, 11 golden shiners [Notemigonus crysoleucas (Mitchill, 1814)] lots, 3 sand shiners [Notropis stramineus (Cope, 1865)] lots, 1 lot each of spottail shiners [Notropis hudsonius (Clinton, 1824)], Northern redbelly dace [Phoxinus eos (Cope, 1861)], and blacknose dace [Rhinichthys atratulus (Hermann, 1804)] and 1 lot of mixed two species: weed shiners [Notropis texanus (Girard, 1856)] and sand shiners. CONCLUSIONS: Based on its scolex and strobilar morphology combined with gene sequence analysis, S. acheilognathi was only found in emerald shiners, golden shiners and sand shiners. The mean within lot prevalence and abundance of infection was highest in emerald shiners (20.3 ± 14.0 and 1.15 ± 1.34), followed by golden shiners (8.3 ± 10.7 and 0.89 ± 1.27) and sand shiners (1.3 ± 2.6 and 0.02 ± 0.05). However, the mean intensity of S. acheilognathi in emerald shiners was lower (4.3 ± 2.6) than that of golden shiners (6.6 ± 6.7). S. acheilognathi-infected fish exhibited enlargement of the abdomen, distension of the intestinal wall, and intestinal occlusion and hemorrhage. This finding suggests that live baitfish are a likely vector by which the invasive Asian tapeworm’s range is expanding.  aPublisher supplied data  aF15AP00216cGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative  a751B5500047cMichigan Department of Natural Resources0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBothriocephalus acheilognathi 3aNotemigonus crysoleucas 3aNotropis atherinoides 3aNotropis hudsonius 3aNotropis stramineus 3aPhoxinus 3aPimephales promelas 3aRhinichthys atratulus 3aabdomen 3abaitfish 3adefinitive hosts 3ahemorrhage 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3atapeworms 3aweeds 3aMichigan1 aHerbst, Seth J.1 aWhelan, Gary E.1 aVan Deuren, Michelle Gunn1 aLoch, Thomas P.1 aFaisal, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2719-80240 tParasites & vectors.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.618-618dBioMed CentralwJournal:24143x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-017-2541-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03886naa a2200949 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014100164300001400305520140500319592002801724650003601752650001301788650002301801650001201824650002201836650002001858650003101878650002401909650001601933650002801949650003701977650004302014650002802057650002502085650005202110650002402162650001302186650002002199650003302219650001202252650002902264650001502293650002202308650001702330653000902347653001202356653001102368653001502379653000802394653000702402653000802409653000802417653000702425653000902432653000802441653000902449653000702458653000702465653000802472653000802480653000802488653000802496653000802504653000802512653000802520653000802528653000902536653000902545653000702554653000902561653000902570653000802579653001202587653002302599653001902622653000702641653000802648700001402656700001602670700002002686700001702706700001502723773009202738856008502830852000902915655001202924IND60552065020221120054206.0161020e20140220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055206502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aEctopic expression of ZmSIMK1 leads to improved drought tolerance and activation of systematic acquired resistance in transgenic tobacco  ap. 18-29.  aThe mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play pivotal roles in diverse signaling pathways related to plant biotic and abiotic stress responses. In this study, a group B MAPK gene in Zea mays, ZmSIMK1, was functionally analyzed. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that ZmSIMK1 transcript could be induced by drought, salt, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000) and certain exogenous signaling molecules. Analysis of the ZmSIMK1 promoter revealed a group of putative cis-acting elements related to drought and defense responses. β-Glucuronidase (GUS) staining produced similar results as qRT-PCR. ZmSIMK1 was mainly localized in the nucleus, and further study indicated that the C-terminal domain (CD) was essential for targeting to the nucleus. Transgenic tobacco accumulated less reactive oxygen species (ROS), had higher levels of antioxidant enzyme activity and osmoregulatory substances and exhibited an increased germination rate compared with wild-type (WT) tobacco under drought stress. ROS-related and drought stress-responsive genes in transgenic tobacco were significantly upregulated compared with the same genes in WT lines under drought stress. Moreover, overexpression of ZmSIMK1 promoted the hypersensitive response (HR) and pathogen-related gene (PR) transcription in addition to triggering systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in tobacco.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3aZea mays 3abeta-glucuronidase 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agermination 3ahypersensitive response 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3aregulatory sequences 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3astress response 3asystemic acquired resistance 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenes 3atransgenic plants 3awater stress 0aMAPK 0aqRT-PCR 0aRT-PCR 0aPst DC3000 0aROS 0aPR 0aSAR 0aABA 0aSA 0aMeJA 0aGFP 0aDAPI 0aCD 0aKD 0aREL 0aMDA 0aNBT 0aDAB 0aAPX 0aCAT 0aPOD 0aSOD 0aDMTU 0aH2O2 0aHR 0aCaMV 0aCTAB 0aGUS 0aZmSIMK1 0aEctopic expression 0aDrought stress 0aHR 0aSAR1 aLiu, Yang1 aCai, Guohua1 aJiang, Shanshan1 aPan, Jiaowen1 aLi, Dequan0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2014 Feb. 20, v. 172 p.18-29dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04366naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245009800200300001600298500002000314520209200334592002802426596004702454596005102501596006702552596004802619596005302667650002202720650001702742650002402759650001502783650001502798650001202813650001002825650001302835650001702848650001402865650001302879650002402892650002102916700005902937700006102996700006503057700005803122700005703180700005803237700003203295700006103327700006503388700006303453700005703516773013203573856007403705852000903779655001203788IND60772828520221118010659.0220410e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077282852DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.134712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJovanovska, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3413-368310aEnvironmental filtering drives assembly of diatom communities over evolutionary time‐scales  ap. 954-967.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Ecological communities are structured through the interplay of deterministic assembly processes such as competition and environmental filtering. Whereas the drivers of spatial community structure are frequently studied in extant communities, little is known about the relative importance of assembly processes in response to environmental factors over evolutionary time‐scales. Here, we use an integrative framework to unravel community assembly processes since the inception of a long‐lived lake ecosystem. LOCATION: Lake Ohrid. TIME PERIOD: From lake formation 1.36 million years ago to the present. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Planktonic diatoms. METHODS: We constructed a dated phylogeny of extant and extinct diatoms and collected trait data for 380 fossil communities to quantify phylogenetic community structure and functional richness and to determine the relative importance of deterministic assembly processes over time. We then used regression analysis to correlate the phylogenetic community structure with palaeoenvironmental and intrinsic biological predictors and to identify primary drivers of assembly processes. RESULTS: Our results suggest a dense packing of niche space with higher species richness and co‐occurrence of closely related species. There are only two short episodes in the very recent past dominated by distantly related taxa. We found distinct changes in phylogenetic community structure upon speciation or extinction events and an increase in mean community relatedness over time. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of closely related co‐occurring species implies environmental filtering as the primary assembly mechanism, with a minor but increasingly important role of competition towards the present, driven by evolutionary dynamics. Such an increase in the relative contribution of competition to the assembly of communities in relation to the aging of an insular ecosystem, together with a denser packing of morphospace in the early phase of system ontogeny is compatible with ecological predictions according to the theory of island biogeography.  aPublisher supplied data  aAL 1076/9cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aJO 1731/1‐1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aSTE 2460/2‐1 and 2460/3‐1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aWI 1902/13cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aPCEFP3_187012cSwiss National Science Foundation 3aBacillariophyceae 3abiogeography 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3afossils 3alakes 3aontogeny 3apaleoecology 3aphylogeny 3aplankton 3aregression analysis 3aspecies richness1 aHauffe, Torsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5711-94571 aStelbrink, Björn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7471-49921 aCvetkoska, Aleksandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9812-88161 aLevkov, Zlatko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1184-23561 aWagner, Bernd1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1369-78931 aLacey, Jack H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6329-21491 aOgnjanova‐Rumenova, Nadja1 aHamilton, Paul B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6938-63411 aBrandenburg, Karen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9342-33491 aAlbrecht, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1490-18251 aWilke, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8263-77580 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2022 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.954-967dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.134713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014400172300001600316520154900332592002801881650001901909650001801928650001601946650001101962650001401973650001301987650001102000650001502011650002102026650001502047650002402062650001902086650001102105650001202116651001602128653000802144653001802152653002102170653003002191653002002221653000802241700005702249700001602306700002402322700001902346773012302365856008802488852000902576655001202585IND60585779720221120220021.0201111e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058577972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeissert, L.F.10aDevelopment of a microscale land use regression model for predicting NO2 concentrations at a heavy trafficked suburban area in Auckland, NZ  ap. 112-119.  aLand use regression (LUR) analysis has become a key method to explain air pollutant concentrations at unmeasured sites at city or country scales, but little is known about the applicability of LUR at microscales. We present a microscale LUR model developed for a heavy trafficked section of road in Auckland, New Zealand. We also test the within-city transferability of LUR models developed at different spatial scales (local scale and city scale). Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) was measured during summer at 40 sites and a LUR model was developed based on standard criteria. The results showed that LUR models are able to capture the microscale variability with the model explaining 66% of the variability in NO₂ concentrations. Predictor variables identified at this scale were street width, distance to major road, presence of awnings and number of bus stops, with the latter three also being important determinants at the local scale. This highlights the importance of street and building configurations for individual exposure at the street level. However, within-city transferability was limited with the number of bus stops being the only significant predictor variable at all spatial scales and locations tested, indicating the strong influence of diesel emissions related to bus traffic. These findings show that air quality monitoring is necessary at a high spatial density within cities in capturing small-scale variability in NO₂ concentrations at the street level and assessing individual exposure to traffic related air pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acities 3aemissions 3aland use 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asuburban areas 3asummer 3atraffic 3aNew Zealand 0aLUR 0aAir pollution 0aNitrogen dioxide 0aIntra-urban air pollution 0aTransferability 0aGIS1 aSalmond, J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5670-77241 aMiskell, G.1 aAlavi-Shoshtari, M.1 aWilliams, D.E.0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 619-620 p.112-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001800264520260900282592002802891650001302919650001402932650002502946650002602971650001202997651001203009651001103021700002003032700002603052773013503078856008103213852000903294655001203303IND60462084720221120073711.0151113e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046208472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-015-0984-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandin, Gustav10aUsing the planetary boundaries framework for setting impact-reduction targets in LCA contexts  ap. 1684-1700.  aPURPOSE: The planetary boundaries (PBs) framework suggests global limits for environmental interventions which could be used to set global goals for reducing environmental impacts. This paper proposes a procedure for using such global goals for setting impact-reduction targets at the scale of products for use, for example, in life cycle assessment (LCA) contexts, e.g. as a basis for evaluating the potential of interventions to reduce the environmental impact of products. METHODS: The procedure consists of four steps: (i) identifying the PBs quantified in literature that correspond to an impact category which is studied in the product assessment context in question; (ii) interpreting what the identified PBs imply in terms of global impact-reduction targets; (iii) translating the outcome of (ii) to reduction targets for the particular global market segment to which the studied product belongs; and (iv) translating the outcome of (iii) to reduction targets for the studied product. The procedure requires some assumptions and value-based choices—the influence of these is tested by applying the procedure in a specific LCA context: a study of Swedish clothing consumption. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The application of the procedure in an LCA context suggested the need for eliminating all or nearly all impact of Swedish clothing consumption for most impact categories. Thus, it is improbable that a single type of impact-reduction intervention (e.g. technological development or changed user behaviour) is sufficient. The outcome’s strong dependence on impact category suggests that the procedure can help in prioritising among impact categories. Furthermore, the outcome exhibited a strong dependence on the chosen method for allocating the globally allowed impact between regions—this was tested by applying different principles identified in a literature review on the allocation of emissions rights. The outcome also strongly depended on the geographical scope—this was tested by changing the geographical scope from Sweden to Nigeria. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed procedure is feasible to use for LCA practitioners and other environmental analysts, and data is available to apply the procedure in contexts with different geographical scopes. Value-based choices are, however, unavoidable and significantly influence the outcome, which accentuates the subjectivity and potentially controversial nature of allocating a finite impact space to certain regions, market segments and products. How to match PBs with appropriate LCA impact categories is an important area for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3alife cycle assessment 3amarkets 3aNigeria 3aSweden1 aPeters, Greg M.1 aSvanström, Magdalena0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2015 Dec., v. 20, no. 12 p.1684-1700dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-0984-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05386naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003400132024002200166024001900188040001800207100002100225245013300246506007600379506017300455520271600628506003703344650001303381650002403394650002503418650001903443650001703462650001703479650002703496650002803523650001503551650002203566650000903588650001003597650001703607650002503624650001603649650002103665650001103686650001703697650002403714650001303738650001503751650001903766650001803785650001803803650001103821650002503832650001503857650001103872650001703883650002003900650001603920650001003936650002503946650001403971650002103985650003704006700002004043700001404063700001704077700001604094773006204110856011204172856004704284956024304331961000904574852000904583655001204592IND50068012020221214225905.0130611s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006801202DNAL7 a2398582aris7 a10113/569172hdl7 a10.1186/1471-2229-10-1142doi7 aPMC30177702pmcid7 a205657892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabber, John H.10aIdentifying new lignin bioengineering targets: 1.

Current plant biotechnology efforts are primarily aimed at manipulating the biosynthesis of normal monolignols, but in the future apoplastic targeting of phenolics from other metabolic pathways may provide new approaches for designing lignins that are less inhibitory toward the enzymatic hydrolysis of structural polysaccharides, both with and without biomass pretreatment. To identify promising new avenues for lignin bioengineering, we artificially lignified cell walls from maize cell suspensions with various combinations of normal monolignols (coniferyl and sinapyl alcohols) plus a variety of phenolic monolignol substitutes. Cell walls were then incubated in vitro with anaerobic rumen microflora to assess the potential impact of lignin modifications on the enzymatic degradability of fibrous crops used for ruminant livestock or biofuel production. In the absence of anatomical constraints to digestion, lignification with normal monolignols hindered both the rate and extent of cell wall hydrolysis by rumen microflora. Inclusion of methyl caffeate, caffeoylquinic acid, or feruloylquinic acid with monolignols considerably depressed lignin formation and strikingly improved the degradability of cell walls. In contrast, dihydroconiferyl alcohol, guaiacyl glycerol, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate readily formed copolymer-lignins with normal monolignols; cell wall degradability was moderately enhanced by greater hydroxylation or 1,2,3-triol functionality. Mono- or diferuloyl esters with various aliphatic or polyol groups readily copolymerized with monolignols, but in some cases they accelerated inactivation of wall-bound peroxidase and reduced lignification; cell wall degradability was influenced by lignin content and the degree of ester group hydroxylation. Overall, monolignol substitutes improved the inherent degradability of non-pretreated cell walls by restricting lignification or possibly by reducing lignin hydrophobicity or cross-linking to structural polysaccharides. Furthermore some monolignol substitutes, chiefly readily cleaved bi-phenolic conjugates like epigallocatechin gallate or diferuloyl polyol esters, are expected to greatly boost the enzymatic degradability of cell walls following chemical pretreatment. In ongoing work, we are characterizing the enzymatic saccharification of intact and chemically pretreated cell walls lignified by these and other monolignol substitutes to identify promising genetic engineering targets for improving plant fiber utilization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiochemical pathways 3abioengineering 3abiosynthesis 3acaffeic acid 3acarbohydrate structure 3acell suspension culture 3acell walls 3aconiferyl alcohol 3acorn 3acrops 3acrosslinking 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aepicatechin 3aepigallocatechin 3aesters 3afermentation 3agenetic engineering 3aglycerol 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroxylation 3alignification 3alignin 3alivestock production 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3aplant fibers 3apolysaccharides 3aquinic acid 3arumen 3arumen microorganisms 3aruminants 3asaccharification 3astructure-activity relationships1 aSchatz, Paul F.1 aKim, Hun,1 aLu, Fachuang1 aRalph, John0 tBMC Plant Biology.g2010, wJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/569173Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-10-114  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Identifying%20new%20lignin%20bioengineering%20targets-Monolognol-substitute%20impacts%20on%20lignin%20formation%20and%20cell%20wall%20fermentability_239858_11Jun13.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245018600163300001400349520137300363592002801736650001401764650002201778650001401800650001201814650001801826650001401844650002101858650002601879650002101905650001201926653001801938653002401956653001401980653003301994700002202027700001802049700002002067700002402087700002002111773009202131856008502223852000902308655001202317IND60552065120221120062932.0161020e20140120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055206512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bo14aThe availability of glucose to CHO cells affects the intracellular lipid-linked oligosaccharide distribution, site occupancy and the N-glycosylation profile of a monoclonal antibody  ap. 17-27.  aThe glycosylation pattern of a chimeric heavy chain antibody (EG2) produced from CHO cells was affected by the glucose concentration (0–25mM) of cultures established at high density (>106ml–1) over 24h. The resulting proportion of non-glycosylated Mab was directly correlated to the exposure time of cells to media depleted of glucose. Deprivation of glucose for the full 24h resulted in a 45% non-glycosylated Mab fraction.Analysis of steady state levels of intracellular lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) showed that under glucose limitation there was a reduction in the amount of full length LLO (Glc3Man9GlcNac2), with a concomitant increase in the smaller mannosyl-glycans (Man2–5GlcNAc2). Glycan microheterogeneity was quantified by galactosylation and sialylation indices (GI and SI) which showed a direct correlation to the cell specific glucose uptake. The GI increased to 0.83 following media supplementation with a cocktail of uridine, manganese and galactose. This is significantly higher than for a fully humanized antibody (DP12) produced under the similar conditions or for similar antibodies reported in the literature. The high GI of the chimeric antibody (EG2) may be due to its low molecular weight and unusual structure. These findings are important in relation to the low substrate that may occur in fed-batch cultures for Mab production.  aPublisher supplied data 3achimerism 3aexposure duration 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aglycosylation 3amanganese 3amolecular weight 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aoligosaccharides 3auridine 0aGlycosylation 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aCHO cells 0aLipid-linked oligosaccharide1 aSpearman, Maureen1 aDoering, John1 aLattová, Erica1 aPerreault, Hélène1 aButler, Michael0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2014 Jan. 20, v. 170 p.17-27dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005900094040001800153100002200171245014500193300001600338520135900354592002801713650002001741650001101761650001301772650001801785650001501803650001301818650001101831650001101842650001601853650001301869650001001882651001001892653001901902653002101921653001801942653001601960700001901976700002101995773010702016856007302123852000902196655001202205IND60773222920221119065521.0220412e20071201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077322292DNAL7 a10.2980/1195-6860(2007)14%5B507:CROGAE%5D2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJump, Alistair S.10aClimate relationships of growth and establishment across the altitudinal range of Fagus sylvatica in the Montseny Mountains, northeast Spain  ap. 507-518.  aA rise in elevation of the temperate biome has been reported in the mountains of northeast Spain. We aimed to determine the principal climatic factors limiting growth and establishment of the dominant temperate tree, Fagus sylvatica, across its altitudinal range and how its climate-response has varied over time. We determined the climate-response of the growth of adult trees and the establishment of juveniles using dendroecological methods at 3 sites along an elevational gradient spanning this species' full altitudinal distribution of approximately 1000–1650 m above sea level. We found strong altitudinal variation in growth and establishment responses to climate. The most common growth response was to high spring and summer temperature (April—July), which promoted growth and establishment at the upper treeline but had the opposite effect at low altitudes. Precipitation was strongly limiting for adult growth at the lower limit of F. sylvatica and declined in importance with increasing altitude. Sensitivity of growth to summer temperature increased over the second half of the 20th century. Future increases in summer temperature are likely to have negative consequences for growth and establishment at this species' low altitude, low latitude range-edge, particularly if temperature increase is not matched by increasing precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3aadults 3aaltitude 3adendroecology 3aecosystems 3alatitude 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atreeline 3atrees 3aSpain 0aclimate change 0ageographic range 0aMediterranean 0atree growth1 aHunt, Jenny M.1 aPeñuelas, Josep0 tEÌcoscience.g2007 Dec. 1, v. 14, no. 4 p.507-518dTaylor & FranciswJournal:28412x2376-76267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2980/1195-6860(2007)14%5B507:CROGAE%5D2.0.CO;2  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245011000212300001800322520146700340592002801807650002301835650002301858650002401881650001901905650001501924650001501939650001601954650001301970650001001983650004301993650002102036653004202057653002702099773013702126856008502263852000902348655001202357IND60748107920221120232418.0211114e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074810792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2021.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Khoury, Charbel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0977-124210aCan colonization by an endophytic fungus transform a plant into a challenging host for insect herbivores?  ap. 1009-1016.  aEndophytic growth of arthropod pathogenic fungi can parasitize insect herbivores without causing damage to the crop. However, studies addressing this tritrophic interaction are absent. Here, the endophytic arthropod pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordyciptaceae), the polyphagous two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Trombidiformes: Tetranychidae), and its preferred plant host Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabales: Fabaceae) were selected to study the multi-kingdom interactions among plants, arthropods, and entomopathogenic fungi. Real-Time PCR analysis of nine defense-related genes revealed that a broad range of plant defense mechanisms is activated in response to the endophytic growth of B. bassiana. Moreover, we studied the molecular mechanism adapted by the two-spotted spider mite that underlies resistance. The analysis of 41 detoxification genes revealed that relatively moderate, high, and few numbers of genes were changed in the adults, nymphs, and eggs stages of T. urticae, respectively, after inoculation on colonized tissues of P. vulgaris. The endophytic growth of B. bassiana can have a negative effect on the growth and performance of the pest, in a developmental stage-dependent manner, by priming plant defense pathways. In parallel, the herbivore induces a broad range of detoxification genes that could potentially be involved in adaptation to endophytically colonized plant tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aTetranychus urticae 3aTrombidiformes 3aarthropods 3aendophytes 3ahost plants 3amycology 3apests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3avirulent strains 0aEndophytic arthropod pathogenic fungi 0aTritrophic interaction0 tFungal biology.g2021 Dec., v. 125, no. 12 p.1009-1016dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2021.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245004500166300001000211520119000221592002801411650001101439650001901450650001401469650001201483650001301495650001601508650001401524650001601538650001601554650001901570650001101589650001901600651001001619651001001629651001101639700001801650773010101668856008201769852000901851655001201860IND60679794020221120145103.0200211e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067979402DNAL7 a10.1007/s12225-018-9762-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandrein, Sven12aA monograph of Caprifoliaceae: Linnaeeae  ap. 1.  aTribe Linnaeeae is a diverse group disjunctly distributed in the northern hemisphere between China and Japan and Mexico.

The adaptive expectations geometric lag model is generalized by geometrically including quadratic lag terms indicative of risk. The computation of consistent estimators is described, and the model is applied in the analysis of California field‐crop supply response. Results indicate that the effects of stabilization (possibly associated with government programs) might have seriously offset the acreage‐reducing effects of voluntary acreage restrictions. Finally, more general implications relating to reduced‐form estimation of the standard Nerlovian model are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacreage 3aagricultural economics 3afarmers' attitudes 3afield crops 3ageometry 3agovernmental programs and projects 3amodels 3arisk 3aCalifornia0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1974 Feb., v. 56, no. 1 p.14-25dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12393433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245014400178300001400322520196500336592002802301650001702329650001402346650002502360650001502385650002002400650001902420650001502439650001802454650002502472650001202497650001502509650003702524650001702561650001802578650001602596650001302612650002002625650001302645653002402658653002002682653002902702653002102731653002702752653003702779700002302816700006402839773008902903856008102992852000903073655001203082IND60528551720221118103451.0160716e20160530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052855172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2016.03.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNika, Chrysanthi-Elisabeth10aPlastic pellets sorptive extraction: Low-cost, rapid and efficient extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from environmental waters  ap. 30-36.  aFor the first time, plastic pellets, a low-cost and easy to reach industrial raw material, are reported as an efficient sorbent material for the laboratory extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from environmental waters. The proposed methodology, termed plastic pellets sorptive extraction (P2SE), consisted of a two-step procedure whereby target analytes were initially adsorbed onto the surface of three low-density polyethylene (LDPE) pellets and then desorbed using microliters of an organic solvent. Interphase mass transfer was greatly accelerated by means of vortex agitation. Organic extracts were analyzed by means of liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. Different experimental parameters were controlled and the optimum conditions found were: three LDPE pellets (∼80 mg) added to 20 mL aqueous sample (20% w:v NaCl) followed by vortex agitation at 3000 rpm; for desorption, the three LDPE pellets were immersed in 100 μL of acetonitrile and the mixture was shaken at 3000 rpm for 5 min using the vortex agitator. The calculated calibration curves gave high levels of linearity yielding coefficients of determination (r2) greater than 0.9913. The precision of the proposed method was found to be good and the limits of the detection were calculated in the low ng L−1 level. Matrix effects were determined by applying the proposed method to spiked river water, treated municipal wastewater and seawater samples. To compensate for the low recoveries of the more hydrophobic PAHs in spiked effluent wastewater and seawater samples the standard addition methodology was applied. The proposed method was applied to the determination of target pollutants in real seawater samples using the standard addition method. Overall, the performance of the proposed P2SE method suggests that the use of inexpensive and easy to reach sorbent materials for extracting analytes in the laboratory merits more intensive investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aagitation 3aanalytical chemistry 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3ahydrophobicity 3ainterphase 3amass transfer 3amunicipal wastewater 3apellets 3apollutants 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolyethylene 3araw materials 3ariver water 3aseawater 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 0aSorptive extraction 0aPlastic pellets 0aLow-density polyethylene 0aVortex agitation 0aEnvironmental analysis 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aYiantzi, Evangelia1 aPsillakis, Elefteria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5867-39400 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2016 May 30, v. 922 p.30-36dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2016.03.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008600164300001600250520117800266592002801444650002401472650001501496650002501511650001701536650001601553650001601569650001901585650004301604650002801647650002201675650001301697650001601710650003301726650002001759650001701779650001501796653001501811653001801826653001601844653003001860653002501890653002601915700001901941700001801960700001601978700002501994700001602019773015402035856008202189852000902271655001202280IND60543129020221118164051.0190409e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054312902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2014.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeladino, L.10aCorn starch systems as carriers for yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) antioxidants  ap. 463-472.  aCorn starch's ability to bind and carry a yerba mate extract with strong antioxidant properties was explored in this paper. The starch was treated by high hydrostatic pressure to increase its loading capacity and scanning electron microscopy revealed that the high pressure treatment altered the shape of starch granules and changed their surface appearance. High pressure caused partial granule gelatinization as determined by calorimetric measurements, also increasing the granule specific surface area, as quantified by nitrogen adsorption. This increase in surface was due to the generation of pores, which favored the adsorption of the yerba mate hydrosoluble polyphenols. The yerba mate polyphenol concentration in the starch carriers was determined by HPLC-MS and its antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH radical and photochemiluminiscense (PCL) methods. Treated starches incorporated a higher amount of yerba mate polyphenols, however, native starch could be an appropriate antioxidant carrier as well. Furthermore, it was found that the antioxidant activity was maintained after high pressure treatment without changing the yerba mate polyphenols profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIlex paraguariensis 3aadsorption 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acalorimetry 3acorn starch 3agelatinization 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amass spectrometry 3anitrogen 3apolyphenols 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch granules 3asurface area 3ayerba mate 0aYerba mate 0aEncapsulation 0aCorn starch 0aHigh hydrostatic pressure 0aAntioxidant activity 0aSpecific surface area1 aTeixeira, A.S.1 aNavarro, A.S.1 aAlvarez, I.1 aMolina-García, A.D.1 aMartino, M.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2015 Apr., v. 94 p.463-472dElsevier B.V.aThe Institution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2014.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01341naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245006300162300001600225500002000241520037600261592002800637650002700665650002200692650002000714650001100734650002200745650001500767700002200782773014300804856007100947852000901018655001201027IND60680249420221122075806.0200104e197402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068024942DNAL7 a10.2307/12393542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSporleder, Thomas L.10aCredit Card Purchasing and Static Consumer Behavior Theory  ap. 129-134.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article treats the theoretical consequences of consumer credit card use.

As climate change is predicted to modify the temperature and precipitation regimes throughout the range of the species, it is important to understand how climate has impacted the growth of the species in the past to predict how it may be affected in the future. However, limited research has been conducted on the growth responses of A. saccharum to climate in the western half of the species range. Because climate varies substantially over the range of A. saccharum, becoming warmer and drier at sites in the west and south, there is a need for additional research in this portion of the range. A dendroecological study was conducted at sites in Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, and Missouri to determine how past variation in temperature and precipitation has affected A. saccharum growth, and how these growth responses varied spatially and temporally. Acer saccharum radial growth correlated strongest with maximum temperature, precipitation, and Palmer Drought Severity Index during the months of June–August of the year the annual growth ring formed. The strength of the growth-climate correlations with June–August precipitation: maximum temperature ratios decreased over the last century. Climate had a stronger impact on radial growth at the study sites in the western part of its range compared to eastern populations examined in other studies. However, differences in growth-climate correlations across a latitudinal gradient did not show a consistent pattern of variation along the climate gradient. These results suggest that A. saccharum populations in the western part of the species range may be more vulnerable to increasing temperature, drought frequency, and drought intensity compared to populations in the eastern part of the species range.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer saccharum 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adendroecology 3adrought 3agrowth rings 3aoverstory 3atemperature 3atrees 3aIndiana 3aKentucky 3aMichigan 3aMissouri1 aLeBlanc, David0 tJournal of the Torrey Botanical Society.g2020 July 31, v. 147, no. 3 p.232-242dTorrey Botanical SocietywJournal:jnl55516x1940-06167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3159/TORREY-D-19-00049.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245017800205300001600383506007600399520134000475592002801815596005901843596007901902596009001981506003702071650001202108650002202120650001202142650001402154650001202168650002202180650001602202650001202218650003102230650001702261650001802278650001102296650001302307650001202320650001802332650001502350650001802365650002002383650001302403650001302416700001702429700001502446700002002461700001502481700001802496700001902514700001402533700001802547700001402565700001502579773010402594856008202698852000902780655001202789IND60590189520221207131254.0210106e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059018952DNAL7 a292997972pmid7 aPMC58470602pmcid7 a10.1007/s10646-017-1885-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Huilin10aTranscriptome assembly and expression profiling of the molecular responses to cadmium toxicity in cerebral ganglia of wolf spider Pardosa pseudoannulata (Araneae: Lycosidae)  ap. 198-208.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal that can cause irreversible toxicity to animals, and is an environmental pollutant in farmlands. Spiders are considered to be an excellent model for investigating the impacts of heavy metals on the environment. To date, the changes at the molecular level in the cerebral ganglia of spiders are poorly understood. Cd exposure leads to strong damage in the nervous system, such as apoptosis and necrosis of nerve cells, therefore we conducted a transcriptomic analysis of Pardosa pseudoannulata cerebral ganglia under Cd stress to profile differential gene expression (DGE). We obtained a total of 123,328 assembled unigenes, and 1441 Cd stress-associated DEGs between the Cd-treated and control groups. Expression profile analysis demonstrated that many genes involved in calcium signaling, cGMP—PKG signaling, tyrosine metabolism, phototransduction–fly, melanogenesis and isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis were up-regulated under Cd stress, whereas oxidative phosphorylation-related, nervous disease-associated, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-associated, and ribosomal-associated genes were down-regulated. Here, we provide a comprehensive set of DEGs influenced by Cd stress, and heavy metal stress, and provide new information for elucidating the neurotoxic mechanisms of Cd stress in spiders.  aPublisher supplied data  a31472017cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2014FJ2003cProject of Science and Technology Department of Hunan Province  aCAAS-ASTIP-2017-IBFCcAgricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPardosa 3aagricultural land 3aanimals 3aapoptosis 3acadmium 3acalcium signaling 3afatty liver 3aganglia 3agene expression regulation 3aheavy metals 3amelanogenesis 3amodels 3anecrosis 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3apollutants 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atyrosine 3aunigenes1 aPeng, Yuande1 aShi, Yixue1 aTian, Jianxiang1 aWang, Juan1 aPeng, Xianjin1 aXie, Chunliang1 aXu, Xiang1 aSong, Qisheng1 aWang, Zhi1 aLv, Zhiyue0 tEcotoxicology.g2018 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.198-208dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-017-1885-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016200165300001300327520148400340592002801824650001301852650000901865650001601874650002101890650001101911650001701922650002401939650001201963650002001975651001201995700001802007700002302025773010902048856008102157852000902238655001202247IND60091423520221116224603.0141211e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009142352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-014-2203-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Jialiang10aSaltwater Upconing Below a Pumping Well in an Inland Aquifer: a Theoretical Modeling Study on Testing Different Scenarios of Deep Saline-Groundwater Pathways  ap. 2203.  aTo date, studies on the geological conditions in inland aquifers leading to pathways for upwelling deep saline groundwater due to pumping have not been published yet. Therefore, this paper conducted a theoretical modeling study to raise two hypotheses about deep saline-groundwater pathways leading to saltwater upconing below a pumping well in an inland aquifer based on the field situation at the Beelitzhof waterworks in southwestern Berlin (Germany), defined as follows: (1) there are windows in the Rupelian clay caused by glacial erosion, where their locations are uncertain, and (2) there are no windows in the clay, but the clay is partially thinned out but not completely removed by glacial erosion, so salt can merely come through the clay upward by diffusion and eventually accumulate on its top. These hypotheses were tested to demonstrate the impact of the lateral distance between windows in the clay and the well, as well as salt diffusion through the clay depending on its thickness on saltwater intrusion in the pumping well, respectively, using a density-dependent groundwater flow and solute transport model. Hypothesis 1 was validated with four scenarios that windows could occur in the clay at the site, and their locations under some conditions could significantly cause saltwater intrusion, while hypothesis 2 could be excluded, because salt diffusion through the clay with thickness greater than 1 m at the site was not able to cause saltwater intrusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclay 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amodels 3asaline water 3asaltwater intrusion 3asolutes 3awater utilities 3aGermany1 aTaute, Thomas1 aSchneider, Michael0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2014 Nov., v. 225, no. 11 p.2203-2203dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-014-2203-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012300171520160400294592002801898650002601926650001601952650001401968650001101982650001101993650001902004650001702023650001302040650001902053650001302072650001802085650002502103650001502128653001402143653002102157653001602178653001902194653002702213700001702240700001802257700005602275700001502331773011802346856008302464852000902547655001202556IND60765932420221121091536.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076593242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2022.1019482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuarino, Salvatore10aBeta-ionone increases catches of Lasioderma serricorne (F.)

(Coleoptera: Anobiidae), is an important stored product pest increasingly impacting museums and herbaria. Monitoring methods make use of pheromone traps which can be implemented using chili fruit powder as food attractant. Further laboratory studies evidenced that the main cues involved in this attraction are the terpenoids α-ionone and β-ionone. In this study a trap bioassay was carried out in a bread plant with pheromone traps added with α-ionone or β-ionone at different doses to evaluate the possible enhance of captures determined by such odorants in comparison with traps loaded with the synthetic pheromone alone. Furthermore, in order to optimize the type of device used, the chemical that elicited the highest performance was tested using two types of dispenser: a polyethylene and a silicone one. The results indicated that pheromone traps with the addition of β-ionone at the dose of 10 mg captured the highest amount of L. serricorne adults and significantly more than traps loaded with pheromone alone or with pheromone plus α-ionone. Differently, captures of pheromone traps supplemented with α-ionone didn't differ statistically from those baited solely with the synthetic pheromone. Moreover, the traps baited with β-ionone loaded in polyethylene dispenser allowed a higher number of catches of the adults of the beetle in comparison with those obtained using silicone dispenser. Data indicate that this co-attractant can be exploited to increase sensitivity for monitoring, and/or for mass trapping L. serricorne adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLasioderma serricorne 3abeta-ionone 3abioassays 3abreads 3afruits 3aodor compounds 3apolyethylene 3aresearch 3asex pheromones 3asilicone 3astorage pests 3asynthetic pheromones 3aterpenoids 0aα-ionone 0aCigarette beetle 0aSerricornin 0aSemiochemicals 0aPolyethylene dispenser1 aBasile, Sara1 aRanno, Pietro1 aSuma, Pompeo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6082-79641 aPeri, Ezio0 tJournal of stored products research.g2022 Mar., v. 96 p.101948-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2022.1019483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014500172300001600317520173700333592002802070650001102098650001202109650002102121650002002142650001402162650001602176650001202192650002202204650001502226650001402241651001302255653001702268653004302285653002102328653001202349653001202361700002302373700001702396773010202413856008702515852000902602655001202611IND60532126220221123045217.0170713e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053212622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParente, Joana10aSpace-time clustering analysis of wildfires: The influence of dataset characteristics, fire prevention policy decisions, weather and climate  ap. 151-165.  aThe present study focuses on the dependence of the space–time permutation scan statistics (STPSS) (1) on the input database's characteristics and (2) on the use of this methodology to assess changes on the fire regime due to different type of climate and fire management activities. Based on the very strong relationship between weather and the fire incidence in Portugal, the detected clusters will be interpreted in terms of the atmospheric conditions. Apart from being the country most affected by the fires in the European context, Portugal meets all the conditions required to carry out this study, namely: (i) two long and comprehensive official datasets, i.e. the Portuguese Rural Fire Database (PRFD) and the National Mapping Burnt Areas (NMBA), respectively based on ground and satellite measurements; (ii) the two types of climate (Csb in the north and Csa in the south) that characterizes the Mediterranean basin regions most affected by the fires also divide the mainland Portuguese area; and, (iii) the national plan for the defence of forest against fires was approved a decade ago and it is now reasonable to assess its impacts. Results confirmed (1) the influence of the dataset's characteristics on the detected clusters, (2) the existence of two different fire regimes in the country promoted by the different types of climate, (3) the positive impacts of the fire prevention policy decisions and (4) the ability of the STPSS to correctly identify clusters, regarding their number, location, and space-time size in spite of eventual space and/or time splits of the datasets. Finally, the role of the weather on days when clustered fires were active was confirmed for the classes of small, medium and large fires.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3adatabases 3afire regime 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3asatellites 3awildfires 3aPortugal 0aForest fires 0aSpace-time permutation scan statistics 0aCluster analysis 0aWeather 0aClimate1 aPereira, Mário G.1 aTonini, Marj0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 July 15, v. 559 p.151-165dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012300160300002000283520142200303592002801725650002301753650002901776650001001805650002201815650001501837650001401852650001701866650001201883650001401895650000901909650001501918651001001933700001601943700001601959773016901975856008202144852000902226655001202235IND60579638320221119151859.0180619e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057963832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9646-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, He10aOccurrence and risk assessment of phthalate esters (PAEs) in agricultural soils of the Sanjiang Plain, northeast China  ap. 19723-19732.  aThis study looks at the pollution status of six priority control phthalate esters (PAEs) under different cultivation of agricultural soils in the Sanjiang Plain, northeast China. Results show the total concentration of PAEs ranged from 162.9 to 946.9 μg kg⁻¹ with an average value of 369.5 μg kg⁻¹. PAE concentrations in three types of cultivated soils exhibited decreasing order paddy field (532.1 ± 198.1 μg kg⁻¹) > vegetable field (308.2 ± 87.5 μg kg⁻¹) > bean field (268.2 ± 48.3 μg kg⁻¹). Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) were the most abundant PAEs congeners. Compared with previous studies, agricultural soils in the Sanjiang Plain showed relatively low contamination levels. Anthropogenic activities such as cultivation practices and industrial emissions were associated with the distribution pattern of PAEs. Furthermore, human health risks of PAEs were estimated and the non-cancer risk shown negligible but carcinogenic risk of DEHP exceeded the threshold limits value. PAE contaminants originated from cultivation practices and intense anthropogenic activities result in placing the agricultural soils under a potential risk to human health and also to ecosystems in the Sanjiang Plain. Therefore, the contamination status of PAEs in agricultural soil and potential impacts on human health should attract considerable attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aanthropogenic activities 3abeans 3adibutyl phthalate 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3ahuman health 3apaddies 3apollution 3arisk 3avegetables 3aChina1 aLiang, Hong1 aGao, Da-Wen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Aug., v. 24, no. 24 p.19723-19732dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9646-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04364naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245013100211300002000342506007600362520271200438592002803150506003703178650001203215650001203227650002103239650001303260650001303273650001103286650002303297650001103320650001603331650001403347650002603361650001003387650001703397650000903414650001103423650001503434650000903449650000903458650000903467650001203476650000903488651001103497700002103508700002103529773016903550856008203719852000903801655001203810IND60579638420221207113551.0180619e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057963842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9531-22doi7 aPMC55707922pmcid7 a286853312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKicińska, Alicja,10aHeavy metals in sands of sandboxes: health risk associated with their quantities and form of occurrence in some spas of Poland  ap. 19733-19748.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe authors dealt with some hazardous elements, i.e. As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, contained in sands of the sandboxes localized in playgrounds of seven spas in southern Poland (CEE). The following determinations were made: the total contents of metals, the most mobile metals (water-leachable fraction) and the metals available to plants and organisms (CaCl₂- and EDTA-extractable fractions). The totals of the metals are below the upper limits of the values recommended for soils of the protected areas (type A). The mobility of the metals is low: the forms leachable with water range from 0.7% of the total content (TC) of Pb to 13.4% TC of Cd. The forms available to living organisms contain considerably higher quantities of the metals: from 2.3% TC of Ni to 22.6% TC of As in CaCl₂-extractable fractions and from 0.7% TC of Cr to 82% TC of As in EDTA-extractable fractions. An assessment of the health risk indicates that children are exposed to the metals present in the sandboxes mostly due to inadvertent swallowing of “dirt” from their hands. The highest are the HQᵢₙgₑₛₜᵢₒₙ indexes of As and Cr, both for the 3-year-old permanent spa residents (5.74E−02 and 1.71E−02, respectively) and the spa visitors of the same age (7.47E−03 and 2.22E−03, respectively) and the 6-year-old residents (4.31E−02 and 1.28E−02, respectively) and visitors (5.60E−03 and 1.66E−03, respectively). The health risk indexes HI in the case of non-cancerogenic substances for children 3 and 6 years old are for spa residents, 9.59E−02 and 7.19E−02, respectively, and for children visitors, who are exposed to environmental factors for a much shorter time than the residents, 1.25E−02 and 9.35E−03, respectively. All the risk indexes have their values significantly below 1, which proves the lack of deleterious effects resulting from the exposition of children to the elements considered. The children of both age groups, exposed to the cancerogenic substances, are endangered mainly by As. The risk values of the cancerogenic As for 3- and 6-year-old children residents are 1.27E−06 and 1.90E−06, respectively, and for children visitors of the same ages 1.65E−07 and 2.47E−07, respectively. These values are significantly lower than a permissible level of "1∙10E-05" and means that also in this case, the health risk is minimal. The risk values calculated for the remaining metals are much lower and follow the sequence Cr > Co > Cd. However, an adverse impact of some sand-contained pollutants that are attributed to the motor traffic (Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Co and Pb) and low emissions (mainly As and Cd) has been established in the spa resorts in question.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acalcium chloride 3achildren 3achromium 3acobalt 3aconservation areas 3acopper 3adeglutition 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3ahands 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anickel 3apollutants 3arisk 3asand 3asoil 3atraffic 3azinc 3aPoland1 aMamak, Magdalena1 aSkrzypek, Monika0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Aug., v. 24, no. 24 p.19733-19748dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9531-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245014800177506011700325506007600442520118100518592002801699506003701727650002201764650001801786650001601804650002801820650001901848650001201867650001201879650000901891650002501900650001501925653002001940653001501960653001601975653001801991653001802009700003102027700005302058773012502111856008202236852000902318655001202327IND60765932520221207114234.0220411e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076593252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1131062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulla, Mehrajfatema Zafar10aFunctionalization of legume proteins using high pressure processing: Effect on technofunctional properties and digestibility of legume proteins  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is an increasing awareness and demand for a new plant-based protein food category in the market. Among different sources, protein derived from legumes are considered GRAS (generally recognized as safe) and used predominantly in the vegan diet. However, these proteins are hard to digest and require functionalization like high-pressure processing to make them more palatable and digestible. High-pressure processing or high hydrostatic pressure processing (HPP) is one of the emerging technologies to process legume proteins with a marginal impact on its sensorial, physical and nutritional properties. Such functionalized legume proteins could modulate the rheological and functional properties like emulsification potential, foaming capacity, surface hydrophobicity and water holding capacity. This could be said as similar to meat and widens the scope of commercialization of plant-based meat analogs. This review aims to summarize the recent findings in the application of high-pressure techniques; especially on different proteins derived from legume seeds with the aim to focus on its effect on rheological, thermal, functional, digestive and bioactive properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acommercialization 3adigestibility 3aemulsifying 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ahydrophobicity 3alegumes 3amarkets 3ameat 3aplant source protein 3avegan diet 0aLegume proteins 0aThixotropy 0aAntioxidant 0aHyrophobicity 0aDigestibility1 aSubramanian, Parthasarathi1 aDar, B.N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4120-36160 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 158 p.113106-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1131063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012000159300002200279520145300301592002801754650002101782650001601803650002501819650002801844650002101872650001501893650001701908650001201925650003101937650003101968650001301999650002402012650001702036650001202053700001702065700002402082700001902106700001802125700002002143700002502163700002402188700002302212700001802235773012702253856007402380852000902454655001202463IND60641399220221123040628.0190505e20161121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064139922DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra24398c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Kian Keat10aTailored activated carbons for supercapacitors derived from hydrothermally carbonized sugars by chemical activation  ap. 110629-110641.  aActivated carbons (ACs) are actively researched as electrode materials for supercapacitors and there is a significant interest to produce ACs from sustainable and low cost precursors. In this study, various ACs were prepared from hydrothermally carbonized sugars by KOH activation. Both the hydrothermal carbonization and activation processes were optimized to tailor the properties (e.g. textural properties, chemical composition, N-doping, electrical conductivity) of the ACs. For instance, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (SBET) were tuned in the range of 800–3000 m² g⁻¹ with associated variation in the extent of microporosity and pore size distributions (PSDs). The ACs were evaluated electrochemically as materials for supercapacitor electrodes in a symmetrical two-electrode cell using an aqueous electrolyte. The relationship between the electrochemical, textural, electrical, and physicochemical properties were analyzed systematically to understand the key factors determining the electrochemical performance. A high specific capacitance (Cₘ) of ∼260 F g⁻¹ was achieved at a moderately high SBET of ∼1300 m² g⁻¹, which was equivalent to a Cₘ/SBET of 20 μF cm⁻², for an optimal AC prepared from hydrothermally carbonized glucose. The very high surface-specific capacitance highlights that the specific surface area is certainly not the sole limiting parameter for effective electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acapacitance 3achemical composition 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aglucose 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporosity 3apotassium hydroxide 3asurface area 3atexture1 aHao, Wenming1 aGustafsson, Mikaela1 aTai, Cheuk-Wai1 aMorin, Daniel1 aBjörkman, Eva,1 aLilliestråle, Malte1 aBjörefors, Fredrik1 aAndersson, Anna M.1 aHedin, Niklas0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 21, v. 6, no. 112 p.110629-110641dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra24398c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245012600163520201200289592002802301650002002329650002302349650001702372650001202389650002202401650001402423650001602437650002002453650002102473650001502494651001702509653004002526653002202566653001902588653003702607653002302644700001702667700005902684700001802743700001802761700005302779700002002832700001802852773010502870856008602975852000903061655001203070IND60717068820221121023516.0211017e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071706882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yi10aElucidating the effects of mega reservoir on watershed drought tolerance based on a drought propagation analytical method  aAs a large control project in a river basin, mega reservoir has obvious influences on hydrological process, and is also very important to drought risk management. However, how much mega reservoir has improved the drought tolerance of the watershed is still an unsolved question. To end this, we explored the effects of mega reservoir on watershed drought tolerance from the perspective of drought propagation in this study. Firstly, the drought propagation characteristics before and after reservoir construction were calculated to reveal the influences of mega reservoir on propagation process from meteorological to hydrological drought. Then, based on drought propagation characteristics and the Bayesian network, a novel drought propagation threshold model was proposed and calculated the cumulative precipitation deficit thresholds that triggered different levels of hydrological drought before and after the reservoir was built, respectively, and the sensitivity of the response of hydrological drought to meteorological drought was also explored based on the Bayesian network model. Finally, we further comparatively analyzed the effects of environment change and mega reservoir on watershed drought tolerance to verify the reliability of the results. The upper Yellow river basin (UYRB) was selected as a case study. Results indicated that (1) mega reservoir could delay the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought in the UYRB, and this effect was weakening with the increase of the distance from hydrological station to the reservoir; (2) the construction and operation of mega reservoir enhanced the drought tolerance of the UYRB, and the probability of severe hydrological drought in the downstream of the reservoir was significantly reduced; (3) environment change accelerated the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought and had a negative effect on drought tolerance in the UYRB, while mega reservoir could effectively resist the influence of environment change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aanalytical methods 3acase studies 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3ahydrology 3aprobability 3arisk management 3athreshold models 3awatersheds 3aYellow River 0aDrought propagation threshold model 0aDrought tolerance 0aMega reservoir 0aCumulative precipitation deficit 0aEnvironment change1 aHuang, Qiang1 aHuang, Shengzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5287-379X1 aLeng, Guoyong1 aZheng, Xudong1 aFang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5616-16451 aDeng, Mingjiang1 aSong, Songbai0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 July, v. 598 p.125738-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.1257383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008900167300001600256520158400272592002801856650001501884650001801899650001201917650001201929650002101941650000901962650001701971650001701988650002902005650001002034650001402044650000902058650001202067650002302079650001302102650001502115650001402130650001102144650000902155650000902164651001002173700002202183700002002205700002202225700002102247773010402268856008202372852000902454655001202463IND60590189820221120120422.0210106e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059018982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-018-1906-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFilippi, Silvia10aGenetic effects in Helix aspersa near a coal plant revealed by the micronucleus test  ap. 234-243.  aCoal plants can be a major source of mutagenic pollutants. In this study we used the common land snail Helix aspersa, to detect the mutagenic effect of pollution from a coal plant in central Italy applying the micronucleus test (MN) on snail’s haemocytes and evaluating trace elements concentration (As Cd, Pb, Hg, and Zn) in soil and snails. Snails from a biological farm were exposed for 13 days in five locations at different distances from the plant. Wild snails collected in the same locations were also analysed. MN frequency in exposed snails was significantly higher in four locations within 10 km from to the plant, with respect to the control and the farthest location. Comparing the MN frequency between farmed and wild snails, a significantly higher frequency emerged for the exposed snails in all locations except the farthest, likely indicating adaptation or selection of the wild organisms due to chronic exposure to pollutants. In natural snails significantly higher MN frequencies with near the plant emerged as well. Trace elements analysis showed significant correlations between MN frequencies and both Zn and As concentrations in soil, for both exposed and wild snails, and Zn and Pb concentrations in exposed snails. Our results were consistent with those previously obtained when evaluating primary DNA damage in natural snails from the same area and show that the snails near the plant were affected by a permanent cytogenetic damage. Moreover, they confirm the suitability of snails for biomonitoring the presence of pollutants with mutagenic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aHelix aspersa 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achronic exposure 3acoal 3acommon lands 3acytogenetics 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afarms 3ahemocytes 3alead 3amercury 3amicronucleus tests 3amutagens 3apollutants 3apollution 3asnails 3asoil 3azinc 3aItaly1 aMeschini, Roberta1 aSpognardi, Sara1 aPapetti, Patrizia1 aAngeletti, Dario0 tEcotoxicology.g2018 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.234-243dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870048x0963-92927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-018-1906-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245011000163300001400273520149000287592002801777650001301805650001601818650001101834650001901845650000901864650001801873650001001891650001101901650001601912650001201928650001301940651001601953653001601969653002001985653001802005653001402023653001602037653001002053653001702063653002102080700001402101700001602115773012602131856005102257852000902308655001202317IND50087668020221119151607.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008766802DNAL7 a10.1080/00288233.2010.5354882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoss, RA10aEffect of herbage species and renewal technique on the free living stages of gastro-intestinal roundworms  ap. 15-22.  aThis experiment assessed the effect of commonly used pasture species and their establishment technique on endoparasites on herbage in Canterbury, New Zealand. Pasture plots were artificially contaminated with lamb faeces with a known endoparasite egg count. Subsequent treatments included retaining the original pasture, replacing the pasture immediately with new pasture via cultivation or direct-drilling, replacing the pasture immediately with a brassica via cultivation or direct drilling, or replacing the pasture immediately with a barley grain crop via cultivation. Brassica and grain crops were later replaced with new pasture. Herbages were harvested and dry matter (DM) yield and numbers and species of endoparasites (L₃) were determined. Pasture and brassica establishment technique had no effect on herbage production. The old pasture initially contained more L₃ than all other treatments, but subsequently had a similar number to pasture renewed by direct drilling, both of which had considerably more than all other treatments. Establishing new pasture by direct drilling resulted in 12 760 L₃/kg DM over 56 weeks, nearly three times more than occurred following cultivation. Brassica swards had fewer L₃ than did new grass. Nematodirus L₃ were disproportional to the number of eggs deposited; they represented 2% of the eggs deposited but 67% of the L₃, and they were more persistent, representing 30% of the L₃ present during March but 87% during October.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica 3aNematodirus 3abarley 3adirect seeding 3aeggs 3aendoparasites 3afeces 3aforage 3agrain crops 3agrasses 3apastures 3aNew Zealand 0acultivation 0adirect drilling 0aendoparasites 0anematodes 0aNematodirus 0apasja 0aTeladorsagia 0aTrichostrongylus1 aDynes, RA1 aGoulter, CL0 tNew Zealand journal of agricultural research.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 54, no. 1 p.15-22dTaylor & Francis Groupx1175-87757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2010.535488  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012000174300001600294520071400310592002801024650001401052650001501066650001001081650001101091650001201102650000901114650001201123650001301135651001001148651001201158653001401170653001401184653001501198653001201213653001301225700002201238773011701260856008501377852000901462655001201471IND60587174520221123013320.0171215e20171002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058717452DNAL7 a10.1080/07924259.2017.13396412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousef, Ebtesam A.14aThe ontogeny of appendages and carapace of Neonesidea schulzi (Ostracoda: Bairdiidae) from the Red Sea coast, Egypt  ap. 225-244.  aThe ostracod genus Neonesidea is broadly distributed in shallow marine waters.

Neonesidea schulzi has eight post-embryonic instars, and a gap in its ontogenetic development during instar A-6, where no new Anlage is added. The Anlagen of the copulatory organs and the forked terminal claw of second antenna appear in the seventh (A-1) instar, and the first thoracic legs of podocopid ostracods are shown to descend from the thoracic region.

Two sets of data were collected at the stop-over site: a capture–recapture–resighting data set and a vector of counts of unmarked birds. The two data sets are analyzed simultaneously by combining a new model for the capture–recapture–resighting data set with a binomial likelihood for the counts. The aim of the analysis is to estimate the total number of birds that used the site and the average duration of stop-over. The combined analysis is shown to be highly efficient, even when just 1 % of birds are recaptured, and is recommended for similar investigations.

In this paper, the suspension cell line QB-Tn9-4s of Trichoplusia ni (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was successfully adapted to serum-free Sf-900 III medium and passaged for 52 generations. The adapted QB-Tn9-4s cells grew faster. Their population doubling time shortened from 27.4 hr in serum-containing medium to 24.1 hr, and their maximal density increased by 1.83-fold, reaching 3.50 × 10⁶ cells/mL in serum-free culture in T-flasks. The cells readily adapted to spinner culture, with maximum cell density of 4.40 × 10⁶ cells/mL in a spinner flask. Although the infection rate of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus and production of occlusion bodies (OBs) of the adapted QB-Tn9-4s cells were 91.0% and 85.4 OBs/cell, respectively, similar to those of QB-Tn9-4s cells cultured in serum-containing medium and control BTI-Tn5B1-4 cells, their budded virus titer was 4.97 × 10⁷ TCID50/mL, significantly higher than those of the latter two. In addition, the expression levels of β-galactosidase at six days post-infection and secreted alkaline phosphatase at seven days postinfection in the adapted QB-Tn9-4s cells reached 2.98 ± 0.15×104 IU/mL and 3.34 ± 0.13 IU/mL, respectively, significantly higher than those of QB-Tn9-4s and control BTI-Tn5B1-4 cultured in serum-containing media. The above findings establish a foundation for industrial production of virus and recombinant proteins in QB-Tn9-4s serum-free culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aTrichoplusia ni 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abeta-galactosidase 3acell suspension culture 3acultured cells 3ainsects 3amedicine 3aprotein engineering 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3aviral load 3avirus replication 3aviruses 0ainsect cell lines 0apopulation doubling time 0avirus production1 aZhou, Hong-Xu1 aLi, Chang-You0 tJournal of insect science .g2014 Feb., v. 14, no. 24 p.1-14dUniversity of Wisconsin Libraryx1536-24427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1673%2F031.014.243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001900170245011600189300001600305520123000321592002801551650002801579650002001607650001901627650001601646650001701662650002201679650001201701650002001713650001601733650003001749650002001779651001101799651001801810651001101828651001801839653002201857653001601879653002501895653001801920653003701938700002101975700002001996700002502016773010402041856008502145852000902230655001202239IND60113291920221118200223.0160903e20130115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011329192DNAL7 a232007732pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavoie, Roxane10aIntegration of groundwater information into decision making for regional planning: A portrait for North America  ap. 496-504.  aGroundwater is widely used as a source of drinking water in North America. However, it can be contaminated by microbial or chemical agents potentially hazardous to human health. In recent decades, governments have developed better knowledge of groundwater and established measures to protect and preserve the resource. Several studies have shown that relevant information on groundwater might prove very useful for regional planning purposes. However, there is little information on how groundwater information contributes to decision making in urban and regional planning in Canada and the United States. The objective of this study is to explore the level of use of groundwater information for land use planning purposes in Canada and the United States and to identify the factors that may explain why some provinces or states are more proactive than others when it comes to using such data for groundwater protection purposes. This paper presents the results of a survey sent across North America to groundwater information producers. The resulting data from the survey were examined using descriptive analyses and multiple correspondence analysis, and illustrate how groundwater data can be integrated into land planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrespondence analysis 3adecision making 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3aland use planning 3asurveys 2aDecision Making 2aGroundwater 2aInformation Dissemination 2aSocial Planning 3aCanada 3aUnited States 0aCanada 0aNew Hampshire 0aRegional planning 0aGroundwater 0aHydrogeological data 0aNorth America 0aMultiple correspondence analysis1 aLebel, Alexandre1 aJoerin, Florent1 aRodriguez, Manuel J.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 114 p.496-504dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009200162300002000254520178800274592002802062650001802090650001902108650001202127650002602139650001102165650001102176650002402187650001602211650001502227650001402242650002402256650001902280650002502299650004202324650001002366650001302376650001302389650002102402650001502423650003102438650001402469650002202483650001302505700004902518700001602567700001502583700001902598700001302617700001802630773016902648856008202817852000902899655001202908IND60579638920221119152127.0180619e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057963892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9602-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hainan10aSediment bacterial communities in a eutrophic lake influenced by multiple inflow-rivers  ap. 19795-19806.  aSediment bacterial communities are sensitive to environmental fluctuations, particularly external input sources.

The results demonstrated that Delta-, Beta-, and Gamma-proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Nitrospira, Bacilli, Anaerolineae, and Actinobacteria were the major classes in sediment bacterial communities of the Taihu Lake. In general, the inflow-rivers of different pollution types have distinctly different influences on sediment bacterial communities of the lake. The bacterial community composition and physicochemical properties of pelagic sites were closer to those of the estuaries of western region which was polluted by serious industrial and agricultural pollution. The bacterial community diversity of estuaries was lower than those of pelagic sites. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that α-diversity of the bacterial community was significantly correlated with C/N, total nitrogen, and total carbon in estuarine sediments. Redundancy analysis revealed that the variance in bacterial community composition was also significantly associated with C/N (24.9%) followed by total phosphorus (15.8%), nitrite (7.2%), and nitrate (7.7%) among different estuaries. This study provides a reference to understand the influence of inflow-rivers on the lake ecosystem, which offered a basic guidance for maintaining the ecological system and protecting the water environment of lacustrine basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aBacilli 3abacterial communities 3abasins 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aestuarine sediments 3aeutrophication 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alakes 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution 3aspecies diversity 3avariance1 aLi, Yi1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2226-69961 aZhang, Jing1 aNiu, Lihua1 aZhang, Wenlong1 aCai, Wei1 aZhu, Xiaoxiao0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Aug., v. 24, no. 24 p.19795-19806dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9602-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245015000162300001600312520143200328592002801760650002501788650002501813650001901838650001301857650001601870650002001886650003101906650001001937650001501947650002001962650002101982650001902003650001702022650001502039650002202054650002402076650001202100700001702112700001802129700001702147700001802164700001802182700001202200700001402212700001602226700005402242773011302296856008202409852000902491655001202500IND60590118720221116213239.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059011872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3659-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xuming10aGene expression profile and long non-coding RNA analysis, using RNA-Seq, in chicken embryonic fibroblast cells infected by avian leukosis virus J  ap. 639-647.  aAvian leukosis virus J (ALVJ) infection induces hematopoietic malignancy in myeloid leukemia and hemangioma in chickens. However, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning the unique pathogenesis of ALVJ. In this study, we investigated the gene expression profiles of ALVJ-infected chicken cells and performed a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CEF cells using RNA-Seq. As a result, 36 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 91 genes (FC > 2 and q-values < 0.05) were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these differentially expressed genes are involved in the innate immune response. Target prediction analysis revealed that these lncRNAs may act in cis or trans and affect the expression of genes which are involved in the anti-viral innate immune responses. Toll-like receptor, RIG-I receptor, NOD-like receptor and JAK-STAT signaling pathways were enriched. Notably, the induced expression of innate immunity genes, including B2M, DHX58, IFI27L2, IFIH1, IRF10, ISG12(2), MX, OAS*A, RSAD2, STAT1, TLR3, IL4I1, and IRF1 (FC > 2 and correlation > 0.95), were highly correlated with the upregulation of several lncRNAs, including MG066618, MG066617, MG066601, MG066629, MG066609 and MG066616. These findings identify the expression profile of lncRNAs in chicken CEF cells infected by ALVJ virus and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of ALVJ infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvian leukosis virus 3aToll-like receptor 3 3abioinformatics 3achickens 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahemangioma 3ainnate immunity 3amyeloid leukemia 3anon-coding RNA 3apathogenesis 3aprediction 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3aviruses1 aChen, Shihao1 aJia, Chongxin1 aXue, Songlei1 aDou, Chunfeng1 aDai, Zhenqing1 aXu, Hui1 aSun, Zhen1 aGeng, Tuoyu1 aCui, Hengmi1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5139-53700 tArchives of virology.g2018 Mar., v. 163, no. 3 p.639-647dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3659-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014900167300002000316520155200336592002801888650003001916650002701946650001201973650001901985650001602004650001202020650001302032650000902045650001502054650001302069650002302082650001302105700001402118700002502132700002602157773013802183856008102321852000902402655001202411IND60091424220221116225017.0150131e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009142422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3207-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, Enrique10aIsotherm studies for the determination of Cd (II) ions removal capacity in living biomass of a microalga with high tolerance to cadmium toxicity  ap. 12616-12628.  aThe biosorption characteristics of Cd (II) ions using the living biomass of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum were investigated. This microalga is a highly tolerant species to cadmium toxicity; for this reason, it is interesting to know its potential for use in the removal of this metal. The use of living biomass offers better possibilities than that of dead biomass since cadmium can also be bioaccumulated inside the cells. For this purpose, tolerant species are necessary. P. tricornutum is within this category with an EC₅₀,₉₆ₕof 19.1 ± 3.5 mg Cd (II)/L, and in the present manuscript, it is demonstrated that this microalga has a very good potential for bioremediation of Cd (II) ions in saline habitats. Cadmium removed by the cells was divided into three fractions: total, intracellular and bioadsorbed. The experiments were conducted for 96 h in natural seawater with a concentration range of 1–100 mg Cd (II)/L. Each fraction was characterized every 24 h by sorption isotherms. The experimental isotherm data were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich and Temkin equations. The biosorption was well described by Langmuir isotherm followed by Freundlich. The worst model was Temkin. The biosorption capacity of this microalga for Cd (II) ions was found to be 67.1 ± 3.2 mg/g after 96 h with approximately 40 % of this capacity in the intracellular fraction. The bioconcentration factor determined was 2,204.7 after 96 h and with an initial Cd (II) concentration of 1 mg/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3ahabitats 3aions 3amicroalgae 3aseawater 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity1 aMera, Roi1 aHerrero, Concepción1 aAbalde Alonso, Julio,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Nov., v. 21, no. 22 p.12616-12628dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3207-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009700174300001600271520175900287592002802046650001802074650001502092650002002107650001202127650001202139650002202151650002602173650001502199650001902214650000902233650001402242650001102256650001402267650001202281650001302293650001902306653001002325653002602335653001802361653001702379653001902396653001502415700002002430700005902450700001702509700001802526773010202544856008702646852000902733655001202742IND60532126820221123045235.0170713e20160715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053212682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogart, Sarah J.10aRapid changes in water hardness and alkalinity: Calcite formation is lethal to Daphnia magna  ap. 182-191.  aThere is growing concern that freshwater ecosystems may be negatively affected by ever-increasing anthropogenic inputs of extremely hard, highly alkaline effluent containing large quantities of Ca2+, Mg2+, CO32−, and HCO3− ions. In this study, the toxicity of rapid and extreme shifts in water hardness (38–600mg/L as CaCO3) and alkalinity (30–420mg/L as CaCO3) to Daphnia magna was tested, both independently and in combination. Within these ranges, where no precipitation event occurred, shifts in water hardness and/or alkalinity were not toxic to D. magna. In contrast, 98–100% of D. magna died within 96h after exposure to 600mg/L as CaCO3 water hardness and 420mg/L as CaCO3 alkalinity (LT50 of 60h with a 95% CI of 54.2–66.0h). In this treatment, a CaCO3 (calcite) precipitate formed in the water column which was ingested by and thoroughly coated the D. magna. Calcite collected from a mining impacted stream contained embedded organisms, suggesting field streams may also experience similar conditions and possibly increased mortality as observed in the lab tests. Although further investigation is required to determine the exact fate of aquatic organisms exposed to rapid calcite precipitation in the field, we caution that negative effects may occur more quickly or at lower concentrations of water hardness and alkalinity in which we observed effects in D. magna, because some species, such as aquatic insects, are more sensitive than cladocerans to changes in ionic strength. Our results provide evidence that both calcite precipitation and the major ion balance of waters should be managed in industrially affected ecosystems and we support the development of a hardness+alkalinity guideline for the protection of aquatic life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aalkalinity 3aaquatic insects 3acalcite 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3afreshwater ecosystems 3aguidelines 3aionic strength 3aions 3amagnesium 3amining 3amortality 3astreams 3atoxicity 3awater hardness 0aCaCO3 0aCalcite precipitation 0aDaphnia magna 0aIon toxicity 0aWater hardness 0aAlkalinity1 aWoodman, Samuel1 aSteinkey, Dylan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0519-61751 aMeays, Cindy1 aPyle, Greg G.0 tScience of the total environment.g2016 July 15, v. 559 p.182-191dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011200172300001600284520151800300592002801818650001401846650001201860650001001872650001201882650001201894650003301906650000901939650001501948650000901963650001101972650001401983650001301997650001402010650001302024650001602037650001002053650001402063651001902077653001102096653001602107653001302123653001902136653001602155700002102171700002402192700001902216700002502235773011902260856008402379852000902463655001202472IND60544960520221116231926.0160901e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054496052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallé, Francesca10aPliocene environmental change in West Africa and the onset of strong NE trade winds (ODP Sites 659 and 658)  ap. 403-414.  aPliocene vegetation dynamics and climate variability in West Africa have been investigated through pollen and XRF-scanning records obtained from sediment cores of ODP Site 659 (18°N, 21°W). The comparison between total pollen accumulation rates and Ti/Ca ratios, which is strongly correlated with the dust input at the site, showed elevated aeolian transport of pollen during dusty periods. Comparison of the pollen records of ODP Site 659 and the nearby Site 658 resulted in a robust reconstruction of West African vegetation change since the Late Pliocene. Between 3.6 and 3.0Ma the savannah in West Africa differed in composition from its modern counterpart and was richer in Asteraceae, in particular of the Tribus Cichorieae. Between 3.24 and 3.20Ma a stable wet period is inferred from the Fe/K ratios, which could stand for a narrower and better specified mid-Pliocene (mid-Piacenzian) warm time slice. The northward extension of woodland and savannah, albeit fluctuating, was generally greater in the Pliocene. NE trade wind vigour increased intermittently around 2.7 and 2.6Ma, and more or less permanently since 2.5Ma, as inferred from increased pollen concentrations of trade wind indicators (Ephedra, Artemisia, Pinus). Our findings link the NE trade wind development with the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere glaciations (iNHG). Prior to the iNHG, little or no systematic relation could be found between sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic with aridity and dust in West Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aEphedra 3aPinus 3acalcium 3aclimate 3adry environmental conditions 3adust 3aglaciation 3airon 3apollen 3apotassium 3asavannas 3asediments 3atitanium 3atrade winds 3avigor 3awoodlands 3aWestern Africa 0aPollen 0aPleistocene 0aPliocene 0aNE trade winds 0aWest Africa1 aDupont, Lydie M.1 aLeroy, Suzanne A.G.1 aSchefuß, Enno1 aWefer, G.q(Gerold),0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 414 p.403-414dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02225naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009900166300002000265520082000285592002801105650001301133650001401146650001201160650001701172650004101189650000901230650001501239650003701254650001801291650001201309650001601321700002101337700006201358700002201420700002101442700002201463700002401485700002201509773016901531856008201700852000901782655001201791IND60579639120221119105229.0180619e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057963912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9612-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Gustavo10aTime-resolved monitoring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons adsorbed on atmospheric particles  ap. 19517-19523.  aReal-time monitoring of individual particles from atmospheric aerosols was performed by means of a specifically developed single-particle fluorescence spectrometer (SPFS).

As compared with daily averaged data, our time-resolved approach provided information about the physicochemical dynamics of the particles.

The overall CO2 absorption reaction was carried out according to consecutive reaction steps that are generated in the order of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. The reaction rate and capture efficiency were strongly dependent on the NaOH concentration in the Na2CO3 production range, but were constant in the NaHCO3 production step, irrespective of the NaOH concentration. The amount of CO2 absorbed in the solution was slightly less than the theoretical value, which was ascribed to the low trona production during the reaction and the consequent decrease in CO2 absorption in the NaOH solution. The mass ratio of absorbed CO2 that participated in the Na2CO3, NaHCO3, and trona production reactions was calculated to be 20:17:1, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3asodium carbonate 3asodium hydroxide 3atrona 2aAdsorption 2aAir Pollutionxprevention & control 2aBicarbonatesxchemical synthesis 2aCarbon Dioxidexchemistry 2aExtraction and Processing Industry 2aSodium Hydroxidexchemistry 0aClimate change 0aCarbon capture 0aChemical absorption 0aGreenhouse gas 0aAbsorbent 0aSodium hydroxide1 aHan, Sang-jun,1 aWee, Jung-Ho0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Jan. 15, v. 114 p.512-519dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.10.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012800162300002000290520204000310592002802350650001102378650002902389650001202418650001402430650001202444650001302456650001302469650001102482650002002493650003102513650001702544650001102561650001402572650000902586650001202595650001102607650001102618650000902629650001702638650000902655650001602664650000902680651001002689651001802699700001602717700001302733700001202746700001402758773016902772856008202941852000903023655001203032IND60579639220221119151716.0180619e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057963922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9516-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Bifeng10aAssessment of the potential health risks of heavy metals in soils in a coastal industrial region of the Yangtze River Delta  ap. 19816-19826.  aSoil heavy metal contamination is a serious environmental problem. Human beings may be directly exposed to heavy metals in soils through the inhalation of soil particles, dermal contact, and oral ingestion, which can seriously threaten health. This study assesses the health risks associated with heavy metals in soils by determining the concentrations of eight heavy metals (Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Cu, Zn, and Ni) based on 2051 surface-soil samples collected from the southern Yangtze River Delta of China. The mean concentrations were higher than the corresponding background values in Zhejiang Province and China as a whole, indicating an accumulation of heavy metals. The health risk assessment suggests that the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in the study area were not significant. The non-carcinogenic risk for children was the highest, followed by those for adults and seniors; the non-carcinogenic risk for the entire population was less than 1.0, the predetermined threshold. Carcinogenic risk for adults was the highest, followed by those for seniors and children; a few sample points had a value larger than the threshold of 1.0E−04. Arsenic represented the greatest contribution to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk. Meanwhile, ingestion of heavy metals in soil was the main exposure pathway for carcinogenic risk, followed by inhalation and dermal exposure. The spatial method of Getis-Ord was used to identify hot spots of health risk. Hot spots with high hazard index (HI) and total carcinogenic risk (TCR) for children, adults, and seniors were mainly distributed in core urban areas, such as Jiangbei, Haishu, Yinzhou, Jiangdong, and the urban areas of some other counties, which coincided with industrial, mining, and urban areas of the study area and were strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities. These results provide a basis for heavy metal control in soil, source identification, and environment management in the Yangtze River Delta and other rapidly developing industrial regions in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarsenic 3abreathing 3acadmium 3achildren 3achromium 3acopper 3adermal exposure 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3aingestion 3alead 3amercury 3amining 3anickel 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3asoil 3aurban areas 3azinc 3aChina 3aYangtze River1 aWang, Jiayu1 aJin, Bin1 aLi, Yan1 aShi, Zhou0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Aug., v. 24, no. 24 p.19816-19826dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9516-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245012200133300001800255520111800273592002801391650001701419650001301436650002201449650001301471651001001484653002101494653002601515653003101541700001601572700001601588773015301604852000901757655001201766IND60705758720221120192340.0200807e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070575872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMawle, Sushil R.10aComparative Study by Demonstration and Adoption of Backyard Poultry Breed-Kadaknath with Local Breed in Nicra Project  ap. 3797-3802.  aThe Kadaknath is an Indian breed of chicken local to the Madhya Pradesh area, where it is knownas “Kali masi” (“fowl having black flesh”).

This study explored to what extent substantial information of configuration metrics increases from certain easily calculated and extensively used composition metrics and how strongly the effectiveness is influenced by different factors. The effectiveness of 12 landscape configuration metrics from the percentage of landscape (PLAND) of each land-use class and patch density (PD) was evaluated through the coefficient of determination (R ²) of multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis of 150 town-based landscape samples from three regions. The different landscape configuration metrics from PLAND and PD presented significantly different performances in terms of effectiveness [the contagion index and aggregation index possess minimal information, and the effective mesh size (MESH) and area-weighted mean patch fractal dimension possess abundant information]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of configuration metrics showed different responses to changing cell sizes and different land-use categorization in different regions (interspersion and juxtaposition index, patch cohesion index, and MESH exhibited large variations in R ² among the different regions). No single, uniform, consistent characteristic of effectiveness was determined across different factors. This new approach to understanding the effectiveness of configuration metrics helps clarify landscape metrics and is fundamental to landscape metric assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3afractal dimensions 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis1 aXiao, Zhanchun1 aLi, Qingling1 aLee, Cherie,1 aXiang, Chao0 tLandscape and ecological engineering.g2017 Jan., v. 13, no. 1 p.169-181dSpringer Japanx1860-18717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-016-0314-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01686naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245012100162300001800283520048600301592002800787650002400815650002300839650002300862650002300885650002700908650001400935700001400949700001600963700001400979700001500993700001601008700001501024700001901039700001701058700001301075773010601088856008501194852000901279655001201288IND60579159120221118023602.0170816e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057915912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b017872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Xu10aPalladium-Catalyzed 6-Endo Selective Alkyl-Heck Reactions: Access to 5-Phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine Derivatives  ap. 3774-3777.  aA new type of palladium-catalyzed 6-endo-selective alkyl-Heck reaction of unactivated alkyl iodides has been described.

Stable-isotope measurements were developed on hydrocarbons extracted from both GFF and C18-disks in order to characterize the source of hydrocarbons. A clear partition of hydrocarbon compounds between the dissolved and the particulate phase was highlighted. PAHs showed a higher affinity with the dissolved phase (recoveries efficiency of 48–71%) whereas AHs presented strong affinity with the particulate phase (up to 76% of extraction efficiency). Medium volumes of seawater samples were tested and no breakthrough was observed for a 5L sample. Isotopic fractionation was investigated within all analytical steps but none was evidenced. This method has been applied to harbor seawater samples and very low AH and PAH concentrations were achieved. Due to the low concentration levels of hydrocarbons in the samples, the source of hydrocarbons was determined by molecular indices rather than isotopic measurements and a pyrolytic origin was evidenced. The aliphatic profile also revealed the presence of long-chain linear alkylbenzenes (LABs). The methodology presented here would better fit to polluted coastal environments affected by recent oil spills.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatography 3afilters 3aglass fibers 3aisotope fractionation 3aoil spills 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aseawater 3asilica 3asolid phase extraction 3astable isotopes 0aHydrocarbons 0aSeawater 0aIsotope fingerprinting 0aC18-disk 0aDissolved phase 0aParticulate phase1 aTolosa, Imma0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 July 24, v. 1404 p.10-20dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001200145245022000157300002000377520149800397592002801895650002001923650001901943650001301962650001901975650001001994650003002004650001802034650001102052650001402063651001702077700002302094700002602117773012702143856008102270852000902351655001202360IND60559307720221118023529.0161206e20161206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055930772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b038922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yan10aMicrobial-Catalyzed Reductive Dechlorination of Polychlorinated Biphenyls in Hudson and Grasse River Sediment Microcosms: Determination of Dechlorination Preferences and Identification of Rare Ortho Removal Pathways  ap. 12767-12778.  aBiodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is an important transformation and detoxification route in the environment. To better understand the influence of PCB congener compositions on dechlorination, sediments from two rivers, Hudson and Grasse, and two PCB mixtures (PCB 5/12, 64/71, 105/114, and 149/153/170 in Mixture 1 and PCB 5/12, 64/71, 82/97/99, and 144/170 in Mixture 2) were used for this microcosm study. The Grasse River sediment microcosms exhibited more extensive dechlorination than the Hudson River sediment microcosms. The extent of dechlorination was predominantly controlled by sediment itself, not by the PCB compositions. Rare ortho dechlorination, targeting mono-ortho PCB congeners was observed in Grasse sediment, indicating a potential for full dechlorination of some PCBs in this sediment. The identified ortho dechlorination pathways were PCB 28 (24–4-CB) to PCB 15 (4–4-CB) and PCB 25 (24–3-CB) to PCB 13(3–4-CB). The relative abundances of Dehalococcoides were much higher in both sediments spiked with PCBs. An apparent increase of Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA genes coincided with the commencement of dechlorination. The dechlorination preferences were identified using a modified data analysis approach focusing on chlorine neighboring conditions. In both sediments, the overall dechlorination preferred meta > para > ortho. Specially, ortho-/double-flanked meta-chlorines were primarily targeted followed by single-/double-flanked para-chlorines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDehalococcoides 3abiodegradation 3achlorine 3adechlorination 3agenes 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aribosomal RNA 3arivers 3asediments 3aHudson River1 aGregory, Kelvin B.1 aVanBriesen, Jeanne M.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2016 Dec. 06, v. 50, no. 23 p.12767-12778dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b038923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01182naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245012000165506002800285520025100313592002800564506003700592650001000629650001500639650002200654651001200676773012800688856007900816852000900895655001200904IND60785336420221207111727.0190504s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078533642DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.25672072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvankovska, I.V.10aMorphological features of fruits and seeds productivity of Hosta Tratt. spesies in the Dendrological Park Sofiyivka  aResource is Open Access  aThe results of the biomorphological features of the fruits and seeds of some species Hosta Tratt. from the collection of the National Dendrological Park Sofi yivka of the NAS of Ukraine are presented.

Five purposefully selected HE teachers participated in individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. The results show a shared view of in the importance of educating the next generation of sustainable food consumers. Teachers returned to specific influencing factors that conditioned their opportunities to implement a perspective of SD in HE food education. This generated four themes: (1) Unscheduled foodwork in preparing sustainable food education, (2) opportunities to link everyday food choices with larger food system issues, (3) access to sustainable supportive food products and materials, and (4) a school environment in support of food-related teaching. The teachers outlined a number of local and national factors perceived to inhibit access to facilitators and expressed a concern for pupils&rsquo; opportunities for quality assurance and goal achievement. The suggested influencing factors could serve as propositions for further investigations in the continued work of both resource reinforcements as well as of developing a SD perspective in food-related HE education.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3afamily and consumer science 3afood choices 3afood consumption 3afoods 3ainterviews 3aquality control 3asustainable development 3ateachers1 aWernersson, Inga1 aLarsson, Christel0 tSustainability.g2018 May 07, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100514633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008000171300001800251500001500269520159400284592002801878650001401906650001101920650001101931650002001942650002201962650001401984650001101998650001102009650002502020650001002045650000902055650002902064650001302093650002902106653001102135653002102146653001302167653004002180700001602220700002102236700002102257700001402278773012102292856008602413852000902499655001202508IND60411419920221121205842.0180608e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041141992DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2015.10500722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConstantino, C.14aThe impact of tertiary wastewater treatment on copper and zinc complexation  ap. 2863-2871.  a2019-12-05  aTightening quality standards for European waters has seen a move towards enhanced wastewater treatment technologies such as granulated organic carbon treatment and ozonation. Although these technologies are likely to be successful in degrading certain micro-organic contaminants, these may also destroy compounds which would otherwise complex and render metals significantly less toxic. This study examined the impact of enhanced tertiary treatment on the capacity of organic compounds within sewage effluents to complex copper and zinc. The data show that granulated organic carbon treatment removes a dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fraction that is unimportant to complexation such that no detrimental impact on complexation or metal bioavailability is likely to occur from this treatment type. High concentrations of ozone (>1 mg O₃/mg DOC) are, however, likely to impact the complexation capacity for copper although this is unlikely to be important at the concentrations of copper typically found in effluent discharges or in rivers. Ozone treatment did not affect zinc complexation capacity. The complexation profiles of the sewage effluents show these to contain a category of non-humic ligand that appears unaffected by tertiary treatment and which displays a high affinity for zinc, suggesting these may substantially reduce the bioavailability of zinc in effluent discharges. The implication is that traditional metal bioavailability assessment approaches such as the biotic ligand model may overestimate zinc bioavailability in sewage effluents and effluent-impacted waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeffluents 3arivers 3acopper 3abioavailability 3aorganic compounds 3aozonation 3asewage 3amodels 3awastewater treatment 3aozone 3azinc 3adissolved organic carbon 3atoxicity 3aenvironmental technology 0acarbon 0ametal speciation 0aeffluent 0agranular activated carbon treatment1 aGardner, M.1 aComber, S.

We accordingly conducted density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the mechanical/failure, thermal conductivity and stability, electronic and optical properties of three N-graphdiyne nanomembranes. Our DFT results of uniaxial tensile simulations reveal that these monolayers can yield remarkably high stretchability or tensile strength depending on the atomic structure and loading direction. Studied N-graphdiyne nanomembranes were found to exhibit semiconducting electronic character, with band-gap values ranging from 0.98 eV to 3.33 eV, based on the HSE06 estimations. The first absorption peak suggests that these 2D structures can absorb visible, IR and NIR light. Ab initio molecular dynamics results reveal that N-graphdiyne 2D structures can withstand at high temperatures, like 2000 K. Thermal conductivities of suspended single-layer N-graphdiyne sheets were predicted to be almost temperature independent and about three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the graphene. The comprehensive insight provided by this work highlights the outstanding physics of N-graphdiyne 2D nanomaterials, and suggest them as highly promising candidates for the design of novel stretchable nanodevices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adensity functional theory 3agraphene 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3ananosheets 3anear infrared radiation 3aoptical properties 3asemiconductors 3asimulation models 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3athermal conductivity1 aMakaremi, Meysam1 aShahrokhi, Masoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3656-65511 aFan, Zheyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2253-82101 aRabczuk, Timon0 tCarbon.g2018 Oct., v. 137 p.57-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.04.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04498naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012800167300001600295520291000311592002803221650001903249650001603268650000903284650001503293650001003308650001303318650002103331650001603352650002303368650002103391650002403412650002103436650001903457650002103476650003303497650002603530650001703556650001603573650002403589650001903613650001503632650002403647650001403671650000803685651001003693700001803703700002003721700002003741773012903761856004503890852000903935655001203944IND50068046120130723000000.0130723e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006804612DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2012000362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiwani, Thuweba N.10aCharacterizing farming systems around Kakamega Forest, Western Kenya, for targeting soil fertility–enhancing technologies  ap. 585-594.  aKakamega district in Western Kenya represents the smallholder farming systems typical for much of the densely populated humid highlands in East Africa. A specific feature, however, is the presence of a protected forest reserve (Kakamega Forest National Park), covering some 20% of the district area. Year‐round crop production with little use of external inputs is resulting in declining soil fertility and crop yields. Technologies to counteract fertility constraints are rarely implemented, as they do not consider system diversity or farm‐specific characteristics. We surmised that farm type–specific targeting of technology options to address soil fertility–related production constraints would reduce the anthropogenic pressure on the resources of the adjacent Kakamega rainforest reserve. Based on Kenyan national census data, we selected 168 farms in physical proximity of the Kakamega forest and characterized them regarding production system and soil attributes. Cluster and principal component analyses identified five distinct farm categories. Three representative farms from each cluster group were subsequently selected to establish labor‐use patterns, draw resource‐flow maps, and determine NPK balances. Small subsistence‐oriented farms were most common (> 50%), with maize yields of 0.9 t ha–¹ (Cluster 1). Most farmers relied on the forest to provide fire wood, animal feed, and medicinal plants. Mixed farms, combining subsistence maize with industrial crops, were differentiated by soil type, with tea being grown on Ferralsol (Cluster 3), and sugar cane being grown on Acrisol (cluster 4). The dependence on forest resources was limited to animal grazing and the collection of feed stuff (Cluster 3), or the extraction of medicinal plants (Cluster 4). Only few farms showed a high degree of market orientation of the food‐crop production. These comprised either small farms with high investments in fertilizer and maize yields close to 2 t ha–¹ (Cluster 2), or larger farms (1.6–3.9 ha) with low fertilizer but high hired‐labor use (Cluster 5). Their reliance on forest resources was generally low. Resource flows showed mainly patterns of nutrient export in subsistence farms, and more complex flow patterns, involving several farm compartments, in the diversified farms. Partial nutrient balances were strongly negative for N and K, irrespective of soil or farm type. Soil‐fertility characteristics reflected the nutrient balances with generally low C and N in all farms on Acrisol, and low P in farms not applying mineral fertilizers or farmyard manure. The proposed typology is expected to improve the targeting of technologies addressing soil fertility–related production constraints, and to reduce the pressure on forest resources. This is of particular importance in the case of small‐scale subsistence and mixed farms close to the forest margin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal manures 3acensus data 3acorn 3acrop yield 3afeeds 3afuelwood 3aindustrial crops 3alarge farms 3amarket orientation 3amedicinal plants 3amineral fertilizers 3anational forests 3anational parks 3anutrient balance 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproduction technology 3arain forests 3asmall farms 3asmall-scale farming 3asoil fertility 3asoil types 3asubsistence farming 3asugarcane 3atea 3aKenya1 aAsch, Folkard1 aBecker, Mathias1 aMussgnug, Frank0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2013 Aug., v. 176, no. 4 p.585-594dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.201200036  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008800169300001600257520180700273592002802080650002202108650001602130650001002146650001802156650002902174650001102203650001502214650001802229653002502247653001002272653002302282653002102305653002402326653002402350700001902374700002002393700001402413773008102427856008402508852000902592655001202601IND60582551520221118003503.0171006e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058255152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBottasso, C.L.10aLiDAR-enabled model predictive control of wind turbines with real-time capabilities  ap. 442-452.  aWe consider LiDAR-enabled model-based collective pitch and torque controllers that can be implemented onboard a wind turbine in a hard real-time environment, in the sense that they can be computed efficiently on standard computer hardware and that require a fixed deterministic number of operations at each call.At first, we show that linear parameter varying wind-scheduled models provide for a reasonable approximation (for control purposes) of the wind turbine response over its entire operating regime. Based on these results, we formulate two model predictive controllers making use of such wind-scheduled linear models and a quadratic cost. The first controller is based on a classical constrained receding horizon approach that leads to the efficient on-line solution of a quadratic problem. The second can be interpreted as its steady-state unconstrained approximation; its implementation is straightforward and leads to the off-line computation of gain matrices that are then wind-scheduled at run time.Both controllers are tested in a high fidelity environment comprising of both a LiDAR and an aeroservoelastic simulator, in deterministic and unfrozen turbulent wind conditions. The numerical experiments show that the receding horizon controller outperforms a standard non-LiDAR-enabled one, as expected and as already reported by other authors. More interestingly, the second simpler controller is shown to provide for an almost similar performance of the more sophisticated one, although at a much lower and trivial computational cost. This behavior is interpreted as being due to the fact that, given the high disturbance level and the frequent solution update, even a rough approximation of the control problem is still capable of capturing the essence of the LiDAR preview information.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer hardware 3acontrollers 3alidar 3alinear models 3arenewable energy sources 3atorque 3awind speed 3awind turbines 0aWind turbine control 0aLiDAR 0aPredictive control 0aReceding horizon 0aNon-homogeneous LQR 0aUnfrozen turbulence1 aPizzinelli, P.1 aRiboldi, C.E.D.1 aTasca, L.0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Nov., v. 71 p.442-452dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245018200179300001100361500001900372520197500391592002802366650002502394650002202419650002802441650002702469650000902496650002302505650003202528650001002560650001702570650003602587650002302623650001502646650001902661650002402680650001702704650001702721651001302738700002602751773009902777856008302876852000902959655001202968IND60707010720221121111552.0210209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070701072DNAL7 a10.1186/s40795-020-00358-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemilew, Yeshalem Mulugeta14aThe relationship between school meals with thinness and stunting among primary school students, in Meket Wereda, Ethiopia: comparing schools with feeding and non-feeding program  ap. 34.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND: Though undernutrition affects academic performance, significant number of Ethiopian school children have undernutrition. To avert nutritional problems the government in collaboration with the world food program has implemented a school feeding program. However, data on the nutritional status of primary school students were scarce in the country. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the relationship between school meals with thinness and stunting among primary school students in Meket Woreda and to identify associated factors. METHODS: A school-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 1091 students, from April 1–27, 2015. The study participants were selected using a multi-stage stratified sampling method. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were done. Anthropometric data were analyzed using Anthro-plus software. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, thinness was commoner in nonschool feeding program schools (37.5%) compared to school feeding program schools (27.8%) but stunting was less common (48.3% versus 58.5%). However, after adjustment for confounding, there was no difference in stunting levels, but the adjusted odds ratio for thinness in nonschool feeding program schools was 2.6 (95% CI: (1.8, 3.8)) times higher than in school feeding program schools. Other independent risk factors for thinness were: having uneducated mother, being a male and taking meal once daily. Independent risk factors for stunting were ethnicity, having uneducated mother, un-piped water supply, taking meal once daily, type of diet and being a male. CONCLUSION: The provision of meals seems to offer considerable protection against thinness, though not against stunting. Thus, school meal program should be scaling up into schools in food insecure areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacademic achievement 3acomputer software 3across-sectional studies 3adescriptive statistics 3adiet 3aelementary schools 3afood and nutrition programs 3amales 3amalnutrition 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anutritional status 3aodds ratio 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3aschool meals 3awater supply 3aEthiopia1 aNigussie, Azezu Asres0 tBMC nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 1 p.34-34dBioMed CentralwJournal:27315x2055-09287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40795-020-00358-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245010700206300001400313506007600327520129200403592002801695506003701723650002601760650001501786650001601801650002001817650001801837650002401855650001401879650001801893650001301911650001601924653003301940653001801973653001901991653002602010653002502036700001602061700001702077700002302094700001702117773009402134856008202228852000902310655001202319IND60091610520221207114706.0161021e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009161052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2012.08.0152doi7 aPMC50122192pmcid7 a229600102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGolden, J.P.10aAutomated processing integrated with a microflow cytometer for pathogen detection in clinical matrices  ap. 10-16.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA spinning magnetic trap (MagTrap) for automated sample processing was integrated with a microflow cytometer capable of simultaneously detecting multiple targets to provide an automated sample-to-answer diagnosis in 40min. After target capture on fluorescently coded magnetic microspheres, the magnetic trap automatically concentrated the fluorescently coded microspheres, separated the captured target from the sample matrix, and exposed the bound target sequentially to biotinylated tracer molecules and streptavidin-labeled phycoerythrin. The concentrated microspheres were then hydrodynamically focused in a microflow cytometer capable of 4-color analysis (two wavelengths for microsphere identification, one for light scatter to discriminate single microspheres and one for phycoerythrin bound to the target). A three-fold decrease in sample preparation time and an improved detection limit, independent of target preconcentration, was demonstrated for detection of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 using the MagTrap as compared to manual processing. Simultaneous analysis of positive and negative controls, along with the assay reagents specific for the target, was used to obtain dose–response curves, demonstrating the potential for quantification of pathogen load in buffer and serum.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3adose response 3amicrobial detection 3apathogens 3aphycoerythrin 3aspinning 3awavelengths 0aIntegrated sample processing 0aMicrofluidics 0aFlow cytometry 0aMagnetic microspheres 0aMultiplexed analysis1 aVerbarg, J.1 aHowell, P.B.1 aShriver-Lake, L.C.1 aLigler, F.S.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 40 p.10-16dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2012.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010600164300001400270520145600284592002801740650004401768650002301812650003701835650002101872650003901893650001701932650001301949650001901962650001901981650001502000650001502015650002402030650003702054700001802091700001902109700001802128700001402146700001402160700001702174700001502191773008502206856008502291852000902376655001202385IND60650894820221122060018.0200419e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065089482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yiwen10aPEGlated graphene as nanoadditive for enhancing the tribological properties of water-based lubricants  ap. 41-48.  aDispersion of Graphene in water is conducive to their practical applications as lubricating additive in water-based fluids due to their safety, low cost and environmental-friendliness. But owing to its hydrophobicity, it is difficult to achieve stable aqueous graphene suspension. Here, we use the Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate as bridging agent between hydrophilic Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and ethanolamine to prepare the amino-containing PEG (PEG-NH₂), followed by covalently grafting PEG-NH₂ onto the surface of carboxylaed graphene (G-COOH) nanosheets to synthesize the PEGlated graphene (PEG-G) via facile amidation under mild conditions. The physical, chemical properties of product were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectra (FTIR), Raman spectra, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) and so on. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning probe microscope (SPM) were utilized to observed the morphology of G-COOH and PEG-G. The frictional properties of PEG-G as nanoadditive of water-based lubricant were characterized by UMT-3 tribometer, following with analyzes on wear surfaces by 3D laser scanning confocal microscopy. Based on the results of characterization, the PEG-G was prepared successfully and the dispersion shows superior friction-reducing and anti-wear properties owing to the formation of fluid adhesive film and carbon protective film, especially the concentration of PEG-G in water is 0.05 wt%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achemical bonding 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aethanolamine 3agraphene 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alubricants 3ananosheets 3apolyethylene glycol 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aWang, Yongxin1 aZeng, Zhixiang1 aZhao, Haichao1 aGe, Xuewu1 aWang, Kai1 aWang, Liping1 aXue, Qunji0 tCarbon.g2018 Oct., v. 137 p.41-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03834naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245016200155300001800317500001100335520176900346592002802115596006902143596006902212596008902281596005902370596017002429650002602599650001602625650000902641650001002650650000902660650002002669650001002689650001002699650001502709650001202724650001002736650001202746650001402758650001302772650001102785650001202796650001202808700001402820700001802834700005402852700001602906700005402922700001802976700005702994773012203051856007403173852000903247655001203256IND60769052520221119133655.0220301e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076905252DNAL7 a10.1111/are.156962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jieyun10aSelection of reference genes suitable for normalization of qRT‐PCR data in spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) under conditions of pathogen infections  ap. 1613-1626.  aREVIEW  aThe aim of this study was to select the most suitable reference genes for qRT‐PCR of spotted sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) under different pathogen infection conditions. A total of 10 candidate reference genes were selected; they included RPL19, RPL7, RPL13, TUGB, 18S rRNA, CYTB5, eIF5A, ACTB, GAB2 and GAPDH. Transcript levels of these candidate reference genes were examined using qRT‐PCR analysis in 11 tissues (heart, liver, stomach, pectoral fin, intestine, muscle, brain, skin, gill, head kidney and spleen). Four algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and comparative ΔCt method, were used to evaluate the expression stability of the candidate reference genes. RPL19 was the most stable gene in different tissues in L. maculatus under normal conditions according to the overall ranking of the four algorithms. GAPDH was the most unstable gene in different tissues. GAB2 was the most stable gene in both head kidney and liver in L. maculatus under V. harveyi infection; RPL19 and RPL13 were the most stable genes in head kidney and liver in L. maculatus under S. iniae infection respectively; RPL19 and GAB2 were the most stable genes in head kidney and liver in L. maculatus under RGV infection respectively; RPL7 and RPL19 were the most stable genes in head kidney and spleen in L. maculatus under ISKNV infection respectively. GAPDH was the most unstable gene in immune tissues in L. maculatus under pathogen infections. The present study provides the first validated reference genes for accurate data normalization in transcript profiling in L. maculatus infected by bacteria (V. harveyi and S. iniae) and virus (ISKNV and RGV), which will be indispensable for further gene expression in this economically valuable marine teleost.  aPublisher supplied data  a202102020487cGuangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project  a201906010028cGuangzhou Municipal Science and Technology Project  a2020TD21cCentral Public‐interest Scientific Institution Basal Research Fund, CAFS  a31802281cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2021SD11cSpecial Scientific Research Funds for Central Non‐profit Institutes and South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences 3aLateolabrax japonicus 3aaquaculture 3abass 3abrain 3afins 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheart 3aintestines 3akidneys 3aliver 3amuscles 3apathogens 3aresearch 3aspleen 3astomach 3aviruses1 aYan, Lulu1 aWang, Pengfei1 aZhao, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2654-60581 aFan, Sigang1 aQiu, Lihua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8999-19011 aZhang, Yaqing1 aQiao, Xiuting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7089-579X0 tAquaculture research.g2022 Apr., v. 53, no. 5 p.1613-1626dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.156963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245007600166520164100242592002801883650002001911650001801931650001201949650001401961650001701975650001501992650001102007653002402018653001302042653001102055653001402066700001902080700001702099700001902116700001602135700001702151700001702168700001502185700001802200773010902218856008602327852000902413655001202422IND60751268620221119080453.0211029e20220103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075126862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1106072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenjie10aEffect of grafting on the growth and flowering of sprays chrysanthemums  aTo study the effect of grafting on the growth and flowering of spray chrysanthemum, Artemisia annua was used as the rootstock and eight spray chrysanthemum varieties 'Zhongshan Jinyang' ('ZSJY'), 'Zhongshan Xinmolian' ('ZSXML'), 'Zhongshan Xuerong' ('ZSXR'), 'Zhongshan Yinggui' ('ZSYG'), 'Zhongshan Zaohong' ('ZSZH'), 'Zhongshan Zhiying' ('ZSZY'), 'Zhongshan Zisongguo' ('ZSZSG'), and 'Zhongshan Ziwei' ('ZSZW') were used as the scions. The plant survival ratio, growth index (crown width, crown circumference, and biomass), and flowering characteristics (total inflorescences per plant, flower diameter, fresh and dry weight of single flowers, and flowering period) were studied after grafting. We found that for variety ‘ZSYG’, the grafted plants showed a 58.4% increase in crown width, a 68.7% increase in crown circumference, a 61.8% increase in the dry weight of the scion, a 108.4% increase in the dry weight of root, a 72.3% increase in the total dry weight, a 28.3% increase in root/shoot, and a 135.2% increase in the total inflorescences per plant compared to those in the own-rooted plants. Grafting can not only promote plant growth and increase plant biomass, and the total inflorescences per plant of spray chrysanthemum but also lengthen the ornamental period of spray chrysanthemum by advancing flowering and delaying the final flowering period. The budding period can be advanced by 13 d, the final flowering period can be delayed by 4 d, and the ornamental period can be increased by 10 d. Therefore, grafting facilitates the growth of spray chrysanthemums, advances flowering, and prolongs the ornamental period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia annua 3aChrysanthemum 3aflowers 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3arootstocks 3ascions 0aSpray chrysanthemum 0aGrafting 0aGrowth 0aFlowering1 aChen, Xiaoyang1 aZhao, Shuang1 aZhan, Qingling1 aChen, Sumei1 aJiang, Jiafu1 aFang, Weimin1 aChen, Fadi1 aGuan, Zhiyong0 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Jan. 03, v. 291 p.110607-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1106073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03736naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245016100190300001600351520147600367592002801843650002401871650002101895650002201916650001701938650001501955650001501970650002701985650001202012650001902024650000702043650001202050650001402062650001702076650001202093650003602105650002802141650008502169650004902254650002302303650001902326650007002345650002302415650001202438650001302450650003102463651001102494653002902505653000902534653004802543653002102591653002202612653001702634653003802651700001902689700001802708700002402726700001902750700001702769700001702786700001702803700002102820773011302841856005102954852000903005655001203014IND50087217220221121121606.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008721722DNAL7 a220594772pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2011.6275712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagalhães, C.G.10aIn-house validation of Premi®Test, a microbiological screening test with solvent extraction, for the detection of antimicrobial residues in poultry muscles  ap. 535-540.  aPremi®Test, a microbial inhibition test for the screening of antimicrobial residues, was validated according to the criteria established by Decision 2002/657/EC. Sensitivity, detection capability (CCβ), specificity, selectivity, robustness and applicability were evaluated. The methodology involves the technique of solvent extraction, which increases the detection capability of the test for a wider range of antibiotics. The following CCβ values in poultry muscle were found: penicillin G ≤ 12.5 µg kg⁻¹, total sulfonamides ≤75 µg kg⁻¹, erythromycin 75 µg kg⁻¹ and lincomycin 50 µg kg⁻¹. The detection capability of chlortetracycline was equal to its maximum residue limit (100 µg kg⁻¹) and the method did not detect gentamicin (1000 µg kg⁻¹), for which no MRL is established in poultry muscle. Specificity evaluated in relation to different analytes and matrices did not detect any interferences in the tests results; whilst the robustness showed that the pH neutralisation point of the extract affects the analytical results and the kits’ performance. Only the screening of tetracyclines requires the analysis of extracts without pH neutralisation. The results of the validation process showed that this method is acceptable for screening β-lactam, sulfonamide and macrolide antimicrobial groups in the National Residues and Contaminants Control Programme (PNCRC), and that for this it is fit for purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3abenzylpenicillin 3achlortetracycline 3aerythromycin 3agentamicin 3alincomycin 3amaximum residue limits 3amuscles 3aneutralization 3apH 3apoultry 3ascreening 3asulfonamides 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxlegislation & jurisprudencexprevention & control. 2aGeobacillus stearothermophilusxdrug effects 2aLimit of Detection 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMicrobiological Techniquesxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aMusclesxchemistry 2aPoultry 2aSolvents 2aVeterinary Drugsxanalysis 0aBrazil 0aanimal products – meat 0ameat 0aveterinary drug residues – antimicrobials 0aveterinary drugs 0amethod validation 0amicrobiology 0ascreening – microbial screening1 aDe Paiva, C.R.1 aBotelho, B.G.1 aDe Oliveira, A.M.G.1 aDe Souza, L.F.1 aNonaka, C.V.1 aSantos, K.V.1 aFarias, L.M.1 aCarvalho, M.A.R.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 29, no. 4 p.535-540dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.627571  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005800169300001600227520148600243592002801729650002101757650001901778650001401797650002201811650002601833650001101859650001601870650002401886650001501910650001501925653000801940653000901948653001701957653001701974653002201991653002202013700001602035700001502051700001702066773008102083856008402164852000902248655001202257IND60582551820221118003654.0171006e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058255182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Jingliang10aEnvironmental/economic power dispatch with wind power  ap. 234-242.  aEconomic environmental dispatch (EED) is a significant optimization problem in electric power system. With more wide spread use of wind power, it is necessary to include wind energy conversion system (WECS) in the EED problem. This paper presents a model to solve the EED problem incorporating wind power. In addition to the classic EED factors, the factors accounting for overestimation and underestimation of available wind power in both economic and environmental aspects are also considered. In order to obtain some quantitative results, the uncertain characteristic of available wind power and the performance of WECS are determined on the basis of the statistical characteristic of wind speed. The optimization problem is numerically solved by a scenario involving two conventional generators and two wind-powered generators. The results demonstrate that the allocation of system generation capacity may be influenced by multipliers related to the cost for overestimation and underestimation of available wind power, and by the multiplier related to the emissions for underestimation of available wind power. Nevertheless, the multiplier related to the emissions for overestimation of available wind power has little impact on the allocation. Taking account of economic factors, environmental factors and impacts of wind power penetration, the proposed EED model is beneficial to finding the right balance between radical and conservative strategy for wind power development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic factors 3aelectric power 3aemissions 3aenergy conversion 3aenvironmental factors 3amodels 3amultipliers 3asystem optimization 3awind power 3awind speed 0aEED 0aWECS 0aPenalty cost 0aReserve cost 0aPenalty emissions 0aReserve emissions1 aZhou, Dequn1 aZhou, Peng1 aMiao, Zhuang0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Nov., v. 71 p.234-242dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01267naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245005500179300001800234520027800252592002800530650002300558650002200581650001800603653001900621653002000640653001600660653001700676653002600693700001600719773011300735856008400848852000900932655001200941IND60599521220221120202019.0180702e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059952122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.07.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFearnley, Stephen Philip12aA concise synthesis of (±)-3-deoxyisoaltholactone  ap. 5207-5209.  aThe novel styryl lactone analog (±)-3-deoxyisoaltholactone was synthesized in 5 steps from dihydrofuran.

Different hypobaric pressures at 0.025, 0.05 and 0.075 MPa were applied to stored blueberry at 0 °C. Hypobaric treatment resulted in lower fruit decay rate compared to control, maintained respiration rate and pH of the fruit for 0.05 and 0.075 MPa treatments, which implied that fruit freshness was maintained following hypobaric storage. Also, hypobaric storage significantly retained high bioactive compounds (P < 0.05), especially total flavonol and anthocyanins after 50 days storage at 0.025 MPa compared to control. The retained bioactive compounds were reflected as high antioxidant capacity indicated by DPPH, FRAP and TEAC. The treatment 0.025MPa displayed the lowest MDA activity on day 23 and highest on day 50, which reflected delayed oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. Evidently, high levels of POD, APX, PPO and GSH antioxidant enzymes in the 0.025 MPa stored blueberries may be due to delayed ROS metabolism. Partial least square regression (PLSR) model showed that, ROS were negatively correlated with anthocyanin, POD, CAT, SSC, flavonol, TEAC, FRAP, DPPH as well as hydroxyl radical scavenging ability. Similarly, path analysis (PA) revealed that MDA was negatively correlated with TEAC, TA and fruit pH, while hydrogen peroxide was negatively correlated with GSH and protein. Of the pressures, 0.025 MPa was selected as the suitable hypobaric pressure for Northland blueberry storage as significantly retained studied indexes at relatively high values throughout 50 days storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3ablueberries 3acell respiration 3aflavonols 3afreshness 3afruits 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aleast squares 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aoxidation 3apH 3apath analysis 0aNorthland blueberry 0aAntioxidants 0aPhenol 0aFlavonol 0aHypobaric storage1 aYao, Ting1 aMa, Guowei1 aGu, Zuchen1 aCai, Qiwei1 aWang, Yousheng0 tScientia horticulturae.g2022 Jan. 03, v. 291 p.110609-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1106093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010100169300001600270520170500286592002801991650003102019650002902050650002102079650001902100653001702119653002702136653001802163653002202181700002302203700002102226700001602247700002002263773008102283856008402364852000902448655001202457IND60582551920221118003534.0171006e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058255192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamadi, Afshin10aMulti-objective coordinated droop-based voltage regulation in distribution grids with PV systems  ap. 315-323.  aHigh penetrations of photovoltaic (PV) systems in distribution grids have caused new challenges such as reverse power flow and voltage rise. Reactive power contribution by PV systems has been proposed by grid codes and literature as one of the remedies for voltage profile violation. Recent German Grid Codes (GGC), for instance, introduce a standard active power dependent reactive power characteristic, Q(P), for inverter-coupled distributed generators. Nevertheless, the GGC recommends a voltage dependent reactive power characteristic Q(V) for the near future, recognizing that the Q(P) characteristic cannot explicitly address voltage limits. This study utilizes the voltage sensitivity matrix and quasi-static analysis in order to develop a coordinated Q(V) characteristic for each PV system along a radial feeder using only the local measurement and drooping technique concepts. The aim of this paper is using a multi-objective design to adjust the parameters of the Q(V) characteristic in the proposed droop-based voltage regulation in order to minimize the reactive power consumption and line losses. On the other hand, it is also possible to adjust the parameters in order to reach equal reactive power sharing among all PV systems. A radial test distribution grid, which consist of five PV systems, is used to calculate power flow and, in turn, the voltage sensitivity matrix. The comparison of results demonstrates that both approaches in the proposed droop-based voltage regulation can successfully regulate the voltage to the steady-state limit. Moreover, it is shown that the profile of reactive power consumption and line losses are considerably reduced by the multi-objective design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy use and consumption 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar collectors 3athermodynamics 0aPhotovoltaic 0aReactive power control 0aDroop control 0aGerman grid codes1 aShayesteh, Ebrahim1 aEriksson, Robert1 aRawn, Barry1 aSöder, Lennart0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Nov., v. 71 p.315-323dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014800167520168200315592002801997650002102025650002302046650001702069650002902086650001202115650001502127650002202142653002402164653002402188653002902212653001702241653001802258700001702276700001602293700005302309773009202362856008602454852000902540655001202549IND60750831420221120180132.0211009e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075083142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Miao12aA simple strategy to enhance the luminescence of metal nanoclusters and its application for turn-on detection of 2-thiouracil and hyaluronidase  aMetal nanoclusters (NCs) as promising nanomaterials for sensing applications have attracted significant attention because of their unique photoluminescence properties. However, the quantum yields of metal NCs are still relatively low when compared to conventional quantum dots and organic dyes, posing a major obstacle to their assay application. It is challenging but important to pursue a way to improve the luminescence of metal NCs. In this work, we developed a novel strategy to enhance the luminescence of silver nanoclusters (Ag NCs) based on the binding with 6-aza-2-thiothymine (ATT) via Au³⁺ bridging. We studied the possible mechanism of this binding-induced luminescence enhancement and attributed it to the ligands rigidifying. Since 2-thiouracil (2-TU), a common anticancer, antithyroid, and antiviral agent, featured a similar molecular structure of ATT, this luminescence enhancement strategy can be designed to sensitive and selective turn-on detect 2-TU. As far as we know, this is the first report for the fluorescent turn-on detect 2-TU. Benefiting from the good performance of this method and the advantages of fluorescence assay, intracellular imaging of 2-TU, which has yet to be achieved based on currently developed analytical methods for 2-TU, was carried out via our approach. Moreover, to further expand the sensing application of the developed luminescence enhancement method, we constructed a universal detection platform. Taking hyaluronidase as a target, the feasibility of the detection platform was confirmed. The discoveries in this study offer a simple route to improve the optical properties of NCs and design their sensing applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantiviral agents 3achemical structure 3afluorescence 3ahyaluronoglucosaminidase 3aligands 3ananosilver 3aphotoluminescence 0aSilver nanoclusters 0a6-Aza-2-thiothymine 0aLuminescence enhancement 0a2-Thiouracil 0aHyaluronidase1 aLei, Zhongli1 aLee, Patsy,1 aXiao, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4242-63870 tTalanta.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 236 p.122876-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012000156300001800276500001100294520162500305592002801930596002601958596005401984650002902038650001602067650001502083650001002098650002102108650004102129650002602170650003202196650001202228650003202240650001302272650001302285650001302298650001802311650001002329700001302339700001902352700001802371700005702389700005402446773012202500856007402622852000902696655001202705IND60769052820221119133725.0220301e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076905282DNAL7 a10.1111/are.156972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Weiwei10aEffects of low salinity on fatty acid and free amino acid composition of muscle tissues in Portunus trituberculatus  ap. 1627-1635.  aREVIEW  aThe effects of low salinity on fatty acid and free amino acid (FAA) composition in muscles of swimming crab, Portunus trituberculatus, were investigated in this study. The swimming crabs were reared for 5 weeks under two different experimental treatments (the 12 ppt group and the 24 ppt group). Then, composition of fatty acids and free amino acids in total muscles was measured using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) with external standard method and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometer (LC‐MS) with internal standard method respectively. Results of fatty acid analysis showed that C18:1n9c, C20:5n3 (EPA) and C22:6n3 (DHA) were the dominating fatty acids in muscle tissues of P. trituberculatus. There was an extremely significant increase in contents of total fatty acids (TFA), total saturated fatty acids (SFA), total monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) in muscle tissues of P. trituberculatus with low salinity treatment (12 ppt) compared with those cultured in seawater (24 ppt) (p < 0.01). Results of free amino acid analysis showed that the content of total free amino acids (TFAA) significantly decreased in muscle tissues of P. trituberculatus with low salinity treatment compared with those in seawater (p < 0.05). Among all flavour‐tasting FAAs, the umami FAA content was extremely significantly higher in low salinity group compared with control group (p < 0.01); the sweetish FAA content was significantly lower in low salinity group while the bitter taste of FAA content had no significant differences between two groups.  aPublisher supplied data  cK.

(A. annua). Previous studies showed that the complex chemical matrix of A. annua could enhance both the bioavailability and efficacy of artemisinin. The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of a combination therapy based on artemisinin and 3 components from A. annua with high content (arteannuin B, arteannuic acid, and scopoletin). In vivo antimalarial activity was assessed following a 4‐day treatment in murine malaria models (Plasmodium yoelii and Plasmodium berghei). Results showed that a much sharper reduction in parasitemia (~93%) was found in combination therapy compared with pure artemisinin (~31%), indicating pharmacodynamic synergism occurring between artemisinin and arteannuin B, arteannuic acid, and scopoletin. Multiple‐dose pharmacokinetics further demonstrated that combination therapy results in increased area under the curve (AUC₀→∞), Cₘₐₓ, and t₁/₂ by 3.78‐, 3.47‐, and 1.13‐fold in healthy mice, respectively, and by 2.62‐, 1.82‐, and 1.22‐fold in P. yoelii‐infected mice, respectively. The calculated oral clearance of combination therapy in healthy and P. yoelii‐infected mice was also reduced. These findings imply that specific components in A. annua might offer a possibility to develop new artemisinin‐based natural combination therapy for malaria treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia annua 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aPlasmodium yoelii 3aartemisinin 3abioavailability 3aleaves 3amalaria 3amedicinal plants 3amice 3amodels 3aparasitemia 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3ascopoletin 3asynergism 3atherapeutics1 aZhang, Chao1 aGong, Muxin1 aWang, Manyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8473-63380 tPhytotherapy research.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.1415-1420dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.60773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014200169300001600311520114000327592002801467650002201495650001001517650001801527650001301545650001801558650001901576650001101595650001601606650001201622650001801634653001701652653001901669653000901688653003201697653000901729653000801738653000901746653000701755653000901762653000801771653000801779653000801787653000801795653000701803700005601810700001501866700001601881700001801897773010101915856008602016852000902102655001202111IND60567163520221122132837.0190319e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056716352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Xiaohong14aThe effect of lamellar structure ordering on the retrogradation properties of canna starch subjected to thermal and enzymatic degradation  ap. 185-192.  aThe starch retrogradation is the main cause of quality deterioration in starchy food during storage.

The retrogradation behavior was assessed by morphology, transmittance, syneresis, and texture changes. At earlier stage of retrogradation, the starch gel has a smooth surface, with the time progressed, a coarse surface was formed, finally changed to hollow network structure. This process lead to a decrease of transmittance, and an increase of syneresis rate (SR) and hardness. Among the degraded starches, TDCS has a lower retrogradation tendency than native canna starch (NCS) and EDCS. Overall, the higher the lamellar structure ordering has, the easier the starch retrograde, therefore thermal and enzymatic degradation possess the potential capacity to reduce the degree of retrogradation by decreasing the lamellar structure ordering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCanna 3aalpha-amylase 3ahardness 3ahydrocolloids 3aretrogradation 3astarch 3atemperature 3atexture 3atransmittance 0aCanna starch 0aRetrogradation 0aSAXS 0aLamellar structure ordering 0aTDCS 0aNCS 0aEDCS 0aSR 0aSAXS 0aTPA 0aWSI 0aPLS 0aAVE 0aCR1 aLiu, Xingxun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9101-35251 aYang, Ying1 aWu, Jinhong1 aWang, Zhengwu0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2017 Aug., v. 69 p.185-192dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2017.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245015100168520136200319592002801681650002701709650002001736650001701756650002101773650001901794650001101813650001601824650001701840650002301857650001101880653003201891653003201923653004401955653002301999700001702022700001602039700001402055773009202069856008602161852000902247655001202256IND60750831520221120180128.0211009e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075083152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Yinghua10aEu3+-β-diketone functionalized covalent organic framework hybrid material as a sensitive and rapid response fluorescent sensor for glutaraldehyde  aA covalent organic framework (named as TpDq) linked by β-ketoamine was prepared by imine condensation reaction with 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (TFP) and 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (DAAQ) as building blocks. Via employing a functionalized modification strategy, a new lanthanide complex Eu³⁺-β-diketone functionalized covalent organic framework hybrid material, Eu-TTA@TpDq (TTA = 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone), has been synthesized. After post-synthetic modification (PSM), the shape and structure of the parent framework is well preserved and the modified material shows remarkable luminescence properties. Based on this, we designed it as a fluorescent probe and tried to use it to sense common aldehydes. The results indicate that Eu-TTA@TpDq exhibits a turn-off response toward glutaraldehyde which can distinguish from other common aldehydes. The fluorescent probe has the advantages of reusability, pH stability (4.50–8.52), fast luminescence response (<1 min) and low detection limit. The linear range of this method was 0–100 μM; the detection limit was 4.55 μM; the relative standard deviation was 2.16%. Furthermore, it has broad application prospect in both practical sensing of glutaraldehyde in water environment and simple detection of glutaraldehyde vapor. In addition, we preliminarily discussed the possible sensing mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acondensation reactions 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimines 3alanthanides 3apH stability 3astandard deviation 3avapors 0aCovalent organic frameworks 0aPost synthetic modification 0aLanthanide hybrid luminescent materials 0aFluorescent sensor1 aWang, Jinmin1 aZhao, Limin1 aYan, Bing0 tTalanta.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 236 p.122877-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245021100190300001600401520165900417592002802076650001702104650002002121650001502141650002002156650001802176650000902194650001002203650001502213650000902228650001502237650001102252650002902263650001202292650003002304650003602334650002802370650001902398650001102417650009202428650002002520650002302540650002202563650002402585650005702609650003802666650003102704653002902735653001002764653001302774653002002787653000902807653002702816653001002843700002202853700002802875700002402903773011302927856005103040852000903091655001203100IND50087217420221121121635.0140412e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008721742DNAL7 a222396152pmid7 a10.1080/19440049.2011.6411602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarreto, Fabiano10aDetermination and confirmation of chloramphenicol in honey, fish and prawns by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry with minimum sample preparation: validation according to 2002/657/EC Directive  ap. 550-558.  aA reliable, simple and sensitive liquid chromatography–electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI-MS/MS) confirmation method has been developed for chloramphenicol (CAP) determination in honey, fish and prawns. For honey, samples were extracted with ethyl acetate, an aliquot was evaporated to dryness and re-dissolved in mobile phase. For fish and prawns, tissues were extracted with acetonitrile and chloroform. The organic layer was evaporated to dryness and the residue was re-constituted with water: acetonitrile (90:10). LC separation was achieved on a C18 column with gradient elution using a mobile phase of acetonitrile and water. Analysis was carried out on a triple–quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via electrospray interface operated in negative ionisation mode, with deuterated chloramphenicol-d₅ (d₅-CAP) as internal standard. Method validation was performed according to the criteria of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Four identification points were obtained for CAP with one precursor ion and two product ions. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.02 µg kg⁻¹. Linear calibration curves were obtained over concentration ranges of 0.1–1.0 µg kg⁻¹ in tissues. Mean recoveries ranged from 85.5% to 115.6%, with the corresponding intra- and inter-day variation ranging from 1.0% to 22.5%, depending on matrix type and level of concentration. The decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) of the method were obtained for all matrices: 0.04 and 0.06 µg kg⁻¹, respectively, for prawns and fish and 0.05 and 0.09 µg kg⁻¹ for honey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3achloramphenicol 3achloroform 3adetection limit 3aethyl acetate 3afish 3ahoney 3aionization 3aions 3amonitoring 3ashrimp 3atandem mass spectrometry 2aAnimals 2aChloramphenicolxanalysis 2aChromatography, Liquidxmethods 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aEuropean Union 2aFishes 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxlegislation & jurisprudencexstatistics & numerical data. 2aHoneyxanalysis 2aLimit of Detection 2aSeafoodxanalysis 2aShellfishxanalysis 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxmethods 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aVeterinary Drugsxanalysis 0achromatographic analysis 0aLC/MS 0aclean-up 0achloramphenicol 0ameat 0afish and fish products 0ahoney1 aRibeiro, Cristina1 aHoff, Rodrigo Barcellos1 aCosta, Teresa Dalla0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 29, no. 4 p.550-558dTaylor & Francis Groupx1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.641160  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016600168300001600334520136300350592002801713650002401741650001101765650002501776650001101801650001601812650001101828650002701839650002901866650002101895650002401916650001601940650001901956650002001975650002001995651001102015653001102026653000802037653001902045653001902064700002102083773008102104856008402185852000902269655001202278IND60582552020221118003446.0171006e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058255202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLantz, Mikael10aGreenhouse gas and energyassessment of the biogas from co-digestion injected into the natural gas grid: A Swedish case-study including effects on soil properties  ap. 387-395.  aIn this study, a large, farm-based, co-digestion plant in southern Sweden, using manure and various food industry wastes is investigated concerning its use of energy and its emissions of greenhouse gases from a life cycle perspective based on measured, site-specific data. The biogas is upgraded and utilized as a vehicle fuel, distributed via the natural gas grid. The case-study also includes a novel approach in which potential changes in soil compaction and soil carbon levels are assessed, based on farm-specific conditions, when digestate replaces mineral fertilizer. An additional objective is to identify potential technical improvements leading to further GHG reductions, and the cost of such measures. According to this case-study, biogas produced from food industry waste and manure in a modern co-digestion plant could reduce GHG emissions by approximately 90% compared to conventional fossil fuels. The corresponding energy input:output ratio is calculated to be about 25%, where the use of electricity in the biogas process, upgrading and pressurisation is the dominating energy input. Finally, several possible technical improvements to further reduce GHG emissions were identified. The economic prerequisites of the specific improvements varied, from profitable from a business perspective to unprofitable from a socio-economic point-of-view.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abusiness enterprises 3acarbon 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afood processing wastes 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amineral fertilizers 3anatural gas 3asocioeconomics 3asoil compaction 3asoil properties 3aSweden 0aBiogas 0aLCA 0aGreenhouse gas 0aEnergy balance1 aBörjesson, Pål0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Nov., v. 71 p.387-395dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245019700168300001300365520138700378592002801765650001801793650002101811650001301832650001901845650002601864650001901890650001401909650001301923653001101936653000701947653001001954653001901964653001901983700001702002700001502019700001702034700005302051773008402104856008502188852000902273655001202282IND60650895320221122223936.0200419e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065089532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2018.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Guodong10aSelf-assembled complexes of graphene oxide and oxidized vapor-grown carbon fibers for simultaneously enhancing the strength and toughness of epoxy and multi-scale carbon fiber/epoxy composites  ap. 6-18.  aReinforcement of polymers with small addition of nanofillers has been intensively investigated. It has been suggested that combination of few-layer graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is more effective than single nanofillers for polymer reinforcement. Herein, we report that the complexes of single-layer graphene oxide (GO) and oxidized vapor-grown carbon fibers (OVGCFs), with dimensionalities of 2 and 1, respectively, simultaneously improve the strength and toughness of epoxy and multi-scale carbon fiber reinforced composites at an extremely low content (∼0.2 wt%). The GO-OVGCF complexes are formed in water by the π-π stacking-induced self-assembly of OVGCFs and GO, and then rapidly transferred to a tertiary amine type epoxy oligomer for the preparation of epoxy and multi-scale composites. OVGCFs were observed to be wrapped by small GO sheets, which greatly improve the dispersion uniformity of OVGCFs in epoxy matrix and the filler-matrix interfacial interactions. The influences of the complexes with various GO-to-OVGCF ratios on the mechanical properties of epoxy and multi-scale composites were investigated systematically. At the optimized GO-to-OVGCF ratio, the complexes increase the mechanical properties of epoxy and multi-scale composites more significantly than previously reported individual nanofillers and the CNT-GNP hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acarbon nanotubes 3aepoxides 3agraphene oxide 3amechanical properties 3ananocomposites 3aoxidation 3apolymers 0aOVGCFs 0aGO 0aTGPAP 0aPhase transfer 0aπ-π stacking1 aYao, Huichao1 aZhou, Yang1 aWang, Weitao1 aPeng, Mao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4663-71300 tCarbon.g2018 Oct., v. 137 p.6-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2018.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01712naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008600174300001800260520043700278592002800715650001800743650002300761650002300784650002900807650001100836650001800847650001100865653002700876653003100903653003000934653001500964653001000979700002100989700002001010700001601030700002101046700001701067773011301084856008401197852000901281655001201290IND60599521520221120171226.0180702e20140917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059952152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2014.07.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShinohara, Hiroyuki10aSilica gel-promoted convenient synthesis of 2-bromo-3-hydroxybenzoate derivatives  ap. 5302-5305.  aA convenient silica gel-promoted synthesis of 2-bromo-3-hydroxybenzoate derivatives has been developed via the Diels–Alder reaction of furans with methyl 3-bromopropiolate, followed by a ring-opening aromatization.

Review  aThe development of diagnostic devices based on memetic molecular recognitions are becoming highly promising due to high specificity, sensitivity, stability, and low-cost comparing to natural molecular recognition. During the last decade, molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) and aptamer have shown dramatic enhancement in the molecular recognition characteristics for bio(chemical) sensing applications. Recently, MIP-aptamer, as an emerging hybrid recognition element, merged the advantages of the both recognition components. This dual recognition-based sensor has shown improved properties and desirable features, such as high sensitivity, low limit of detection, high stability under harsh environmental conditions, high binding affinity, and superior selectivity. Hybrid MIP-aptamer as dual recognition element, was used in the real sample analysis, such as detection of proteins, neurotransmitters, environmental pollutants, biogenic compounds, small ions, explosives, virus detections and pharmaceuticals. This review focuses on a comprehensive overview of the preparation strategies of various MIP-aptamer recognition elements, mechanism of formation of MIP-aptamer, and detection of various target molecules in different matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adrugs 3aexplosives 3ahybrids 3amolecular imprinting 3aneurotransmitters 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymers 3aviruses 0aDual recognition 0aMIP 0aAptamer 0aMIP-Aptamer sensor 0aBiosensor1 aOmer, Khalid M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6866-41160 tTalanta.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 236 p.122878-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009600167300001800263520112900281592002801410596004201438650002501480650001201505650002001517650001601537650001601553650000701569650001301576650002001589650002101609700007401630700003501704700003101739773013401770856008301904852000901987655001201996IND60751380620221123022429.0211023e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075138062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11694-021-01019-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefi, Leila10aAntioxidant activity of ultrafiltered-Feta cheese made with adjunct culture during ripening  ap. 4336-4342.  aSix lactic acid bacteria strains previously isolated and fully identified from Motal cheese were used in ultrafiltered (UF)-Feta cheese as adjunct cultures. Antioxidant activity in cheese samples was evaluated on days 14, 28, 42 and 56 of the ripening period (5 °C). Cheese samples inoculated with L. brevis KX572376 (M2) showed the highest antioxidant activity, which was selected for further analyses. The highest DPPH radical scavenging and Iron (II) chelating activity of M2 cheese were 31.45% and 61.42%, respectively, which were observed on the 14th day of ripening. Fraction > 10 kDa showed more antioxidant activity than 5–10 and < 5. The electrophoretic pattern of water-soluble extract of M2 cheese also showed the presence of more bands above 10 kDa than the control sample (without adjunct culture). Peptide content in M2 samples was higher than the control samples. pH changes in M2 and control samples were different during ripening; while no significant difference was observed in the sensory properties. This study showed the ability of L. brevis KX572376 (M2) to produce functional UF-Feta cheese.  aPublisher supplied data  a48986cFerdowsi University of Mashhad 3aantioxidant activity 3acheeses 3aelectrophoresis 3alactic acid 3ameasurement 3apH 3apeptides 3aultrafiltration 3awater solubility1 aDovom, Mohammad Reza Edalatian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8137-75791 aNajafi, Mohammad Bagher Habibi1 aMortazavian, Amir Mohammad0 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2021 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.4336-4342dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-021-01019-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005500138245016200193300001800355500002000373520104800393592002801441650001901469650001401488650001901502650001001521650001501531650001901546650002201565650003801587650001301625700001201638773012301650856007201773852000901845655001201854IND60601091720221116172101.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060109172DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.60572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Jihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1115-845510aAstragaloside IV inhibits TGF‐β1‐induced epithelial‐mesenchymal transition through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NF‐κB pathway in gastric cancer cells  ap. 1289-1296.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAstragaloside IV (AS‐IV) has been reported to possess anti‐metastasis activity in cancer cells. However, it is unknown whether AS‐IV could inhibit epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular de‐differentiation program that promotes metastasis, in cancer cells. The aim of this study was to study the effect and mechanism of AS‐IV on EMT in gastric cancer (GC) cells. The results showed that AS‐IV significantly inhibited cell viability, invasion, and migration of GC cells. The E‐cadherin to N‐cadherin switch and expression of Vimentin and metastasis‐related genes were induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF‐β1), whereas AS‐IV reversed the induction. In addition, AS‐IV inhibited TGF‐β1‐induced activation of PI3K/Akt/NF‐κB. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NF‐κB pathway reversed TGF‐β1‐induced EMT. In conclusion, AS‐IV inhibited TGF‐β1‐induced EMT through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/NF‐κB pathway in GC cells. AS‐IV might be an effective candidate for the treatment for GC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastragalosides 3acadherins 3acell viability 3agenes 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3astomach neoplasms 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3avimentin1 aWen, Ke0 tPhytotherapy research.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.1289-1296dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.60573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009600176520110900272592002801381650002301409650001701432650002001449650001001469650001901479650001101498650002101509650001701530653001701547653002001564653002001584653001701604653003201621700002501653700005801678773009201736856008601828852000901914655001201923IND60750831720221120180114.0211009e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075083172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassanain, Waleed A.10aLabel-free identification of Erythropoietin isoforms by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy  aWe present a sensitive label-free surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) method for the discrimination between the recombinant and endogenous human Erythropoietin (EPO) isoforms. The proposed methodology comprises a lectin-functionalised extractor chip for the extraction of the recombinant human EPO (rhuEPO) and the endogenous EPO (enEPO) from blood plasma. The disulfide bond molecular structure of the purified isoforms was modified to chemisorb the biomolecules onto a SERS substrate in a unified orientation, thus maximizing the reproducibility and sensitivity of the SERS measurements. The acquired SERS spectra of the EPO isoforms showed diagnostic Raman bands that allowed for the discrimination between rhuEPO and enEPO. The method was also used for the SERS quantification of rhuEPO and enEPO down to 0.1 pM and 0.5 pM, respectively. The SERS determination of the protein isoforms was cross validated against ELISA. The new SERS method has strong potential for the rapid screening of rhuEPO doping in athletes and for the therapeutic drug monitoring of rhuEPO treatment in cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3ablood plasma 3adisulfide bonds 3adrugs 3aerythropoietin 3ahumans 3aprotein isoforms 3atherapeutics 0aEPO isoforms 0aLabel-free SERS 0aThiol chemistry 0aSport doping 0aTherapeutic drug monitoring1 aTheiss, Frederick L.1 aIzake, Emad L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1353-68270 tTalanta.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 236 p.122879-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005200138245011500190300001800305500001100323520143000334592002801764650001801792650001401810650001701824650002101841650001001862650001801872650001301890650003101903650001401934650002201948700005201970773012302022856007202145852000902217655001202226IND60601091820221116172047.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060109182DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.60682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7170-701X10aHerbal medicine for hand–foot syndrome induced by fluoropyrimidines: A systematic review and meta‐analysis  ap. 1211-1228.  aREVIEW  aThe aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of herbal medicine for the prevention and management of hand–foot syndrome (HFS) induced by fluoropyrimidines and to identify herbs associated with HFS alleviation for further research. The PubMed, Cochrane, Springer, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were searched up to May 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated herbal medicine for relieving HFS in patients undergoing fluoropyrimidine‐based chemotherapy. Study evaluation and synthesis methods were in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, and data were analyzed using RevMan 5.3. In total, 35 RCTs (2,668 participants) were included. Meta‐analysis showed that the addition of herbal medicine significantly reduced the incidences of all‐grade and high‐grade HFS. The total effective rate and complete remission rate of HFS patients increased significantly with herbal medicine arm. Further sensitivity analysis identified Paeoniae Radix Alba, Carthami Flos, Cinnamomi Ramulus, and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma as being consistently associated with significant reductions in HFS incidence without important heterogeneity. However, the lack of blinding in most studies may have led to overestimation of these effects. More high‐quality RCTs and experimental research are needed to confirm and investigate the efficacy of the herbs identified in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata analysis 3adatabases 3adrug therapy 3aherbal medicines 3aherbs 3ameta-analysis 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3aremission 3asystematic review1 aSun, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5675-04660 tPhytotherapy research.g2018 July, v. 32, no. 7 p.1211-1228dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.60683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01181naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008200169300001600251500001900267520034600286592002800632650001300660650001900673650001800692650001200710700002100722773009100743856004800834852000900882655001200891IND6036888720221120205104.0210830e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603688872DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078110501502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUl’zetueva, I.

PAN/UiO@UiO2-N₃-aptamer) with a high aptamer coverage density was proposed based on the electrospinning and seeded growth method, and used for specific affinity recognition of trace Microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Heterobifunctional ligand was used to modify the metal–organic framework nanoparticles (MOF NPs) surface, which could passivate the MOF surface with respect to unmodified DNA, followed by coupling massive aptamers on MOF of the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber using click chemistry. Characterizations including morphology, spectra analysis, mechanical stability, binding capacity and specificity were fulfilled. Applied to the analysis of MC-LR, the good selective and sensitive recognition were obtained with the detection limit as low as 0.003 ng/mL, which was better than most non-specific SPME or solid-phase extraction (SPE) protocols. The stability and reproducibility were acceptable, and the intra-day, inter-day and column-to-column relative standard deviations (RSDs) for the recovery of MC-LR were gained in the range from 2.5% to 14.3%, respectively. Satisfactory recoveries of MC-LR in environmental water samples were measured as 96.3 ± 4.7% - 98.9 ± 2.7% (n = 3) in tap water, 94.4 ± 2.5% - 96.1 ± 3.5% (n = 3) in pond water, and 97.0 ± 2.1% - 97.9 ± 3.1% (n = 3) in river water, respectively. This work demonstrated that the electrospun nanofibrous composite with massive aptamers would be a better alternative for ultra-trace MC-LR detection with good selectivity, matrix-resistance ability and high resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achemistry 3acoordination polymers 3adetection limit 3aligands 3amicrocystin-LR 3ananofibers 3aoligonucleotides 3ariver water 3asolid phase microextraction 3atap water 0aElectrospinning 0aAptamer 0aClick chemistry 0aSelective extraction1 aZhang, Zhexiang1 aShe, Zongkang1 aLin, Chenchen1 aLin, Xucong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2566-50361 aXie, Zenghong0 tTalanta.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 236 p.122880-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2021.1228803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008100174300001600255520213300271592002802404650002302432650001102455650000902466650001802475650002402493650001602517650001802533650001302551650001902564650001602583653001702599653000802616653000802624653002502632653001002657653001202667700002602679773008102705856008402786852000902870655001202879IND60582552320221118003520.0171006e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058255232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Gomez, Pedro10aSimulating blade-strike on fish passing through marine hydrokinetic turbines  ap. 401-413.  aThe occurrence, frequency, and intensity of blade-strike of fish on an axial-flow marine hydrokinetic turbine was simulated using two modeling approaches: a novel scheme combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with Lagrangian particle tracking, and a conventional kinematic model. The kinematic model included simplifying assumptions of fish trajectories such as distribution and velocity. The proposed CFD and Lagrangian particle tracking methods provided a more realistic representation of blade-strike mechanisms by integrating the following components: (i) advanced unsteady turbulence simulation using detached eddy simulation (DES), (ii) generation of inflow turbulence based on field data, (iii) moving turbine blades in highly transient flows, and (iv) Lagrangian particles to mimic the potential fish pathways. The test conditions to evaluate the blade-strike probability and fish survival rate were: (i) the turbulence environment, (ii) the fish size, and (iii) the approaching flow velocity. The proposed Lagrangian method simulates potential fish trajectories and their interaction with the rotating turbine with the limitation that it does not include any volitional fish avoidance behavior. Depending upon the scenario, the percentage of particles that registered a collision event ranged from 6% to 19% of the released sample size. Next, by using a set of experimental correlations of the exposure-response for live fish colliding with moving blades, the simulated collision data were used as input variables to estimate the survival rate of fish passing through the operating turbine. The resulting survival rates were greater than 96% in all scenarios, which is comparable to or better than known survival rates for conventional hydropower turbines. The kinematic model predicted higher blade-strike probabilities and mortality rates than the Lagrangian particle-based method did. The Lagrangian method also offers the advantage of expanding the evaluation framework to include additional mechanisms of stress and injury on fish, or other aquatic biota, caused by hydrokinetic turbines and related devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavoidance behavior 3ablades 3afish 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3aprobability 3asurvival rate 3aturbines 3aturbulent flow 3awater power 0aHydrokinetic 0aCFD 0aDES 0aLagrangian particles 0aTidal 0aTurbine1 aRichmond, Marshall C.0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Nov., v. 71 p.401-413dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245012500180520140000305592002801705650001201733650002101745650002001766650001401786650002101800650001201821650002001833650001301853650002301866650001501889653002801904653002301932653001501955653002001970653002301990700002102013773010702034856008702141852000902228655001202237IND60751269520221119080327.0211213e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075126952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1030942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŞahin, Mehmet Kürşat10aThermal biology of two sympatric Lacertid lizards (Lacerta diplochondrodes and Parvilacerta parva) from Western Anatolia  aSympatric lizard species present convenient models for studying differentiation in thermal behavior and the role of morphological differences in their thermal biology. Here we studied the thermal biology of two sympatric lizard species which occur sympatrically in the Phrygian Valley of Western Anatolia. These two species differ in body size, with Lacerta diplochondrodes being larger than Parvilacerta parva. The surface body temperatures of the individuals belonging to both species were recorded when active in the field. Additionally, several environmental parameters including solar radiation, substrate temperature, air temperature and wind speed were monitored to investigate the relative effects of these abiotic parameters on the thermal biology of the two species. The surface body temperature and temperature excess (difference between body and substrate temperature) of the two species, while being relatively close to each other, showed seasonal differences. Solar radiation, substrate temperature and air temperature were the main factors influencing their thermal biology. Additionally, although body size did not have a direct effect on body temperature or temperature excess, the interaction between body size and solar radiation on temperature excess was significant. In conclusion, our study partially supports the conservation of body temperature of related lizard species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLacerta 3aTurkey (country) 3aair temperature 3abody size 3abody temperature 3alizards 3asolar radiation 3asympatry 3athermal properties 3awind speed 0aLacerta diplochondrodes 0aParvilacerta parva 0aLacertidae 0aThermal ecology 0aSeasonal variation1 aKuyucu, Arda Cem0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2021 Oct., v. 101 p.103094-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1030943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008000169300001600249520138400265592002801649650001701677650001101694650002901705650002501734650001801759650001201777650001501789650001701804650002301821650002301844650001101867650001101878650002001889650001201909650001401921650002001935650001101955651001101966653002101977653002401998653002502022653002302047653002202070653001502092653001102107700002002118700002402138700001802162700002402180700001802204700001902222700002502241700002202266700002102288700001902309700002202328773011102350856008502461852000902546655001202555IND60525834220221117202347.0190401e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052583422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeksne, Gunita10aHigh prevalence of Trichinella spp. in sylvatic carnivore mammals of Latvia  ap. 118-123.  aTrichinella spp. are zoonotic parasites transmitted to humans by the consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked meat of different animal species. Carnivore mammals are important reservoir hosts of these nematodes. The aims of this work were to establish the prevalence of Trichinella spp. and infection intensity in sylvatic carnivore mammals of Latvia, to identify the etiological agents at the species level and their circulation in the Latvian regions. From 2010 to 2014, muscle samples were collected from 1286 hunted animals (2 European badgers, 137 pine martens, 24 stone martens, 4 golden jackals, 394 raccoon dogs, 668 red foxes, 23 grey wolves, and 34 Eurasian lynxes). Trichinella spp. larvae were isolated by muscle digestion. Overall, 633 animals (49.2%; 95% CI 46.5%-52.0%) belonging to all the eight investigated species, tested positive for Trichinella spp. larvae. Trichinella britovi was the most common species (94.0%; 95% CI 91.7%–95.7%). Trichinella nativa was detected in 30 animals as single (6, 1.1%; 95% CI 0.4%–2.3%) or mixed infection (24, 4.4%; 95% CI 2.9%–6.4%) with T. britovi. Trichinella spiralis was detected in only three animals as mixed infection with T. britovi. The high prevalence of Trichinella spp. infection in sylvatic carnivore mammals suggests that they are good indicators for the risk assessment of Trichinella spp. in Latvia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis aureus 3aMartes 3aNyctereutes procyonoides 3aTrichinella spiralis 3aVulpes vulpes 3abadgers 3acarnivores 3acooked foods 3adisease reservoirs 3aetiological agents 3ahumans 3alarvae 3amixed infection 3amuscles 3aparasites 3arisk assessment 3awolves 3aLatvia 0aTrichinella spp. 0aTrichinella britovi 0aTrichinella spiralis 0aTrichinella nativa 0aCarnivore mammals 0aPrevalence 0aLatvia1 aSegliņa, Zanda1 aJahundoviča, Inese1 aEsīte, Zanda1 aBakasejevs, Eduards1 aBagrade, Guna1 aKeidāne, Dace1 aInterisano, Marilena1 aMarucci, Gianluca1 aTonanzi, Daniele1 aPozio, Edoardo1 aKirjušina, Muza,0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 231 p.118-123dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2016.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008600164300001800250500001900268500002000287520201100307592002802318596005802346650002102404650001602425650001002441650001302451650001602464650002502480650001702505650000902522650001702531650001502548650001602563650002402579650001602603650000902619650001902628650001302647650002002660650001902680650003902699650001502738650001902753650001802772650001302790700002402803700002402827700002102851773012502872856007902997852000903076655001203085IND60707011720221120142402.0200812e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070701172DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.153152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasaki, Hitomi10aLipopolysaccharide neutralizing protein in Miso, Japanese fermented soybean paste  ap. 2498-2505.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMiso, a fermented paste made from soybeans, is used traditionally for seasoning of food. It has been a protein and nitrogen source since ancient times in Japan because of its high nutritional value. Furthermore, it has important health functions such as the estrogen‐like activity of isoflavones, anti‐oxidation, and angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme inhibition activity. Moreover, it has activity for neutralization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of that activity remain unclear. For this study, we purified and identified the proteins responsible for LPS‐neutralization. After proteins were isolated from a miso extract using Blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a protein found at 10 to 30 kDa on the polyacrylamide gel was identified using nano LC‐MS/MS as 2S albumin in soybean (Glycine max). The protein had two LPS binding motifs: SKWQHQ (22 amino acid residues) and EKQKKKMEKE (131 amino acid residues). The protein in miso was found to have LPS neutralization activity, as assayed by prostaglandin D₂ (PGD₂) production from macrophage cells. The PGD₂ production by macrophage cells was inhibited by LPS‐neutralizing protein (LNP) from miso. Particularly, 50 mg/mL of LNP solution and LPS (10 µg/mL) inhibited production of PGD₂ from the cells. The data were inferred as significantly different (P < 0.05) from statistical analyses by analysis of variance testing and Tukey tests. The 2S albumin in soybean is LNP, an LPS‐neutralizing protein, produced in miso. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: A protein from miso fermented soy paste neutralizes an Escherichia coli intestinal bacterial product, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which causes intestinal inflammation. Miso and its protein are anticipated for use as a probiotic agent to prevent intestinal inflammation in humans and domestic animals. Miso is useful not only as a seasoning for food, but also as a health‐functional food because it is an LPS‐neutralizing agent.  aPublisher supplied data  cKobayashi International Scholarship Foundation, Japan 3aEscherichia coli 3aGlycine max 3aJapan 3aalbumins 3aamino acids 3aanalysis of variance 3afermentation 3agels 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3aisoflavones 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amiso 3aneutralization 3anitrogen 3anutritive value 3apolyacrylamide 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprobiotics 3aprostaglandins 3asoybean paste 3asoybeans1 aPham Thi Ngoc, Diep1 aNishikawa, Masazumi1 aKanauchi, Makoto0 tJournal of food science.g2020 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.2498-2505dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.153153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03495naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007600139245013500215300001800350500002000368520172700388592002802115596006802143596006802211650002902279650001902308650002502327650001702352650001602369650001302385650002802398650001402426650002302440650001402463650001302477650002102490650001302511650001102524700002502535700003702560700007702597700006902674700002602743700002702769773012202796856007402918852000902992655001203001IND60769053420221119133550.0220301e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076905342DNAL7 a10.1111/are.157222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiranda, Diego Henrique de Sousa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1771-220210aAcute toxicity and sublethal effects of nitrite on oxidative stress in early juvenile Brazilian flounder, Paralichthys orbignyanus  ap. 1939-1946.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study evaluated the acute toxicity and sublethal effects of nitrite on oxidative stress parameters in early juvenile Brazilian flounder, Paralichthys orbignyanus. Fish were exposed to six concentrations of nitrite: 20, 40, 80, 170, 330 and 550 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹, plus a control with no added nitrite, all in triplicate for 96 h. Every 24 h, the tanks were monitored to check possible mortality to estimate the LC₅₀. At the end of the experiment, fish were sampled for stress oxidative analysis. All fish exposed to 550 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹ died within the first 24 h. The LC₅₀ ranged from 427.8 to 393.1 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹ for 24 and 96 h respectively. The total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) showed a gradual reduction in fish exposed to nitrite levels from 170 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹. The glutathione S‐transferase (GST) activity was higher in 80, 170 and 330 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹. The non‐proteic (NPSH) and proteic (PSH) thiols levels were higher in 170 and 330 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹ compared with the control, 20 and 40 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), as indicated by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level, was significantly higher in fish exposed to 330 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹ than the control and 20 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹. Moreover, a pro‐oxidant condition was induced when P. orbignyanus were exposed to concentrations from 80 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹, which was evidenced by alterations in the antioxidant system and increased levels of LPO. Therefore, it is recommended that the nitrite concentration do not exceed 40 mg NO₂⁻N‐L⁻¹ in order to avoid oxidative stress for early juvenile Brazilian flounder.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aParalichthys orbignyanus 3aacute toxicity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaquaculture 3aflounder 3aglutathione transferase 3ajuveniles 3alipid peroxidation 3amortality 3anitrites 3aoxidative stress 3aresearch 3athiols1 aMaltez, Lucas Campos1 aCampello, Marina Espírito Santo1 aCórdova, Joel Fitzgerald Linares1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3488-96641 aRodrigues, Ricardo Vieira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8809-47391 aSampaio, Luís André1 aOkamoto, Marcelo Hideo0 tAquaculture research.g2022 Apr., v. 53, no. 5 p.1939-1946dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.157223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006900170300001300239520069700252592002800949650001200977650001400989650001001003650001601013650001601029650000901045650001901054650001301073650000901086700002101095773012701116856008101243852000901324655001201333IND60479410120221123003811.0160121e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047941012DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590160100642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInzhevatkin, E.

It was shown that the extreme conditions induced metabolic changes that were independent of the cell type or the nature of the extreme factor. These changes characterized the metabolic mechanisms of cell adaptation and disadaptation. The concept of the “nonspecific metabolic reaction” of cells to extreme exposures had been introduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascites 3acarcinoma 3afever 3ahepatocytes 3alymphocytes 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3arats1 aSavchenko, A.

The occurrence of CI results in irreversible aroma loss, especially ‘peach‐like’ lactones loss during cold storage and subsequent shelf life. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment is effective in alleviating CI symptoms in peach fruit; however, its effect on peach aroma volatiles is still unknown. To explore the effect and mechanism of MeJA treatment on aroma loss of peaches, fruit was treated with 10 µmol/L MeJA, then stored at 4 °C for 3 weeks, and subsequently transferred to 20 °C to simulate shelf life for 3 days. Here, the ability of MeJA to regulate aroma lactones of ‘Xiahui 6’ peaches was investigated, and the expression of genes responsible for ethylene and lactones biosynthesis was considered. MeJA treatment significantly reduced internal browning index, increased ethylene production, and promoted the emission of aroma‐related lactones in peaches during shelf life at room temperature. In addition, MeJA also elevated the expression of PpSAMS, PpACS3, PpACS4, PpACO, and PpACX3 during or after cold storage. These results suggested that MeJA treatment could enhance chilling tolerance in peaches and induce the recovery of ethylene and aroma lactones, which is closely related to ethylene biosynthesis as revealed by upregulated genes expression of PpSAMS, PpACS3/4, and PpACO. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This research provides theoretical basis for the application of methyl jasmonate in fruit preservation and the basis for molecular breeding to cultivate aroma‐abundant peach fruits.  aPublisher supplied data  aPAPDcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions  aK2018029cJiangsu Key Laboratory for Horticultural Crop Genetic Improvement 3aambient temperature 3aaromatic compounds 3abiosynthesis 3acold 3acold storage 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3afood science 3afruits 3alactones 3amethyl jasmonate 3aodors 3apeaches 3ashelf life1 aHan, Shuai1 aYu, Mingliang1 aMa, Ruijuan1 aYu, Zhifang0 tJournal of food science.g2020 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.2389-2397dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.153393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100002000175245018200195300001800377520099900395592002801394650002201422650001801444650002501462650001801487650001201505650001701517651001201534653001501546653001101561653001301572700002001585773012801605856008101733852000901814655001201823IND60652376320221118021911.0190712e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065237632DNAL7 a30838965 308389652pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800190000532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlint, Stuart W10aSeven-year itch: the UK Government’s difficult relationship with the food and drink industry since Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A Call to Action on Obesity in England (2011)  ap. 1326-1329.  aUnhealthy food and drink consumption is associated with a range of physical and mental health concerns.

These tools are used to study the chemical reactions, design and simulate the entire hydrogen production process, investigate the energetic and exergetic performances of the processes and perform parametric analyses (using intuitive and design of experiment-based methods).Investigating the chemical reactions of autothermal reforming (ATR) of glycerol reveals that the optimal conditions, based on maximizing the hydrogen production, minimizing the methane and carbon monoxide contents and eliminating coke formation at thermoneutral conditions, can be achieved at a water–glycerol feed ratio (WGFR), reforming temperature (T) and oxygen–glycerol feed ratio (OGFR) of 9, 900 K and 0.35, respectively. The energetic study of the resulting process indicates that approximately two-thirds of the energy fed to the process is recovered in the useful product (H2) and that the remaining incoming process energy is exhausted in the off-gas. The exergetic investigation reveals that the exergetic efficiency of the ATR process is 57% and that 152 kJ are destroyed to generate 1 mol of hydrogen. The process operating conditions recommended by the chemical reaction investigation suffers from low performance because energetic and exergetic efficiencies are comparatively lower than values previously reported in literature for other reformates. The parametric investigation indicates that more accurate conditions are needed to convert glycerol–hydrogen. These conditions ensure the lowest consumption of energy to generate a given amount of hydrogen. This paper recommends WGFR = 5.5, T = 900 K and OGFR = 0.96 as the optimum conditions for the entire glycerol-to-hydrogen process. For this configuration, the thermal and exergetic efficiencies are 78.7% and 67.8%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3achemical reactions 3aexergy 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amethane 3aprocess energy 3arenewable energy sources 3atemperature 0aHydrogen 0aGlycerol 0aAutothermal reforming 0aEnergy-exergy assessment 0aDesign of experiments1 aBaccar, Ines1 aPons, Marie-Noëlle,0 tRenewable energy.g2014 Nov., v. 71 p.368-380dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014600170300001600316520145000332592002801782650002501810650002201835650001901857650002001876650001901896650001101915650001101926650001501937650002901952650001401981650002301995650001002018651001002028653000902038653002702047653002402074653001402098653001702112653002802129700001702157700001402174700001602188700001602204773011802220856008502338852000902423655001202432IND60411417020221121043746.0150924e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041141702DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2015.10487142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Jingjing10aTwo-compartment models for describing temporal variation in the effective leaf area index of Robinia pseudoacacia stands on the Loess Plateau  ap. 678-687.  aLeaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter in many ecological models and its phenology significantly affects on net ecosystem production in deciduous forests. We examined trends in LAIe (effective leaf area index) using two-compartment models to test effects of stand age and slope aspect on seasonal rates of LAIe increase (k ₁) and decrease (k ₂). LAIe measurements were acquired from 24 sample plots over five months and used to develop robust predictive models for modeling LAIe dynamics. Generally, the stands’ k ₁ values were substantially greater than their k ₂ values. The LAIe increased rapidly between leaf emergence and saturation, and then lower slowly from leaf saturation to senescence. The strongest increase in LAIe was observed in 11- to 15-year-old stands on shady slopes (k ₁ = 4.76) and in young stands (<10 years) on sunny slopes (k ₁ = 3.94), but k ₂ values were largest in mature stands. The trees on shady slopes generally had higher k ₁ and lower k ₂ values than those on sunny slopes, except in the youngest stand. The results showed that two-compartment models can robustly describe leaf growth and loss rates in black locust stands, and that both stand age and aspect both strongly affect the rate and magnitude of changes in LAIe during the growing season. Hence, the two-compartment model is recommended as an effective method when monitoring the LAIe quantitative dynamics of broad-leaved forest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3adeciduous forests 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3aleaf emergence 3aleaves 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anet ecosystem production 3aphenology 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3aChina 0aLAIe 0atwo-compartment models 0adynamic variability 0astand age 0aslope aspect 0ablack locust plantation1 aHu, Xiaoning1 aZhou, Hui1 aYuan, Zhifa1 aZhao, Zhong0 tScandinavian journal of forest research.g2015 Nov. 17, v. 30, no. 8 p.678-687dTaylor & Francisx1651-18917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827581.2015.10487143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013100170520129300301592002801594650003001622650000801652650002401660650002201684650000901706650001501715650002401730650002201754653002501776653002201801653002401823653002201847653001601869653001601885700001801901773011601919856008702035852000902122655001202131IND60776809220221117230705.0220830e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077680922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSezen, Kutbay10aPerformance analysis of air source heat pump according to outside temperature and relative humidity with mathematical modeling  aThe paper investigates the performance effect of outdoor temperature and relative humidity on ASHP performance above frosting conditions, with the developed mathematical model. The model results are validated with the experimental data available in literature, of four ASHPs in the 2.7 kW−5.8 kW capacity range. 4 kW capacity ASHP is taken as reference. Constant heating (CH), constant work (CW) and variable heating (VH) modes are determined as operating modes. The model results reveal that relative humidity is a performance enhancing factor above frosting conditions. In VH mode, which is the most realistic operating mode for residences, raise in outdoor temperature from 7 °C to 14 °C increases the COP value by 30%, and raise in the relative humidity from 0.6 to 1.0 provides an additional 5% COP increase. In CH and CW modes, the contribution of relative humidity to performance increases with temperature, up to 10.7% and 6.4%, respectively. Correlations giving the COP change rate with respect to ambient temperature and relative humidity are derived with higher than 0.9839 R2 values for dry and humid conditions of the CH, CW and VH operating modes. These correlations can be useful for researchers who intends to analyze ASHP performance based on ambient conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aenergy conversion 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3amathematical models 3arelative humidity 0aAir source heat pump 0aAmbient condition 0aAmbient temperature 0aRelative humidity 0aPerformance 0aCorrelation1 aGungor, Afsin0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 July 01, v. 263 p.115702-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03233naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245022300169300001600392520183600408592002802244650001302272650001902285650002002304650001202324650001302336653004502349653002102394653004902415653002002464653001302484653001202497700002102509700002202530700002102552700002202573700002102595773011402616856008402730852000902814655001202823IND60603067520221119102153.0180712e20150710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060306752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarrut, Morgan10aPotential and limitations of on-line comprehensive reversed phase liquid chromatography×supercritical fluid chromatography for the separation of neutral compounds: An approach to separate an aqueous extract of bio-oil  ap. 124-133.  aOn-line comprehensive Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography×Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (RPLCxSFC) was investigated for the separation of complex samples of neutral compounds. The presented approach aimed at overcoming the constraints involved by such a coupling. The search for suitable conditions (stationary phases, injection solvent, injection volume, design of interface) are discussed with a view of ensuring a good transfer of the compounds between both dimensions, thereby allowing high effective peak capacity in the second dimension. Instrumental aspects that are of prime importance in on-line 2D separations, were also tackled (dwell volume, extra column volume and detection). After extensive preliminary studies, an on-line RPLCxSFC separation of a bio-oil aqueous extract was carried out and compared to an on-line RPLCxRPLC separation of the same sample in terms of orthogonality, peak capacity and sensitivity. Both separations were achieved in 100min. For this sample and in these optimized conditions, it is shown that RPLCxSFC (with Hypercarb and Acquity BEH-2EP as stationary phases in first and second dimension respectively) can generate a slightly higher peak capacity than RPLCxRPLC (with Hypercarb and Acquity CSH phenyl-hexyl as stationary phases in first and second dimension respectively) (620 vs 560). Such a result is essentially due to the high degree of orthogonality between RPLC and SFC which may balance for lesser peak efficiency obtained with SFC as second dimension. Finally, even though current limitations in SFC instrumentation (i.e. large extra-column volume, large dwell volume, no ultra-high pressure) can be critical at the moment for on-line 2D-separations, RPLCxSFC appears to be a promising alternative to RPLCxRPLC for the separation of complex samples of neutral compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3achromatography 3ainstrumentation 3aliquids 3asolvents 0aSupercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) 0aOn-line RPLCxSFC 0aComprehensive two-dimensional chromatography 0aComplex samples 0aBio-oils 0aBiomass1 aCorgier, Amélie1 aCrétier, Gérard1 aLe Masle, Agnès1 aDubant, Stéphane1 aHeinisch, Sabine0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 July 10, v. 1402 p.124-133dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01508naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245013500161300001800296520037400314592002800688650003600716650001400752650002300766650002300789650001100812650001100823650001100834650001600845650001300861700001300874700001600887700001500903700001600918773010600934856008501040852000901125655001201134IND60579156320221118023326.0170816e20160805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057915632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b017162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lei10aCooperative Co(III)/Cu(II)-Catalyzed C–N/N–N Coupling of Imidates with Anthranils: Access to 1H-Indazoles via C–H Activation  ap. 3662-3665.  aCooperative cobalt- and copper-catalyzed C–H activation of imidate esters and oxidative coupling with anthranils allowed efficient synthesis of 1H-indazoles in the absence of metal oxidants.

The inventory is designed to be consistent with the 2016 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (GHGI) for 2012. The EPA inventory is available only as national totals for different source types. We use a wide range of databases at the state, county, local, and point source level to disaggregate the inventory and allocate the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions for individual source types. Results show large differences with the EDGAR v4.2 global gridded inventory commonly used as a priori estimate in inversions of atmospheric methane observations. We derive grid-dependent error statistics for individual source types from comparison with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) regional inventory for Northeast Texas. These error statistics are independently verified by comparison with the California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Measurement (CALGEM) grid-resolved emission inventory. Our gridded, time-resolved inventory provides an improved basis for inversion of atmospheric methane observations to estimate US methane emissions and interpret the results in terms of the underlying processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3adatabases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainventories 3amethane 3astatistics 3aCalifornia 3aTexas1 aJacob, Daniel

Thus, rapid and non-destructive analytical methods for screening sorghum for desirable grain quality traits benefit the industries using sorghum for food, feed, and biofuels as well as sorghum breeders and seed companies working to improve the grain quality of sorghum. In the present study, a method based on Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was developed to characterize the major chemical components in sorghum flour. Sorghum flour had three major FTIR active regions from 1800 to 800 cm⁻¹. As expected, FTIR spectra revealed that starch was the primary compound in sorghum flour, followed by protein with only minor amounts of lipids and phenolic acids. Phenolic acids were characterized by a peak at 1709 cm⁻¹, which varied in intensity across sorghum varieties. Tannin sorghum could be discriminated from non-tannin sorghum by a shift in O–H stretch band around 3300 cm⁻¹ and their C=C absorption peaks at 1608 and 1522 cm⁻¹. Flour from the outer part of the kernel (corneous endosperm) had greater protein and lipid absorbance while the inner kernel (floury endosperm) had stronger starch absorbance. Pearson’s correlation analyses between FTIR peak intensities and protein/starch content showed that starch content did not have a significant correlation with infrared peaks, whereas the amide I peak at 1652 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretching group), highly correlated with protein content (P ≤ 0.05). A calibration curve (Y = 127.79X-14.345, R² = 0.9454) was built using peak height at 1652 cm⁻¹ to predict protein content and this was applied to determining protein digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data  aC1011-15cUnited Sorghum Checkoff Program 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3abiofuels 3acalibration 3adigestible protein 3aendosperm 3agrain composition 3agrain quality 3alipids 3aprotein content 3aquantitative analysis 3asorghum flour 3astarch1 aBean, S.

Observations were conduct for 5 years (from 2013 to 2018). We studied ontomorphogenesis by generally accepted methods. Results. Diagnostic features of age stages of individuals in latent, pregenerative, generative and senile periods of ontogenesis are established. Detailed morphological descriptions of plants in different age stages and the sequence of their passing by individuals are shown. Conclusions. The peculiarities of the growth and development of P. tenuifolia on the northern border of the Ukrainian Forest-Steppe are manifested in the multivariate ontomorphogenesis. Established that is difficult to distinguish the immature plants from the subsenile ones on the aboveground part of plants only. In the reproductive period is not possible to determine a degree disintegration of the rhizome and calculate the number of individuals. Estimating the age range in populations (both natural and artificial), it is only possible to identify the number of aboveground shoots of different age states and the presence of generative reproduction in plants.

In the present study, metAFLP, a variation of methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, was used to investigate tissue culture-induced variation in triticale regenerants derived from four distinct genotypes using androgenesis and somatic embryogenesis. The metAFLP technique enabled identification of both sequence and DNA methylation pattern changes in a single experiment. Moreover, it was possible to quantify subtle effects such as sequence variation, demethylation, and de novo methylation, which affected 19, 5.5, 4.5 % of sites, respectively. Comparison of variation in different genotypes and with different in vitro regeneration approaches demonstrated that both the culture technique and genetic background of donor plants affected tissue culture-induced variation. The results showed that the metAFLP approach could be used for quantification of tissue culture-induced variation and provided direct evidence that in vitro plant regeneration could cause genetic and epigenetic variation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3aTriticosecale 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aandrogenesis 3aepigenetics 3agenetic background 3ain vitro culture 3ain vitro regeneration 3anucleotide sequences 3asomatic embryogenesis 3atriticale1 aZimny, Janusz1 aBednarek, Piotr Tomasz0 tPlant molecular biology.g2015 Oct., v. 89, no. 3 p.279-292dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-015-0368-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01700naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008700167300001600254520069400270592002800964650001600992650002001008650002101028650001901049650001001068653002601078653001901104653002101123700001801144773011801162856008501280852000901365655001201374IND60411417320221121043809.0150924e20151117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041141732DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2015.10487172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Wenfei10aEffect of magnetic treatment on seed germination of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.)  ap. 639-642.  aBased on preliminary experiments, the speed of germination (SG) was in general increased for Pinus taeda L. seeds treated with a static magnetic field (B = 150 mT) for 10, 30 and 60 min.

However, the modulation of solar heat gain has to affect the solar light transmittance in most existing dynamic glazing and window systems. In this work, a new type of dynamic window concept was proposed: reversible photothermal windows based on nanoscale solar infrared-induced plasmonic photothermal effects, which can modulate solar heat, independent of visible light conditions. This study provides the underlying technical characteristics and the thermal and optical features under solar irradiation via experimentally validated analytical models. The reversible photothermal windows exhibit a substantial ability to control solar heat gain coefficient with a range between about 0.2 and 0.6 and a stable visible transmittance of 0.32, A whole-building energy simulation demonstrates the potential for energy savings offered by reversible photothermal windows could reach over 18% in mixed climates, as compared to baseline models built using the most recent energy efficiency standards. This research illustrates technical and numerical evidence and mechanisms for energy savings that will support future research and development of this new dynamic window technology.  aPublisher supplied data  cMaterials Research Institute, Pennsylvania State University  cNSF  cUSDA  cUniversity of Cincinnati0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadministrative management 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat 3alight 3ananosheets 3aresearch and development 3asolar radiation 3atransmittance 0aDynamic window 0aReversible window 0aSolar infrared 0aSolar heat gain 0aBuilding energy 0aPhotothermal 0aNanofilm 0aSurface plasmon resonance 0aU-factor 0aSHGC 0aPPE 0aNIR 0aLSPR 0aSHGC1 aWang, Julian1 aZhang, Enhe1 aDuan, Qiuhua1 aFeng, Yanxiao0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 July 01, v. 263 p.115705-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03865naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245012600158300002000284520137200304592002801676596009801704596009801802596009801900596012801998596012802126596012802254596006902382596007302451596011502524650001402639650001502653650001102668650002302679650001302702650001402715650001302729650001302742650001802755650001302773650001702786650001702803700001802820700001102838700001802849700001302867700001902880700005602899700005102955700005803006773014903064856007703213852000903290655001203299IND60791762420221117235231.0220831e20220822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176242DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c064362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Liang10aAnisotropic Self-Assembly of Asymmetric Mesoporous Hemispheres with Tunable Pore Structures at Liquid–Liquid Interfaces  ap. 15754-15763.  aAsymmetric materials have attracted tremendous interest because of their intriguing physicochemical properties and promising applications, but endowing them with precisely controlled morphologies and porous structures remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a facile micelle anisotropic self-assembly approach on a droplet surface is demonstrated to fabricate asymmetric carbon hemispheres with a jellyfish-like shape and radial multilocular mesostructure. This facile synthesis follows an interface-energy-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism, which allows easy control of the micellar self-assembly behaviors from isotropic to anisotropic modes. Furthermore, the micelle structure can also be systematically manipulated by selecting different amphiphilic triblock copolymers as a template, resulting in diverse novel asymmetric nanostructures, including eggshell, lotus, jellyfish, and mushroom-shaped architectures. The unique jellyfish-like hemispheres possess large open mesopores (∼14 nm), a high surface area (∼684 m² g–¹), abundant nitrogen dopants (∼6.3 wt %), a core–shell mesostructure and, as a result, manifest excellent sodium-storage performance in both half and full-cell configurations. Overall, our approach provides new insights and inspirations for exploring sophisticated asymmetric nanostructures for many potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a21733003cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a21975050cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a22105041cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2017YFA0207303cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2018YFA0209401cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2018YFE0201701cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a21TQ008cFudan Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003347  a21TQ1400100cFudan Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003347  a21XD1420800cScience and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipalitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003399 3aScyphozoa 3aanisotropy 3acarbon 3acomposite polymers 3adroplets 3aegg shell 3aisotropy 3amicelles 3ananomaterials 3anitrogen 3aporous media 3asurface area1 aPeng, Huarong1 aXu, Li1 aWang, Baixian1 aLan, Kun1 aZhao, Tiancong1 aChe, Renchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4192-72781 aLi, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4641-620X1 aZhao, Dongyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8440-69020 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Aug. 22, v. 144, no. 34 p.15754-15763dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c064363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245012300167520099200290592002801282650001501310650001701325650002201342650001701364653002801381653001701409653001301426653001601439653001101455653002001466700002101486773010801507856008101615852000901696655001201705IND60757137820221122065814.0220118e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075713782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2021.1144732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRendon, Dairo A.12aA modern, simple, and economical accessory for continuous L-format measurement of steady-state fluorescence anisotropy  aIn this study, the pros and cons of the most relevant L-format devices reported in the literature for measuring steady-state fluorescence polarization/anisotropy are identified. Combining all this information, and with the use of modern elements for the acquisition, treatment, and recording of signals, a modern, simple, and economical L-format accessory is implemented to rapidly and continuously record steady-state fluorescence anisotropy. This device can be adapted to the majority of the commercial spectrofluorometers (or fluorometers). During the measurement, the emission polarizer is in permanent rotation by means of a Gimbal brushless DC motor, and as a result the recorded fluorescence signal is sinusoidal. The maximums and minimums of this signal, which are obtained with the help of LabVIEW tools, allow recording the fluorescence anisotropy. The LabVIEW applications developed for this investigation are freely available, so it is not necessary to have LabVIEW software.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3abiochemistry 3acomputer software 3afluorescence 0aFluorescence anisotropy 0aSteady-state 0aL-format 0aMeasurement 0aMethod 0aInstrumentation1 aPalacio, Juan L.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 639 p.114473-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2021.1144733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245005100202300001600253506007600269520102200345592002801367506003701395650002201432650001701454650001801471650003101489650002401520650001001544650004301554650000901597650001201606650002001618650002201638650001101660650000901671700002001680700001301700700001301713700001401726700001401740700002401754773010301778856008101881852000901962655001201971IND60439919820221207135005.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043991982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-015-0357-32doi7 aPMC45792672pmcid7 a263379382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Y.10aFunctions of OsDof25 in regulation of OsC4PPDK  ap. 229-242.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRelative little is known about the functions of the so-called Dof zinc factors in plants. Here we report on the analysis of OsDof25 and show a function in regulation of the important C4 photosynthesis gene, OsC4PPDK in rice. Over-expression of OsDof25 enhanced the expression of OsC4PPDK in transient expression experiments by binding in a specific way to a conserved Dof binding site which was confirmed by yeast and in vitro binding studies. Expression studies using promoter GUS plants as well as qPCR experiments showed that OsDof25 expressed in different tissues including both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs and that expression of OsDof25 was partially overlapping with the OsC4PPDK gene. Conclusive evidence for a role of OsDof25 in regulation of C4PPDK came from loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments with transgenic rice, which showed that down-regulation or over-expression of OsDof25 correlated with OsC4PPDK expression and that OsDof25 has functions as transcriptional activator.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC4 photosynthesis 3aOryza sativa 3abinding sites 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3atissues 3atransactivators 3atransgenic plants 3ayeasts 3azinc1 aVerhoeff, N.

This study distinguishes four stakeholders of the bike-sharing industry; these are bike-sharing companies, the public, the media, and government. A research model is proposed based on the Stimulus&ndash;Organism&ndash;Response framework to explore the impact of these four stakeholders on users&rsquo; intention of civilized use. The model was tested using 250 questionnaires collected from an online survey. The results demonstrate the importance of user-interface (UI) design, social influence, and new media in affecting users&rsquo; awareness of and attitude towards uncivilized behaviors, which in turn improve their intention of civilized use. The study also clarifies the moderation effect of firm and government controls on the relationship among different variables in the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aindustry 3amodels 3aquestionnaires 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3auser interface1 aLiu, Xin1 aLiu, Yaqian0 tSustainability.g2018 May 05, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100514373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04643naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011400169300001400283520278000297592002803077650001903105650001103124650000903135650001703144650001803161650001503179650002103194650001003215650001403225650002903239650002403268650001203292650001503304650001103319650002803330650001103358650001403369650000903383650001203392650000903404650001003413650001503423650001403438650000903452650001103461650001103472650002403483650001003507650001003517651001103527653000903538653001003547653002003557653001103577653003103588653001403619653001603633700002003649700002303669700002203692700001803714773011003732856008203842852000903924655001203933IND60569210520221120123551.0190411e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056921052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2017.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColbach, Nathalie12aA methodology for multi-objective cropping system design based on simulations. Application to weed management  ap. 59-73.  aWeeds are harmful for crop production but important for biodiversity. In order to design cropping systems that reconcile crop production and biodiversity, we need tools and methods to help farmers to deal with this issue. Here, we developed a novel method for multi-objective cropping system design aimed at scientists and technical institutes, combining a cropping system database, decision trees, the “virtual field” model FlorSys and indicators translating simulated weed floras into scores in terms of weed harmfulness (e.g. crop yield loss, weed-borne parasite risk, field infestation), weed-mediated biodiversity (e.g. food offer for bees) and herbicide use intensity. 255 existing cropping systems were simulated with FlorSys, individual indicator values were aggregated into a multi-performance score, and decision trees were built to identify combinations of management practices and probabilities for reaching performance goals. These trees are used to identify the characteristics of existing cropping systems that must be changed to achieve the chosen performance goals, depending on the user's risk strategy. Alternative systems are built and simulated with FlorSys to evaluate their multi-criteria performance. The method was applied to an existing oilseed rape/wheat/barley rotation with yearly mouldboard ploughing from Burgundy which was improved to reconcile weed harmfulness control, reduced herbicide use and biodiversity promotion, based on a risk-minimizing strategy. The best alternative replaced a herbicide entering plants via shoot tips (during emergence) and roots after barley sowing by a spring herbicide entering via leaves, introduced crop residue shredding before cereals and rolled the soil at sowing, which reduced the risk of unacceptable performance from 90% to 40%. When attempting to reconcile harmfulness control and reduced herbicide use, the best alternative changed the rotation to oilseed rape/wheat/spring pea/wheat, replaced one herbicide in oilseed rape by mechanical weeding, delayed tillage before rape and applied the PRE herbicide before oilseed rape closer to sowing. This option reduced the risk of unacceptable performance to 30%. None of the initial or alternative cropping systems succeeded in optimal performance, indicating that more diverse cropping systems with innovative management techniques and innovative combinations of techniques are needed to build the decision trees. This approach can be used in workshops with extension services and farmers in order to design cropping systems. Compared to expert-based design, it has the advantage to go beyond well-known options (e.g. plough before risky crops) to identify unconventional options, with a particular focus on interactions between cultural techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3abarley 3abees 3abiodiversity 3acrop residues 3acrop yield 3acropping systems 3acrops 3adatabases 3adecision support systems 3aextension education 3afarmers 3aherbicides 3aleaves 3amechanical weed control 3amodels 3aparasites 3apeas 3aplowing 3arisk 3aroots 3ashoot tips 3ashredding 3asoil 3asowing 3aspring 3asystems engineering 3atrees 3awheat 3aFrance 0aWeed 0aModel 0aCropping system 0aDesign 0aMulti-criteria performance 0aIndicator 0aAgroecology1 aColas, Floriane1 aPointurier, Olivia1 aQueyrel, Wilfried1 aVillerd, Jean0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2017 July, v. 87 p.59-73dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011600160300001600276520155200292592002801844650002801872650002501900650002501925650001101950650001701961650001501978650001001993650001402003650001802017650001402035650002002049650001002069650001202079650001102091650001102102650001102113700001902124700001902143700001802162700001302180700001802193700001202211773010302223856008102326852000902407655001202416IND60439920020221120034243.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043992002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-015-0366-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Tao10aAccelerated rates of protein evolution in barley grain and pistil biased genes might be legacy of domestication  ap. 253-261.  aTraits related to grain and reproductive organs in grass crops have been under continuous directional selection during domestication. Barley is one of the oldest domesticated crops in human history. Thus genes associated with the grain and reproductive organs in barley may show evidence of dramatic evolutionary change. To understand how artificial selection contributes to protein evolution of biased genes in different barley organs, we used Digital Gene Expression analysis of six barley organs (grain, pistil, anther, leaf, stem and root) to identify genes with biased expression in specific organs. Pairwise comparisons of orthologs between barley and Brachypodium distachyon, as well as between highland and lowland barley cultivars mutually indicated that grain and pistil biased genes show relatively higher protein evolutionary rates compared with the median of all orthologs and other organ biased genes. Lineage-specific protein evolutionary rates estimation showed similar patterns with elevated protein evolution in barley grain and pistil biased genes, yet protein sequences generally evolve much faster in the lowland barley cultivar. Further functional annotations revealed that some of these grain and pistil biased genes with rapid protein evolution are related to nutrient biosynthesis and cell cycle/division. Our analyses provide insights into how domestication differentially shaped the evolution of genes specific to different organs of a crop species, and implications for future functional studies of domestication genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aamino acid sequences 3aartificial selection 3abarley 3abiosynthesis 3acell cycle 3acrops 3acultivars 3adomestication 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agenes 3agrasses 3ahumans 3aleaves 3apistil1 aDimitrov, Ivan1 aZhang, Yinling1 aTax, Frans E.1 aYi, Jing1 aGou, Xiaoping1 aLi, Jia0 tPlant molecular biology.g2015 Oct., v. 89, no. 3 p.253-261dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-015-0366-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012200167520207500289592002802364650003002392650000802422650000902430650001702439650001602456650001602472650001102488650001802499650002802517650001702545650001202562650001302574650001202587653003002599653001702629653001502646653001702661653002002678700001802698700001702716700002002733700001702753773011702770856008702887852000902974655001202983IND60776809820221117230817.0220914e20220901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077680982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chen10aLiquid air energy storage with effective recovery, storage and utilization of cold energy from liquid air evaporation  aLiquid air energy storage (LAES), as a promising grid-scale energy storage technology, can smooth the intermittency of renewable generation and shift the peak load of grids. In the LAES, liquid air is employed to generate power through expansion; meanwhile cold energy released during liquid air evaporation is recovered, stored and later utilized for air liquefaction enhancement. However, it is challenging for effective cold recovery from liquid air in the evaporator and cold utilization to compressed air in the cold box. The current cold recovery fluids are exergy-inefficient, and thus the most suitable cold recovery fluids should be determined. In this paper, a practically dynamic LAES system with cold/heat storage packed beds is studied from the startup to stability. Some common cold recovery fluids, such as air, propane, and methanol/propane, are investigated and compared in terms of heat transfer characteristics in the heat exchangers (i.e., evaporator and cold box) and cold storage packed bed. Simulation results show that using pressurized air (10 MPa) as cold recovery fluid results in high heat transfer coefficients in the heat exchangers and cold storage packed bed. Compared to other fluids, the pressurized air leads to a larger exergy efficiency of 78.2% in the cold box, and a comparable exergy efficiency of 89.6% in the evaporator. It is found that pressurized air and methanol/propane are both good cold recovery fluids in view of the heat transfer performance in the cold box and evaporator, achieving similar idealistic round trip efficiency of 53%. However, the consideration of exergy destruction in packed beds will decline the round trip efficiency to 43% for pressurized air and 38% for methanol/propane. The cold storage packed beds with methanol/propane as cold recovery fluids are easier to be penetrated by thermoclines at the same size of pebbles, which causes a lower round trip efficiency. This study gives new insights into the effective cold recovery, storage and utilization process of LAES for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aair 3acold 3acold storage 3acommon cold 3aevaporation 3aexergy 3aheat transfer 3aindustrial applications 3aliquefaction 3aliquids 3amethanol 3apropane 0aLiquid air energy storage 0aCold storage 0aPacked bed 0aHeat storage 0aEnergy recovery1 aYou, Zhanping1 aDing, Yulong1 aZhang, Xiaosong1 aShe, Xiaohui0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 267 p.115708-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245009600165300001600261520096900277592002801246650001201274650001501286650001401301700002001315700002401335700001901359700002701378700002201405700001901427700002401446700002301470700002101493700002301514700002301537700002401560700002301584700002001607700001801627700001901645773012401664856007901788852000901867655001201876IND60300867420221119220451.0150703e20130208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030086742DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12315072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuber, Maria T.10aGravity Field of the Moon from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) Mission  ap. 668-671.  aThe Holy GRAIL?

Zuber et al. (p. 668, published online 6 December) discuss the overall gravity field, which reveals several new tectonic and geologic features of the Moon. Impacts have worked to homogenize the density structure of the Moon's upper crust while fracturing it extensively. Wieczorek et al.

In this study, a wheat (Triticum aestivum) NY-YB gene referred to as NtNF-YB3;l was functionally characterized for mediation of the drought stress. NtNF-YB3;l shares a high similarity to its counterparts across various plant species. The transcript abundance of TaNF-YB3;l was significantly up-regulated in roots and leaves upon drought and exogenous abiscisic acid (ABA), suggesting its role in regulating drought response possibly through an ABA-associated pathway. The TaNF-YB3;l overexpression lines exhibited improved growth under drought, which is consistent with behaviors of the transgenic lines with promoted stomata closure rate, enhanced leaf water retention capacity, and increased antioxidant enzyme activities and osmolyte accumulation. The genes encoding peroxidase (POD) genes (i.e., NtPOD1;3, NtPOD1;5, and NtPOD2;1) showed up-regulated expression in TaNF-YB3;l -overexpressing plants treated by simulated drought, suggesting their contribution to the TaNF-YB3;l-mediated POD activities. Transcripts of the ABA receptor gene NtPYL4 and PIN-FORMed (PIN) gene NtPIN4 were up-regulated in TaNF-YB3;l overexpression lines; overexpression or knockdown of them validated their roles in regulating plant drought response and modifying root system architecture (RSA) establishment, respectively. Our investigation indicates that TaNF-YB3;l is crucial for plant drought tolerance largely through its function in modulating an ABA-associated signaling pathway, which impacts on the physiological processes associated with stomata movement, reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolsim, osmolyte accumulation, and RSA establishment.  aPublisher supplied data 3areactive oxygen species 3adrought tolerance 3asignal transduction 3adrought 3awheat 3agenes 3aplant response 3aroots 3agenetically modified organisms 3awater stress 3aTriticum aestivum 3aperoxidase 3astomatal movement 3atranscription factors 3aeukaryotic cells 3awater holding capacity 3aenzyme activity 3aroot systems 3aabscisic acid 3astomata 0aleaves1 aZhao, Yingjia1 aShi, Shuya1 aDu, Xiaoming1 aGu, Juntao1 aXiao, Kai0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2017 Jan., v. 128, no. 1 p.97-111dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-016-1088-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245009900162500002000261520156700281592002801848650001201876650001001888650000901898650002101907650001001928650001501938650002001953650001401973650001501987650001502002650001302017650001702030650001802047650001402065650001002079650002202089650001302111700002002124700002502144700002002169700002702189700002102216700002102237700002502258773011702283856007202400852000902472655001202481IND60692480220221121221228.0200502e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069248022DNAL7 a10.1002/ecm.14042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKihwele, Emilian S.10aQuantifying water requirements of African ungulates through a combination of functional traits  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aClimate and land use change modify surface water availability in African savannas. Surface water is a key resource for both wildlife and livestock and its spatial and temporal distribution is important for understanding the composition of large herbivore assemblages in savannas. Yet, the extent to which ungulate species differ in their water requirements remains poorly quantified. Here, we infer the water requirements of 48 African ungulates by combining six different functional traits related to physiological adaptations to reduce water loss, namely minimum dung moisture, relative dung pellet size, relative surface area of the distal colon, urine osmolality, relative medullary thickness, and evaporation rate. In addition, we investigated how these differences in water requirements relate to differences in dietary water intake. We observed strong correlations between traits related to water loss through dung, urine and evaporation, suggesting that ungulates minimize water loss through multiple pathways simultaneously, which suggests that each trait can thus be used independently to predict water requirements. Furthermore, we found that browsers and grazers had similar water requirements, but browsers are expected to be less dependent on surface water because they acquire more water through their diet. We conclude that these key functional traits are a useful way to determine differences in water requirements and an important tool for predicting changes in herbivore community assembly resulting from changes in surface water availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acolon 3adiet 3aevaporation rate 3afeces 3aherbivores 3aland use change 3alivestock 3aosmolality 3aprediction 3asavannas 3asurface area 3asurface water 3aungulates 3aurine 3awater requirement 3awildlife1 aMchomvu, Victor1 aOwen‐Smith, Norman1 aHetem, Robyn S.1 aHutchinson, Matthew C.1 aPotter, Arjun B.1 aOlff, H.q(Han),1 aVeldhuis, Michiel P.0 tEcological monographs.g2020 May, v. 90, no. 2 p.e01404-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19342x0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.14043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245008800210300001400298520082600312592002801138650001901166650001801185650001401203650002801217650002701245650002801272650001301300650001401313650001901327650001401346650001301360650001601373650002201389650001101411650001201422650001401434653001901448653002201467653002601489700002201515773011201537856008401649852000901733655001201742IND60603068020221119102249.0180712e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060306802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPesek, Joseph J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6375-900410aAmmonium fluoride as a mobile phase additive in aqueous normal phase chromatography  ap. 69-74.  aThe use of ammonium fluoride as a mobile phase additive in aqueous normal phase chromatography with silica hydride-based stationary phases and mass spectrometry detection is evaluated.

Antarctica ecological system is characterized by the presence of few consumers and simple trophic levels (TLs), which are crucial in discussing the behavior of contaminants. To assess the biomagnification potential of DP in the Antarctic food web, nine representative species were sampled and analyzed from the Fildes Peninsula. Results showed the DP concentrations ranged from 0.25ngg−1 to 6.81ngg−1 lipid weight in Antarctic biota and the concentrations of anti-DP and syn-DP showed significantly positive correlations with TLs (p<0.05, ra=0.85; rs=0.81, respectively), suggesting that syn-DP and anti-DP underwent biomagnification and the biomagnification ability of anti-DP was higher than that of syn-DP. The anti-DP fraction (anti-DP/∑DP) (ƒanti=0.23–0.53) of the organisms was lower than that of commercial products (ƒanti=0.68), demonstrating ƒanti was changed during long-range atmospheric transport or stereoselection enrichment through the food web. Furthermore, based on food web magnification factors (FWMF) comparison between DP and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), the biomagnification potential of DP was found to be similar to that of highly chlorinated PCBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic food webs 3abioaccumulation 3aisomers 3alipids 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3atrophic levels 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aDechlorane Plus 0aFood web 0aTrophic magnification 0aStereoselection 0aThe Antarctic1 aYao, Yao1 aGao, Hui1 aLi, Ruijing1 aGe, Linke1 aTitaley, Ivan A.1 aSantiago-Delgado, Lisandra1 aMassey Simonich, Staci L.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 117, no. 1-2 p.456-461dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.01.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245012500158300002000283520086400303592002801167596010601195596010401301596007101405596009801476596010301574596007501677650001601752650002601768650001101794650003601805650002101841650001401862650001201876650001101888650001401899700002101913700001901934700001801953700006601971773014902037856007702186852000902263655001202272IND60791762920221117235208.0220831e20220816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079176292DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.2c066622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Baolu12aA Borane Lewis Acid in the Secondary Coordination Sphere of a Ni(II) Imido Imparts Distinct C–H Activation Selectivity  ap. 15793-15802.  aTwo borane-functionalized bidentate phosphine ligands that vary in tether length have been prepared to examine cooperative metal–substrate interactions. Ni(0) complexes react with aryl azides at low temperatures to form structurally unusual κ²-(N,N)-N₃Ar adducts. Warming these adducts affords products of N₂ extrusion and in one case, a Ni-imido compound that is capped by the appended borane. Reactions with 1-azidoadamantane (AdN₃) provide a distinct outcome, where a proposed nickel imido intermediate activates the sp² C–H bonds of arenes, even in the presence of benzylic C–H sites. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies demonstrate that the unique reactivity is a consequence of Lewis-acid-induced polarization of the Ni–NR bond, potentially providing a synthetic strategy for chemoselective reaction engineering.  aPublisher supplied data  a1R01GM111486-01A1cNational Institute of General Medical Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  a1R35GM136360-01cNational Institute of General Medical Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000057  a1625543cDivision of Chemistrydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000165  a22001249cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNAcMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  aNAcChinese Academy of Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002367 3aLewis acids 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aazides 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3achemoselectivity 3aextrusion 3aligands 3anickel 3aphosphine1 aSeo, Chris S.

Guppies (P. reticulata) were exposed to progressive concentrations of methyl parathion (MP) and chlorpyrifos (CPF); a semi-static method according to guidelines of OECD was used. Tests of acute toxicity were conducted using 10 fish for each separate concentration and for the control group. The results were subjected to probit analysis to determine the 96h LCââ values. The 96h LCââ values of MP and CPF to P. reticulata were 8.48ppm/L (5.98â10.89) and 0.176ppm/L (0.313â0.224) respectively. In addition, behavioral changes at each concentration were observed for the individual fish. Fish were exposed for 96h to different sublethal concentrations of MP and CPF (Â¼ LCââ, 1/8 LCââ and 1/10 LCââ) and their oxidative stress-induction potential was estimated in brain, liver and gills of fish. MDA content is induced in all tissues but maximum rise was observed in gills (161% and 153% for MP and CPF respectively). With regard to antioxidant defense system (ADS), GSH level decreased in the brain, liver and gills of tissues of MP treated fishes (22%, 6% and 13% respectively) and showed increase in brain and gills CPF treated (23% and 21% respectively). CAT, GST, GR and SOD levels fluctuated in all treatment groups relative to the control. Brain AChE showed dose-dependent inhibition in fish exposed to the higher concentrations reached 45% and 66% for MP and CPF respectively. Collective findings demonstrated that pesticide exposure of fish induced an increase in MDA and fluctuated ADS along with inhibited AChE. These findings may be used as valuable biomarkers for evaluation of water pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aacute toxicity 3aaquarium fish 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3achlorpyrifos 3agills 3alethal concentration 50 3aliver 3aparathion-methyl 3aprobit analysis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater pollution1 aMetkari, Vimal1 aPatode, Priyanka0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2011 Oct., v. 101, no. 2 p.132-141dElsevier Inc.x0048-35757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2011.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010300167300001300270520142800283592002801711650001201739650001401751650002301765650001301788700001901801773008601820856004801906852000901954655001201963IND50089284520221118102001.0140503e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008928452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-014-1840-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLento, Jennifer10aFilling the gaps in stream size spectra: using electroshocking to collect large macroinvertebrates  ap. 1-17.  aStudies of stream benthic macroinvertebrate size distributions describe assemblages from random small area samplers or cobbles. Large organisms are often underestimated in these samples because of their mobility or low densities. This study compared the performance of cobble collection and a Hess sampler with electrobugging (using a backpack electroshocker to collect macroinvertebrates) to determine whether electrobugging could improve estimates of the biomass of large organisms. We sampled 12 stream sites, collecting cobbles and Hess samples and conducting 3–4 consecutive electrobugging passes (repeating until attrition was observed, following with kick samples). Electrobugging collected more biomass of mobile taxa than cobble or Hess samples, and collected greater taxonomic richness, particularly at sites with low algal biomass. However, it was less effective at collecting attached and immobile taxa. Electrobugging extended the size distribution range by up to eight size classes by collecting larger macroinvertebrates than the cobble or Hess methods, and collected significantly more taxa per size class. Size distributions created from only cobble or Hess samples clearly do not represent the entire benthic community, but our results indicate that electrobugging provides a means to improve estimates of the biomass of large, mobile taxa, providing a more accurate estimate of body size distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abody size 3amacroinvertebrates 3asamplers1 aMorin, Antoine0 tHydrobiologia.g2014 July, v. 732, no. 1 p.1-17dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1840-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013200165300001600297500001900313520083600332592002801168650002501196650001601221650002001237650001901257650001801276650001601294650002101310700002101331700001901352700002201371700002301393773011901416856008101535852000901616655001201625IND60725624020221118021950.0210127e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072562402DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829200601272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmirnov, A.

Treatments of citrus fruits with Wickerhamomyces anomalus BS91 have been previously reported as effective measures to reduce the incidence of green mold caused by Penicillium digitatum. On the opposite, the knowledge of the antifungal activity of cultivated cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L. var. altilis DC.) leaf extract, vegetable widespread in some Mediterranean areas, is still very limited. In this study, experimental trials were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness in vitro of leaf aqueous, methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. cardunculus against seven fungal pathogens responsible for considerable food losses in the postharvest stage. In addition, biocontrol yeast W. anomalus BS91 and the three C. cardunculus extracts were tested in vivo both as a single treatment and in mixture, against Penicillium digitatum on ‘Tarocco’ oranges and ‘Femminello’ lemons. The combination of W. anomalus BS91 and leaf ethanolic extract reduced with the highest efficacy the incidence and severity of green mold on orange and lemon fruits with respect to the control, and was more effective than treatment with antagonistic yeast or leaf extracts applied alone. Incidence and severity of citrus decay were more consistently reduced when mixtures were applied 24 h before the inoculation of the pathogen, thus suggesting the relevance of preventive treatments. The mixtures of antagonistic W. anomalus BS91 and ethanolic leaf extract were more effective in controlling green mold decay on oranges than on lemons. These results indicate that biocontrol agents and leaf extracts, used in appropriate combination, can provide a stronger protection than when used singularly. However, compatibility between microbial antagonist and antimicrobial extract should be preliminary verified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aCynara cardunculus 3aPenicillium digitatum 3aWickerhamomyces anomalus 3aantagonists 3aantifungal properties 3abiological control 3acardoons 3adeterioration 3afood microbiology 3afungal antagonists 3aincidence 3aknowledge 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3alemons 3apathogens 3apostharvest diseases 3ayeasts 0aBiocontrol 0aGreen mold 0aPostharvest1 aLombardo, Monia1 aScavo, Aurelio1 aMauromicale, Giovanni1 aCirvilleri, Gabriella0 tFood microbiology.g2020 Dec., v. 92 p.103583-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2020.1035833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013800178300001800316520138000334592002801714650001501742650001701757650001401774650002901788650002901817650001001846650002301856650001201879650001101891650001001902650001901912650001301931650001801944650001201962650001001974653002801984653002902012653001902041653003402060653003002094700003002124700002302154700002502177700002402202700002702226700003002253773010502283856008502388961001302473852000902486655001202495IND60411418220221120054050.0150924e20151102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041141822DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2015.10439572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastelli, Karen Regina10aAnalysis of effectiveness of three forest interventionist techniques and proposal of a new and integrated model of forest restoration  ap. 2712-2723.  aWe assessed the efficacy of three different forest intervention techniques, in terms of phytosociological and edaphic responses, that were implemented in 2007. In a farm where trees are planted and managed for cellulose production as well as set aside for environmental conservation, four stands were analysed: three of them were considered degraded and were managed using different intervention techniques (transposition, perch, and abandonment), and a fourth stand comprising pristine vegetation was considered a control (reference). Floristic and phytosociology data were collected in three 10 × 10 m plots established in each stand. Also, a total of 48 soil samples were collected to analyse physical and chemical attributes of the topsoil for the different stands. In terms of biodiversity, all the treatments showed significantly lower values when compared to the reference area. However, the soils in all the treatment and reference stands are similar in terms of physical and chemical attributes. Taking into account the specificities of each restoration technique, we verified that the integrated use of a set of management practices, constituted by the (1) abandonment of the area and (2) following a selective killing of the eucalyptus, is the most suitable and promising model to provide fast and effective restoration in terms of environmental indicators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abiodiversity 3acellulose 3aenvironmental indicators 3aenvironmental technology 3afarms 3aforest restoration 3aforests 3amodels 3aperch 3aphytosociology 3aplanting 3asoil sampling 3atopsoil 3atrees 0aenvironmental indicator 0aenvironmental assessment 0aforest ecology 0aforest restoration technology 0ainterventionist practices1 aBarreto, Mariana Gregorio1 aFrancesconi, Wendy1 aValle, Leandro Dalla1 aMondelli, Giulliana1 aAbilio, Fernanda Maria1 ada Silva, Alexandre Marco0 tEnvironmental technology.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 36, no. 21 p.2712-2723dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2015.10439573Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245008400172300001300256506002800269520131400297592002801611506003701639653002301676653002601699653002201725700002001747700002101767700002901788773011501817856009001932852000902022655001202031IND60785333620221207095725.0211028e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078533362DNAL7 a10.21107/agriekonomika.v10i1.93912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarita, Leny10aStrategi Peningkatan Kesejahteraan Petani Indonesia, Review Manajemen Strategis  ap. 1-18.  aResource is Open Access  aPenelitian ini bertujuan membangun kerangka strategi peningkatan kesejahteraan petani, terkait kondisi petani, stakeholder pertanian, strategi yang dilakukan, dan ukuran kinerja, untuk memberikan gambaran trend manajemen strategis dalam peningkatan kesejahteraan petani.

The source of its decline in recent years has been largely attributed to the expansion of the dairying industry, and its improvement, a focal point of environmental management. A collaborative model has been developed in the Canterbury region, where committees have been created including government representatives, water management experts, farmers, and non-farming community members. These committees develop water management plans in a water catchment and can be seen to embody a form of socialising accountability where different groups hold each other accountable and share responsibility. One feature of the plans is the establishment of nitrogen loss thresholds for farms in a catchment, implemented through a highly technical form of nutrient modelling. Drawing from interviews and observations in Canterbury water governance networks, we argue that there is a tension between collaborative forms of environmental governance that seeks to socialise accountability, and nutrient modelling that de-socialise accountability in practice. We discuss how these tensions may challenge participatory forms of governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccountability 3aenvironmental governance 3aenvironmental management 3afarms 3aindustry 3amilk production 3amodels 3anitrogen 3awater management 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aNew Zealand 0aAccountability 0aAgri-environmental governance 0aCollaboration 0aMetrologies 0aParticipatory1 aLegun, Katharine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8238-63271 aCampbell, Hugh0 tJournal of rural studies.g2022 May, v. 92 p.451-461dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl38039x0743-01677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010600162520166600268592002801934650001501962650001701977650001301994650001202007650001202019650001002031650001202041650001302053650001702066700002202083700002002105700001602125700001902141700002202160700002202182700002002204700002402224700002402248700002402272773012202296856007502418852000902493655001202502IND60771381820221120234408.0220325e20220321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077138182DNAL7 a10.3390/nu140613132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeane, Colleen S.10aCurcumin Enhances Fed-State Muscle Microvascular Perfusion but Not Leg Glucose Uptake in Older Adults  aTherapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing blood flow may combat the postprandial vascular and metabolic dysfunction that manifests with chronological ageing. We compared the effects of acute curcumin (1000 mg) coupled with an oral nutritional supplement (ONS, 7.5 g protein, 24 g carbohydrate and 6 g fat) versus a placebo and ONS (control) on cerebral and leg macrovascular blood flow, leg muscle microvascular blood flow, brachial artery endothelial function, and leg insulin and glucose responses in healthy older adults (n = 12, 50% male, 73 ± 1 year). Curcumin enhanced m. tibialis anterior microvascular blood volume (MBV) at 180 and 240 min following the ONS (baseline: 1.0 vs. 180 min: 1.08 ± 0.02, p = 0.01 vs. 240 min: 1.08 ± 0.03, p = 0.01), and MBV was significantly higher compared with the control at both time points (p < 0.05). MBV increased from baseline in the m. vastus lateralis at 240 min after the ONS in both groups (p < 0.05), and there were no significant differences between groups. Following the ONS, leg blood flow and leg vascular conductance increased, and leg vascular resistance decreased similarly in both conditions (p < 0.05). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and middle cerebral artery blood flow were unchanged in both conditions (p > 0.05). Similarly, the curcumin and control groups demonstrated comparable increases in glucose uptake and insulin in response to the ONS. Thus, acute curcumin supplementation enhanced ONS-induced increases in m. tibialis anterior MBV without potentiating m. vastus lateralis MBV, muscle glucose uptake, or systemic endothelial or macrovascular function in healthy older adults.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3ablood volume 3acurcumin 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3amales 3amuscles 3aplacebos 3atherapeutics1 aDin, Ushnah S.

But attributing the cause to a large asteroid impact depends on precisely dating material from the impact with indicators of ecological stress and environmental change in the rock record. Renne et al. (p. 684; see the Perspective by Pälike) acquired high-precision radiometric dates of stratigraphic layers surrounding the boundary, demonstrating that the impact occurred within 33,000 years of the mass extinction. The data also constrain the length of time in which the atmospheric carbon cycle was severely disrupted to less than 5000 years. Because the climate in the late Cretaceous was becoming unstable, the large-impact event appears to have triggered a state-shift in an already stressed global ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3aradiometry1 aDeino, Alan L.1 aHilgen, Frederik J.1 aKuiper, Klaudia F.1 aMark, Darren F.1 aMitchell, William S.1 aMorgan, Leah E.1 aMundil, Roland1 aSmit, Jan0 tScience.g2013 Feb. 8, v. 339, no. 6120 p.684-687dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12304923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014400206300001600350500001400366520156200380592002801942650001301970650001701983650000902000650002502009650001402034650001602048650001102064650001202075650001102087650000902098650001602107650002202123650001802145650000702163650001702170650001402187650001002201650000902211650000902220650001202229700002402241700002102265773014002286856008202426852000902508655001202517IND60707009020210222000000.0200812e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070700902DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-020-00621-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamin, Silvana1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4560-930614aThe influence of mycorrhization on the growth of Zea mays L. and the sclerification of foliar tissues susceptible to chewing insect attacks  ap. 493-502.  aNAL-light  aThe interrelationships between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plants have been the subject of numerous studies; however, whether these mutualistic associations are capable of producing structural defenses in plants for pest control remains to be determined. The present study evaluated the influence of AMF on the sclerification of foliar tissues of corn and related it to insect attack. Corn plants were grown in 5.5-L pots containing soil/sand (sterile, fertilized, pH corrected) in a greenhouse. Mycorrhized plants received propagules of native AMF; non-mycorrhized plants received soil filtrate of AMF-free soil. Some of the plants of both treatments were collected at 40 days post-emergence, while others were collected at 50 days and 60 days. Height and dry mass of the aerial part and dry mass of radicular part were evaluated. The median region of leaves of the fourth (basal) and seventh (cartridge) leaf nodes was transversally sectioned, and the sections stained, mounted in semi-permanent medium and analyzed under a microscope to measure variables related to tissue organization and sclerification. Mycorrhized plants had greater height and aerial-part dry mass. Mycorrhization influenced nine of the 15 anatomical variables analyzed with increased lignified tissue in at least one of the growth stages. It can be concluded that colonization of corn roots by AMF promotes sclerification of leaf tissues and, thus, may interfere indirectly with the plant–pest relationship by altering the quality of phytomass available for insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aaerial parts 3acorn 3adevelopmental stages 3afiltrates 3agreenhouses 3aheight 3ainsects 3aleaves 3amass 3amycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aorganogenesis 3apH 3apest control 3aphytomass 3aroots 3asand 3asoil 3atissues1 aCarrenho, Rosilaine1 aMartins, Shirley0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2020 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.493-502dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22890x0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-020-00621-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245009300174300001600267520143400283592002801717650003001745650001501775650002201790650002201812650002601834650001201860650001101872650001201883650001101895650001901906650001001925651001001935653001901945653001301964653002601977653002902003653001902032700001802051700001502069773009802084856008902182852000902271655001202280IND60567161220221121032133.0190319e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056716122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHui, Eddie C.M.10aLand use, housing preferences and income poverty: In the context of a fast rising market  ap. 289-301.  aAlthough the public housing programme and the development of new towns are important (and interrelated) land use planning policies, many people hold the belief that these policies actually aggravate the problem of poverty concentration in several areas. This paper, in this light, analyzes their relationships with household income poverty in two consecutive five-year periods (2001–2006 and 2006–2011) in Hong Kong. The findings indicate that low-income households are more likely to cluster in the new towns, rather than in the inner-city regions, when property price is surging; and that the public housing programme does not show a significant relationship with household income poverty in both study periods. In addition to the preferences of low-income households in general, the preferences of the “sandwiched households” are specifically explored as well. These households are found to be susceptible to property price fluctuations in different regions, and therefore tend to cluster in the new towns. Not regarded as “poor” households under the 2001–2006 poverty line, the “sandwiched households” were (and still are) the most vulnerable, yet the most overlooked, population group in view of surging housing price and median household income. We suggest that the geographical distribution of newly-completed flats should be considered as a crucial factor affecting low-income households’ preferences.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageographical distribution 3ahouseholds 3aissues and policy 3aland use planning 3alow income households 3amarkets 3apeople 3apoverty 3aprices 3apublic housing 3atowns 3aChina 0aPublic housing 0aNew town 0aPoverty concentration 0aHousehold income poverty 0aLogistic model1 aZhong, Jiawei1 aYu, Kahung0 tLand use policy.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 58 p.289-301dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139242010400158245014000262300001600402520095500418592002801373650001601401650001801417650001401435650001201449650001001461650001001471650001601481650001901497651001101516653002201527653002901549653001701578653002601595653001901621653002301640653002001663653002501683700002201708700003501730700002201765773013001787856007401917852000901991655001202000IND60769050620221119133618.0220301e20220228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076905062DNAL7 a10.3356/JRR-20-902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanuto, Marcus10aComportamiento Territorial de Buteogallus lacernulatus y Pseudastur polionotus en el Este de Brasil10aTerritorial Behavior of the White-Necked Hawk (Buteogallus lacernulatus) and the Mantled Hawk (Pseudastur polionotus) in Eastern Brazil  ap. 101-105.  aStudies of territorial and courtship behavior are lacking for many tropical raptors. From 2006 to 2009, using observations that were not time-limited, we studied the territorial and courtship behaviors of the White-necked Hawk (Buteogallus lacernulatus) and the Mantled Hawk (Pseudastur polionotus) in Rio Doce State Park in eastern Brazil. We observed White-necked Hawks and Mantled Hawks engaged in aerial displays on 67 and 13 occasions, respectively. Display behaviors performed by White-necked Hawks were characterized by 1–4 undulations followed by aerial swoops and spirals. Territorial and/or courtship behaviors of Mantled Hawks were characterized by the male and female performing thermal or horizontal gliding together and diving in spirals while frequently emitting a series of long and short whistles. This study presents the first formal descriptions of the aerial territorial/courtship displays of these rare forest-dwelling raptors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aButeogallus 3abirds of prey 3acourtship 3afemales 3ahawks 3amales 3astate parks 3aterritoriality 3aBrazil 0aWhite-necked Hawk 0aButeogallus lacernulatus 0aMantled Hawk 0aPseudastur polionotus 0aaerial display 0aagonistic behavior 0aAtlantic forest 0aterritorial behavior1 aVargas, F.

To examine how water addition can affect the species composition and structure, and CO <sub>2</sub> -flux of a Central European natural steppe plant community, grassland monoliths were irrigated for three consecutive years at Gödöllő, from 2002 through 2004. The loess grassland studied by <i>ex situ</i> is a characteristic plant association of Hungary and similar vegetation can be found in other temperate regions. The treatment consisted of spray irrigation during night-time only in the growing season as well as aboveground biomass removal twice per year. Interannual and intraannual dynamics of species richness, Shannon Diversity, percentage cover, and different functional groups (monocots/dicots; plant life forms; social behaviour types; C <sub>4</sub> /C <sub>3</sub> plants), and Net Ecosystem CO <sub>2</sub> Exchange in treated and untreated permanent plots, were studied simultaneously. To measure NEE and water vapour at stand level a self-developed, portable, non-destructive open chamber system (d=60cm) was used. The majority of the examined parameters varied considerably among years at both irrigated and control, but concerning carbon fluxes water addition effects were evident in dry periods only. At the treated plots, in general species richness, Shannon Diversity, the number of plant life forms and social behaviour types, the ratio of dicots and C <sub>4</sub> plants declined with addition of water. Our study proved that decline in species richness and Shannon diversity is not necessarily followed by the reduction of stand physiological (synphysiological) processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLiliopsida 3aMagnoliopsida 3aaboveground biomass 3abasins 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3agrowing season 3aloess 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aplant communities 3asocial behavior 3aspecies diversity 3asprinkler irrigation 3asteppes 3atemperate zones 3awater vapor 3aHungary 0aCanopy chamber 0aDiversity 0aFunctional groups 0aLoess grassland 0aMonolith 0aNet ecosystem CO <sub>2</sub> exchange 0aSpecies composition and structure 0aWater addition1 aSzirmai, O.1 aNagy, J.1 aBalogh, J.1 aÜrmös, Zs.1 aPéli, E.1 aTuba, Z.0 tCommunity ecology.g2008 June 1, v. 9, no. 0 p.91-96dAkadémiai Kiadóx1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FComEc.9.2008.S.133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03965naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005900145245007400204300001800278500002000296520284200316592002803158650002403186650001603210650002403226650002003250650001703270650001403287650001003301650001403311650001203325650001203337650001303349700002103362773012003383856007903503852000903582655001203591IND60601089620221116172639.0180705e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060108962DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.131052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Roy, Amélie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6457-976610aTransgenerational effects and acclimation affect dispersal in guppies  ap. 1819-1831.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEvolutionary theory predicts that intergenerational environmental fluctuations lead to transgenerational effects where offspring phenotypes are matched to conditions experienced by previous generations. However, in fluctuating environments, transgenerational effects can be detrimental by causing mismatches between ancestral and offspring environments. Acclimation in offspring could alleviate these negative effects. We determined whether the interaction between transgenerational effects and acclimation affects locomotor performance and dispersal in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). In a fully factorial experiment, we tested the interaction between ancestral (22 or 30°C for six to eight generations), acclimation (22 or 30°C for 4 weeks) and acute test temperatures (two to five temperatures across 18–34°C). We predicted that matching ancestral and acclimation temperatures to acute environmental temperature maximises physiological capacities (swimming performance [Ucᵣᵢₜ] and metabolic enzyme activities), and dispersal in an artificial stream. Alternatively, when ancestral and acute temperatures were mismatched, we predicted that thermal acclimation compensates for this mismatch by shifting performance curves. Finally, we hypothesised that physiological capacities are positively related to dispersal. We measured dispersal as a combination of traits characterising the departure and transient phases of dispersal (time taken to leave the introductory pool, voluntary speed against the current, number of dispersal decisions taken) in an 8‐m artificial stream. As hypothesised, Ucᵣᵢₜ was greatest when ancestral, acclimation and acute temperatures matched. Cold acclimation reduced the decrement in Ucᵣᵢₜ resulting from a mismatch between ancestral and acute test temperatures. In both sexes, the interaction between ancestral and acclimation temperatures determined Ucᵣᵢₜ, but not metabolic enzyme activities, and it affected the number of dispersal decisions in males only. Contrary to our hypothesis, physiological capacities did not constrain dispersal. Males were more likely to initiate dispersal when the acute temperatures mismatched their ancestral temperature. After initiating dispersal, males moved at a greater voluntary speed and made more dispersal decisions in environments matching their ancestral environment. Our findings imply that although the interaction between transgenerational effects and acclimation modulates locomotor capacities, these relationships do not necessarily translate to all ecologically relevant locomotor tasks. Instead, sex‐specific life‐history traits such as life span are more likely to influence dispersal, and males in particular may initiate dispersal to escape suboptimal conditions.

A considerable number of persimmon tannins bound to cell walls may remain insoluble in the residues after methanol extraction. The extraction conditions of bound tannins in residues were optimised and the quantity of bound tannins was up to 221.8 mg/g under the circumstances (pH 1, 120 °C for 30 min). Gallic acid, gallocatechin, and catechin were the main constituents of hydrolysates. The changes in free and bound tannins were investigated during fruit maturation. Free tannin content reached the highest at the end of August to mid-September in northern China and then constantly decreased. The bound tannin content was relatively stable from June to August and significantly increased after September. It then became the main ingredient at the end of October. As a result, the composition of the free and bound tannins in Mopan persimmon was determined qualitatively and quantitatively, and the change in the tannin content during maturation of Mopan persimmon was analysed.  aPublisher supplied data  a19227141DcNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province 3acatechin 3aepigallocatechin 3afruits 3agallic acid 3aingredients 3ameasurement 3amethanol 3apH 3apersimmons 3aChina1 aFeng, Runfang1 aYang, Jie1 aMeng, Fenghua1 aAo, Changwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1851-76360 tJournal of food measurement & characterization.g2021 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.3985-3993dSpringer USwJournal:12159x2193-41267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11694-021-00934-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04055naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113040001800159100002100177245013400198300001800332520227500350592002802625650002602653650002002679650001402699650001802713650002402731650001802755650002202773650001902795650001202814650002202826650002602848650006202874650003902936650002702975650001103002650004103013650001403054650003403068650002403102650001203126651001003138651002503148700001503173700001603188700001403204700001403218700001803232700001903250700001803269773008903287856009203376852000903468655001203477IND50059282320221123023111.0141111e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005928232DNAL7 a229799612pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Francesco, S.10aInfluence of season on corpus luteum structure and function and AI outcome in the Italian Mediterranean buffalo (Bubalus bubalis)  ap. 1839-1845.  aThe aim was to ascertain whether relationships between corpus luteum (CL) vascularization, CL function, and pregnancy outcome in AI in buffaloes were consistent across the breeding season and transition period to the nonbreeding season in a Mediterranean environment. Stage of the estrous cycle in Italian Mediterranean buffaloes was synchronized using the Ovsynch with timed AI program and buffaloes were mated by AI in both the breeding season (N = 131) and transition period (N = 125). Detailed investigation of CL structure and function was undertaken in 39 buffaloes at each of the respective times using realtime B-mode/color-Doppler ultrasonography on Days 10 and 20 after AI. Progesterone (P4) concentrations were determined by RIA in all buffaloes. Pregnancy rate on Day 45 after AI was greater (P < 0.05) during the breeding season (58.0%) than the transitional period (45.6%) and this was primarily the result of a lower (P < 0.05) late embryonic mortality during the breeding season (7.3%) compared with the transition period (23%). Circulating concentrations of P4 on Days 10 and 20 after AI were greater (P < 0.01) during the breeding season (4.6 ± 0.3 and 3.4 ± 0.2, respectively) than during the transition period (1.6 ± 0.12 and 1.8 ± 0.2, respectively), and this was independent of reproductive status as there was no interaction between pregnancy and season. Corpus luteum time average medium velocity at Day 10 after AI was greater (P < 0.01) during the breeding season (19.3 ± 1.5) than in the transitional period (8.3 ± 0.7). There were positive correlations in pregnant buffaloes between CL time average medium velocity and P4 concentrations on Day 10 (r = 0.722; P < 0.01) and Day 20 (r = 0.446; P < 0.01) after AI. The findings were interpreted to indicate that relationships between CL vascularization, CL function, and pregnancy outcome in AI in buffaloes are consistent across the breeding season and transition period to the nonbreeding season. The distinction between the breeding season and the transition period is the relatively low proportion of buffaloes that have CL function and P4 concentrations required to establish a pregnancy during the transition period, which is manifested in a greater incidence of embryonic mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3abreeding season 3abuffaloes 3acorpus luteum 3aembryonic mortality 3aestrous cycle 3apregnancy outcome 3apregnancy rate 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethods 2aBuffaloesxphysiology 2aCorpus Luteumxblood supplyxphysiologyxultrasonography. 2aEmbryo Lossxetiologyxveterinary. 2aEstrus Synchronization 2aFemale 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Outcomexveterinary 2aProgesteronexblood 2aSeasons 0aItaly 0aMediterranean Region1 aNeglia, G.1 aVecchio, D.1 aRossi, P.1 aRusso, M.1 aZicarelli, L.1 aD'Occhio, M.J.1 aCampanile, G.0 tTheriogenology.g2012 Nov., v. 78, no. 8 p.1839-1845dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008600186300001600272520084600288592002801134650002901162650002801191650002501219650002601244650003001270650001801300650002401318650001001342650001901352650002201371650002401393650007901417650002701496650002301523650002101546650007701567650002801644650003601672650005101708650004801759650004901807650001601856700002001872700001601892700002001908700002301928700001801951700002201969700002401991773011402015856004802129852000902177655001202186IND4451596420221123001714.0121003e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445159642DNAL7 a208824202pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-010-9087-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatanaka, Tadashi10aExtracellular Production and Characterization of Two Streptomyces L-Asparaginases  ap. 836-844.  aL-Asparaginase (ASNase) has proved its use in medical and food industries.

Comparison of the two Streptomyces enzymes described above demonstrated that 14270 ASNase was superior to SGR ASNase in terms of optimum temperature, thermal stability, and pH stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces avermitilis 3aStreptomyces coelicolor 3aStreptomyces griseus 3aStreptomyces lividans 3aStreptomyces thermophilus 3afood industry 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3asignal peptide 3athermal stability 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAsparaginasexbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxsecretion. 2aAsparaginexmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aIsoenzymesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxsecretion. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStreptomyces coelicolorxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aStreptomyces griseusxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aStreptomyces lividansxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTemperature1 aUsuki, Hirokazu1 aArima, Jiro1 aUesugi, Yoshiko1 aYamamoto, Yukihiro1 aKumagai, Yuya1 aYamasato, Akihiro1 aMukaihara, Takafumi0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 Apr., v. 163, no. 7 p.836-844dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-010-9087-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008000164300001600244520170400260592002801964650001301992650001602005650001402021650002002035650001102055650002902066650001802095650001302113650001102126650001802137651001702155700002302172700002502195700002102220773009402241856004802335852000902383655001202392IND4484073020221120021527.0120927e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448407302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-011-9674-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolimene, Luca11aAmechanistic explanation of the Sargasso Sea DMS âsummer paradoxâ  ap. 243-255.  aIn the Sargasso Sea, maximum dimethylsulfide (DMS) accumulation occurs in summer, concomitant with the minimum of chlorophyll and 2Â months later than its precursor, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). This phenomenon is often referred to as the DMS âsummer paradoxâ. It has been previously suggested that the main agent triggering this pattern is increasing irradiance leading to light stress-induced DMS release from phytoplankton cells. We have developed a new model describing DMS(P) dynamics in the water column and used it to investigate how and to what extent processes other than light induced DMS exudation from phytoplankton, may contribute to the DMS summer paradox. To do this, we have conceptually divided the DMS âsummer paradoxâ into two components: (1) the temporal decoupling between chlorophyll and DMSP and (2) the temporal decoupling between DMSP and DMS. Our results suggest that it is possible to explain the above cited patterns by means of two different dynamics, respectively: (1) a succession of phytoplankton types in the surface water and (2) the bacterially mediated DMSP(d) to DMS conversion, seasonally varying as a function of nutrient limitation. This work differs from previous modelling studies in that the presented model suggests that phytoplankton light-stress induced processes may only partially explain the summer paradox, not being able to explain the decoupling between DMSP and DMS, which is possibly the more challenging aspect of this phenomenon. Our study, therefore, provides an âalternativeâ explanation to the summer paradox further underlining the major role that bacteria potentially play in DMS production and fate.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3achlorophyll 3aexudation 3alight intensity 3amodels 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3aphytoplankton 3asulfides 3asummer 3asurface water 3aSargasso Sea1 aArcher, Stephen D.1 aButenschÃ¶n, Momme1 aAllen, J.

Its main vector, Triatoma infestans (kissing bug), feeds on people and domestic animals and finds refuge in the peripheral structures of rural and semi-rural houses. Here we propose a mathematical model based on discrete-time equations that describe the evolution of the populations of all the stages of T. infestans residing in a chicken coop, a typical bug reservoir in non-urban habitats. The chicken coop has also been used as a suitable location for observations of T. infestans populations under realistic, controlled conditions. The variables that govern the model are the time of the year, the temperature, and the blood intake by the triatomines. Using the available data, we design fitting functions, such as maximum blood intake, development time, mortality rate, egg fertility, etc., for each population group. Then, we validate our model using D. Gorla's experimental work on T. infestans populations. Finally, we analyze the minimum conditions of temperature and food availability necessary for the survival of T. infestans, showing that average daily temperatures below 12 °C or average yearly temperatures below 16 °C or above 32 °C lead to colony extinction. Feeding also regulates the colony size, and we find that if a few triatomines (5% of the colony) are well fed, and the rest occasionally get a meager meal, the colony size can be, on average, constant over the years. By quantifying what happens in structures crucial to the species survival, our model is an important step forward towards the formulation of a general population model for T. infestans in the Grand Chaco under current conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChagas disease 3aTriatoma infestans 3ablood 3achickens 3aegg fertility 3aextinction 3afood availability 3amathematical models 3amortality 3apeople 3atemperature 3aLatin America 0aKissing bug 0aPopulation dynamics 0aChagas’ disease1 aCondat, C.A.0 tEcological modelling.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 460 p.109753-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.1097533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015600167300001600323500001900339520161000358592002801968650001301996650002002009650002102029650001202050650001902062650002002081650002202101650001102123651001702134700002002151700002402171773010502195856004802300852000902348655001202357IND50063961720221120021311.0130325e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006396172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-012-9507-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoets, Francois10aAbiotic variables dictate the best monitoring times for the endangered Table Mountain stag beetle (Colophon westwoodi Gray 1832, Coleoptera: Lucanidae)  ap. 279-285.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is often a lack of basic ecological data needed to implement effective conservation management programmes for endangered arthropods. This is particularly true for the highly localized and rare Colophon, a genus of beetles of which all members are narrow range endemics of conservation concern. The genus is confined to the highest mountain peaks in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa and each of the 17 known species is endemic to a particular mountain or range. We investigated the influence of selected abiotic variables on adult Colophon westwoodi activity in Table Mountain National Park, South Africa, which will aid the development of an effective monitoring programme. Weekly surveys conducted on Table Mountain showed that adult numbers peaked during early summer. Adults were active at dusk on clear days, although earlier when misty. Unexpectedly, relative humidity and air temperature had no significant effect on Colophon abundance, while illuminance was the most important predictor. Contrary to general consensus, C. westwoodi activity is not strictly crepuscular but also appears nocturnal. Thus, Colophon monitoring programmes need to be conducted in early summer after sunset and monitoring can continue later than previously assumed. Little is still known about C. westwoodi population size, area of occupancy, general behaviour and the impact tourists have on it, or indeed why the genus is restricted to mountain tops. Therefore this research is important for the design of monitoring protocols for this flagship species, while at the same time directing future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColophon 3aair temperature 3aflagship species 3ainsects 3anational parks 3apopulation size 3arelative humidity 3asummer 3aSouth Africa1 aPryke, James S.1 aMcGeoch, Melodie A.0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2013 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.279-285dSpringer-Verlagx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-012-9507-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024003500122040001800157100001700175245010000192300001800292520157300310592002801883650001101911650002801922650002101950650001401971650001001985650000801995650001702003650001702020650003702037650002502074650001002099651001002109653001402119653001502133653001702148653004002165700002302205700002402228700002102252773012802273856008102401852000902482655001202491IND60652374720221118003839.0190712e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065237472DNAL7 a30612590 306125902pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800180036342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadam, Nidhi10aLow knowledge of osteoporosis and its risk factors in urban Indian adults from Pune city, India  ap. 1292-1299.  aTo assess knowledge of osteoporosis and its risk factors and to explore associations between knowledge and various sociodemographic factors in Indian adults. Cross-sectional study. The Revised Osteoporosis Knowledge Test (OKT) was used to assess knowledge of osteoporosis. Four scores (OKT-total, range 0–32; OKT-exercise, range 0–20; OKT-nutrition, range 0–26; OKT-risk factors, range 0–14) were generated by giving 1 point to every correct answer and 0 points for incorrect or ‘not known’ answers. Tertiary-care hospital in Pune city, India. Adults aged 40–75 years (n 477; 234 males) enrolled through voluntary routine health checks and health camps. Mean age of the study population was 54·6 (sd 9·5) years. Half the participants were aware of osteoporosis and could correctly define it. Women showed significantly higher median OKT-total and OKT-nutrition scores than men (P<0·05). Those with higher education and higher socio-economic status had significantly higher scores in both men and women (P<0·05). All four scores were significantly higher in both men and women who could correctly define osteoporosis (P<0·05). All four scores were significantly higher in women with a family history of osteoporosis (P<0·05) but not in men (P>0·1). Understanding about osteoporosis and its risk factors is low in the present cohort of Indian men and women. There is need to create awareness programmes aimed at both men and women especially targeting those with lower education, lower socio-economic status and no previous exposure to osteoporosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3across-sectional studies 3ahigher education 3ahospitals 3amales 3amen 3aosteoporosis 3arisk factors 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asocioeconomic status 3awomen 3aIndia 0aKnowledge 0aIndian men 0aIndian women 0aRevised Osteoporosis Knowledge Test1 aChiplonkar, Shashi1 aKhadilkar, Anuradha1 aKhadilkar, Vaman0 tPublic health nutrition.g2019 May, v. 22, no. 7 p.1292-1299dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800180036343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245007300169300002000242520125600262592002801518650002501546650001801571650000901589650001301598650002301611650001701634650001101651650001101662650001301673650001201686650001401698650001301712650001601725700001401741700001501755700001601770700001301786700001601799700001501815773010701830856008901937852000902026655001202035IND60586068220221120055213.0171116e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058606822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b024862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Shoutao10aScreening Monoethanolamine As Solvent to Extract Phenols from Alkane  ap. 12997-13009.  aCoal tar is a byproduct of low temperature coal carbonization. The separation of the compounds has great significance since its main component is the mixture of phenols and hydrocarbons. In this paper, the separation of specific phenolic compounds from model coal tar (phenols + hexane) was studied. The solvent was screened by empirical analysis, the universal quasichemical functional group activity coefficient (UNIFAC), and conductor-like screening model COSMO-SAC (segment activity coefficient). COSMO-SAC was used to calculate the capacity, selectivity, and performance index of solvents. Finally, the monoethanolamine (MEA) was selected as the solvent to extract the phenols. The liquid–liquid equilibrium for the ternary mixture of phenols + hexane + MEA was measured at 303.15 K and 323.15 K under atmospheric pressure, and the results showed that MEA provided a high distribution coefficient, efficiency, and selectivity for phenols. Meanwhile, the extraction process of phenols was simulated based on the nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) model, for which binary interaction parameters were obtained through calculations of phase equilibrium. The results showed that the purity of phenols can achieve more than 99.5 wt % using MEA as a solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbonization 3acoal 3acoal tar 3aempirical research 3aethanolamine 3ahexane 3amodels 3amoieties 3aphenols 3ascreening 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aYu, Qiang1 aHou, Yafei1 aLi, Jinfang1 aLi, Yuan1 aMa, Zhanhua1 aSun, Lanyi0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Nov. 16, v. 31, no. 11 p.12997-13009dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b024863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001100153245007400164520099300238592002801231650001901259650001501278650001201293650002001305650001501325650003301340650003301373650001301406650001501419650002501434651001001459653000801469653000801477653000801485653000801493653002501501700001301526700002001539700002601559700001701585773010701602856008801709852000901797655001201806IND60751267320221119080642.0220207e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075126732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.1097542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Na12aA hybrid PCA-SEM-ANN model for the prediction of water use efficiency  aThis study employs a Structural Equation Model (SEM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to construct a hybrid PCA-SEM-ANN model, for the prediction of Water Use Efficiency (WUE). The structural relationship and the degree of influence among factors is determined by SEM, and is transformed into ANN's topology, where PCA is employed to reduce spatial dimensionality. The applied results, in Kashgar, Xinjiang, China, show that different influencing factors on WUE present a diversity with different levels. The ANN structure optimized by SEM fits better, and the PCA-SEM-ANN model has high explanatory and precision for environmental control of the ecosystem as well as WUE simulation.

Dawn and evening carbohydrate levels in leaves suggested growth stimulation of the dicot under elevated CO2 and the opposite for the grass species and indicated sink limitation as a major factor determining photosynthetic acclimation at the species level. The smaller LAI as well as the insignificant biomass response to elevated air CO2 was a compounded response by multi-species stands. Under mild water shortage, elevated air CO2 concentration partly alleviated the drought effect shown by the higher relative growth rate of LAI. Canopy surface temperatures of the vegetation in the CO2 enriched rings were higher than those in the ambient rings suggesting that decreased leaf conductance and transpiration were responsible for the temperature difference between the treatments. Increased canopy surface temperature under elevated air CO2 concentration will probably lead to increased sensible heat flux and therefore enhanced convection at larger spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnoliopsida 3aacclimation 3abiomass 3acanopy 3adrought 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agas exchange 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aheat transfer 3aleaf area index 3aleaf conductance 3aleaves 3aloess 3asurface temperature 3awater shortages 0aAcclimation of photosynthesis 0aCanopy surface temperature 0aElevated air CO <sub>2</sub> concentration 0aGrassland 0aLeaf area index 0aLeaf carbohydrate concentration1 aTuba, Z.0 tCommunity ecology.g2008 June 1, v. 9 p.153-160dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000060x1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/ComEc.9.2008.S.203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013300157300002000290520135400310592002801664650001401692650002201706650001101728700002101739700001801760700001701778700001601795700001701811700001801828700001901846700001801865700001701883700001901900700002001919700001701939700001801956700002201974700002101996700001802017700002002035700001802055700001602073773014402089856007502233852000902308655001202317IND60782251820221120082659.0220706e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078225182DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ta01987f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhongkai12aA polymer/small-molecule binary-blend hole transport layer for enhancing charge balance in blue perovskite light emitting diodes  ap. 13928-13935.  aMetal halide based perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are promising candidates for next generation commercial display products due to their excellent high color-purity and recent dramatic improvements in their device efficiencies. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs falls far short of the requirements of commercialization, for which one of the main reasons is the wide band gap of blue-emitting perovskites, resulting in inferior hole injection and imbalanced charge transport in the emissive layer. Here, we introduce a facile method for overcoming the charge balance issue by developing a polymer/small-molecule binary-blend hole transport layer (HTL) with poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and 2-(4-biphenyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD). The binary-blend HTL allows a systematic modulation of the hole injection barrier that enabled balanced charge transport between electrons and holes for an effective recombination within the perovskite emissive layer. In particular, the PeLED based on our optimal blended HTL exhibits one of the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of 5.30% for blue PeLEDs with an emission peak at 478 nm. Our work provides a simple and effective concept for forming an energy ladder for efficient charge transport which will contribute towards developing high performance blue PeLEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3acommercialization 3aenergy1 aJeong, Woo Hyeon1 aKang, Keehoon1 aSong, Hochan1 aShen, Xinyu1 aAhn, Hyungju1 aLee, Seok Woo1 aFan, Xiangyang1 aJang, Ji-Won,1 aHa, Su Ryong1 aMin, Jeong Wan1 aPark, Jong Hyun1 aHan, Jongmin1 aJung, Eui Dae1 aSong, Myoung Hoon1 aChang, Dong Wook1 aIm, Wŏn-bin,1 aPark, Sung Heum1 aChoi, Hyosung1 aLee, Bo Ram0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 July 5, v. 10, no. 26 p.13928-13935dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ta01987f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245006200192300001600254520153400270592002801804650001401832650001701846650002501863650002501888650001501913650001401928650002001942650001001962650003701972650001802009650001102027650001102038650001202049650001102061650003702072650002602109650001602135650002302151650000902174650002502183650002602208650002202234650004402256650003802300650001702338650001202355650004602367650002202413650004202435650003402477650003502511650004902546650002602595650004302621650003302664700001802697700001902715773010502734856005502839852000902894655001202903IND4469014920221122005546.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446901492DNAL7 a220228012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01538.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetzold, H. Earl10aExpression and functions of proteases in vascular tissues  ap. 121-129.  aWith the emergence of new models for wood formation and the increasing emphasis on improving the efficiency of cellulosic biofuel production, research on vascular tissue biology has intensified in recent years. Some of the most active areas of research focus on manipulating activity of enzymes in the cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and lignin pathways. In addition, great strides have been made in the characterization of transcriptional networks controlling genes that affect differentiation, secondary cell wall synthesis and programmed cell death in xylem. Less attention has been devoted to the characterization of proteases that may be important regulators of post‐translational events that affect vascular cell differentiation and function and cell wall composition. Several genes for proteases and components of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway are upregulated in xylem and phloem and in cell culture systems for studying the differentiation of xylem tracheary elements (TEs). Although small molecule protease inhibitors have been used to explore the roles of proteases during the differentiation of cultured TEs, only a small number of vascular tissue‐associated protease genes have been directly tested to determine whether they play roles in vascular tissue biology. In this report, we review roles for proteases in vascular cell differentiation and function as determined through the use of protease inhibitors and genetic analyses and conclude by identifying opportunities for future research in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell culture 3acell differentiation 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3acellulose 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3amodels 3apectins 3aphloem 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteinases 3atracheary elements 3awood 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Wallxenzymology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aLigands 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Development 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlantsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aProtease Inhibitorsxchemistry 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complexxmetabolism 2aProteasome Inhibitors 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aXylemxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aZhao, Mingzhe1 aBeers, Eric P.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2012 May, v. 145, no. 1 p.121-129dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01538.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005800154245005200212300001600264520157500280592002801855650001101883650001701894650001601911650001501927650002201942650002001964650001601984650002802000650001302028650001802041650001702059650001702076651001102093653001602104653002002120653002302140653002002163653001102183653001002194700002202204773009802226856008902324852000902413655001202422IND60567162120221122034122.0190319e20161231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056716212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.09.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Naber, Majd1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3156-121X14aThe politics of accessing desert land in Jordan  ap. 492-503.  aWith the dramatic increase of the population in Jordan, the value of land has rocketed up. Urban sprawl into semi-desert or desert areas, initially not surveyed or settled by the British and considered as state land, has brought to the surface the problematic status of those lands. Likewise, the profitability of irrigated agriculture based on groundwater has generated a demand for land in the Mafraq, Zarqa and Amman governorates. These trends have spurred tensions between local tribes and the state. This study focuses on land tenure and conflicts in the semi-desert and desert areas of Jordan, with a focus on the expansion of irrigated agriculture within the Azraq basin. It is based on field work and interviews with different stakeholders at various levels. We first provide a summary of the main historical developments regarding land tenure in Jordan, with a focus on the status of semi-desert and desert land. We move on to examining the different ways by which state land can be privatized and then review instances of conflicts around rights to desert land in the past 30 years, further taking the Azraq water basin as a case study to shed light on the particular case of groundwater-based agricultural expansion. We then articulate our discussion through the lens of legal pluralism, look at the interplay between state and tribal power, and analyze the twin strategies of accessing land and water in desert areas. We conclude by showing the historical continuity of the land tenure relationships, while singling out Jordan's state land management regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3agroundwater 3ainterviews 3airrigated farming 3aland management 3aland tenure 3amulticultural diversity 3apolitics 3aprofitability 3astakeholders 3aurbanization 3aJordan 0aLand tenure 0aLegal pluralism 0aDesert reclamation 0aTribal politics 0aJordan 0aAzraq1 aMolle, François,0 tLand use policy.g2016 Dec. 31, v. 59 p.492-503dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.09.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013100171300002000302500001500322520147500337592002801812650001601840650001501856650002101871650002901892650001101921650002201932650001001954650002201964650002601986650004402012650001402056650002302070650002302093650001302116653002402129700002302153700001302176773010702189856008902296852000902385655001202394IND60586068520221120055308.0171116e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058606852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b025202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Ribhu10aApparent Kinetics of Fast Pyrolysis of Four Different Microalgae and Product Analyses Using Pyrolysis-FTIR and Pyrolysis-GC/MS  ap. 12339-12349.  a2019-12-06  aThis study reports an experimental technique to obtain the isothermal mass loss profiles of four different microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Nannochlorpsis oculata, Schizochytrium limacinum, and Arthrospira platensis) under fast pyrolysis conditions in the temperature range of 400–700 °C at short residence times of 2–60 s using an analytical pyrolyzer. The microalgae investigated in this study vary significantly, based on elemental and biochemical composition. The apparent kinetic parameters of fast pyrolysis of the algae were evaluated using first-order and multidimensional diffusion models. The apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor evaluated under fast heating rate conditions were lower compared to those reported under slow pyrolysis conditions, which is attributed to the diffusion effects. The rate parameters were validated by constructing a kinetic compensation plot, which showed that ln(A) = 0.19Eₐ + 0.43. The product time evolution at short time scales was studied using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and a majority of the functional groups evolved in the range of 5–12 s. The evolution of CO and aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations for lipid-rich algae was slow, compared to that for protein-rich algae. The pyrolysates were characterized using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and the yield of nitrogen-containing organics followed a linear trend with the elemental nitrogen content in the algae.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3amicroalgae 3anitrogen content 3aSchizochytrium limacinum 3amodels 3aactivation energy 3afuels 3amass spectrometry 3aArthrospira platensis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3apyrolysis 3aChlorella vulgaris 3agas chromatography 3amoieties 0aSpirulina platensis1 aVarma, Akash Kiran1 aVinu, R.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Nov. 16, v. 31, no. 11 p.12339-12349dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b025203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245010600176300001600282520137800298592002801676650001101704650002101715650001701736650001901753650002101772650001501793650001201808650001501820650001601835650001301851650001101864650001401875651001801889653001901907653002101926653002601947653001501973700002801988700002002016700002202036773009802058856008902156961001202245852000902257655001202266IND60567162220221122034127.0190319e20161231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056716222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulston, John W.10aRefined forest land use classification with implications for United States national carbon accounting  ap. 536-542.  aThe United States provides annual estimates of carbon sources and sinks as part of its National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGHGI). Within this effort, carbon stocks and fluxes are reported for six land use categories that are relevant to economic sectors and land use policy. The goal of this study is to develop methodologies that will allow the US to align with an internationally agreed upon forest land use definition which requires forest to be able to reach 5m in height at maturity. Models to assess height potential are available for a majority of US forests except for woodland ecosystems. We develop a set of models to assess height potential in these systems. Our results suggest that ∼13.5millionha of forests are unlikely to meet the international definition of forests due to environmental limitations to maximum attainable height. The incorporation of this height criteria in the NGHGI results in a carbon stock transfer of ∼848Tg from the forest land use to woodland land use (a sub-category of grasslands) with minimal effect on sequestration rates. The development of a forest land use definition sensitive to climatic factors in this study enables a land use classification system that can be responsive to climate change effects on land uses themselves while being more consistent across a host of international and domestic carbon reporting efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon footprint 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3aforests 3agrasslands 3aland policy 3aland use 3amodels 3awoodlands 3aUnited States 0aCarbon storage 0aWoodland forests 0aRandom forests models 0aGrasslands1 aWoodall, Christopher W.1 aDomke, Grant M.1 aWalters, Brian F.0 tLand use policy.g2016 Dec. 31, v. 59 p.536-542dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle
