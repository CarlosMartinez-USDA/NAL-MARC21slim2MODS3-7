The landscape–seascape dynamics depends on the glacial recession determined by climate warming after the Little Ice Age (i.e., since the beginning of the twentieth century, and especially since the 1980s). The isthmus has been narrowed from 28 km in 1899–1900 to 6.2 km in 2013, and lowered by 60–200 m from 1936 to 2005. Two isthmus’ glaciers will have melted, given the current thermic conditions, by 2030–2035. It cannot be ruled out that Sørkapp Land will become an island after that period, because the altitude of the glaciers’ bedrock is close to the sea level. The disappearance of this huge ice mass, even without origin of a sound and island, will lead to a great transformation of the landscape and the ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaltitude 3abedrock 3aecosystems 3aglaciation 3aglaciers 3aglobal warming 3aice 3alandscapes 3amelting 3asea level 3aArctic region 3aNorway1 aOstafin, Krzysztof0 tAmbio.g2015 May, v. 44, no. 4 p.332-342dSpringer-Verlagx0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-014-0572-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245014100171300002000312500002000332520148300352592002801835650002001863650002201883650001501905650002601920650001401946650001501960650001101975650001901986650001202005650003102017650001302048650002202061650001502083650001502098650002202113651001202135700002002147700002802167700002402195700002102219700002402240700002102264700002002285700002502305700002502330700001902355700001902374700002002393700002502413700002002438773014102458856007402599852000902673655001202682IND60651750320221119232015.0190712e20151120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065175032DNAL7 a10.3390/su711155932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolzhauer, Stephanie I. J.10aOut of the Dark: Establishing a Large-Scale Field Experiment to Assess the Effects of Artificial Light at Night on Species and Food Webs  ap. 15593-15616.  aJournal Article  aArtificial light at night (ALAN) is one of the most obvious hallmarks of human presence in an ecosystem. The rapidly increasing use of artificial light has fundamentally transformed nightscapes throughout most of the globe, although little is known about how ALAN impacts the biodiversity and food webs of illuminated ecosystems. We developed a large-scale experimental infrastructure to study the effects of ALAN on a light-naïve, natural riparian (i.e., terrestrial-aquatic) ecosystem. Twelve street lights (20 m apart) arranged in three rows parallel to an agricultural drainage ditch were installed on each of two sites located in a grassland ecosystem in northern Germany. A range of biotic, abiotic, and photometric data are collected regularly to study the short- and long-term effects of ALAN on behavior, species interactions, physiology, and species composition of communities. Here we describe the infrastructure setup and data collection methods, and characterize the study area including photometric measurements. None of the measured parameters differed significantly between sites in the period before illumination. Results of one short-term experiment, carried out with one site illuminated and the other acting as a control, demonstrate the attraction of ALAN by the immense and immediate increase of insect catches at the lit street lights. The experimental setup provides a unique platform for carrying out interdisciplinary research on sustainable lighting.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adrainage channels 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3afood webs 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3ainfrastructure 3ainsects 3ainterdisciplinary research 3alighting 3along term effects 3aphotometry 3aphysiology 3aspecies diversity 3aGermany1 aFranke, Steffen1 aKyba, Christopher C.

In this study, L. testaceipes colonies were initiated from parasitized brown citrus aphids obtained from field-collected citrus foliage in Florida and successfully maintained for >25 generations in the laboratory. To enhance colony rearing methods, several aspects of the parasitoid’’s biology were examined. An evaluation of foraging by single or multiple females determined that the presence of multiple females did not influence mean progeny yield per female. However, the mean number of progeny produced by mature (25-49 and 49-73 h) L. testaceipes females was higher than that produced by younger (1-25 h) females over a 24-h period. In all three parasitoid age classes, each reared on second-, third- or fourth-instar aphid hosts, significantly more mummies containing L. testaceipes formed on a paper coffee filter covering the soil surface compared to the number of mummies formed on citrus foliage. Mummy formation off foliage has not been reported for this aphid-parasitoid complex in citrus. Mated females of L. testaceipes with access to honey and water and without access to aphids or honeydew lived longer than females that had access to aphid hosts and honeydew. These data provide novel findings on the biology of L. testaceipes when parasitizing the brown citrus citrus, particularly on mummification sites, and allowed us to develop a protocol for routine large-scale rearing of L. testaceipes on brown citrus aphids on citrus.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLysiphlebus testaceipes 0aToxoptera citricida 0alaboratory cultures 0ahost instar 0acitrus1 aHoy, Marjorie A.0 tFlorida entomologist.g2003 Dec., v. 86, no. 4 p.429-436dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F0015-4040%282003%29086%5B0429%3AMOFPAE%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245007800178300001600256520128800272592002801560650001101588650001901599650000901618650001101627650001201638650002901650650002201679650001101701650001401712651001001726651001801736700002101754700002001775773008001795856008601875852000901961655001201970IND60084992020221118084622.0141101e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008499202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichieka, Nyakundi M.13aAn empirical analysis of the role of China’s exports on CO₂ emissions  ap. 258-267.  aChina is one of the world’s most rapidly growing countries and the largest consumer of energy in the world. As a result, China’s pollution emissions almost doubled from 2002 to 2007, and in 2006 it surpassed the United States to become the world’s top carbon dioxide emitter. Understanding the sources of emissions is essential towards designing policies aimed at curbing carbon emissions in China. The surge in China’s exports has been partially blamed for this increase in emissions. To understand the sources of emissions, this study uses a vector autoregression model to examine the relationship among exports, CO₂ emissions, coal consumption and trade openness in China for the years 1970–2010. The study uses a modified version of Granger Causality developed by Toda and Yamamoto [56]. The main findings within the study indicate: (1) Granger Causality running from exports to emissions; (2) Granger Causality running from coal consumption to exports; and (3) GDP determines future variability in exports and CO₂ emissions. Results suggest that governmental policies aimed at controlling coal consumption could affect CO₂ emissions and exports. Results from this study should assist in formulating policies to mitigate both CO₂ emissions and coal consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aenergy 3aexports 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apollution 3aChina 3aUnited States1 aFletcher, Jerald1 aBurnett, Wesley0 tApplied energy.g2013 Apr., v. 104 p.258-267dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245017800167300001600345520087700361592002801238650002501266650001301291650001401304650001501318650001401333650001501347650002001362650001501382650001101397650001101408650001901419650002401438650002101462650001401483653002301497653003001520653003201550653002201582700001701604700005701621700006001678700002301738700006201761700005901823773014501882856008002027852000902107655001202116IND60680931720221122235011.0200110e20191218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068093172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b057032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeans, Bianca J.10aDistinct Drimane Chemotypes in Tasmanian Mountain Pepper (Tasmannia lanceolata): Differences in the Profiles of Pungent Leaf Phytochemicals Associated with Altitudinal Cline  ap. 315-322.  aThis study assesses whether the distinct altitudinal cline in leaf morphology (decreased leaf width and length with increased altitude) in Tasmanian mountain pepper (Tasmannia lanceolata) is associated with changes in the leaf chemistry of wild populations from different ecological landscapes and altitudes. The presence of distinct pungent drimane sesquiterpenoid chemotypes was identified: subalpine woodland and wet sclerophyll forest chemotypes. Isolation studies and analysis of extracts revealed that wet sclerophyll forest T. lanceolata populations featured polygodial as the principal terpenoid, with profiles similar to the commercial cultivars sampled. In contrast, the subalpine woodland populations contained the drimane sesquiterpenoids 1β-acetoxy-9-deoxyisomuzigadial and 3β-acetoxydrimenin and the conspicuous absence of the pungent principle polygodial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTasmannia lanceolata 3aaltitude 3achemistry 3achemotypes 3acultivars 3alandscapes 3aleaf morphology 3aleaf width 3aleaves 3apepper 3aphytochemicals 3asclerophyll forests 3asesquiterpenoids 3awoodlands 0adrimane chemotypes 0aTasmanian mountain pepper 0apungent leaf phytochemicals 0aaltitudinal cline1 aJust, Jeremy1 aTedone, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5252-88651 aKilah, Nathan L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0615-37911 aJordan, Gregory J.1 aBissember, Alex C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5515-28781 aSmith, Jason A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6313-32980 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 68, no. 1 p.315-322dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b057033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245014500182300001600327520123300343592002801576650001701604650001201621650001001633650003001643650000901673650001201682650001601694650001301710650001401723650001801737653000801755653002101763653001801784700002201802700001901824773010601843856008201949852000902031655001202040IND60517668620221120044023.0190801e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051766862DNAL7 a215547722pmid7 a10.1017/S09671994110001892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuji, Yuta10aAdministration of cyclosporin A to recipients improves the potential of mouse somatic cell nuclear-transferred oocytes to develop to fetuses  ap. 261-267.  aSomatic cell nuclear-transferred (SCNT) oocytes have a high potential for development in vitro, but a large proportion of embryos that are transferred to recipients is aborted before parturition. The precise mechanism for the high abortion rate is unknown, but abnormal placenta formation is frequently observed in SCNT-cloned pregnancies. The present study examined the effects of treating the recipients with cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunoprotectant, on the proportion of fetuses resulting from SCNT-cloned pregnancies. Cloned embryos developed from enucleated oocytes and receiving cumulus cells from F1 (C57BL/6 × DBA, H-2ᵇ/ᵈ) females were transferred to outbred ICR (in which the H-2 complex was not fixed) recipient females. Each recipient received an intraperitoneal injection of CsA or vehicle. Compared with vehicle, administration of CsA to recipients on day 4.5 of pregnancy significantly increased the proportion of fetuses observed on day 10.5. The proportion of fetuses at day 18.5 of pregnancy in recipients receiving CsA treatment was slightly higher than that in controls. This study is the first to report that CsA administration increases the proportion of fetuses resulting from SCNT-cloned pregnancies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyclosporine 3afemales 3afetus 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amice 3aoocytes 3aparturition 3aplacenta 3apregnancy 3asomatic cells 0aCsA 0aNuclear transfer 0aSomatic cells1 aKato, Y.q(Yoko),1 aTsunoda, Yukio0 tZygote.g2012 Aug., v. 20, no. 3 p.261-267dCambridge University PresswJournal:6292x1469-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09671994110001893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013000174300001400304520211400318592002802432650002702460650002402487650002002511650002102531650000902552650001802561650001302579650001602592650001702608650002102625650002802646650001402674650001402688650001102702650001602713700001902729700001602748700002302764700001602787700001602803773013902819856008702958852000903045655001203054IND60608877420221119114907.0200511e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060887742DNAL7 a10.1080/14620316.2012.115128262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPazos-Navarro, M.10aMicropropagation from apical and nodal segments of Bituminaria bituminosa and the furanocoumarin content of propagated plants  ap. 29-35.  aAn efficient micropropagation protocol has been developed for Bituminaria bituminosa, a species considered to be of pharmaceutical interest for its furanocoumarin (FC) content. Four accessions of B. bituminosa with different FC contents were used: variety albomarginata (“albo-tedera”), variety bituminosa (“bitu-Calnegre”), var. albomarginata × var. bituminosa (“albo-hybrid”), and var. bituminosa × var. albomarginata (“bitu-hybrid”). Different concentrations of sodium troclosene solution were evaluated for in vitro establishment of apical and nodal explants cultured on modified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. The effects of the type of agar and the addition of activated charcoal (AC) were also evaluated. The best treatment for surface sterilising the explants was 3.5 g l–¹ sodium troclosene. The lowest frequency of hyperhydrated shoots was achieved using 0.8% (w/v) American bacteriological agar. Apical explants resulted in greater shoot proliferation than nodal explants. The addition of AC increased the quality and development of regenerated shoots. The highest average numbers of shoots ≥ 5 mm per explant were obtained from apical explants of “albo-tedera” (7.8 shoots) and “albo-hybrid” (7.6 shoots) on a modified MS medium supplemented with plant growth regulators (T2 media) and for “bitu-Calnegre” (6.3 shoots) and “bitu-hybrid” (5.3 shoots) on a modified MS medium without plant growth regulators (T1 media). The regenerated shoots rooted efficiently on different media depending on the plant material. Plantlets were acclimatised and maintained in a greenhouse until they were transferred to the experimental field.

An analysis of the regions of the CO1 and ITSs genes showed that the studied populations differ by several nucleotide substitutions. The analysis of two DNA sequences of the conserved nuclear gene 18SrRNA as expected did not reveal the differences between the populations. A comparison of the data with sequences from the water bodies of Poland (from the GenBank https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT146445) showed that they are grouped with eurytemoras from the Cheboksary Reservoir. It is likely that the E. velox found in the water bodies of Poland originates from the Caspian region, from where the eurytemora also settled in the Cheboksary Reservoir. The population from the lake in Kyiv most likely came up the Dnieper River from the Black Sea region. Thus, apparently, we are dealing with an independent dispersal of the species from at least two donor regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEurytemora 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3arivers 3aBlack Sea 3aPoland1 aLazareva, V.

In this work, a hybrid adhesive bonding method combining adhesive and thermal bonding is proposed. It uses a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) tape for integration of a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) film and printed circuit board (PCB) substrate while a PMMA microchannel layer is bonded with PMMA film through thermal bonding. The simple bonding process can reliably integrate electronic circuits and fluidic components without any expensive equipment. The relationship between pressure applied during adhesive bonding and the bond ratio is investigated as well as the influence of pressure upon the remaining channel depth during thermocompression. The bond strength is also studied with a dead-end channel test and flow rate test ranging from 20 μl min⁻¹ to 500 μl min⁻¹. The results demonstrate a strong bond formed between the two different layers using the hybrid technique. As an application, a microchip for electrophoresis detection is tested. Successful separation of different ions and a comparable level of the relative standard deviation (RSD) for the migration time and the peak height imply the reliability of the bonding protocol and the good potential for a wide range of applications in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic circuits 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectrophoresis 3aions 3amicrochip technology 3amicrofluidic technology 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3aprotocols 3astandard deviation1 aYou, Hui0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Feb. 28, v. 11, no. 9 p.1229-1236dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay02642d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008400169300002000253500001900273520132800292592002801620650002301648650001701671650001901688650001901707650003201726650002101758650002301779650001301802650001201815650001201827650002301839650001601862650001301878650001301891700001801904700002001922700002101942700001801963700005901981773013102040856008402171852000902255655001202264IND60710991720221117203128.0200915e20200826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c025072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnebl, Andreas10aFiber-Enhanced Raman Gas Spectroscopy for the Study of Microbial Methanogenesis  ap. 12564-12571.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicrobial methanogenesis is a key biogeochemical process in the carbon cycle that is responsible for 70% of global emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH₄). Further knowledge about microbial methanogenesis is crucial to mitigate emissions, increase climate model accuracy, or advance methanogenic biogas production. The current understanding of the substrate use of methanogenic microbes is limited, especially regarding the methylotrophic pathway. Here, we present fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) of headspace gases as an alternate tool to study methanogenesis and substrate use in particular. The optical technique is nondestructive and sensitive to CH₄, hydrogen (H₂), and carbon dioxide with a large dynamic range from trace levels (demonstrated LoDs: CH₄, 3 ppm; H₂, 49 ppm) to pure gases. In addition, the portable FERS system can provide quantitative information about methanol concentration in the liquid phase of microbial cultures through headspace gas sampling (LoD 25 ppm). We demonstrate how FERS gas sensing could enable us to track substrate and product levels of microbial methanogenesis with just one instrument. The versatility of Raman gas spectroscopy could moreover help us to elucidate links between nitrogen and carbon cycle in microbial communities in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate models 3agas production (biological) 3agreenhouse gases 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amethanol 3anitrogen1 aDomes, Robert1 aWolf, Sebastian1 aDomes, Christian1 aPopp, Juergen1 aFrosch, Torsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3358-88780 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 26, v. 92, no. 18 p.12564-12571dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c025073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01594naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245009900169300001800268520040900286592002800695650003400723650002200757650002300779650000900802650001200811650003700823700002200860700001800882700002000900700001700920700002400937700002000961700002300981773013301004856007401137852000901211655001201220IND60644802320221122013750.0190522e20190521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064480232DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc00926d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaignan, A..q(Antoine),10aSr₂Fe₁₊ₓRe₁₋ₓO₆ double perovskites: magnetoresistance and (magneto)thermopower  ap. 5878-5881.  aPolycrystalline Sr₂Fe₁₊ₓRe₁₋ₓO₆ samples have been synthesized and structurally characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

Because of the scarcity of information correlated among atomic structure, electronic structure, and photocatalytic property from isolated nanoparticles, the origin of photocatalytic activity of colored TiO₂ from microscopic and electronic level remains intensely debated. Here we demonstrated the origin of photocatalytic activity in Ti⁴⁺/Ti³⁺ core–shell TiO₂ nanocrystals mainly by a combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and photo-Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). The thickness of the Ti³⁺ shell layer increases with the annealing temperature, meanwhile the O/Ti atomic ratio of the outermost layer decrease. The differences in interplanar spacing between the surface and the subsurface generate strain effect, which increase carrier mobility and ultimately improve catalytic performance. Quantum size effect and specific surface area also have a big impact on catalytic performance. A prerequisite is to keep a good balance between the Ti⁴⁺/Ti³⁺ core–shell structure and the particle size to optimize its photocatalytic properties. By employing Au as a reference, we were able to estimate the Fermi levels of TiO₂ before and after illumination. The amplitude of the Fermi level upshift unambiguously relates with the photocatalytic activity. The largest Fermi level upshift under illumination means generating the most efficient photoinduced carries to perform a highly catalytic reaction, carried out by optimizing the electronic structure with appropriate oxygen vacancies. But too many oxygen vacancies increase the recombination center and reduce the concentration of photoinduced electrons, which can also be observed from the photo-KPFM result.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acolor 3aelectrons 3agold 3alighting 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3aphotocatalysis 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMa, Yanling1 aWu, Jianbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3574-55851 aPang, Fei1 aGe, Jianping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4366-12261 aSui, Song1 aYao, Yefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6274-20481 aQi, Ruijuan1 aCheng, Yan1 aDuan, Chun-gang1 aChu, Junhao1 aHuang, Rong0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 31, v. 123, no. 34 p.20949-20959dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b052853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02771naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010400163300002000267500002000287520131100307592002801618650001701646650001301663650001501676650002201691650002601713650001001739650001401749650001301763650001501776650001401791650001301805650002301818650001401841650003601855650001301891650001901904650001101923650001701934650001101951651001101962700002301973700002201996700002302018773014102041856007402182852000902256655001202265IND60651750620221119232123.0190712e20151123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065175062DNAL7 a10.3390/su711156522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidiropoulou, Anna10aLandscape Pattern Changes in Response to Transhumance Abandonment on Mountain Vermio (North Greece)  ap. 15652-15673.  aJournal Article  aTranshumance, the seasonal movement of herds between highlands and lowlands following precise, repeated routes, is a common practice in many Mediterranean regions. This livestock movement exploits natural vegetation in both winter and summer pastures. In Greece transhumant herders, drawn by relatively abundant vegetation, usually relocate to mountainous areas between April and October. Mount Vermio was an ideal summer pasture for the nomadic, ethnic group Sarakatsanoi of Thessaly, who used to own big herds. Socio-economic conditions of the 20th century led to the gradual decline of transhumance, resulting in reduction in grazing pressure and changes in vegetation dynamics. The purpose of this study was to monitor changes in landscape patterns in response to transhumance abandonment. Landscape metrics were employed to estimate land use/cover in two altitudinal zones. Results reveal that due to the abandonment of transhumance in the highlands landscape fragmentation increased. Meanwhile, in the lowlands, due to the uninterrupted presence of animals, landscape structure is more stable and diversified. Grasslands and agroforestry systems became smaller and more isolated. In conclusion, the abandonment of transhumance led to the overall deterioration of the rural landscape in the highlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3aaltitude 3agrasslands 3agrazing intensity 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aherds 3ahighlands 3aland use 3alandscapes 3alivestock 3alowlands 3amigratory behavior 3amountains 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apastures 3asocioeconomics 3asummer 3atranshumance 3awinter 3aGreece1 aKaratassiou, Maria1 aGalidaki, Georgia1 aSklavou, Paraskevi0 tSustainability.g2015 Nov. 23, v. 7, no. 11 p.15652-15673dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su711156523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03745naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245015500166300001800321520209600339592002802435650004702463650002402510650001902534650001602553650001502569650000902584650001902593650000902612650001302621650002002634650001902654650001202673650001302685650001402698650002102712650002202733653002602755653001802781700006802799700007202867700002302939700002602962700006502988773011003053856007903163852000903242655001203251IND60783241720221120181458.0220719e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078324172DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2022-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajirezaee, Saeed10aProtective effects of dietary Lavender (Lavandula officinalis) essential oil against Malathion-induced toxicity in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 1087-1096.  aThe present study was aimed to evaluate the moderating properties of lavender (Lavandula officinalis) essential oil (LEO) against immunotoxic effects of the organophosphate pesticide, malathion in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. For this purpose, fish were supplemented with LEO at dietary concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 ml/kg diet LEO for 56 days. A non-LEO supplemented group was also considered as control. After 57 days feeding trial, biochemicals were assayed in the blood and kidney tissue and then fish exposed to a sub-lethal concentration of malathion [0.24 mg/l equal to 30% of LC₅₀ (0.8 mg/L)]. After 57 days feeding trial, the serum total immunoglobulin, respiratory burst activity, lysozyme activity and complement activity significantly elevated in fish treated with 1 and 2 ml LEO/kg diet compared to non-LEO supplemented individuals (P<0.01). Such changes were not observed in non-LEO supplemented fish (P>0.01). Significant elevations were observed in the expression of the immune genes (iNOS and C₃ genes) in fish treated with 0.2–2 mg LEO/kg diet compared to non-supplemented ones (P<0.01). The lysozyme and complement activity significantly decreased in fish fed 4 ml/kg diet (P<0.01). After exposure to malathion, all immune components significantly declined in control and those treated with 0.5, 1 and 4 ml LEO/kg diet (P<0.01). In contrast, the immunity components exhibited no significant changes in fish treated with 2 ml LEO/kg diet after exposure (P>0.01). The expression of iNOS and C₃ genes significantly reduced in control and fish fed 0.5, 1 and 4 ml LEO/kg diet in response to malathion (P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression of these genes showed no significant changes in fish fed with 2 ml LEO/kg diet after exposure (P>0.01). The findings of the present study suggested an immunoprotective role for dietary LEO at optimized dietary concentrations of 1 and 2 ml LEO/kg diet against oxidative stress and toxicity induced by malathion. Nevertheless, LEO at high dietary concentration (4 ml/kg diet) had reducing effects on the fish immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLavandula angustifolia subsp. angustifolia 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aanimal science 3ablood serum 3acomplement 3adiet 3aessential oils 3afish 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulins 3aimmunotoxicity 3akidneys 3alysozyme 3amalathion 3aoxidative stress 3arespiratory burst 0aLavandula officinalis 0arainbow trout1 aJalil, Abduladheem Turki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8403-74651 aShichiyakh, Rustem Adamovich1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5159-43501 aAltimari, Usama S.1 aGhafel, Sukaina Tuama1 aMustafa, Yasser Fakri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0926-74280 tAnnals of animal science.g2022 July 01, v. 22, no. 3 p.1087-1096dSciendowJournal:2194x2300-87337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aoas-2022-00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245015100209300002000360500001900380520186200399592002802261650002502289650001902314650002502333650002002358650002502378650002502403650002002428650001502448700005902463700005302522773013102575856008402706852000902790655001202799IND60710991920221117203132.0200915e20200828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c025562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhizhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8017-386210aMicrochip with Single-Cell Impedance Measurements for Monitoring Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells under Electrical Stimulation  ap. 12579-12587.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEffective induction methods and in situ monitoring are essential for studying the mechanism of biological responses in stem cell differentiation. This article proposes an induction method incorporating electrical stimulation under an inhomogeneous field with single-cell impedance monitoring for studying osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using a microchip. The microchip contains an array of sextupole-electrode units for implementing a combination of controllable electrical stimulation and single-cell impedance measurements. MSCs are inducted to osteogenic differentiation under electrical stimulation using quadrupole electrodes and single-cell impedances are monitored in situ using a pair of microelectrodes at each unit center. The proposed microchip adopts an array design to monitor a number of MSCs in parallel, which improves measurement throughput and facilitates to carry out statistic tests. We perform osteogenic differentiation of MSCs on the microchip with and without electrical stimulation meanwhile monitoring single-cell impedance in real time for 21 days. The recorded impedance results show the detailed characteristic change of MSCs at the single-cell level during osteogenic differentiation, which demonstrates a significant difference between the conditions with and without electrical stimulation. The cell morphology and various staining analyses are also used to validate osteogenesis and correlate with the impedance expression. Correlation analysis of the impedance measurement, cell morphology, and various staining assays proves the great acceleration effect of the proposed electrical stimulation on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. The proposed impedance method can monitor the dynamic process of cell development and study heterogeneity of stem cell differentiation at the single-cell level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abone formation 3acell differentiation 3acell structures 3aelectrical treatment 3amicrochip technology 3amicroelectrodes 3astem cells1 aZheng, Tianyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2733-54791 aZhu, Rong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5363-95190 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 28, v. 92, no. 18 p.12579-12587dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c025563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245012000172300001600292520204200308592002802350650002502378650001702403650002002420650001802440650002302458650002502481650001302506650002002519650002202539650002302561650001602584650000902600650002802609650002302637650001602660650001902676650001702695651001002712653001702722653002202739653002302761653002602784653001902810700002002829700001602849700001402865773009602879856008902975852000903064655001203073IND60611914120221118073617.0190719e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Rongfang10aImpacts of urbanization on ecosystem services and their temporal relations: A case study in Northern Ningxia, China  ap. 163-173.  aUrbanization, an unavoidable global process, has driven land use change, impacted ecosystem services, and induced serious environmental problems. As a result, urban planning is a critical issue in sustainable development. In this study, we developed a framework to quantify how urbanization influences ecosystem services (ESs) in order to provide suggestions for urban planning during large scale urban agglomeration in northwestern China. We separated the region into three sub-regions (developed urban, developing urban, and rural areas), quantified five critical ESs (crop production, carbon storage, nutrient retention, sand fixation, and habitat quality), analyzed the relationships (trade-off, synergy, and bundle) among ES changes, and investigated the impacts of urbanization on these ESs. The results show that urbanization results in large scale reclamation and small scale deforestation in rural areas; it comprehensively results in an increase of four ESs (not habitat quality). Urban expansion mainly occurs in developing urban areas and causes a decrease in four ESs (not sand fixation). Based on temporal change in ESs, synergy relationships exist among them, except for between nutrient retention and crop production, which have an insignificant correlation. Urban expansion would strengthen the synergy relationships among regulating services, while green infrastructure in core urban areas would weaken these relationships. Based on the spatial distribution of ES change, two bundles were identified among the five ESs: 1) crop production, carbon storage, and nutrient retention; and 2) sand fixation and habitat quality. Based on these findings, several suggestions for urban expansion and land use planning are proposed to achieve an optimized balance between urbanization and ES protection. Investigating the impacts of rapid urbanization on ESs and their relationships could provide scientifically based suggestions for urban planning according to ES protection, sustainable urban development, and human well-being.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3acase studies 3acrop production 3adeforestation 3aecosystem services 3agreen infrastructure 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3anutrient retention 3arural areas 3asand 3asustainable development 3atemporal variation 3aurban areas 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aUrbanization 0aEcosystem service 0aNorthwestern China 0aTemporal relationship 0aUrban planning1 aZhang, Jianming1 aXu, Mengqun1 aLi, Jijun0 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.163-173dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001800172245013300190300001600323520103100339592002801370650001501398650002501413650002301438650002601461650001301487650001301500650001901513650001801532650001001550650001101560650002901571650003001600650000901630650001401639650001301653650001401666650001201680650001301692650002501705650003101730650003001761650001101791650001401802650002301816650001301839650006801852650004001920650002601960650001001986650002801996651001002024651001202034700001902046700001802065700001502083700001202098700002302110700001202133700001302145773011802158856008902276852000902365655001202374IND4468042720221123033447.0141111e20111003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446804272DNAL7 a218021602pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Hecheng10aCharacterization and horizontal transfer of class 1 integrons in Salmonella strains isolated from food products of animal origin  ap. 274-277.  aA total of 81 Salmonella isolates from retail meats and seafood in Hebei province, China, were assayed for the presence of and horizontal transfer of class 1 integrons. By the PCR screening for the integrons, class 1 integron was detected from strains in serotypes of Derby, Indiana, London and Choleraesuis, which were isolated from pork, chicken or seafood; however, two isolates contained the empty integron that lacked the resistance cassette, a potential hotspot for development of the multidrug resistance. In contrast, two other isolates had the antibiotic resistance gene cassettes within the class 1 integron, which were dfrA1-aadA1 and aadB-cmlA, respectively. The conjugation experiments demonstrated the plasmid-mediated transfer of the class 1 integrons. Furthermore, each of the integrons was transmitted to Streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation. These findings suggest the possible transfer of class 1 integrons from foodborne pathogens to human residential bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aanimal-based foods 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3achickens 3afood pathogens 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ahumans 3amultiple drug resistance 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apork 3ascreening 3aseafoods 3aserotypes 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aConjugation, Genetic 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aHumans 2aIntegrons 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aPlasmids 2aSalmonellaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSalmonella Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aSeafoodxmicrobiology 2aSwine 2aTransformation, Genetic 3aChina 3aIndiana1 aZhang, Zhigang1 aChen, Miaorui1 aSu, Yongyu1 aLi, Lin1 aMiyoshi, Shin-ichi1 aYan, He1 aShi, Lei0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2011 Oct. 3, v. 149, no. 3 p.274-277dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03609naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245013500172300001800307520175700325592002802082650001702110650001902127650002502146650002702171650001602198650002402214650001302238650001602251650002402267650000902291650002002300650001402320650001002334650001302344650001002357650001502367650001502382650002802397650001602425650002502441650001102466653001802477653002302495653002102518653001702539653002002556700002102576700002302597700002102620700002902641700001702670700002602687700001402713700001802727700002802745773011002773856007902883852000902962655001202971IND60783241820221120181414.0220719e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078324182DNAL7 a10.2478/aoas-2022-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShadrack, Ronick Spenly10aSpecific importance of low level dietary supplementation of Lypomyces starkeyi CB1807 yeast strain in red sea bream (Pagrus major)  ap. 1073-1085.  aMost probiotic yeast supplement in fish exhibit beneficial effect at ≤1% of the dietary proportion. This study aimed at evaluating the specific effects of Lypomyces starkeyi CB1807 yeast strain supplemented at ≤1% of dietary proportion on the performance of juvenile red sea bream (Pagrus major, 1.9 ± 0.04 g). Five diets were supplemented with yeast at graded levels of 0% (control diet ‘CD1’), 0.05% (D2), 0.1% (D3), 0.5% (D4), and 1.0% (D5). After 45 days of feeding trial, significant (P<0.05) improvement was detected on final body weight (FBW) and body weight gain (BWG) in fish fed D3 and D5 compared to control. Low values of total cholesterol (T-Cho) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were recorded in fish groups fed on D2, D4, and D5, respectively. Fish fed on D3, D4 and D5 diets showed high (P<0.05) values of serum, mucus and liver lysozyme compared to control. Fish fed on D5 showed high values of total immunoglobulin (Ig) compared to control. Fish fed on D2 showed strong correlation with biological antioxidant activity (BAP), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity (CAT). The biological antioxidant potential (BAP) activity in fish fed on D2 was significantly higher compared to control (P<0.05). The reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) were significantly lower in fish fed on D2 and D3 compared to CD1 (P<0.05). Peroxidase activity was improved significantly (P<0.05) in fish fed on D3, D4 and D5 compared to control. The tolerance ability (LT₅₀) of fish fed on D5 against low salinity stress was significantly higher compared to control (P<0.05).

Whilst conflicts may first appear to concern wildlife, they are often embedded within wider debates surrounding land use, land ownership, and the governance of natural resources. Disputes over the impacts or management of a species therefore become symbols for conflicts that are fundamentally between the divergent interests and values of the people involved. NGOs representing the interests of local stakeholders can become actors within the conflict, often utilising publicly available platforms such as websites and social media in an attempt to influence over others and gain a dominant foothold in the debate.Here, we examined discourses of organisations in relation to a contentious and high-profile case of conflict in Scotland, that occurs between interests of raptor conservation and grouse moor management. News articles sourced from the websites of six organisations – identified as key voices in the debate – were subjected to discourse analysis. 36 storylines were drawn from common phrases and statements within the text. Storylines demonstrated a clear divide in the discourse; organisations differed not only in their portrayal of central issues, but also in their representation of other actors. Discourses were strategic; organisations interpreted the situation in ways that either supported their own interests and agendas, or damaged the image of opposing parties. We argue that discursive contestation at this level could be damaging to mitigation efforts – widening barriers between stakeholders and risking already fragile relationships. This in turn reduces the likelihood of consensus and impacts on successful decision-making and policy implementation. We conclude that conflict managers should be aware of the contestation between high-profile actors, and the ramifications this may have for conflict mitigation processes. An understanding of what constitutes these discourses should therefore be used as a foundation to improve dialogue and collaborative management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abirds of prey 3acollaborative management 3adecision making 3agovernance 3agrouse 3aissues and policy 3aland ownership 3aland use 3amanagers 3anongovernmental organizations 3asocial networks 3astakeholders 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3aScotland 0aConservation conflicts 0aConflict mitigation 0aDiscourse analysis 0aStakeholders 0aOrganisations 0aRaptors1 aRedpath, Steve M.1 aEngelke, Anke,1 aYoung, Juliette0 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.332-343dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014100166300001600307520142600323592002801749650003001777650001201807650001801819650001101837650001601848650001401864650001801878650002001896650001501916650001301931650001301944650002101957650001801978650002501996650002502021700001802046773011902064856008202183852000902265655001202274IND60775731120221116193317.0220427e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077573112DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829220201102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoman, N. Yu.10aCombined Effect of Light Intensity and Nitrogen Concentration in a Medium on the Structural and Functional Characteristics of Microalgae  ap. 115-121.  aThis study investigates the change in light dependences of the specific growth rate and carbon to the chlorophyll a ratio in marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum on the initial nitrogen concentration in a nutrient medium. In different variants of experiment, the nitrogen content in the medium (in nitrate form) ranged from 10 to 414 μM; the light intensity varied between 14 and 1200 μE m–² s–¹. It is found that the combined effect of light intensity and the degree of nitrogen availability to cells on the studied characteristics of algae is observed under the light inhibition of growth. A decrease in the initial nitrogen concentration in the medium leads to a narrowing of the optimal range of light intensity for algae growth, an increase in the degree of a light inhibition of growth rate, and a progressive decrease in the chlorophyll content in the cells. The half-saturation constant calculated from the Monod equation increases with light intensity on a power-law relationship. The regularities of the specific growth rate and the intracellular chlorophyll a content changes depending on the nitrogen concentration in the medium, and light conditions of cultivation can be used in developing models for assessing the biomass and primary production of phytoplankton, as well as in the interpretation of data from monitoring natural waters and in biotechnology for the mass cultivation of microalgae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3achlorophyll 3aequations 3ainland waters 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphytoplankton 3aprimary productivity 3aspecific growth rate1 aAkimov, A.

Transplastomic tobacco plants generated with this vector properly expressed the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene without incorporating it into the plastid genome. To construct the episomal vector, a 610-bp DNA fragment containing the putative replication origin was fused to a dicistronic expression cassette encoding the aminoglycoside 3′-adenyltransferase (aadA) and gfp genes under control of the plastid rrn promoter. The vector was delivered to plastids of tobacco leaf explants by biolistic bombardment. After 8 weeks of bombardment, episomal transformant shoots were generated from leaf explants cultured on selection media containing 500 mg/L spectinomycin. Fluorescence microscopy and northern blot analysis demonstrated GFP expression in episomal transformant plants. PCR, Southern blot analysis, recovery of episomes, and sequencing analysis showed the vector to be maintained as self-replicating extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules for at least 6 months. Using a single construct for all plants, our episomal vector system may offer an advantage over the conventional plastid vector systems, which require species-specific constructs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aDinophyceae 3aNorthern blotting 3aSouthern blotting 3abiolistics 3achromosomes 3aexplants 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aleaves 3aplasmids 3aplastid genome 3aplastids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areplication origin 3asequence analysis 3ashoots 3aspectinomycin 3atobacco1 aDavarpanah, Seyed Javad1 aJung, Seo Hee1 aPark, Youn-il1 aLiu, Jang R.1 aJeong, Won-Joong0 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2015 Nov., v. 9, no. 6 p.443-449dSpringer Japanx1863-54667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-015-0381-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03353naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245014600166300001600312500002000328520172100348592002802069596004302097596004802140596002402188650002102212650000902233650002502242650002602267650002702293650002102320650002302341650001102364650001402375650002902389650001402418650001102432650001202443650001302455650001402468650001402482700002402496700002002520700001702540700002802557700002502585700002202610773010702632856007502739852000902814655001202823IND60787215820221118143816.0220808e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078721582DNAL7 a10.1002/lipd.122882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKermack, Alexandra J.14aThe Fatty Acid Composition of Human Follicular Fluid Is Altered by a 6‐Week Dietary Intervention That Includes Marine Omega‐3 Fatty Acids  ap. 201-209.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe fatty acid composition of human follicular fluid is important for oocyte development and for pregnancy following in vitro fertilization (IVF). This study investigated whether a dietary intervention that included an increase in marine omega‐3 fatty acids, olive oil and vitamin D alters the fatty acid composition of human follicular fluid. The association of lifestyle factors with follicular fluid fatty acid composition was also investigated. Fifty‐five couples awaiting IVF were randomized to receive the 6‐week treatment intervention of olive oil for cooking, an olive oil‐based spread, and a daily supplement drink enriched with vitamin D and the marine omega‐3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 56 couples were randomized to receive placebo equivalents. Dietary questionnaires were completed, and samples of blood were taken before and after the intervention. Follicular fluid was collected at oocyte retrieval and the fatty acid profile assessed using gas chromatography. In the control group, individual fatty acids in red blood cells and follicular fluid were significantly correlated. Furthermore, a healthier diet was associated with a lower percentage of follicular fluid arachidonic acid. The follicular fluid of women in the treatment group contained significantly higher amounts of EPA and DHA compared to the control group, while the omega‐6 fatty acids linoleic, γ‐linolenic, dihomo‐γ‐linolenic, and arachidonic were lower. This is the first report of a dietary intervention altering the fatty acid composition of follicular fluid in humans. Further research is required to determine whether this intervention improves oocyte quality.  aPublisher supplied data  cComplete Fertility Centre, Southampton  cNIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre  cSmartfish Nutrition 3aarachidonic acid 3adiet 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afollicular fluid 3agas chromatography 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3anutritional intervention 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aoocytes 3aplacebos 3apregnancy 3avitamin D1 aWellstead, Susan J.1 aFisk, Helena L.1 aCheong, Ying1 aHoughton, Franchesca D.1 aMacklon, Nicholas S.1 aCalder, Philip C.0 tLipids.g2021 Mar., v. 56, no. 2 p.201-209dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.122883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245017100190300001600361520143100377592002801808650002101836650002201857650002001879650001301899650001001912650001001922650001501932650001201947650001501959650001401974650002101988650001402009650001002023650001202033650001502045650001202060650002402072650001302096650002102109650001002130650005902140650004502199650004802244650002702292650002802319650001402347650002502361650002702386650002202413651001002435651001202445651002702457700001902484700001802503700002002521700002202541700001902563700001702582700002102599700002102620700001902641700002002660700001902680700001802699700001802717773008602735856004802821852000902869655001202878IND50069567320221120171209.0130928e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006956732DNAL7 a238610182pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-013-0954-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamatsu, Masatoshi14aThe genetic and antigenic diversity of avian influenza viruses isolated from domestic ducks, muscovy ducks, and chickens in northern and southern Vietnam, 2010–2012  ap. 317-329.  aTo estimate the prevalence of avian influenza virus infection in Vietnam, surveillance was conducted in domestic and wild birds from households, live-bird markets, slaughtering sites, and bird sanctuaries in Vietnam between October 2010 and October 2012. Of the 4,550 samples collected, 226 influenza A virus isolates were obtained from domestic ducks, muscovy ducks, and chickens. Of these, 25 and 22 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) were isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in live-bird markets and slaughtering sites in northern and southern Vietnam, respectively. The HA genes of H5 viruses isolated from birds in northern Vietnam phylogenetically belonged to the genetic clade 2.3.2.1 and those in southern Vietnam belonged to the genetic clade 1.1. In addition, 39 H3, 12 H4, 1 H5, 93 H6, 2 H7, 18 H9, 3 H10, and 11 H11 viruses were isolated. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses of the H6 and H9 viruses revealed that they were closely related to the isolates obtained from domestic poultry in China. Phylogenetic analyses of internal gene segments of these isolates revealed that these viruses were circulating in both domestic and wild birds in Asia and reassortment events had occurred frequently. Therefore, it will be important to continue the surveillance and strict controls over the movement and trade of poultry and poultry products in order to eradicate H5N1 HPAIV from Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCairina moschata 3aInfluenza A virus 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3aducks 3agenes 3ahouseholds 3amarkets 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3apoultry products 3aslaughter 3atrade 3aviruses 3awild birds 2aAnimals 2aAntigenic Variation 2aChickens 2aCluster Analysis 2aDucks 2aHemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virusxgenetics 2aInfluenza A virusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aInfluenza in Birdsxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology 3aChina 3aVietnam 0aVietnamxepidemiology.1 aNishi, Tatsuya1 aNomura, Naoki1 aYamamoto, Naoki1 aSakoda, Yoshihiro1 aSakurai, Kenji1 aChu, Huy Duc1 aThanh, Long Pham1 aVan Nguyen, Long1 aVan Hoang, Nam1 aTien, Tien Ngoc1 aYoshida, Reiko1 aTakada, Ayato1 aKida, Hiroshi0 tVirus genes.g2013 Oct., v. 47, no. 2 p.317-329dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-013-0954-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245009700169300001600266520139900282592002801681650001101709650001101720650001301731650002101744650001101765650002301776650001601799650001701815651001001832653002701842653002501869653001901894653002801913653002001941653001001961700001601971700001701987700001702004773009602021856008902117852000902206655001202215IND60611914320221118073616.0190719e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Cheng10aIs Urban Land Development Driven by Economic Development or Fiscal Revenue Stimuli in China?  ap. 107-115.  aSince the reform and opening-up, urban land development in China mainland has been increasing dramatically with significant regional differences. Using the panel data of municipal districts in 246 cities at the prefectural or higher levels in Chinese mainland from 2004 to 2014, based on the analysis of the differences in land development intensity in municipal districts, a model of factors affecting land development is built to verify whether the urban land development is driven by economic development or fiscal revenue from the perspectives of economic development and fiscal revenue. The conclusions are as follows: first, the intensity of land development varies significantly among municipal districts. The difference in the intensity of land development increases with the increase of city scale. The difference in the intensity of land development in central China is lower than that in eastern and western China. Second, the primary factors affecting the intensity of urban land development are economic growth, population urbanization, and population density. Finally, land transfer revenues also drive the land development in cities at the prefectural or higher levels to a considerable extent, which is proposed as “land finance” (local governments rely on the sale of land use rights to obtain extra-budgetary income to maintain local fiscal expenditure) in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aincome 3aland use 3alocal government 3amodels 3apopulation density 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aUrban land development 0aEconomic development 0aFiscal revenue 0aPopulation urbanization 0aLand management 0aChina1 aXie, Hualin1 aJiang, Jinfa1 aChen, Qianru0 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.107-115dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014200182300001600324500001500340520076000355592002801115650002001143650001401163650002101177650002101198650001301219650001801232650002601250650001101276650001801287650001101305650002101316650003801337650000901375650001001384650002201394650001201416650005901428650002201487650004001509650003801549650001101587650000901598650002101607650002101628650003001649650005801679650005001737650005001787653002001837700001801857700002401875773010101899856008102000852000902081655001202090IND4401798820221120054735.0151024e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440179882DNAL7 a180438692pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-007-9609-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFong, Mun Yik10aCharacterization of secreted recombinant Toxoplasma gondii surface antigen 2 (SAG2) heterologously expressed by the yeast Pichia pastoris  ap. 611-618.  a2019-12-06  aThe surface antigen 2 (SAG2) gene of the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, was cloned and extracellularly expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The effectiveness of the secreted recombinant SAG2 (rSAG2-S) as a serodiagnosis reagent was assessed by western blots and ELISA. In the western blot assay, rSAG2-S reacted with all Toxoplasma-antibody positive human serum samples but not with Toxoplasma-negative samples. In the ELISA, rSAG2-S yielded sensitivity rates ranging from 80% (IgG negative, IgM positive) to 100% (IgG positive, IgM negative). In vivo experiments showed that serum from mice immunized with rSAG2-S reacted specifically with the native SAG2 of T. gondii.

In addition to this, we have also obtained the phase equilibria and interfacial properties of the system from a molecular dynamics computer simulation. THF is modeled as a rigid and planar approximated TraPPE-UA model proposed by us in a previous work [Garrido, J. M. et al. J. Chem. Phys.2016, 144, 787 144702−144711]. This model has been used recently to determine the vapor–liquid interfacial properties of the THF + carbon dioxide binary mixture [Algaba, J. et al. J. Chem. Phys. C2018, 122, 16142−16153] with high accuracy. The simulations are performed using the direct coexistence technique in the molecular dynamics NVT canonical ensemble. We have determined density profiles, pressure-composition, pressure-density, and surface tension. The last property is calculated using the virial definition of the pressure tensor. Predictions of the phase equilibria are in good agreement with experiments. Predictions for surface tension obtained from simulations have also been compared with the experimental results, the agreement being excellent in all cases. The surface relative Gibbs adsorption of the species along the interfacial region is reported; methane is adsorbed along the interfacial region, whereas tetrahydrofuran does not exhibit any special adsorption activity. The adsorption of methane increases with pressure and decreases with temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer simulation 3amethane 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aprediction 3asurface tension 3atemperature 3atetrahydrofuran1 aCartes, Marcela1 aMejía, Andrés1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7238-66331 aMíguez, José Manuel1 aBlas, Felipe J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9030-040X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 31, v. 123, no. 34 p.20960-20970dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b054123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245010900176300001600285520125100301592002801552650002501580650001701605650001101622650001101633650002201644650001301666650001301679650002301692651001201715653000801727653000801735653000801743653000801751653000801759653000801767653001701775653002001792653002101812653003701833700006301870773009601933856008902029852000902118655001202127IND60611914420221118073556.0190719e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanger, Sebastian14aThe effect of industrial and commercial land consumption on municipal tax revenue: Evidence from Bavaria  ap. 279-287.  aThis paper aims to quantify the municipal tax-revenue effects of increases in built-up areas. The assumed existence of these effects is one of the key reasons for ongoing land consumption on the part of the municipalities. Some previous case studies have however suggested that these effects may not be large enough, especially in rural municipalities, and would thus make land development unprofitable.We estimate the effect of built-up industrial and commercial (BIC) area change on business tax revenues in cross-sectional instrumental variable estimations. Based on detailed data for Bavaria, we find that an increase in municipal BIC area has a significant and positive tax-revenue effect. The size of this effect differs sharply between urban and rural municipalities and between cities with different population densities. The positive overall effects become much smaller when large cities are excluded from the sample. Based on these findings, we reflect on the tradable planning permits scheme recently discussed in the literature on land use in the context of policies aiming to limit land consumption. In addition, we relate our estimates to the average municipal costs for land development and undertake a number of robustness checks.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3acities 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3aplanning 3apopulation density 3aGermany 0aH21 0aH25 0aH70 0aH71 0aR14 0aR52 0aTax revenues 0aMunicipal taxes 0aLand consumption 0aInstrumental variable regression1 aKorzhenevych, Artem1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3835-93720 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.279-287dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001700169245013400186300001400320520092100334592002801255653002201283653003301305653002801338700001801366773010701384856011701491852000901608655001201617IND60127300320221120235009.0151110e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012730032DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040(2004)087[0051:ANSOTA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeyrup, Mark12aA new species of the ant genus leptothorax from florida, with a key to the leptothorax of the southeast (hymenoptera: formicidae)  ap. 51-59.  aA new species of myrmicine ant is described from Florida: Leptothorax palustris is known from workers and associated queens and males collected in a marsh and in frequently flooded pinelands in the Apalachicola National Forest in northwestern Florida. Nests are near the surface in root mats that extend into small open sandy hummocks. The species resembles Leptothorax texanus Wheeler, a species of adjacent well-drained sandy sites, differing primarily in the structure of the petiole and postpetiole and color. Leptothorax davisi Wheeler is synonymized with Leptothorax texanus Wheeler (new synonymy); this is based on extensive and previously unknown variability in L. texanus, even in single sites and within nest series.

The Municipalities have to implement the contents related to the various risks and directly intervene on the territory, but the lack of linkage and coordination between the plans and the authorities in charge often makes the emergency management and LUP less effective towards the achievement of a real safety of territories. In addition, the actual legislative framework does not face the possible consequences of risk interactions.In this context, the objective was to develop a simple risk pre-screening tool, expressly designed for local planners, able to point out the areas more exposed to risks and risks interactions, in order to better address the distribution of the municipal resources for further studies and interventions. The local planners that, especially in Italy, have a central role for the risk management of the territory, became the central point for the proposed framework, assuming the role of evaluators, and then decision-makers.A semi-quantitative approach, based on an index scale from 0 to 3 onwards was developed for a direct use from Municipal technicians; the proposed scale is applied to measure both the impact of the risks and risk interaction. The methodology is composed by 4 steps: 1) characterization of the risks; 2) assignation of the ratings to the risks; 3) assessment of binary risk interactions; 4) assessment of the compatibility and planning phase. Each step is accompanied by GIS mapping.The methodology was tested on two Italian case-studies, two Municipalities affected by multiple types of risks which could interact; the proposed approach demonstrated to be able in identifying and bring multi-risks aspects to the attention of the decision makers, constituting a guide to risk that can be integrated with the existing planning instruments to improve the quality of decisions related to risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3ageographic information systems 3aland use planning 3arisk 3arisk management 3atechnicians 3aItaly 0aMulti-Risk 0aLocal scale 0aSemi-quantitative methodology1 aDemichela, M.0 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.143-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013000171300001600301520107800317592002801395650001401423650001201437650001201449650001101461650001101472651001801483773013101501856008201632852000901714655001201723IND60775731520221116193439.0220427e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077573152DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255220200812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyzhanovskiy, V.

The invasion of the yellow-browed warbler, the greenish warbler, and the accentor into the Subarctic is limited by arboreal vegetation, and the invasion of the arctic warbler is limited by tall willows in the river valleys of the middle Yamal. The northwestern Siberian warbler, chiffchaff, and sedge warbler inhabit the subarctic tundra of Yamal. The last three species move northward. There are no species or subspecies of warblers associated with the Subarctic, but the birds tolerate temperatures close to 0°C, allowing the northwestern Siberian warbler and chiffchaff to come in the second half of May and early June. Sedge, arctic, and yellow-browed warblers coming in June are more thermophilic. The probable advancement of forest-tundra landscapes to the north under conditions of further warming will entail the northward movement of forest and shrubby birds—not only warblers—because there are no factors preventing it.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSylviidae 3aecology 3aforests 3arivers 3atundra 3aArctic region0 tContemporary problems of ecology.g2022 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.101-108dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000001736x1995-42557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S19954255220200813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245008800203300001600291500001100307520179000318592002802108596006802136596006602204596007102270650001502341650002802356650001802384650002002402650001502422650001302437650001002450650001302460650001602473650001302489650001102502650002002513650002002533650001502553650001702568700002102585700001702606700001802623700002402641700002302665700002002688773010602708856007502814852000902889655001202898IND60787216020221118143811.0220808e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078721602DNAL7 a10.1002/lipd.122902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenincasa, Giuditta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7552-352210aNetwork Medicine Approach in Prevention and Personalized Treatment of Dyslipidemias  ap. 259-268.  aREVIEW  aDyslipidemias can affect molecular networks underlying the metabolic homeostasis and vascular function leading to atherogenesis at early stages of development. Since disease‐related proteins often interact with each other in functional modules, many advanced network‐oriented algorithms were applied to patient‐derived big data to identify the complex gene–environment interactions underlying the early pathophysiology of dyslipidemias and atherosclerosis. Both the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 (PCSK7) and collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) genes arose from the application of TFfit and WGCNA algorithms, respectively, as potential useful therapeutic targets in prevention of dyslipidemias. Moreover, the Seed Connector algorithm (SCA) algorithm suggested a putative role of the neuropilin‐1 (NRP1) protein as drug target, whereas a regression network analysis reported that niacin may provide benefits in mixed dyslipidemias. Dyslipidemias are highly heterogeneous at the clinical level; thus, it would be helpful to overcome traditional evidence‐based paradigm toward a personalized risk assessment and therapy. Network Medicine uses omics data, artificial intelligence (AI), imaging tools, and clinical information to design personalized therapy of dyslipidemias and atherosclerosis. Recently, a novel non‐invasive AI‐derived biomarker, named Fat Attenuation Index (FAI™) has been established to early detect clinical signs of atherosclerosis. Moreover, an integrated AI‐radiomics approach can detect fibrosis and microvascular remodeling improving the customized risk assessment. Here, we offer a network‐based roadmap ranging from novel molecular pathways to digital therapeutics which can improve personalized therapy of dyslipidemias.  aPublisher supplied data  cItalian Ministry of Health Ricerca Corrente‐IRCCS MultiMedica  cUniversity of Campania, “Luigi Vanvitelli,” Naples, Italy  aPRIN2017F8ZB89cItalian Ministry of University and Research (MIUR) 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aatherogenesis 3aatherosclerosis 3abiomarkers 3acollagen 3adrugs 3afibrosis 3ahomeostasis 3amedicine 3aniacin 3apathophysiology 3arisk assessment 3asubtilisin 3atherapeutics1 ade Candia, Paola1 aCosta, Dario1 aFaenza, Mario1 aMansueto, Gelsomina1 aAmbrosio, Giuseppe1 aNapoli, Claudio0 tLipids.g2021 May, v. 56, no. 3 p.259-268dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.122903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007600165300001600241520111200257592002801369650002301397650001701420650001201437650001701449650002301466650001201489650001201501650000701513650002201520650001301542650001601555653002801571653002001599653001701619700001201636700005101648700001701699700005501716773014501771856008001916852000901996655001202005IND60680932520221122231444.0200110e20191209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068093252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b062232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhenxia10aIdentification of a Potent Enzyme for the Detoxification of Zearalenone  ap. 376-383.  aThe occurrence of mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) and its derivatives has been a severe global threat to food and animals. In addition to the chemical and physical degradation methods, a powerful biocatalyst is urgently required for the detoxification of ZEN. Here, an efficient ZEN-degrading lactonase from Gliocladium roseum, named ZENG, was identified for the first time. The recombinant ZENG exhibited the highest activity at pH 7.0 and 38 °C. In addition, the recombinant enzyme showed a high degrading performance toward ZEN and its toxic derivatives α-zearalenol (α-ZOL) and α-zearalanol (α-ZAL), with the specific activities as 315, 187, and 117 units/mg, respectively. To meet the industrial demands, attempts were also made to enhance the thermostability of ZENG using a structure-based modification. Three double-site mutants, including H134L/S136L, H134F/S136F, and H134I/S134I, in the position between the cap and core catalytic domain of ZENG were designed. Finally, the thermostability of both H134L/S136L and H134F/S136F displayed a significant improvement compared to the wild-type enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClonostachys rosea 3aactive sites 3aanimals 3abiocatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenzymes 3amutants 3apH 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 3azearalenone 0aZEN-degrading lactonase 0athermostability 0amodification1 aXu, Wei1 aWu, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5532-65641 aZhang, Wenli1 aMu, Wanmeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6597-527X0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Dec. 09, v. 68, no. 1 p.376-383dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b062233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013800156300002000294520089500314592002801209650001101237650002101248650001701269650000901286650002001295650001401315650002101329650001001350650001801360650001101378650001201389651001001401700002001411700001801431700002001449773014101469856007401610852000901684655001201693IND60651751120221119232125.0190712e20151124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065175112DNAL7 a10.3390/su711157722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haina10aCarbon Footprint Analysis for Mechanization of Maize Production Based on Life Cycle Assessment: A Case Study in Jilin Province, China  ap. 15772-15784.  aThe theory on the carbon footprint of agriculture can systematically evaluate the carbon emissions caused by artificial factors from the agricultural production process, which is the theoretical basis for constructing low-carbon agriculture and has important guiding significance for realizing low-carbon agriculture.

There is currently no single analytical method that can simultaneously acquire elemental, molecular, and spatial information from a single sample. This paper presents the coupling of an NWR213 laser ablation (LA) system to the liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) microplasma for combined atomic and molecular (CAM) analysis. The work demonstrates a fundamental balance that must be considered between the extent of fragmentation of molecules and ionization of atoms for CAM analysis. Detailed studies showed that the interelectrode gap to be a critical parameter for controlling the ionization efficiency of atomic and molecular species. Utilizing Design-of-Experiment (DoE) procedures, the discharge current was also found to be a significant parameter to control. Elemental lead, caffeine, and simultaneous lead and caffeine analysis via LA-LS-APGD-MS was made possible through improved understanding of the influence of plasma parameters on the product mass spectra of laser-ablated particles. Finally, a chemical map of elemental lead and molecular caffeine, from lead nitrate and caffeine residues, was generated, demonstrating the comprehensive mapping capabilities of LA-LS-APGD-MS. The practical relevance of the capabilities is demonstrated by mapping glutamic acid from a cryosectioned chicken breast with a thallium spike deposited within the tissue. It is believed that the LA-LS-APGD-MS could be a valuable methodology for the simultaneous mapping of elemental and molecular species from a variety of samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanalytical methods 3abreasts 3acaffeine 3achickens 3aenvironmental assessment 3aglutamic acid 3aionization 3alead 3alead nitrate 3aliquids 3aspatial data 3athallium1 aBryant, Tyler J.1 aQuarles, C.

More D. alloeum were observed alighting on blueberry fruit clusters infested with Rhagoletis mendax Curran larvae than were observed alighting on uninfested blueberry fruit clusters 80 cm away. Approximately equal numbers of D. alloeum alighted on uninfested blueberries that were mechanically damaged versus undamaged. The majority of D. alloeum females were attracted to host-infested blueberries 15 to 21 days after R. mendax females had oviposited into fruit. Female D. alloeum spent more time alighting on R. mendax-infested blueberry fruit clusters than on uninfested blueberry clusters 80 cm away. There was no difference in the duration of time spent by D. alloeum on mechanically damaged versus undamaged uninfested blueberries.

It recorded high-resolution spectra during day and night, from pole to pole and between 6 and 70km altitude in the nominal measurement mode or up to 170km in special measurement modes, producing daily more than 1000 vertical profiles of various trace gases. The operational Level-2 data are processed by ESA/DLR but there exist three other, independent research Level-2 processors that are hosted by ISAC-CNR/University of Bologna, Oxford University, and KIT IMK/IAA. All four Level-2 processors rely on the same Level-1b data provided by ESA but their retrieval schemes differ. As part of ESA's Ozone Climate Change Initiative project, an intercomparison of the four MIPAS processors took place, in which vertical ozone profiles retrieved by these four processors from MIPAS nominal mode measurements were compared for 2007 and 2008. We present the results of this comparison exercise, which consisted of five parts: an information content study of the vertical averaging kernels, an intercomparison of zonal seasonal means and spreads, a determination of biases through comparison to ozonesonde and lidar measurements, a comparison to other satellite records (bias estimation and precision assessment with respect to ACE-FTS and Aura-MLS data), and a geophysical validation of the provided error bars using MIPAS–MIPAS collocations.The four processors demonstrate similar performance. All processors use the same Level-1b data from ESA, apply global fits, and use microwindows instead of the full spectrum. The main differences in the processing schemes include the choice of microwindows, the regularization approach, the treatment of negative retrieved values, and the cloud detection threshold. The different regularization schemes lead to a different trade-off between noise and resolution, but without a clear average advantage for any particular data set. The vertical resolution is typically 3–5km and the single profile precision is about 2–3%. In the middle and upper stratosphere, at 25–45km, all four MIPAS processors clearly show a high bias of 2 to 5% relative to all reference instruments. The similarity of the structure and magnitude of the bias among the MIPAS data sets indicates that the bias is most likely linked to the use of microwindows of the MIPAS AB band. The satellite intercomparisons show furthermore that for the KIT dataset, the onset of the high bias starts at a somewhat higher altitude (only above 35km) than for the other three datasets. This is likely due to the more restrictive use of the AB band by the KIT processor, which comes at the cost of a coarser vertical resolution near the ozone volume mixing ratio (vmr) peak. In the troposphere, the Level-2 algorithms that suppress negative ozone values in the iterative retrieval process produce a larger positive bias than the algorithm that does not follow such a strategy. Our main conclusion is that the four MIPAS processors are more similar to each other than to any other reference instrument. This indicates that the observed biases are very likely instrument-related.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adetection limit 3agases 3ageophysics 3aindole acetic acid 3ainterferometers 3alidar 3amixing 3aozone 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseeds 3aspectrometers 3astratosphere 3atroposphere 0aMIPAS 0aOzone1 aHubert, D.1 aVerhoelst, T.1 avon Clarmann, T.1 aDinelli, B.M.1 aDudhia, A.1 aRaspollini, P.1 aStiller, G.1 aGrabowski, U.1 aKeppens, A.1 aKiefer, M.1 aSofieva, V.1 aFroidevaux, L.1 aWalker, K.A.1 aLambert, J.

Therefore, the binding affinities of candidate drugs to their targets are key for pharmacological activity and clinical use. For drug discovery methods where multiple drug candidates can simultaneously bind to the same target, a competition is established, and the resulting equilibrium depends on the dissociation constants and concentration of all the species present. Such coupling between all equilibrium-governing parameters complicates analysis and development of improved mixture-based, high-throughput drug discovery techniques. In this work, we present an iterative computational algorithm to solve coupled equilibria between an arbitrary number of ligands and a biomolecular target that is efficient and robust. The algorithm does not require the estimation of initial values to rapidly converge to the solution of interest. We explored binding equilibria under ligand/receptor conditions used in mixture-based library screening by affinity selection–mass spectrometry (AS–MS). Our studies support a facile method for affinity-ranking hits. The ranking method involves varying the receptor-to-ligand concentration ratio in a pool of candidate ligands in two sequential AS–MS analyses. The ranking is based on the relative change in bound ligand concentration. The method proposed does not require a known reference ligand and produces a ranking that is insensitive to variations in the concentration of individual compounds, thereby enabling the use of unpurified compounds generated by mixture-based combinatorial synthesis techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical chemistry 3adissociation 3adrugs 3aligands 3amedicinal properties 3aspectroscopy1 aOtero-Muras, Irene1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2895-997X1 aAnnis, David Allen0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 19, v. 92, no. 18 p.12630-12638dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c027153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03615naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245012500206300002000331520164400351592002801995650001502023650001302038650001402051650001202065650001202077650001102089650001102100650001202111650002302123650002802146650001902174650002002193650002102213650002302234650003002257650002302287650001302310650002102323650001202344650001202356650001302368650001302381650001502394650002502409650002102434700002302455700005802478700005602536700001502592700002302607700006002630700002302690700006102713773013802774856008002912852000902992655001203001IND60661470920221120162640.0190829e20190805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066147092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b057072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamachi, Takashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9281-045410aLinear Correlations between Adsorption Energies and HOMO Levels for the Adsorption of Small Molecules on TiO₂ Surfaces  ap. 20988-20997.  aAdsorption is a fundamental step in catalysis on a solid surface, and therefore, its understanding is important for explaining its behavior. This work investigated the adsorption of various small molecules, including H₂, N₂, CO, CO₂, CH₄, NH₃, H₂O, H₂S, dimethyl sulfoxide, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatic compounds, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, carboxylic acids, amides, and amines, on the anatase (101) and rutile (110) surfaces of TiO₂, using periodic density functional theory calculations and statistical methods. Adsorption energies were computed at the same level of theory to obtain a clean and consistent data set. A linear relationship was observed between the adsorption energies of these molecules and their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, whereas no obvious correlation was evident for the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels. Improved correlations between the adsorption energies and HOMO levels were generated by dividing these molecules into two subgroups: hydrocarbons and heteroatom-containing compounds. Interactions between frontier molecular orbitals and the surfaces were considered, to gain a better understanding of the significant correlations that were identified. The data show that these relationships can be primarily ascribed to the interactions between the HOMO of the small molecule and conduction state of the TiO₂ surface. The statistical analysis using machine learning demonstrated that the HOMO and dipole moment are the first and second most important properties, respectively, in terms of rationalizing and predicting the adsorption energies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aalkenes 3aalkynes 3aamides 3aamines 3aammonia 3aaromatic compounds 3aartificial intelligence 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acarboxylic acids 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aketones 3amethane 3anitriles 3anitrogen 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 3atitanium dioxide1 aTatsumi, Toshinobu1 aToyao, Takashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6062-56221 aHinuma, Yoyo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2272-11781 aMaeno, Zen1 aTakakusagi, Satoru1 aFurukawa, Shinya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2621-61391 aTakigawa, Ichigaku1 aShimizu, Ken-ichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0501-02940 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 05, v. 123, no. 34 p.20988-20997dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b057073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006900138245013800207300001800345500002000363520184700383592002802230650002102258650002502279650002102304650001202325650001202337650001102349650002002360650002602380650001602406650001302422650002102435650001802456650001302474650001002487650001602497650002002513700001802533700002102551700002102572700002002593700001902613773013302632856007202765852000902837655001202846IND60616591220221123005749.0181018e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061659122DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.31002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrzezińska, Małgorzata,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8626-097810aQuantitative interactions between total and specific enzyme activities and C and N contents in earthworm‐affected pear orchard soil  ap. 3379-3389.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe current study describes quantitatively the interactions between (a) activity of extracellular enzymes: β‐glucosidase (BG), protease (Prot), alkaline phosphatase (Alk P), and acid phosphatase (Acid P); (b) intracellular activities: respiration, dehydrogenase activity (DHA); and (c) C and N contents of soil: Cₒᵣg—organic carbon, Cₘᵢc—microbial biomass, ratio Cₘᵢc:Cₒᵣg, Nₜₒₜ—total nitrogen, and ratio C:N in earthworm‐affected and surrounding loess soil under a pear orchard. The soil tested was collected from: burrow walls (0–3 mm) and a transition zone (3–7 mm) both forming drilosphere, bulk soil (20 mm from the burrow wall), and cast aggregates. The enzyme activities were presented as total ‘tot’ (per gram of dry soil mass) and specific ‘spec’ (per Cₘᵢc). It was shown that soil Cₘᵢc, basal respiration, BGₜₒₜ, Protₜₒₜ, and Alk Pₜₒₜ were significantly positively correlated with Cₒᵣg, Cₘᵢc:Cₒᵣg, Nₜₒₜ, and C:N (r = 0.627–0.976). However, the specific BGₛₚₑc, Protₛₚₑc, and Acid Pₛₚₑc were negatively correlated, while specific respiration (qCO₂) and Alk Pₛₚₑc were not correlated with most soil characteristics. The relationships between DHAₜₒₜ, DHAₛₚₑc, and all soil characteristics were positive and had the highest correlation coefficients (r = 0.703–0.989). Response ratio of the enzyme activity was more strongly affected by enzyme activity location (extracellular vs. intracellular) and presentation method (total vs. specific), than by earthworm‐affected soil compartments. The results suggest a need to consider the method of enzyme activity presentation (specific vs. total) that supports understanding ecologically relevant microbial processes in earthworm‐inhabited orchard soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiomass 3aburrows 3acarbon 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3aloess soils 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aorchard soils 3aorchards 3apears 3aproteinases 3asoil properties1 aLipiec, Jerzy1 aFrąc, Magdalena1 aOszust, Karolina1 aSzarlip, Paweł1 aTurski, Marcin0 tLand degradation & development.g2018 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.3379-3389dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.31003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245005700172300001600229520151100245592002801756650001201784650002301796650001901819650001901838650001801857650002301875650001801898650001901916650002301935650001201958650001401970650001401984650001001998653001602008653002602024653003002050653001902080700001802099700002202117700002002139773010202159856008602261852000902347655001202356IND60635125620221116220417.0190509e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063512562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsieh, Chao-Feng10aStructure and functional properties of waxy starches  ap. 238-254.  aA comprehensive study was conducted to elucidate structural and functional properties of waxy starches. The specific objectives were to examine the relationship between gelatinization/pasting properties and morphology of starch cooks, determine how the retrogradation properties are affected by chain-length distribution, and use a novel sensory approach to assess freeze-thaw stability of starch pastes. Waxy potato starch had a greater degree of granule swelling, higher paste viscosities, and better paste clarity than waxy starches from maize, wheat, rice, and tapioca. Waxy starches typically had greater paste viscosities than their normal counterparts, but the exception was potato starches. Waxy potato starch, which had no amylose, had lower paste viscosity than normal potato starch. Both waxy rice and waxy tapioca starches had less retrogradation tendency, which was closely related to the higher proportion of chains with DP 6–11 and the lower proportion of chains with DP 12–24. The sensory evaluation in this study allowed for an easier assessment of water separation as compared to the conventional centrifuge methods. Waxy maize and waxy potato starches had noticeable water separation from the paste after 1–2 freeze-thaw cycles, whereas both waxy rice and waxy tapioca starches could survive 6 freeze-thaw cycles without apparent syneresis. Waxy wheat, waxy rice and waxy tapioca starches are potential starting materials from which clean-label functional starches may be produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agelatinization 3aglutinous rice 3ahydrocolloids 3apasting properties 3apotato starch 3aretrogradation 3asensory evaluation 3atapioca 3aviscosity 3awaxy corn 3awheat 0aWaxy starch 0aFreeze-thaw stability 0aChain-length distribution 0aRetrogradation1 aLiu, Weichang1 aWhaley, Judith K.1 aShi, Yong-Cheng0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Sept., v. 94 p.238-254dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017100169300001600340520130500356592002801661650002001689650002001709650001601729650001701745650001101762650001901773650002401792650001601816651001201832700001701844700001901861700002301880773008601903856008501989852000902074655001202083IND60084476820221121235627.0141101e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008447682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarz, Nina10aRelationship of land surface and air temperatures and its implications for quantifying urban heat island indicators—An application for the city of Leipzig (Germany)  ap. 693-704.  aUrban heat islands (UHIs) describe the phenomenon of altered temperatures that occur in urban areas when compared to their rural surroundings. UHIs influence human well-being, human health and the city as an ecological niche. UHIs can be quantified with meteorological ground measurements of air temperatures or with remotely sensed land surface temperatures (surface urban heat island). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages and are rarely combined. Further, within these approaches, different indicators for quantifying the UHIs are used. In this methodological study, we (1) combined data on land surface and air temperatures, (2) enriched the debate by suggesting the application of indicators for the two distinct data sets and (3) systematically quantified indicators of all approaches for the city of Leipzig, Germany. A relationship between the land surface and air temperatures was established. However, the results for the single indicators showed that the absolute values of the detected UHI in Leipzig depend on the selected indicator and the data set used. The main conclusion for future studies on UHIs is to use several UHI indicators in parallel to acknowledge the uncertainty of measuring the UHI using a single indicator and either ground measurements or remote sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3adata collection 3aheat island 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aremote sensing 3asurface temperature 3auncertainty 3aGermany1 aSchlink, Uwe1 aFranck, Ulrich1 aGrossmann, Katrin,0 tEcological indicators.g2012 July, v. 18 p.693-704dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01995naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011400174300001600288520110600304592002801410650001101438650001301449650001701462651001901479700001801498773011101516856008101627852000901708655001201717IND60438749520221121004315.0151023e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043874952DNAL7 a10.1007/s00334-006-0040-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeen, Marijke van der,12aA re-analysis of agricultural production and consumption: implications for understanding the British Iron Age  ap. 217-228.  aPatterning in the carbonized seed assemblages from Iron Age sites in Britain has led to the development of several explanatory models. The most influential of these, by Martin Jones, proposed that grain-rich assemblages represent producer sites and weed-/chaff-rich assemblages consumer sites. The assumptions underlying this model and the method of constructing the diagrams are discussed and a new approach is put forward, stressing the need for appropriate levels of analysis and interpretation. It is concluded that a predominance of grain-rich samples is far more likely to be an indicator of the scale of production and consumption, than a means of distinguishing between the two. A review of the evidence from Iron Age Britain indicates that grain-rich site assemblages primarily occur in the south of the country, and frequently co-occur with pits, used for the storage of surplus grain. Moreover, such pits are concentrated in hillforts. It is proposed that the grain stored in such pits may have been used in large communal feasts and that the hillforts functioned as locations for feasting.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3asampling 3astored grain 3aUnited Kingdom1 aJones, Glynis0 tVegetation history and archaeobotany.g2006 June, v. 15, no. 3 p.217-228dSpringer-Verlagx0939-63147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-006-0040-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04393naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132024004200167040001800209100002300227245012400250500002200374500001500396506007600411506003100487520240100518592002802919596008302947506003703030650001903067650001703086650002203103650001103125650001903136650001003155650003203165650001003197650002103207650001503228650001203243650001903255650001203274650001903286650002103305650002103326650001403347650001703361651001303378651001203391653003203403653001903435653002303454653002503477653001503502653003203517700002203549700001803571773007503589856008203664852000903746655001203755IND60569023420221207082936.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056902342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.0062chorus7 a10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.0062doi7 a10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.0062chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGudex-Cross, David10aEnhanced forest cover mapping using spectral unmixing and object-based classification of multi-temporal Landsat imagery  aPre-press version  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aSpatially-explicit tree species distribution maps are increasingly valuable to forest managers and researchers in light of the effects of climate change and invasive pests on forest resources. Traditional forest classifications are limited to broad classes of forest types with variable accuracy. Advanced remote sensing techniques, such as spectral unmixing and object-based image analysis, offer novel forest mapping approaches by quantifying proportional species composition at the pixel level and utilizing ancillary environmental data for forest classifications. This is particularly useful in the Northeastern region of the United States where species composition is often mixed.Here we employed a hierarchical forest mapping approach using spectral unmixing of multi-temporal Landsat imagery to quantify percent basal area for ten common tree species/genera across northern New York and Vermont. Basal area maps were then refined using an object-based ruleset to produce a thematic forest classification.Validation with 50 field inventory plots covering a range of species compositions indicated that the quality of percent basal area mapping largely reflected the number of “pure” (>80% BA) endmember plots available for calibration, with more common species mapped at a higher accuracy (i.e. Acer saccharum, adj. r2=0.44, compared to Populus sp., adj. r2=0.24). The resulting thematic forest classification mapped 15 forest classes (nine species/genus level and six common species assemblages) with overall accuracy=42%, KHAT=33%, fuzzy accuracy=86% at the pixel level, and 38%, KHAT=29%, fuzzy accuracy=84% at the object level.Using the validation plots to compare existing forest classification products, this hierarchical approach provided more class detail (11 represented classes) and higher accuracy than the National Forest Type Map (six represented classes, overall accuracy 18%, fuzzy accuracy 70%), LANDFIRE (five represented classes, overall accuracy 28%, fuzzy accuracy 80%) and National Land Cover Database (three represented classes, overall accuracy=56%).These results show that more detailed and accurate forest mapping is possible using a combination of multi-temporal imagery, spectral unmixing, and rule-based classification techniques. Improved large-scale forest mapping has important implications for natural resource management and other modeling applications.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aimage analysis 3aforest types 3aspecies diversity 3amodels 3aclimate change 3atrees 3anatural resource management 3apests 3aforest inventory 3aland cover 3aLandsat 3aremote sensing 3aPopulus 3aAcer saccharum 3astand basal area 3aforest resources 3adatabases 3abiogeography 3aNew York 3aVermont 0aHierarchical classification 0aRemote sensing 0aBasal area mapping 0aBiophysical modeling 0abasal area 0aObject-based image analysis1 aPontius, Jennifer1 aAdams, Alison0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006200140245006000202300001600262500001100278520128100289592002801570650001601598650002701614650001201641650001901653650000901672650001301681650001601694650001301710650002401723651001101747700002201758700002301780773012901803856007501932852000902007655001202016IND60787153120221121023820.0220807e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715312DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.216492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiskopf, Sarah R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5933-819110aClimate change effects on deer and moose in the Midwest  ap. 769-781.  aREVIEW  aClimate change is an increasing concern for wildlife managers across the United States and Canada. Because climate change may alter populations and harvest dynamics of key species in the region, midwestern states have identified the effects of climate change on ungulates as a priority research area. We conducted a literature review of projected climate change in the Midwest and the potential effects on white‐tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces). Warmer temperatures and decreasing snowpack in the region favor survival of white‐tailed deer. In contrast, moose may become physiologically stressed in response to warming, and increasing deer populations spreading disease will exacerbate the problem. Although there is some uncertainty about exactly how the climate will change, and to what degree, robust projections suggest that deer populations will increase in response to climate change and moose populations will decrease. Managers can begin preparing for these changes by proactively creating management plans that take this into account. Published 2019.

Phenols are becoming increasingly important particularly because of their beneficial effects on health. OBJECTIVE: To provide a faithful calibration model for the simultaneous determination and quantification of phenolic acids, as salicylic, vanillic, p‐hydroxybenzoic acids, eugenol and thymol in different extracts of medicinal plants, a comparative study was made between two methods of infrared measurements based on attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and transmission. METHODS: Characteristic absorbance peak heights of mid‐infrared spectra of individual phenolic acids were measured for the compounds. For partial least squares regression (PLS‐R) calibration mixtures of phenolic acids, wavenumber ranges, spectra pretreatment and number of latent variables, were assayed to improve the prediction capability of models using different spectral preprocessing techniques after mean centring of infrared data. Plant extracts were prepared by using water/methanol and ethanolic extraction solvents followed by Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR)‐spectrometry analysis. The concentrations of phenolic compounds contained in the extracts were obtained by using the best models selected of the PLS calibration. RESULTS: PLS‐ATR‐mid‐infrared (MIR) measurement provided the most accurate results and offers a good methodology for the determination of phenolic acids. The analysis showed that the rate of phenolic acids and monoterpenic phenols in extracts of medicinal plants is in the same range obtained with the Folin–Ciocalteu method, which confirm that the developed method using PLS is therefore, highly specific and selective. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous direct quantification of various phenolic acids in different plant extracts was possible with a fast and simple methodology based on PLS‐ATR‐FTIR analysis.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Research Foundation (DGRSDT)  aB00LO1UN090120180001‐AlgeriacPRFU  aB00LO1UN090120180001‐AlgeriacNational Research Foundation (DGRSDT) and PRFU 3aabsorbance 3acalibration 3acomparative study 3aeugenol 3amethanol 3amodels 3aphytochemicals 3aprediction 3areflectance 3asecondary metabolites 3athymol1 aBouzidi, Naima1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6702-319X1 aDaghbouche, Yasmina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8022-23291 aGarrigues, Salvador1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5461-75891 aGuardia, Miguel de la,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9982-16631 aEl Hattab, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0926-382X0 tPhytochemical analysis.g2021 Apr., v. 32, no. 2 p.206-221dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.29743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01697naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013400159300001800293500001400311520040800325592002800733650002500761650001800786650001500804650001200819650002200831653001500853653002700868653001900895653001800914700001900932700001800951700002200969700001900991700002101010773018501031856007401216852000901290655001201299IND60692192720221122060801.0200502e20120823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069219272DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1202842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Hiroki,10aImmobilization of a Thermostable Cellobiose 2-Epimerase from Rhodothermus marinus JCM9785 and Continuous Production of Epilactose  ap. 1584-1587.  aNAL-light  aCellobiose 2-epimerase (CE) efficiently forms epilactose which has several beneficial biological functions.

Samples for pollen analysis and macroremains, including seed/fruit and wood/charcoal records, were collected from stratigraphic sequences and occupation levels during the excavations 1996–2001. The results permitted the reconstruction of the main characteristics of the landscape which at the onset of the Terramara rapidly passed from a natural, more forested landscape with mixed oak wood and conifers to a more open and anthropic landscape characterised by cereal fields, pastures and meadows. People felled oaks and other trees such as Populus/Salix and Fraxinus to make piles or walls for houses. Wood from these species was also recorded as charcoal in the hearths. Palynological and carpological data show that the inhabitants of the Terramara largely founded their economy on cereals (mainly Triticum aestivum/durum, T. dicoccum and Hordeum vulgare). They also grew a few legumes (Vicia faba var. minor, Vicia sp. and Lens culinaris). There was also grazing by domestic animals, mainly ovicaprines but also pigs and cattle, and these were fed exploiting wild plants such as Carpinus. In the paper the four main steps of the history of the Terramara are described (before the Terramara, the onset, the Terramara phase, the decline) during which both human influence and climatic changes were important. At the onset of the Terramara (around 1600 B.C.) a warm and possibly dry phase occurred. The intense use of the territory and a climatic deterioration at around 1300 B.C. might have triggered the decline of the Terramara di Montale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpinus 3aFraxinus 3aHordeum vulgare 3aLens culinaris 3aPopulus 3aQuercus 3aSalix 3aTriticum aestivum 3aVicia faba 3acattle 3acharcoal 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3adurum wheat 3agrazing 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3alegumes 3ameadows 3apalynology 3apastures 3apeople 3apollen 3asampling 3aswine 3atrees 3awild plants 3awood 3aItaly1 aAccorsi, Carla Alberta1 aBandini Mazzanti, Marta,1 aBosi, Giovanna1 aCardarelli, Andrea1 aLabate, Donato1 aMarchesini, Marco1 aGrandi, Giuliana Trevisan0 tVegetation history and archaeobotany.g2006 Nov., v. 16, no. 1 p.43-60dSpringer-Verlagx0939-63147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-006-0034-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04087naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010200163500002200265520254200287592002802829650002902857650001102886650001702897650002002914650001502934650002702949650001902976650001902995650002103014650001103035650001503046650001603061650000903077650001903086650002603105650001403131650001503145650002503160651001203185653003403197653003403231653004003265653002203305653001203327653001503339700001303354700001303367773007503380856008103455852000903536655001203545IND60569023720221122222632.0170628s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056902372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalia, A.C.12aA Copernicus downstream-service for the nationwide monitoring of surface displacements in Germany  aPre-press version  aAdvanced interferometric SAR processing techniques (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry, Small Baseline Subset) are able to detect and monitor various surface displacements caused by e.g. gravitative mass movement, subrosion, groundwater extraction, fluid injection, natural gas extraction. These processes can e.g. cause damage to buildings and infrastructure, affect ecosystems and agriculture or affect the economic use of the geological underground by influencing the hydrogeological setting. Despite the maturity and operational readiness of the PSI technology it is rarely used in operational workflows of the German user community (e.g. from responsible authorities).In order to support the operational use of this technique a “Ground Motion Service Germany” has been designed by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) in collaboration with the user community, land surveying agencies, SME and research institutions. A major outcome of this collaboration is the user request regarding a PSI-WAP (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry Wide-Area-Product) dataset of the entire nation (approx. 360,000km2) based on Sentinel-1 data. For this reason the PSI mapping coverage is increased by mosaicking PSI data products from adjacent SAR data stacks. Several case studies has been performed to demonstrate the design of the service. Within this paper one case study regarding the PSI-WAP technique and the calibration/validation scheme is presented.The pilot study is focusing on the built up of an officially approved PSI-WAP dataset. The study area covers an area of >30,000km2 and is located in the Northwest German Basin. This is the first time a PSI-WAP analysis is performed in this area. Several natural processes (e.g. compaction of marine sediments, peat growth/shrinkage) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. natural gas extraction, rock salt mining) are causing surface displacements in the study area. The PSI-WAP analysis is based on six adjacent ERS-1/-2 data stacks covering the timespan from 1992 until 2001. Each data stack consists of 49 to 73 acquisitions. A comparison of the PSI results with thematic data (e.g. cumulated volume of extracted natural gas and location of natural gas fields) indicates that a part of the detected land subsidence is caused by natural gas extraction.To summarize, this paper shows i) the design of the “Ground Motion Service Germany” and ii) a pilot study to exemplarily demonstrate a PSI-WAP, the calibration/validation scheme and value-added-products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3agroundwater extraction 3ainterferometry 3aland surveying 3amarine sediments 3amining 3amonitoring 3anatural gas 3apeat 3aremote sensing 3aresearch institutions 3ashrinkage 3asubsidence 3avalue-added products 3aGermany 0aCopernicus downstream-service 0aGround Motion Service Germany 0aPersistent Scatterer Interferometry 0aWide-Area-Product 0aERS-1/2 0aSentinel-11 aFrei, M.1 aLege, T.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009800167300001600265520156900281592002801850650001201878650001201890650001601902650002001918650001201938650001501950650001501965650005001980650004302030650002402073650001902097650001802116651001702134700001702151700002402168700002102192700001902213700001702232773008602249856008502335852000902420655001202429IND60084477420221122013230.0141101e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008447742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Wei10aIntegration of multi-sensor data to assess grassland dynamics in a Yellow River sub-watershed  ap. 163-170.  aGrasslands form the dominant land cover in the upper reaches of the Yellow River and provide a reliable indicator by being strongly correlated with regional terrestrial ecological status. Remote sensing can provide information useful for vegetation quality assessments, but no single sensor can meet the needs for the high temporal–spatial resolution required for such assessments on a watershed scale. To observe long-term grassland dynamics in the Longliu Watershed located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images were integrated to obtain Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. The MODIS images were used to identify patterns of monthly variation. With the temporal dynamics of NDVI provided by the MODIS images, an exponential regression model was obtained that described the relationship between Julian day and NDVI. Four time-series data sets from multi-spectral sensors were constructed to obtain regional grassland NDVI information from 1977 to 2006 in the Longliu Watershed. Using the daily NDVI correlation coefficient, NDVI values for different days were obtained from Landsat series images, standardised to the same day and integrated into TM format by using NDVI coefficients between the four different sensors. Thus, the NDVI data obtained from multi-sensors on different days were integrated into a comparable format. A regression analysis correlating the NDVI data from two sensors with fresh grass biomass showed that the integration procedure was reliable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aland cover 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asubwatersheds 3aYellow River1 aHao, FangHua1 aSkidmore, Andrew K.1 aGroen, Thomas A.1 aToxopeus, A.G.1 aWang, Tiejun0 tEcological indicators.g2012 July, v. 18 p.163-170dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245007300172300001400245520157000259592002801829650001401857650001201871650002001883650001001903650002401913650001801937650001401955650001401969653001101983653001901994653001902013653001402032653001302046700002602059700002202085773013002107856008402237852000902321655001202330IND60539625520221119222416.0190318e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053962552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2014.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavender, James T.10aMeso-predators: A confounding variable in consumer exclusion studies  ap. 26-33.  aLarge consumers are important in determining community structure and have been extensively researched. The impact of predation on hard-substrate marine invertebrate communities tends to be mixed. Numerous exclusion studies fail to incorporate appropriate procedural controls or account for meso-predators. An experimental exclusion study was performed to investigate the effects of large predators on the development of hard-substrate invertebrate assemblages, whilst simultaneously quantifying changes in the abundances of meso-predators. Settlement plates were deployed subtidally and were either caged (to exclude large predators), placed in cage controls or left exposed to predation. Assemblages were collected and censused after 9, 14 and 19weeks. The overall structure of the communities differed due to predation, and this effect was consistent through time. Encrusting bryozoans and hydroids occupied more space on exposed surfaces. Amphipod tube cover was greater in caged treatments, with the magnitude of the difference increasing through time, whilst solitary ascidian cover was greater on caged treatments in week 19 only. Meso-predators varied in their responses to large predators, with whelks more abundant in the absence of predators, whereas flatworm abundance was greater where predators were present. Our study demonstrated that strong effects of predators on particular taxa was able to alter the overall community composition, with the cascading effects of large predators on meso-predator abundances potentially contributing to this outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aBryozoa 3aPlatyhelminthes 3acages 3acommunity structure 3ainvertebrates 3apredation 3apredators 0aCaging 0aHard-substrate 0aMeso-predators 0aPredation 0aSubtidal1 aDafforn, Katherine A.1 aJohnston, Emma L.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 July, v. 456 p.26-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245006000167300001600227500002000243520184000263592002802103650002402131650001102155650002702166650001102193650001802204650001602222650001202238650001302250650002402263650001102287700002302298700002502321773012902346856007502475852000902550655001202559IND60787153520221120120459.0220807e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715352DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.216552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerhune, Theron M., II10aNorthern Bobwhite Chick Survival and Effects of Weather  ap. 963-974.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aReliable vital rates for all life stages are necessary to identify limiting factors in wildlife populations and inform sound wildlife management. The difficulty associated with capturing and tagging precocial young, such as northern bobwhite chicks (Colinus virginianus), and linking variation in recruitment to ecological conditions has contributed to significant knowledge gaps in their population ecology. During 1999–2017, we captured and patagial‐tagged ≤12‐day‐old bobwhite chicks (n = 3,576) and estimated their survival from time of capture (Jun–Sep) to fall and winter (Nov and Jan) recapture and winter (Feb) recovery. We used Burnham's model implemented in Program MARK to integrate mark‐recapture and dead‐recovery (via harvest) data to estimate survival for the 19‐year study. By including weather covariates, we also evaluated explicit hypotheses related to temperature and precipitation effects on chick survival. We found inter‐annual, intra‐annual, and intra‐seasonal variation in chick survival with an average annual daily survival estimate of 0.9887 (95% CI = 0.9321, 0.9918). Precipitation amount and number of precipitation (>0.635 cm) events during the first 4 weeks post‐tagging decreased the daily survival rate of chicks curvilinearly. Average minimum daily temperature and maximum daily temperature effects on survival were negligible, but an interaction between minimum temperature and cumulative precipitation during the first 14 days post‐tagging affected survival. We recommend population modelers incorporate intra‐ and inter‐annual variation in chick survival to improve predictions. Observed variation in chick survival rates portends a significant opportunity to improve population management for bobwhites and other game birds. © 2019 The Wildlife Society  aPublisher supplied data 3aColinus virginianus 3achicks 3amark-recapture studies 3amodels 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3aweather 3awildlife 3awildlife management 3awinter1 aPalmer, William E.1 aWellendorf, Shane D.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 May, v. 83, no. 4 p.963-974dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.216553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009900156300001800255500001900273520112500292592002801417650002401445650001201469650001801481650001601499650002401515650002001539650001601559650002001575650001601595650002801611650003601639650001101675650001001686650001001696650002101706653004501727653000801772700002101780700002401801700001601825700002201841700002501863773018601888856007402074852000902148655001202157IND60692193020221122060807.0200502e20121123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069219302DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1202942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHAN, Kyu-Ho10aJapanese Butterbur (Petasites japonicus) Leaves Increase Hepatic Oxidative Stress in Male Rats  ap. 2026-2031.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe investigated the adverse effects of Japanese butterbur leaves (Petasites japonicus, Compositae) in male F344/DuCrj rats. The rats were fed a control diet or a treatment diet containing 5% butterbur leaf powder for 4 weeks. No differences were observed in body weight gain, food intake or feed efficiency between treatments, but relative liver weight in the butterbur group was significantly higher than that of the control group. In addition, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and glutathione levels in the serum and liver of the butterbur group were higher than those of the control group. Hepatic glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities and mRNA expression in the butterbur leaf group were higher than in the control group. Furthermore, hepatic cytochrome 2E1 mRNA expression was higher than in the control group. In vitro, an acetone extract of the butterbur leaf powder showed the strongest increase in TBARs level in a hepatic homogenate through 4 d. Our findings suggest that feeding 5% butterbur leaf powder to rats can cause adverse effects by increasing oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPetasites japonicus 3aacetone 3abiotechnology 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3afeed conversion 3afood intake 3agene expression 3aglutathione 3aglutathione transferase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aleaves 3aliver 3amales 3aoxidative stress 0aJapanese butterbur (Petasites japonicus) 0arat1 aSEKIKAWA, Mitsuo1 aSHIMADA, Ken-ichiro1 aLEE, Chi-Ho1 aHashimoto, Naoto,1 aFUKUSHIMA, Michihiro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2012 Nov. 23, v. 76, no. 11 p.2026-2031dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.1202943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245014700196500002000343520140900363592002801772596013501800596007801935650001002013650002502023650001402048650002202062650001202084650002202096650002402118650002002142650002202162650001402184700001302198700001702211700001602228700001602244773014402260856007502404852000902479655001202488IND60759843420221120102506.0211214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075984342DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.160872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Yangbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8767-330110aAntioxidant activity and rheological properties of the polysaccharides isolated from Ribes stenocarpum maxim with different extraction methods  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe purpose of the present study is to illustrate the effects of extraction methods on the antioxidant activity and rheological properties of polysaccharides isolated from Ribes stenocarpum Maxim (RPs). RPs were extracted by ultrasonic‐assisted extraction (RPs‐1), alkaline extraction (RPs‐2), acid extraction (RPs‐3), microwave‐assisted extraction (RPs‐4), and three‐phase separation (RPs‐5). The results showed that RPs‐1, RPs‐2, RPs‐3, RPs‐4, and RPs‐5 are acidic heteropolysaccharides with glucose, arabinose, and galacturonic acid as the main chain units and absence of triple‐helix structure. Of them, RPs‐3 possess the highest uronic acid content, best thermal stability, and strongest DPPH, ABTS, and hydroxyl radical scavenging abilities. Rheological properties showed that the above‐mentioned polysaccharides are non‐Newtonian fluids and own the similar shear thinning properties. RPs‐3 represent the highest apparent viscosity and better stability in the over‐acid or over‐alkali environment. The above results indicated that the acid extraction could serve as the most favorable extraction method for RPs. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: A novel polysaccharide was isolated from Ribes stenocarpum Maxim by acid extraction, showing a stronger antioxidant activity and excellent rheological properties, which has a good application prospect in food processing.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017‐ZZ‐07cScientific Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Plateau Ecology and Agriculture of Qinghai University of China  a2016‐ZJ‐938QcNatural Science Foundation of Qinghai Province of China 3aRibes 3aantioxidant activity 3aarabinose 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amicrowave treatment 3apolysaccharides 3athermal stability 3aviscosity1 aYe, Ying1 aCai, Tingxiu1 aLiu, Yaoyao1 aHan, Lijuan0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.e16087-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.160873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03793naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245008200163300001600245500001900261520169200280592002801972650001402000650001802014650001602032650002302048650001302071650001002084650001302094650001102107650002002118650001802138650002002156650000902176650003702185650001302222650002002235650001302255650001902268650001702287650001002304653000902314653002202323653002802345653001302373653000802386653000802394653000802402653002402410653001002434653000802444653000802452653000802460653001102468653000902479653000802488653000902496653000902505653000702514653000802521653001302529653000802542653000702550653001102557653001002568700001302578700001902591700001602610700001802626700001702644700001802661700001802679700001602697773014602713856008302859852000902942655001202951IND60672123820221118052549.0191214e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067212382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Ming10aInhibition of core fucosylation limits progression of diabetic kidney disease  ap. 612-618.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFUT8-mediated core fucosylation, which transfers a fucose residue from GDP-fucose to core-GlcNAc of the N-linked type glycoproteins, is crucial for signaling receptors function. Core fucosylation is involved in various biological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and immune regulation. Our previous studies demonstrated that inhibiting core fucosylation prevented renal interstitial fibrosis of UUO murine models, but its role in the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the protective effects and molecular mechanisms during the progress of DKD by inhibiting core fucosylation in vivo.Core fucosylation was examined in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model. Then a new Fut8 mutation mouse model in which exon 7 of Fut8 gene is deleted was constructed for diabetes induction. Metabolic and renal parameters were measured. Renal structure, fibrosis, and podocyte injury were assessed, and underlying mechanisms were investigated.The levels of fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, kidney-weight-to- body-weight (KW/BW) and urine albumin-to-creatinine (ACR) were increased at 16 weeks post injection. KW/BW and urine ACR were decreased significantly by inhibiting core fucosylation. The renal pathology, fibrosis, and podocyte injury were mitigated significantly by inhibiting core fucosylation. The protective effects of inhibiting core fucosylation were mediated by downregulated of the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).Our results indicate that FUT8-based treatment might be a promising intervention strategy in therapeutic paradigm of DKD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acell proliferation 3adiabetes 3aexons 3afibrosis 3afucose 3aglycohemoglobin 3aglycoproteins 3akidney diseases 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutation 3aphosphorylation 3aresearch 3astreptozotocin 3atherapeutics 3aurine 0aFUT8 0aCore fucosylation 0aDiabetic kidney disease 0aPodocyte 0aDKD 0aUUO 0aSTZ 0aglycated hemoglobin 0aKW/BW 0aACR 0aERK 0aECM 0aTGF-β 0aPDGF 0aEGF 0aFUT8 0aHPLC 0aWT 0aHET 0aknockout 0aLCA 0aFN 0aα-SMA 0aGAPDH1 aKang, Le1 aWang, Xiaolang1 aGuo, Xianan1 aWang, Weidong1 aQin, Biaojie1 aDu, Xiangning1 aTang, Qingzhu1 aLin, Hongli0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 520, no. 3 p.612-618dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010300167300001600270520181200286592002802098650001602126650001102142650001402153650000902167650002202176650001402198650002302212650001802235650001402253650001202267650001502279650001702294650002002311651001002331651001802341651001502359653001802374653000902392653002002401653001902421700001602440700001902456700001902475700001602494700001802510700001302528700001702541773010702558856008502665852000902750655001202759IND60635126320221116220700.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063512632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.01.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaoxia10aCharacteristics and retention of microplastics in the digestive tracts of fish from the Yellow Sea  ap. 878-885.  aMicroplastics (MPs) are a major global issue in the marine environment, and fish inhabiting coastal environments are susceptible to the ingestion of MPs. Knowledge regarding MPs in fish along the coast of China is very limited. In this study, the characteristics and retention of MPs in 19 fish species in the Yellow Sea were systematically studied. MPs were detected in all of the fish species sampled. Overall, 34% (444/1320) of fish retained plastic, and 552 pieces of plastic were removed from these fish, among which 546 pieces (99%) were microplastics (i.e., <5 mm). Three MP types were found: fibers, pellets, and fragments, which accounted for 67%, 22%, and 11% of the total, respectively. MP length ranged from 16 to 4740 μm, with an average of 941 ± 43 μm. The average lengths of the fibers, pellets, and fragments were 1233 ± 57 μm, 263 ± 24 μm, and 503 ± 91 μm, respectively, and MP length was positively correlated with fish length. Fourteen polymers were detected, with organic oxidation polymers (40%) being most abundant, followed by polyethylene (22%) and polyamide (11%). The retention of MPs in fish was affected by sampling areas and fish weight. Fish collected from the area adjacent to the Bohai Sea and the Yangtze River Estuary were found to possess higher levels of MPs than those collected from the center of the Yellow Sea. The average MP/fish for fish with plastic was negatively correlated with fish body weight. The retention of MPs may affect the quality and quantity of fishery resources in the Yellow Sea, especially the commercial fish. It is suggested that future studies be conducted to determine the ingestion rate, retention time, and egestion rate of MPs by fish to enable a rational risk assessment by combining the field results.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3afish 3afishery resources 3aingestion 3amarine environment 3amicroplastics 3aoxidation 3apellets 3apolyamides 3apolyethylene 3arisk assessment 3aChina 3aYangtze River 3aYellow Sea 0aMicroplastics 0aFish 0aDigestive tract 0aThe Yellow Sea1 aLi, Qingjie1 aShi, Yongqiang1 aZhao, Yongfang1 aZheng, Shan1 aLiang, Junhua1 aLiu, Tao1 aTian, Ziyang0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 June, v. 249 p.878-885dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.01.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245010900172300002000281520155200301592002801853650001501881650001101896650002601907650001101933650001701944650001101961650001101972650002201983650001602005650001302021650001402034650001602048700005502064700006202119700005702181700005602238700005702294773013802351856008002489852000902569655001202578IND60606177020221122003841.0180724e20180621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060617702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b036812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonabi Naghadeh, Sara10aPhotophysical Properties and Improved Stability of Organic–Inorganic Perovskite by Surface Passivation  ap. 15799-15818.  aOrganic–inorganic perovskite materials in the form of nanocrystals and thin films have received enormous attention recently because of their unique optoelectronic properties such as high absorption coefficient, narrow and tunable emission bandwidth, high photoluminescence quantum yield, long exciton lifetime, and balanced charge transport properties. These properties have found applications in a number of important fields, including photovoltaic solar cells, light-emitting diodes, photodetectors, sensors, and lasers. However, the stability of the materials and devices is strongly affected by several factors such as water moisture, light, oxygen, temperature, solvent, and other materials in contact such as metal oxides used in devices. Defects, particularly those related to surface states, play a critical role in the stability as well as the performance of the perovskites. Various surface modification and defect passivation strategies have been developed to enhance stability and improve performance. We review some recent progress in the development of synthetic approaches to produce high-quality nanostructured and bulk film perovskites with controlled properties and functionalities. We also highlight the degradation mechanism and surface passivation approaches to address the issue of instability. To help gain deeper fundamental insight into mechanisms behind degradation and surface passivation, relevant properties, including structural, optical, electronic, and dynamic, are discussed and illustrated with proposed models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3alasers 3alight emitting diodes 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3aoxides 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3asolar cells 3asolvents 3asynthesis 3atemperature1 aLuo, Binbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9652-79981 aAbdelmageed, Ghada1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4429-09971 aPu, Ying-Chih1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0685-72001 aZhang, Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5281-59791 aZhang, Jin Z.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3437-912X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 June 21, v. 122, no. 28 p.15799-15818dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b036813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013100173300001400304520138400318592002801702650001901730650000901749650002601758650001301784650001201797650002001809650001801829650001701847650001501864650002501879650001601904650001801920650001401938650001401952650002201966650000901988650001801997650001302015651001002028653001702038653002002055653001802075653002102093700002202114700003002136700002102166700001602187700001702203700002002220700002602240773012602266856008502392852000902477655001202486IND60125820520221118044305.0150428e20150102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012582052DNAL7 a10.1080/22311866.2015.10093852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraveen Kumar, P.10aScreening of Actinomycetes for Enzyme and Antimicrobial Activities from the Soil Sediments of Northern Tamil Nadu, South India  ap. 58-70.  aThe present study involves the screening of actinomycetes for enzymes and antimicrobial activities from the soil sediments of Northern Tamil Nadu, South India. Actinomycetes from the soil samples were isolated by pour plate technique on Actinomycetes Isolation Agar. Morphological characteristics of the isolates were studied based on microscopic appearance. Actinomycetes isolates was screened for the production of different extracellular enzymes like amylase, protease and lipase. In the screening for enzyme activity, the actinomycetes strains showed amylase activity, protease activity and lipase activity. Preliminary screening for antimicrobial activity of actinomycetes isolates were performed by cross streak plate method. Active form of 82 isolated strains showed activity against one or more bacteria and exhibited potential antifungal activity. The active strain was subjected to cultural, molecular identification and optimization of fermentation medium, solvent extraction and antimicrobial activity for crude extracts. Based on the primary antimicrobial proficiency, Loyola AR1 strain was selected for further studies. Ethyl acetate extract showed good antimicrobial activity when compared to butanol extract. The partial 16s rRNA sequence analysis of Loyola AR1 isolate identified to be Streptomyces sp. and the sequence was submitted to the Gene Bank (HM163569).  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aagar 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3abutanol 3aenzyme activity 3aethyl acetate 3afermentation 3agene banks 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteinases 3aribosomal RNA 3ascreening 3asediments 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3asolvents 3aIndia 0aSoil samples 0aEnzyme activity 0aAntimicrobial 0aStreptomyces sp.1 aPreetam Raj, J.P.1 aNimal Christhudas, I.V.S.1 aSagaya Jansi, R.1 aMurugan, N.1 aAgastian, P.1 aArunachalam, C.1 aAli Alharbi, Sulaiman0 tJournal of Biologically Active Products from Nature.g2015 Jan. 2, v. 5, no. 1 p.58-70dTaylor & Francisx2231-18747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22311866.2015.10093853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01822naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005600173300001400229520075000243592002800993650002101021650001201042650001401054650001701068650001701085653000801102653000801110653000801118653000801126653000801134653001601142653001501158653002101173653002001194700002001214773009501234856008601329852000901415655001201424IND60609984420221123022855.0181012e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060998442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFesselmeyer, Eric10aNeighborhood segregation and black entrepreneurship  ap. 88-91.  aWe examine the causal effect of neighborhood segregation on black entrepreneurship. We address neighborhood sorting by analyzing city averages and omitted variable bias by instrumenting for segregation using historical railroad configurations. We find that segregation has a significant positive effect: a 10 percentage point increase in the dissimilarity index decreases the racial gap by about 3.3 percentage points. To minimize the effect of cross-city sorting, we use a narrower sample constructed from outcomes of young adults and find a similar effect. Our findings are important because historically, entrepreneurship has been an avenue out of poverty, and entrepreneurship has been promoted as a way to decrease welfare and unemployment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aentrepreneurship 3apoverty 3arailroads 3aunemployment 3ayoung adults 0aD63 0aJ15 0aL26 0aR12 0aR30 0aSegregation 0aInequality 0aEntrepreneurship 0aSelf-employment1 aSeah, Kiat Ying0 tEconomics letters.g2017 May, v. 154 p.88-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2017.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04506naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245015100167500002000318520258900338592002802927596005402955596006103009650004403070650001503114650001803129650002103147650001603168650001603184650001803200650001003218650002303228650002803251650001203279650001703291650001403308650001703322650001303339650002403352650002003376650001503396650002103411650002203432650002103454650001403475650001803489650001603507700002703523700002703550700002503577700001903602700006703621773014403688856007503832852000903907655001203916IND60759843620221120143555.0211214e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075984362DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.160892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousefniaPasha, Hassan10aPreparation and characterization of the plasticized polylactic acid films produced by the solvent‐casting method for food packaging applications  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA strategy to overcome the brittleness and rigidity of polylactic acid (PLA)‐based materials for food packaging applications is adding a proper plasticizer in the right amount. Here, triacetin (TA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were used as plasticizers in different amounts (10, 20, and 30 wt%) to produce the plasticized PLA films by the solvent‐casting method. Tensile properties, water vapor permeability (WVP), moisture content (MC), optical properties, Fourier transform infrared absorption (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are reported. The results showed that both TA and PEG cause increasing elongation at break (Eₐb) and decreasing tensile strength (TS), where the plasticized PLA films containing 10 and 30 wt% of TA showed the highest TS (26.6 MPa) and Eₐb (81.1%), respectively. Light transmission of PLA was decreased by introducing the plasticizers, while WVP, MC, and opacity of the plasticized films were increased compared to the neat PLA. Among the plasticized films, the sample with 10 wt% of TA and PEG showed the lowest WVP (4.9 × 10⁻¹⁰ g/m s⁻¹ Pa⁻¹) and MC (5.5%), respectively. Based on the TGA, an improvement in the thermal stability of TA and PEG plasticized films compared to the neat PLA was obvious. The sample containing 10 wt% of TA (PLA‐TA10) showed the best performance for food packaging applications. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Food product packaging provides retarding deterioration, reducing microbial contamination, preserving safety, protecting quality, and extending the shelf life of packaged foods during transmission, storage, and consumption. Petroleum‐based plastic and synthetic polymers have been mainly used in food packaging due to their cheap cost and good mechanical and barrier properties. However, increasing the use of these nonbiodegradable polymers causes serious environmental and health problems. The biopolymers which are extracted from biodegradable and renewable sources are considered as suitable alternatives for petroleum‐based plastic materials. However, application of biopolymers as packaging materials has been limited due to their low mechanical properties and thermal stability. Many studies have been conducted to modify the properties of PLA‐based packaging materials to create a favorable product for the food industry. Moreover, introducing plasticizer to PLA helps to develop biocomposite materials with unique characteristics for food packaging. This article shows an improvement in the properties of the PLA‐based composites for food packaging applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a99011944cIran National Science Foundation (INSF)  a120041cUniversity of Tehran Science and Technology Park 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3abiocomposites 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3abrittleness 3afood industry 3afoods 3alight transmission 3amicrobial contamination 3aopacity 3apermeability 3apetroleum 3aplasticizers 3aplastics 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolylactic acid 3ashelf life 3atensile strength 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3atriacetin 3awater content 3awater vapor1 aMohtasebi, Seyed Saeid1 aTabatabaeekoloor, Reza1 aTaherimehr, Masoumeh1 aJavadi, Azizeh1 aSoltani Firouz, Mahmoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9155-10160 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.e16089-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.160893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009000163300001300253520142000266592002801686650001501714650001001729650003501739650002901774650000901803653002401812653002501836653001601861653001801877700002201895700001501917773012201932856008102054852000902135655001202144IND60689186720221119031838.0200420e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068918672DNAL7 a10.1080/073885505005086442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Ajay10aComposting: A Potentially Safe Process for Disposal of Genetically Modified Organisms  ap. 1-16.  aThe widespread use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) may result in the release of GMOs into the environment. The potential risks regarding their use and implementation of disposal methods, especially the possibility of novel genes from GMOs being transferred to natural organisms, need to be evaluated and better understood. There is an increasingly accepted public view that GMO products introduced into the environment should be degradable and should disappear after a limited period of time. Due to the risk of possible horizontal gene transfer, disposal methods for GMOs need to address destruction of both the organism and the genetic material. During the last two decades, we have developed a greater understanding of the biochemical, microbiological and molecular concepts of the composting process, such that maximum decomposition may be achieved in the shortest time with minimal negative impacts to the environment. The conditions created in a properly managed composting process environment may help in destroying GMOs and their genes, thereby reducing the risk of the spread of genetic material. When considering composting as a potential method for the disposal of GMOs, the establishment of controlled conditions providing an essentially homogenous environment appears to be an important requirement. An evaluation of composting as a safe option for disposal of GMOs is provided in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposting 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3arisk 0acomposting disposal 0amicrobial cell death 0afate of DNA 0agene transfer1 aBillingsley, Kate1 aWard, Owen0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 26, no. 1 p.1-16dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/073885505005086443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002300144245006600167300001600233500001500249520172000264592002801984650001202012650001802024650002402042650001502066650001502081650002502096650001902121650001802140650002002158650001502178650002502193650002802218650001502246651001502261653001702276653001802293653003002311653002102341653001902362653002602381653002602407700001902433700002002452773011802472856008202590852000902672655001202681IND4432827620221123031704.0151126e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443282762DNAL7 a10.2111/REM-D-09-00106.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilver, Whendee L.10aSoil Carbon Pools in California's Annual Grassland Ecosystems  ap. 128-136.  a2019-12-06  aRangeland ecosystems cover approximately one-third of the land area in the United States and half of the land area of California. This large land area, coupled with the propensity of grasses to allocate a considerable proportion of their photosynthate belowground, leads to high soil carbon (C) sequestration potential. Annual grasslands typical of the Mediterranean climates of the western United States differ in their life history strategies from the well-studied perennial grasslands of other regions and thus may also differ in their soil C pools and fluxes. In this study we use the literature to explore patterns in soil C storage in annual grass-dominated rangelands in California. We show that soil C is highly predictable with depth. Cumulative soil C content increased to 2––3-m depth in rangelands with a woody component and to at least 1-m depth in open rangelands. Soil C within a given depth varied widely, with C content in the top 1-m depth spanning almost 200 Mg C ·· ha⁻⁻¹ across sites. Soil C pools were not correlated with temperature or precipitation at a regional scale. The presence of woody plants increased C by an average of 40 Mg ·· ha⁻⁻¹ in the top meter of soil. Grazed annual grasslands had similar soil C content as ungrazed grassland at all depths examined, although few details on grazing management were available. Soil C pools were weakly positively correlated with clay content and peaked at intermediated levels of aboveground net primary production. Our results suggest that annual grasslands have similar soil C storage capacity as temperate perennial grasslands and offer an important resource for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannuals 3aclay fraction 3asoil organic carbon 3aperennials 3arangelands 3aprimary productivity 3aphotosynthates 3ameta-analysis 3aair temperature 3asoil depth 3acarbon sequestration 3adry matter partitioning 3agrasslands 3aCalifornia 0aoak woodland 0aprecipitation 0asoil carbon sequestration 0aannual grassland 0aclimate change 0abiogeochemical cycles 0aMediterranean climate1 aRyals, Rebecca1 aEviner, Valerie0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2010 Jan., v. 63, no. 1 p.128-136dSociety for Range Managementx1551-50287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2111%2FREM-D-09-00106.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006800138245007300206300001800279500002000297520158700317592002801904596006501932650002001997650001702017650002602034650001502060650002502075650001802100650001702118650001402135650002402149650002602173650002202199650001202221650001502233700006002248700002302308700002102331700002002352773013302372856007202505852000902577655001202586IND60616592220221122010917.0181018e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061659222DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.31192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaverková, Magdalena D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2384-620714aThe use of vegetation as a natural strategy for landfill restoration  ap. 3674-3680.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIt is well‐known that the disposal of municipal solid waste in landfills has adverse effects on the environment and human health. Restoration of closed landfills is essential to compensate for disturbances in the ecosystem, minimize negative impact on the environment, and ensure safety in further use. It was hypothesized that specific plant succession knowledge can present nature‐based solutions to restore and rehabilitate degraded ecosystems at municipal solid waste landfills. The goal of the 8‐year study was to identify restoration strategies based on vegetation succession. For the vegetation survey, we recorded the vegetation over the period 2007–2015. The study was carried out on the surface of the landfill site. We also used four mathematical models to analyze the increase of plant species over time. During the study period, 195 vascular plant species were recorded. There was a progressive change in plant communities and an increase in biodiversity. What is more, the growth prediction models show that the diversity of plant species over time at the landfill site has an increasing tendency, which has beneficial implications for landfill restoration. During the vegetation survey period, there was no evidence to suggest that the landfill site had a significant impact on the biotic composition of the environment. We can conclude that the health status of plants occurring in the landfill was good. Plants both contributed to and indicated the health of the landfill site and were found to be a convenient and natural component of landfill restoration.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic 3aadverse effects 3abiodiversity 3aecological succession 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3ahealth status 3ahuman health 3alandfills 3amathematical models 3amunicipal solid waste 3aplant communities 3asurveys 3avegetation1 aRadziemska, Maja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3526-59441 aBartoň, Stanislav1 aCerdà, Artemio,1 aKoda, Eugeniusz0 tLand degradation & development.g2018 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.3674-3680dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.31193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04142naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015200171300001600323520178000339536047602119592002802595596004802623596001702671596001602688650001902704650002102723650003102744650002502775650002602800650002102826650001302847650001702860650002702877650001602904650002002920650002702940650001902967650001202986650001002998650001903008650000903027650001403036650001403050650002103064650002503085653002103110653002303131653001703154653002803171700001303199700001603212700001803228700001903246700001703265700001303282773011403295856008603409852000903495655001203504IND60733479620221117234516.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073347962DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.18126722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lüping,10aBoletus aereus protects against acute alcohol-induced liver damage in the C57BL/6 mouse via regulating the oxidative stress-mediated NF-κB pathway  ap. 905-914.  aAlcoholic liver disease, caused by abuse and consumption of alcohol, exhibits high morbidity and mortality. Boletus aereus Bull. (Boletaceae) (BA) shows antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. To investigate the hepatoprotective effects of BA using an acute alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity mice model. The composition of BA fruit body was first systematically analyzed. Subsequently, a C57BL/6 mice model of acute alcohol-induced liver injury was established by intragastrically administration of alcohol, which was intragastrically received with BA powder at 200 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg for 2 weeks, 60 mg/kg silybin treatment was used as positive control group. By employing the pathological examination, ELISA, RT-PCR and western blot, the regulation of BA on oxidative stress signals was investigated. The LD₅₀ of BA was much higher than 4 g/kg/p.o. In acute alcohol-damaged mice, BA reduced the levels of alanine aminotransferase (>18.3%) and aspartate aminotransferase (>27.6%) in liver, increased the activity of liver alcohol dehydrogenase (>35.0%) and serum acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (>18.9%). BA increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (>13.4%), glutathione peroxidase (>11.0%) and 800 mg/kg BA strongly reduced chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (14.9%) and chitinase-3 like-1 protein (13.4%) in serum. BA reversed mRNA over-expression (>70%) and phosphor-stimulated expression (>45.0%) of an inhibitor of nuclear factor κ-B kinase (NF-κB, an inhibitor of nuclear factor κ-B α and nuclear factor κ-B in the liver. BA is effective in ameliorating alcohol-induced liver injury through regulating oxidative stress-mediated NF-κB signalling, which provides a scientific basis for further research on its clinical applications.  aThis work was supported by the Science and Technology Develop Project in Jilin Province of China under grant [No. 20191102027YY, 20200708091YY and 20200708068YY], the Special Projects of Cooperation between Jilin University and Jilin Province in China under grant [No. SXGJSF2017-1], Innovation Training Program of Zhuhai College of Jilin University under grant [No. 2018XJCQ016], and “Three levels” Talent Construction Projects in Zhuhai College of Jilin University.  aPublisher supplied data  a20191102027YYa20200708091YYa20200708068YY  aSXGJSF2017-1  a2018XJCQ016 3aBoletus aereus 3aWestern blotting 3aacetaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aalanine transaminase 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aalcohol drinking 3aalcohols 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3afruiting bodies 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatotoxicity 3aligands 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3amice 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aHepatoprotective 0aalcohol metabolism 0ainflammation 0areactive oxygen species1 aMeng, Bo1 aLi, Lanzhou1 aWang, Yanzhen1 aZhang, Yuanzhu1 aFang, Xuexun1 aWang, Di0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.905-914dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.18126723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02816naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010600165300001600271520123700287592002801524650001601552650002201568650001901590650003001609650001401639650002001653650001901673650001801692650001601710650001301726650000901739650001101748650001301759653001301772653001801785653002001803653001401823653001001837700001501847700001501862700001501877700001401892700001701906700001201923700001701935700001601952700001701968700001701985700001402002700001602016773011402032856008302146852000902229655001202238IND60569024320221119172038.0210708e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056902432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Rong H.14aThe effects of melamine with or without cyanuric acid on immune function in ovalbumin-sensitized mice  ap. 254-261.  aMelamine is commonly used in the chemical industry, and it has been found to exist on food processing equipment and utensils. Previous investigations suggested that melamine alone or its combination with cyanuric acid appears to be toxic to immune system in animals. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential effects of melamine with or without cyanuric acid on immune function in ovalbumin- sensitized mice. Our data indicated that melamine-related administration caused a significant decreasing in the content of IL-4 in mice in comparison to negative control group. Significant increasing in the content of histamine (HIS) was recorded in almost all treated groups. The co-administration of melamine and cyanuric acid with high dose (each at 16mgkg⁻¹2d⁻¹) led to a significantly lower contents of IL-10, IL-16 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in mouse serum in comparison to negative control group. Moreover, our data indicated that the number of Th1 and Th2 cells, and the ratio of Th1/Th2 spleen lymphocytes were significantly changed after treatment. Also, our results demonstrated that the profiles of both CD40 and CD40L were significantly altered in spleen lymphocytes after treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achemical industry 3achemokine CCL2 3afood processing equipment 3ahistamine 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-4 3alymphocytes 3amelamine 3amice 3aspleen 3atoxicity 0aMelamine 0aCyanuric acid 0aImmune function 0aOvalbumin 0aMouse1 aDong, Qiao1 aLi, Hua S.1 aYuan, Jing1 aLi, Xi T.1 aYin, Rong L.1 aLi, Wen1 aWang, Wen C.1 aLiu, Bao S.1 aHan, Xiao H.1 aWang, Ren F.1 aWang, Xin1 aBai, Wen L.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2017 Oct., v. 114 p.254-261dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2017.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245007800165300001800243500002000261520148200281592002801763596006801791596005801859650001201917650001201929650001301941650001101954650001501965650001801980650001701998650001702015650002202032650002102054650000902075650001202084650001202096650002602108650002602134650001102160650001402171650000902185650001102194650001602205650001402221650001202235650001302247650002702260650000902287651001002296700001702306700002402323700002102347700003002368700007702398773013302475856007202608852000902680655001202689IND60616592520221121223959.0181018e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061659252DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.30782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdumo, Benjamin Okang'10aArtisanal gold‐mining in a rural environment: Land degradation in Kenya  ap. 3285-3293.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aArtisanal gold‐mining (AGM) is one of the most important activities in the districts of Migori and Transmara (Kenya). Gold‐mining, however, is known to release vast quantities of arsenic and metals (some of which are very toxic like As, Hg, Cd, or Pb), which poses a serious threat to not only miners but also to the ecosystem and local populations. We, herein, determine the concentrations of arsenic and some heavy metals in several sample types (i.e., ore, soil, river sediment, and mine tailing) collected from the districts of Migori and Transmara. We also employ lichens and mosses as pollution bioindicators. Geostatistical tools and canonical correlation analysis were used to identify the relevant factors that affected arsenic and metal concentrations in the analysed samples. The following concentration ranges were reported in topsoil: As (1–17,250 mg kg⁻¹), Cd (0.01–15.10 mg kg⁻¹), Cu (7–9,238 mg kg⁻¹), Cr (1–214 mg kg⁻¹), Ni (5–766 mg kg⁻¹), Pb (3–1,149 mg kg⁻¹), and Zn (22–1,271 mg kg⁻¹). It was concluded that the ecosystem in both districts was highly polluted by heavy metals whereas the arsenic concentrations in topsoil were among the highest reported worldwide. The results of this study provide new evidence on the impact of AGM on the environment and may further contribute to the design of policy measures with the aim of reducing environmental and human health risks associated to AGM activities.  aPublisher supplied data  aCGL2013‐43675‐PcSpanish Ministry of Science and Innovation  cNational Council for Science and Innovation (NACOSTI) 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3aecosystems 3ageostatistics 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3aland degradation 3alead 3alichens 3amercury 3amosses and liverworts 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3apollution 3arisk 3arivers 3arural areas 3asediments 3atopsoil 3atoxicity 3atraditional technology 3azinc 3aKenya1 aNanos, Nikos1 aCarbonell, Gregoria1 aTorrijos, Manuel1 aPatel, Jayanti Purshottam1 aRodríguez Martín, José Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9158-95640 tLand degradation & development.g2018 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.3285-3293dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.30783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04563naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245006100162300001600223500002000239520335200259592002803611650002203639650001103661650001403672650001703686650001103703650001203714650002403726651001103750651001703761651001703778700002603795700002103821700002103842700002203863700002403885700001903909773012903928856007504057852000904132655001204141IND60787154320221120085539.0220807e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715432DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.216392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDooley, Joshua L.10aAge class dynamics of Canada geese in the Central Flyway  ap. 938-953.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAbundance of temperate‐nesting Canada geese (Branta canadensis) in Central Flyway east‐tier states (ND, SD, NE, KS, OK, USA) increased since the 1970s. Hunting regulations were liberalized since the mid‐1990s in these states to increase harvest and reduce abundance of local populations. Because 2 age classes, juvenile and adult, are typically classified when banding, most dead‐recovery band analyses of Canada geese have only considered 2 age classes to estimate survival and recovery probabilities, despite a delayed breeding life history. We evaluated recovery distributions and survival and recovery probabilities of Canada goose age classes (i.e., juvenile [first year], subadult [second and third year], and adult [≥fourth year]) among Central Flyway east‐tier states relative to liberalized hunting regulations during 1990–2015. We also conducted simulations and evaluated bias in parameter estimates from 2‐age‐class dead‐recovery models when a subadult age class was not modeled. Models including 3 age classes were more supported than models including only 2 age classes. Mean juvenile survival estimates among states from the top 2‐age‐class models were 9–50% greater than an equivalent 3‐age‐class model, whereas differences were less or negligible for adult survival (−4% to −1%), adult recovery (1–12%), and juvenile recovery (−3–6%). Geese were primarily recovered in the state they were banded (range among states = 59–86%), and 91% of all recoveries occurred in the Central Flyway east‐tier states. Recovery distributions of subadults were broader and more northward than adults and juveniles. Recovery estimates (Brownie parameterization) of subadults among states (x¯ = 0.091 ± 0.039 [SE] to 0.116 ± 0.029) were also generally greater than adults (0.061 ± 0.030 to 0.104 ± 0.033) and juveniles (0.049 ± 0.026 to 0.132 ± 0.041). Survival estimates of adults (0.713 ± 0.103 to 0.748 ± 0.119) and subadults (0.621 ± 0.197 to 0.801 ± 0.154) exhibited some decrease through time concurrent with liberalized harvest regulations, but survival estimate of juveniles (0.492 ± 0.093 to 0.686 ± 0.164) increased or were stable. Of the 5 Central Flyway east‐tier states, management actions to reduce local Canada goose populations were the most intensive in North Dakota and South Dakota, and these states had the greatest decrease in adult and subadult survival estimates. Our results provide some limited evidence that harvest regulations targeted at locally breeding Canada geese can affect their survival, have greatest effects when first implemented, and affect subadults from a broader spatial scale than adults and juveniles. More information is needed on how localized harvest regulations affect temperate‐nesting Canada geese from other areas, particularly subadults and molt migrants, and, conversely, how such geese affect the ability to achieve management objectives at varying spatial scales. Lastly, to minimize bias when analyzing temperate‐nesting Canada goose data, or other species with similar marking constraints and age‐class structure, consideration should be given to evaluating ≥3 age classes and using recapture data and joint live‐dead models when possible. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBranta canadensis 3aadults 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amodels 3amolting 3awildlife management 3aCanada 3aNorth Dakota 3aSouth Dakota1 aSzymanski, Michael L.1 aMurano, Rocco J.1 aVrtiska, Mark P.1 aBidrowski, Tom F.1 aRichardson, Josh L.1 aWhite, Gary C.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 May, v. 83, no. 4 p.938-953dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.216393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245010500197300001800302500002000320520180300340592002802143596004702171596005002218596004702268596003202315596003202347650002202379650001802401650002302419650002602442650001902468650001502487650001402502650001802516650001302534650001902547650002202566650002002588650001702608650002002625650001002645651001802655700002002673700006202693700002102755700002002776700005902796700005802855700001902913773011902932856007403051852000903125655001203134IND60777142320221119052811.0220514e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077714232DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.164312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuffley, Megan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1796-271910aGenomic evidence of an ancient inland temperate rainforest in the Pacific Northwest of North America  ap. 2985-3001.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe disjunct temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest of North America (PNW) are characterized by late‐successional dominant tree species Thuja plicata (western redcedar) and Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock). The demographic histories of these species, along with the PNW rainforest ecosystem in its entirety, have been heavily impacted by geological and climatic changes the PNW has experienced over the last 5 million years, including mountain orogeny and repeated Pleistocene glaciations. These environmental events have ultimately shaped the history of these species, with inland populations potentially being extirpated during the Pleistocene glaciations. Here, we collect genomic data for both species across their ranges to test multiple demographic models, each reflecting a different phylogeographical hypothesis on how the ecosystem‐dominating species may have responded to dramatic climatic change. Our results indicate that inland and coastal populations in both species diverged ~2.5 million years ago in the early Pleistocene and experienced decreases in population size during glacial cycles, with subsequent population expansion. Importantly, we found evidence for gene flow between coastal and inland populations during the mid‐Holocene. It is likely that intermittent migration in these species during this time has prevented allopatric speciation via genetic drift alone. In conclusion, our results from combining genomic data and demographic inference procedures establish that populations of the ecosystem dominants Thuja plicata and Tsuga heterophylla persisted in refugia located in both the coastal and inland regions of the PNW throughout the Pleistocene, with populations expanding and contracting in response to glacial cycles with occasional gene flow.  aPublisher supplied data  aDEB‐1457726cNational Science Foundation  aNSF EPS‐809935cNational Science Foundation  aDEB‐1457519cNational Science Foundation  aNCRR 1P20RR016448‐01cNIH  aNCRR 1P20RR016454‐01cNIH 3aPleistocene epoch 3aThuja plicata 3aTsuga heterophylla 3aallopatric speciation 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agene flow 3agenetic drift 3agenomics 3aphylogeography 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3arain forests 3arefuge habitats 3atrees 3aNorth America1 aSmith, Megan L.1 aEspíndola, Anahí1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9128-88361 aTurck, Daniel F.1 aMitchell, Niels1 aCarstens, Bryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1552-227X1 aSullivan, Jack1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0216-68671 aTank, David C.0 tMolecular ecology.g2022 May, v. 31, no. 10 p.2985-3001dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48811x0962-10837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.164313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245006800153300001800221500002000239520159000259592002801849596007401877596011301951596009002064596003302154596005902187596005902246596007902305650001102384650001702395650001602412650002102428650002102449650001502470650001702485650002002502650001502522650001902537700001502556700001902571700005602590700001702646700001602663700001502679700001302694700001902707773013302726856007202859852000902931655001202940IND60616592620221122010833.0181018e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061659262DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.30892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Junna10aAnalysis of saline groundwater infiltration into two loam soils  ap. 3795-3802.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIrrigation with saline groundwater may cause salt accumulation in the soil and even land degradation in coastal areas. The aim of this study was to reveal how the changes in groundwater salinity affect the infiltration characteristics under controlled conditions. One‐dimensional vertical infiltration experiments were conducted in uniform columns of silty clay‐loam and sandy‐loam under different salinity levels of irrigation groundwater (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 g L⁻¹ NaCl). The results showed that as groundwater salinity increased, the infiltration capacity of the silty clay‐loam increased under low salinity levels but decreased under higher salinity levels, with a turning point at the salinity of 6 g L⁻¹ NaCl. However, there were no significant differences in the infiltration capacity of the sandy‐loam under salinity levels of 1–9 g L⁻¹ NaCl, whereas a significant increase was found under 12 g L⁻¹ NaCl. The infiltration capacity of the sandy‐loam was consistently higher compared with the silty clay‐loam under different salinity levels. Under short‐term irrigation with a conventional amount of 750–900 m³ ha⁻¹, extracting groundwater with the salinity of <6 g L⁻¹ NaCl obtained higher desalination efficiency in the silty clay‐loam and resulted in less salt accumulation in the surface soil (0–20 cm). Under the same amount of irrigation with groundwater containing 1–12 g L⁻¹ NaCl, the increase of soil salt content was relatively small in the sandy‐loam and might not significantly affect crop growth.  aPublisher supplied data  c“Coastal Resources and Environmental Team for Blue‐yellow Area”  cProject of the Cultivation Plan of Superior Discipline Talent Teams of Universities in the Shandong Province  aCX(15)1005cAutonomous Innovation Project of Jiangsu Agriculture Science & Technology  aLY2015013cLudong University  a41771256cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41501309cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFC0400202cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China 3acoasts 3adesalination 3agroundwater 3airrigation rates 3aland degradation 3aloam soils 3asalt content 3asodium chloride 3asoil salts 3awater salinity1 aHe, Fuhong1 aZhang, Zhenhua1 aShao, Hongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3921-54851 aPan, Yinghua1 aYang, Runya1 aLi, Wenxue1 aLi, Peng1 aZheng, Mengzhu0 tLand degradation & development.g2018 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.3795-3802dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.30893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013300170300001600303520174500319536016902064592002802233596002002261650001302281650002102294650003102315650001902346650002002365650001302385650001102398650001202409650001002421650002302431650001902454650002502473650002602498650001202524650001702536650002502553650001702578653001602595653002202611653002302633653001502656653002602671653002902697653002302726653002602749653001702775700001802792700002202810700001602832700001802848700001902866773011402885856008602999852000903085655001203094IND60733479920221117234802.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073347992DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.18143562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGazioglu, Isil10aTriterpenoids and steroids isolated from Anatolian Capparis ovata and their activity on the expression of inflammatory cytokines  ap. 925-931.  aCapparis L. (Capparaceae) is grown worldwide. Caper has been used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases including rheumatism, kidney, liver, stomach, as well as headache and toothache. To isolate and elucidate of the secondary metabolites of the C. ovata extracts which are responsible for their anti-inflammatory activities. Buds, fruits, flowers, leaves and stems of C. ovata Desf. was dried, cut to pieces, then ground separately. From their dichloromethane/hexane (1:1) extracts, eight compounds were isolated and their structures were elucidated by NMR, mass spectroscopic techniques. The effects of compounds on the expression of inflammatory cytokines in SH-SY5Y cell lines were examined by qRT-PCR ranging from 4 to 96 µM. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the control, untreated cells. This is a first report on isolation of triterpenoids and steroids from C. ovata with anti-inflammatory activity. One new triterpenoid ester olean-12-en-3β,28-diol, 3β-pentacosanoate (1) and two new natural steroids 5α,6α-epoxycholestan-3β-ol (5) and 5β,6β-epoxycholestan-3β-ol (6) were elucidated besides known compounds; oleanolic acid (2), ursolic acid (3), β-sitosterol (4), stigmast-5,22-dien-3β-myristate (7) and bismethyl-octylphthalate (8). mRNA expression levels as EC₁₀ of all the tested seven genes were decreased, particularly CXCL9 (19.36-fold), CXCL10 (8.14-fold), and TNF (18.69) by the treatment of 26 µM of compound 1 on SH-SY5Y cells. Triterpenoids and steroids isolated from C. ovata were found to be moderate-strong anti-inflammatory compounds. Particularly, compounds 1 and 3 were found to be promising therapeutic agents in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.  aThis study was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey [TUBITAK-112S187] and Pamukkale University PAUBAP-2014FBE051 projects funds.  aPublisher supplied data  aTUBITAK-112S187 3aCapparis 3aTurkey (country) 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acell viability 3agene expression 3aheadache 3ahexane 3akidneys 3aliver 3amethylene chloride 3aoleanolic acid 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asecondary metabolites 3astomach 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3aursolic acid 0aCapparaceae 0aanti-inflammatory 0aanticholinesterase 0afatty acid 0asecondary metabolites 0aolean-12-en-3β, 28-diol 0a3β-pentacosanoate 0astructure elucidation 0aspectroscopy1 aSemen, Sevcan1 aAcar, Ozden Ozgun1 aKolak, Ufuk1 aSen, Alaattin1 aTopcu, Gulacti0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.925-931dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.18143563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01321naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245005800161300001600219520034100235592002800576650001600604650001200620650002300632650002300655650001200678650001100690650002200701700002200723700002600745700002500771773010300796856007500899852000900974655001200983IND60578650720221118221939.0170813e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057865072DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400122k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevin, Vitalij V.10aReactions of Difluorocarbene with Organozinc Reagents  ap. 917-919.  aReactions of difluorocarbene with benzyl and alkylzinc halides leading to fluorinated organozinc species have been described.

We aimed to test whether static no‐take zones within a large, sustainable‐use MPA prevented overlap between gentoo penguins and a krill fishery during two winters with contrasting prey fields. LOCATION: South Georgia, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. METHOD: We used satellite tracking (N = 16, June–September 2018) to describe gentoo penguin movements and distribution and quantified their overlap with the MPA’s no‐take zone (NTZ) and the krill fishing grounds. DNA metabarcoding of scats (N = 220, April–September 2018) was used to quantify diet. RESULTS: When krill were at moderate densities and evenly distributed in 2001, gentoo penguins would have spent all of their time within the 12 NM NTZ, but when availability was low in 2018, they spent 46.3% of their time outside the NTZ and 9.6% within the krill fishing grounds. The extension of the NTZ to 30 km in response to this finding would have produced a 14.9% increase in protection for penguins and displaced 4% of fishery hauls. Gentoo penguin diet comprised 25.8% krill, which is lower than in the late 1980s but more than in 2009. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Gentoo penguins extend their foraging range when krill is scarce, which increases the potential for spatial overlap with the krill fishery during periods of nutritional stress. Current regulations allow for expansion of both extent and catches by the krill fishery and, should this occur, gentoo penguins may face heightened risks from competition. A dynamic ocean management framework, that extends closed areas in response to near real‐time data on penguin movements and krill density estimates, may reduce the potential for competition in this sustainable‐use MPA while allowing a profitable krill fishery.  aPublisher supplied data  cPew Charitable Trusts  cBritish Antarctic Survey  cTruell Conservation Foundation 3aDNA barcoding 3adiet 3afisheries 3akrill 3amalnutrition 3amarine protected areas 3apenguins 3asatellites 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aGeorgia1 aDeagle, Bruce1 aLove, Kieran1 aPolanowski, Andrea1 aFielding, Sophie1 aWood, Andrew G.1 aHill, Simeon1 aGrant, Susie1 aBelchier, Mark1 aFleming, Andrew1 aHall, Jonathan0 tDiversity & distributions.g2021 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.552-563dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.132163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009200169300001400261520140000275592002801675650001901703650001301722650001301735650001701748650001501765650002101780650001601801650002001817650001001837650001801847650001501865650001301880650001101893650001601904650001501920650001301935650001601948650001501964650002001979650001601999650001102015653001602026653001502042653001502057653001502072653001902087653001702106700002102123773012302144856008102267852000902348655001202357IND60689187320221119000634.0200420e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068918732DNAL7 a10.1080/073885506006714662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemain, Arnold L.10aInvolvement of Nitrogen-Containing Compounds in β -Lactam Biosynthesis and its Control  ap. 67-82.  aBiosynthesis of β -lactam antibiotics by fungi and actinomycetes is markedly affected by compounds containing nitrogen.

Certain amino acids are precursors or inducers, whereas others are involved in repression and, in certain cases, as inhibitors of biosynthetic enzymes and of enzymes supplying precursors. The most important amino acids from the viewpoint of regulation are lysine, methionine, glutamate and valine. Surprisingly, diamines such as diaminopropane, putrescine and cadaverine induce cephamycin production by actinomycetes. In addition to penicillins and cephalosporins made by fungi and cephamycins made by actinomycetes, other β-lactams are made by actinomycetes and unicellular bacteria. These include clavams (e.g., clavulanic acid), carbapenems (e.g., thienamycin), nocardicins and monobactams. Here also, amino acids are precursors and inhibitors, but only little is known about regulation. In the case of the simplest carbapenem made by unicellular bacteria, i.e., 1-carba-2-em-3-carboxylic acid, quorum sensors containing homoserine lactone are inducers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aammonium 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acadaverine 3acarboxylic acids 3acephamycins 3aclavulanic acid 3afungi 3aglutamic acid 3ahomoserine 3alactones 3alysine 3ametabolites 3amethionine 3anitrogen 3apenicillins 3aputrescine 3aregulator genes 3athienamycin 3avaline 0aantibiotics 0aβ-lactams 0aregulation 0apenicillin 0acephalosporins 0aamino acids.1 aVaishnav, Preeti0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 26, no. 2 p.67-82dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/073885506006714663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01300naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245009300178300001400271520030100285592002800586650001300614653000700627653000800634653000800642653003200650653001800682653002000700653003100720653003300751773009500784856008600879852000900965655001200974IND60609985120221123022740.0181012e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060998512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMünter, Markus Thomas10aEndogenous number of firms, horizontal concentration and heterogeneity of firms—A note  ap. 74-76.  aWe re-examine implications of heterogeneity of firms under a Cournot setting on free entry equilibria concerning the number of firms.

The 30% maltodextrin (control), 25% arabic gum + 5% maltodextrin and 25% Capsul™ + 5% maltodextrin carriers were used at air-drying inlet temperatures of 140, 160 and 180°C. The following responses were evaluated: anthocyanin retention (AR), moisture content (MC), total solids (TS), hygroscopicity (H), overall color difference and antioxidant activity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was also performed. The AR, MC, H and overall color difference parameters were selected for simultaneous optimization by the desirability approach. The results showed that the highest desirability (0.7–0.8) was achieved when 30% maltodextrin was used at 180°C. According to the SEM analysis, the use of maltodextrin and gum arabic allowed for the formation of more homogeneous particles, which is recommended in spray-drying microencapsulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyrciaria 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3agum arabic 3amicroencapsulation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspray drying 3atemperature 3atotal solids 3awater content 0aJaboticaba 0aAnthocyanins 0aMicroencapsulation 0aDesirability 0aSpray dryer1 aStringheta, Paulo Cesar1 aTeófilo, Reinaldo Francisco1 ade Oliveira, Isadora Rebouças Nolasco0 tJournal of food engineering.g2013 Aug., v. 117, no. 4 p.538-544dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.08.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011000163300001600273500001900289520117900308592002801487650001501515650001701530650001601547650002301563650001901586650002501605650002001630650001401650650002501664650002001689650001201709650001201721650004301733650001301776650001501789653001501804653003201819653003101851653002301882653002701905653000801932653000801940653000701948653000701955653000901962700001601971700001501987700001502002700001802017700009002035773014602125856008302271852000902354655001202363IND60672124620221118052441.0191031e20191203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067212462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Feifei10aCCN1 induces adipogenic differentiation of fibro/adipogenic progenitors in a chronic kidney disease model  ap. 385-391.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrevious studies have shown that sarcopenic obesity is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, the association between CKD and sarcopenic obesity were investigated. The 5/6 nephrectomy was performed to establish CKD in mice. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA kits assay, immunohistochemistry, and cell proliferation assay were carried out to investigate the condition of muscle loss and fatty infiltration were in CKD mice and the origin of adipocytes. Muscle atrophy occurred and adipogenic gene expression, Perilipin and FABP4 were markedly increased in the hind limb muscle of CKD mice. Results indicated that fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are the precursor of adipocytes in the muscle of CKD mice.Meanwhile, the content of extracellular matrix protein CCN1 was notably increased in serum of CKD patients with sarcopenic obesity which was also found in muscle and serum of CKD mice. CCN1 induced the differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes. These results suggest that CKD mice are susceptible to sarcopenic obesity. CCN1 may be a novel activator of the differentiation of FAPs in CKD muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3ablood serum 3acell proliferation 3adisease models 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression 3ahindlimbs 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidney diseases 3amuscles 3aobesity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3asarcopenia 0aCCN1/Cyr61 0aFibro/adipogenic progenitor 0aAdipogenic differentiation 0aSarcopenic obesity 0aChronic kidney disease 0aCKD 0aFAP 0aSC 0aTA 0aFACS1 aLin, Youyou1 aZuo, Yidan1 aChen, Ruyi1 aLuo, Shengnan1 aSu, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6390-9957 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6390-99570 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Dec. 03, v. 520, no. 2 p.385-391dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03766naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245012800178300001400306520191600320592002802236650002502264650001002289650002102299650002102320650001802341650001402359650001502373650001002388650001502398650002502413650006602438650002802504650002002532650002202552650002702574650002202601653001702623653000802640653000802648653000802656653000902664653001002673653001702683653000902700653002702709653001902736653003202755653003002787700002002817700001902837700002302856700002602879700002002905773012802925856009003053852000903143655001203152IND60541123420221122163034.0190318e20140818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWieme, Anneleen D.10aIdentification of beer-spoilage bacteria using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  ap. 41-50.  aApplicability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for identification of beer-spoilage bacteria was examined. To achieve this, an extensive identification database was constructed comprising more than 4200 mass spectra, including biological and technical replicates derived from 273 acetic acid bacteria (AAB) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB), covering a total of 52 species, grown on at least three growth media. Sequence analysis of protein coding genes was used to verify aberrant MALDI-TOF MS identification results and confirmed the earlier misidentification of 34 AAB and LAB strains. In total, 348 isolates were collected from culture media inoculated with 14 spoiled beer and brewery samples. Peak-based numerical analysis of MALDI-TOF MS spectra allowed a straightforward species identification of 327 (94.0%) isolates. The remaining isolates clustered separately and were assigned through sequence analysis of protein coding genes either to species not known as beer-spoilage bacteria, and thus not present in the database, or to novel AAB species. An alternative, classifier-based approach for the identification of spoilage bacteria was evaluated by combining the identification results obtained through peak-based cluster analysis and sequence analysis of protein coding genes as a standard. In total, 263 out of 348 isolates (75.6%) were correctly identified at species level and 24 isolates (6.9%) were misidentified. In addition, the identification results of 50 isolates (14.4%) were considered unreliable, and 11 isolates (3.2%) could not be identified. The present study demonstrated that MALDI-TOF MS is well-suited for the rapid, high-throughput and accurate identification of bacteria isolated from spoiled beer and brewery samples, which makes the technique appropriate for routine microbial quality control in the brewing industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid bacteria 3abeers 3abrewing industry 3acluster analysis 3aculture media 3adatabases 3adesorption 3agenes 3aionization 3alactic acid bacteria 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amicrobiological quality 3aquality control 3asequence analysis 3aspecies identification 3aspoilage bacteria 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0aAAB 0aLAB 0aSSP 0aRAPD 0aUPGMA 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0aMLSA 0aBeer-spoilage bacteria 0aIdentification 0aPeak-based cluster analysis 0aClassifier-based analysis1 aSpitaels, Freek1 aAerts, Maarten1 aDe Bruyne, Katrien1 aVan Landschoot, Anita1 aVandamme, Peter0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Aug. 18, v. 185 p.41-50dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007800167300001800245520166500263592002801928650002101956650001801977650001701995650001202012650001302024650001002037650002302047650002302070650001602093650001802109650000902127650001102136650001202147650002102159650001502180650002202195650001002217700001802227700002302245700002102268700002502289773012502314856008102439852000902520655001202529IND60466730720221122083933.0151128e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046673072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-015-9823-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagy, Dávid D.10aShift of rove beetle assemblages in reforestations: Does nativity matter?  ap. 1075-1087.  aCreating plantations after clear-cutting of native forests is a serious risk for biodiversity. Rove beetles were collected by litter sifting in non-native plantations (black locust, Scots pine, red oak), in native oak plantation and mature oak forest as control. We hypothesised that diversity and composition of the rove beetles in the mature forest would be different from those in the plantations. We expected that reforestation with native species would have less harmful effects on rove beetles than reforestation with non-native species. In accordance with our hypotheses the overall number of rove beetle individuals and species, as well as the diversity of hygrophilous and decaying material dependent rove beetles were significantly lower in the plantations than in the mature oak forest. However, the overall species richness and the diversity of hygrophilous and decaying material dependent rove beetles were significantly higher in the native plantation compared to the non-native ones. There was no significant correlation between the diversity of these rove beetles and the soil moisture and decaying woody materials as limiting resources; thus, our study did not support the resource quantity hypothesis. The cover of herbs and shrubs, the soil temperature and soil pH were the most important factors controlling the diversity of rove beetles. Our results suggest that reforestation with native tree species provides more suitable habitat for rove beetles than non-native ones. However, it seems that rove beetle assemblages did not recover even after 40 years of reforestation with native tree species due to their specific ecological demands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aStaphylinidae 3aclearcutting 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aherbs 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aplantations 3areforestation 3arisk 3ashrubs 3asoil pH 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3atrees1 aMagura, Tibor1 aDebnár, Zsuzsanna1 aHorváth, Roland1 aTóthmérész, Béla0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2015 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.1075-1087dSpringer International Publishingx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-015-9823-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245011300179300001800292520162800310592002801938650001901966650002301985650001402008650001302022650001502035650001902050650001702069650002202086650001202108650001302120650001002133650000902143651001102152700002802163700001902191773012502210856008102335852000902416655001202425IND60466730820221122083914.0151128e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046673082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10841-015-9821-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobsen, Rannveig Margrete10aScale-specific responses of saproxylic beetles: combining dead wood surveys with data from satellite imagery  ap. 1053-1062.  aWe investigate relevant scales and cost-efficient methods for measurements of habitat for saproxylic, aspen-associated beetles, in two boreal forest landscapes in south-eastern Norway. We sampled saproxylic beetles with window traps on fresh aspen dead wood and conducted field surveys of dead wood in the surroundings (1, 2 and 3 km radius). In addition, we used maps derived from satellite imagery to extract data on forest age and volume for the same surroundings. We found that species richness of saproxylic beetles was related to dead wood volume estimated by field survey within 1 or 2 km radius from the trapping points. However, the map-derived variable describing area of forest with high levels of deciduous wood volume was the overall best predictor of species richness. The scale of response to this variable differed; species richness of all saproxylic beetles was best predicted by estimates for the 2 km radius whereas richness of species more strongly associated with aspen was best predicted by estimates for the 3 km radius. This might indicate that aspen-associated beetles disperse over larger distances than many other beetles; possibly an adaptation to the scattered distribution and ephemeral nature of aspen dead wood in boreal forests. Our results show that substrate variables must be measured at the scale that is ecologically relevant for the study organism to elicit a response. We also show that remote sensing data -often easy to obtain for large scales—can be used to complement studies of scale-specific responses and thus improve conservation measures for saproxylic beetle species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboreal forests 3acost effectiveness 3adead wood 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atrapping 3atraps 3awood 3aNorway1 aSverdrup-Thygeson, Anne1 aBirkemoe, Tone0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2015 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.1053-1062dSpringer International Publishingx1366-638X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-015-9821-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011500175300001600290520092300306592002801229650001501257650002001272650000901292650001201301650001801313650000901331650001601340700002101356700001601377773008001393856008601473852000901559655001201568IND60084990220221119164236.0141101e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008499022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarousi Farshi, L.10aExergoeconomic comparison of double effect and combined ejector-double effect absorption refrigeration systems  ap. 700-711.  aAt a particular temperature range, heat sources are not hot enough to drive lithium bromide double effect absorption refrigeration systems efficiently and are too hot to be used for the single effect systems because of the risk of crystallization. A combined ejector-double effect absorption cycle is a good choice to make effective use of heat sources at this temperature range for refrigeration purposes. In this study, detailed exergoeconomic analyses are performed for series flow double effect and combined ejector double effect systems in order to investigate and compare the influence of various operating parameters on investment costs of the overall systems and product cost flow rates. In addition, the proportion of component costs in the overall systems costs and exergoeconomic results are obtained. The results show that the combined cycle operates more economically compared to the double effect system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acrystallization 3aheat 3alithium 3arefrigeration 3arisk 3atemperature1 aMahmoudi, S.M.S.1 aRosen, M.A.0 tApplied energy.g2013 Mar., v. 103 p.700-711dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245014300183300001600326520076200342592002801104650001901132650001901151650002101170650001601191650001601207650001501223650001701238650005201255650002701307650002001334650004801354650002501402650002301427650002001450650005401470650002901524650001901553650003501572650001101607650001301618650003701631650006201668650005201730650002501782650003801807650005201845650005001897700001801947700001801965700001801983700001802001700001802019700001802037700001702055773010102072856008102173852000902254655001202263IND4401798620221120175047.0151024e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440179862DNAL7 a179850792pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-007-9584-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Yong-Soo10aMultipotency and growth characteristic of periosteum-derived progenitor cells for chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic differentiation  ap. 593-601.  aThe mesengenic multipotency of cryopreserved periosteum-derived progenitor cells (PDPCs) for chondrogenesis, osteogenesis and adipogenesis was investigated. Differentiation was verified using RT-PCR and histological analysis. For characterization, FACS analysis was performed with specific surface markers of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Among PDPCs, unsorted periosteum-derived cells (PDCs) and dermal fibroblasts, the most distinct characteristics were found to be CD9, CD105, and CD166. In addition, these markers in PDPCs were continuously maintained until passage 15. We developed a rapid method for the isolation of PDPCs that can differentiate into mesodermal lineages and provide enough cells in a short period of time for allogeneic cell therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abone formation 3achondrogenesis 3acryopreservation 3afibroblasts 3alipogenesis 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 2aAdipogenesisxgeneticsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aAntigens, CDxanalysis 2aTetraspanin 29. 2aCell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronalxanalysis 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Proliferation 2aCells, Cultured 2aChondrogenesisxgeneticsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aFetal Proteinsxanalysis 2aFlow Cytometry 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxanalysis 2aMultipotent Stem Cellsxcytologyximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aOsteogenesisxgeneticsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aPeriosteumxcytology 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStem Cellsxcytologyximmunologyxmetabolism.1 aNoh, Sang-Eun1 aIm, Sang-min,1 aYi, Ch'ang-u,1 aKim, Chul-Soo1 aIm, Moon-Whan1 aLee, Moon-Hee1 aKim, Dong-Il0 tBiotechnology letters.g2008 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.593-601dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-007-9584-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01685naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245004200157300001600199500000900215520085400224592002801078650002401106650001501130650001901145650001201164651001901176773011801195856007301313852000901386655001201395IND60608875120221119115255.0180813e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060887512DNAL7 a10.1111/nbu.123382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRapley, G.

Since then, there has been a gradual reassessment of the perceived wisdom that guides how complementary feeding is approached, with the result that many of the features of BLW are now reflected in mainstream thinking. The publication of the report of the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, Feeding in the First Year of Life, which summarises and evaluates the existing evidence base for infant feeding as a benchmark for UK guidelines, provides a useful opportunity to look at how well the baby‐led approach fits with current evidence and which aspects of the introduction of solid foods remain to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplementary foods 3aguidelines 3ainfant feeding 3aweaning 3aUnited Kingdom0 tNutrition bulletin.g2018 Sept., v. 43, no. 3 p.262-268dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl6406x1471-98277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nbu.123383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010600169300002000275520072500295592002801020650001301048650001101061650001601072650001201088650001101100650002301111650002201134650002301156650002501179650001601204700002301220700002401243700006201267700006201329773013801391856008001529852000901609655001201618IND60661468120221120224959.0190829e20190802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066146812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b042672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYudin, Vsevolod I.10aPhotoluminescence Manipulation by Ion Beam Irradiation in CsPbBr₃ Halide Perovskite Single Crystals  ap. 21130-21134.  aHalide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronics with an attractive radiation resistance property. In this article, we study the effect of 30 keV Ga⁺ ion irradiation on the photoluminescence (PL) of CsPbBr₃ halide perovskite single crystals. The high crystal quality and liquid helium temperature studies make it possible to distinguish the radiation-defect-related PL band. A model to explain the band shifts with radiation dose and pulsed pump intensity has been developed. Bright defect PL allows the visualization of the irradiated areas using PL mapping. Manipulation of optical properties using focused ion beams opens wide opportunities for halide perovskite nanofabrication for optoelectronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3ahelium 3airradiation 3aliquids 3amodels 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3aphysical chemistry 3aradiation resistance 3atemperature1 aLozhkin, Maksim S.1 aShurukhina, Anna V.1 aEmeline, Alexey V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8338-71131 aKapitonov, Yury V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8146-86540 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 02, v. 123, no. 34 p.21130-21134dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b042673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04108naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002400172245017400196300001600370520222000386592002802606650002302634650001902657650002102676650002702697650001402724650001602738650001802754650001102772650001702783650002302800650001302823650001302836650001302849650002302862650001302885650001602898650002302914650001702937650004502954650002302999650005003022650002703072650003203099650001503131650003803146650003803184650002003222650001903242700001603261700002403277773011903301856008903420852000903509655001203518IND4468048720221123033254.0141111e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446804872DNAL7 a222003232pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHospital, Xavier F.10aSurvival of Listeria innocua in dry fermented sausages and changes in the typical microbiota and volatile profile as affected by the concentration of nitrate and nitrite  ap. 395-401.  aThe involvement of nitrate and nitrite in the formation of N-nitrosamines in foods is a matter of great concern. This situation has led to revise the real amount of nitrate and nitrite needed in meat products to exert proper technological and safety activities, and also to extensive research to find alternatives to their use. The present study addresses the possibility of reducing the ingoing amounts of these additives below the legal limits established by the current European regulations. Different concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were tested on Spanish salchichón-type dry fermented sausages concerning their role in the microbiota and volatile profile. Sausages were manufactured with the maximum ingoing amounts established by the EU regulations (150ppm NaNO₃ and 150ppm NaNO₂), a 25% reduction and a 50% reduction; control sausages with no nitrate/nitrite addition were also prepared. The mixtures were inoculated with 5logcfu/g of Listeria innocua as a surrogate for Listeria monocytogenes. L. innocua numbers in the final product were approximately 1.5logcfu/g lower in the batch with the maximum nitrate/nitrite concentration when compared to 25 and 50% reduced batches, and about 2logcfu/g in comparison to the control sausages. The final numbers of catalase-positive cocci were 1logcfu/g higher in the 50% nitrate/nitrite reduced batch and 2logcfu/g higher in the control sausages, compared to products manufactured with the maximum nitrate/nitrite concentration. This increase was related to a higher amount of volatile compounds derived from carbohydrate fermentation and amino acid degradation. Sausages with no addition of nitrate/nitrite showed higher amount of volatiles from lipid oxidation. Enterobacteriaceae counts reached detectable values (1–2logcfu/g) in both nitrate/nitrite reduced sausages and in the control batch, while these organisms were not detected in the batch with the maximum ingoing amount. Nitrate and nitrite exerted a significant effect on the typical microbiota of dry fermented sausages and effectively contributed to control Listeria. These considerations should be taken into account in view of a future restriction in the use of these curing additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3aEuropean Union 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aadditives 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrates 3adrying 3afermentation 3alipid peroxidation 3anitrates 3anitrites 3asausages 3avolatile compounds 2aBacteria 2aDesiccation 2aEnterobacteriaceae 2aFermentation 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aListeriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aListeria monocytogenes 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aMetagenome 2aNitratesxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aNitritesxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aNitrogen Oxides 2aVolatilization1 aHierro, Eva1 aFernández, Manuela0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 153, no. 3 p.395-401dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2011.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245006600153300001400219500001700233520131000250592002801560650002401588650001301612650001901625650001001644650001901654650002201673650002801695650001401723650001401737650001101751650001001762650002701772650001301799650001101812650001301823700001401836700002201850773013401872856007302006852000902079655001202088IND60631570020221120070827.0190311e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063157002DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.127842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodge, PJ10aAvian mycobacteriosis in captive brolgas (Antigone rubicunda)  ap. 81-86.  aCase Reports  aCASE SERIES: Avian mycobacteriosis is a significant disease of a wide range of bird species worldwide. The most common causative agent, Mycobacterium avium, is reported to also infect a range of mammals, including humans. Of 11 brolgas (Antigone rubicunda) submitted to the University of Melbourne for postmortem examination over a 10‐year period, 7 were diagnosed with mycobacteriosis. All were from a wildlife park and kept in permanent enclosures as part of a breeding program. Most of the brolgas with mycobacteriosis were in poor body condition and had widely disseminated granulomas throughout the body, especially within the liver, spleen and gastrointestinal tract. Respiratory tract involvement was common, with all disseminated cases having pulmonary or air sac granulomas. Rare to moderate numbers of acid‐fast organisms were detected in granulomas by histological examination. Where examined by appropriate bacteriological examinations, M. avium complex was isolated from affected tissues. CONCLUSION: This case series is the first known report of mycobacteriosis in brolgas and highlights the pathological changes seen. The complications in maintaining an avian mycobacteriosis‐free breeding program and in eradication of the disease from an enclosed wildlife environment are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium avium 3aair sacs 3aanimal tissues 3abirds 3abody condition 3abreeding programs 3agastrointestinal system 3agranuloma 3ahistology 3ahumans 3aliver 3amycobacterial diseases 3anecropsy 3aspleen 3awildlife1 aSandy, JR1 aNoormohammadi, AH0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2019 Mar., v. 97, no. 3 p.81-86dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.127843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245005600158300001800214520154900232592002801781650002101809650000901830650001501839650001901854650001901873650001101892650001901903650001901922650001801941650001901959650001301978650001701991650001302008650001702021650002002038700001202058700001702070700001602087700002402103700002702127773013402154856007402288852000902362655001202371IND60644800620221121144101.0190522e20190520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064480062DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cs00919h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shushan10aCovalent organic frameworks for membrane separation  ap. 2665-2681.  aCovalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are constructed from organic linkers, are a new class of crystalline porous materials comprising periodically extended and covalently bound network structures. The intrinsic structures and the tailorable organic linkers endow COFs with a low density, large surface area, tunable pore size and structure, and facilely-tailored functionality, attracting increasing interests in different fields including membrane separations. Exciting research activities ranging from fabrication strategies to separation applications of COF-based membranes have appeared. This review analyzes the synthesis and applications of diverse continuous/discontinuous COF membranes, such as COF-based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), COF-based thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes, and free-standing COF films. Special attention was given to pore size, stability, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity and surface charge of COFs in view of determining proper COFs for membrane fabrication, along with the approaches to fabricate COF-based membranes, such as blending, in situ growth, layer-by-layer stacking and interfacial polymerization (IP). Moreover, applications of COF-based membranes in gas separation, water treatment (deaslination and dye removal), organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), pervaporation and fuel cell are disscussed. Finally, we illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of COF-based membranes through a comparison with MOF-based membranes, and the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this field.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3adyes 3afuel cells 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3ananofiltration 3apervaporation 3apolymerization 3aporosity 3aporous media 3asolvents 3asurface area 3awater treatment1 aLi, Xin1 aZhu, Junyong1 aZhang, Gang1 aVan Puyvelde, Peter1 aBruggen, Bart van der,0 tChemical Society reviews.g2019 May 20, v. 48, no. 10 p.2665-2681dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cs00919h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015800166300001800324520201600342592002802358650001202386650001302398650001602411650001102427650001602438650002302454650002602477650002102503650001502524650001402539650001802553650002302571650001602594650001902610650002502629650002502654650002202679700002702701700002502728700002402753700002002777700001502797700001802812700001302830700001702843773013702860856008302997852000903080655001203089IND60775728520221118022019.0220427e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077572852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-022-03159-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas, Ghulam10aBiochar increases salt tolerance and grain yield of quinoa on saline-sodic soil: multivariate comparison of physiological and oxidative stress attributes  ap. 1446-1459.  aPURPOSE: Plant growth and grain yield of most of the crops are reduced on saline-sodic soils. Different organic and inorganic amendments have been used to increase plant growth and productivity on salt-affected soils. However, the role of cotton shell biochar (CSBC) for increasing salt tolerance of plants grown on saline-sodic soils has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the current study was intended to estimate the impact of cotton shell biochar (CSBC) addition @1 and 2% for ameliorating Na-induced phytotoxicity in quinoa grown on saline-sodic soil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quinoa plants were grown on saline-sodic soil with and without CSBC addition. Different physiological attributes were measured at vegetative stage. Plants were harvested at maturity when growth and grain yield were recorded. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results revealed that plant biomass, grain yield, stomatal conductance, relative water contents, and chlorophyll contents of quinoa were declined by > 20%, 18%, 23%, 27%, and 16%, respectively under salt stress. Excessive uptake of Na decreased the uptake of K and K:Na, and caused the overproduction of H₂O₂ (62%) and lipid peroxidation (58%) in quinoa. The CSBC addition @2% was more effective than 1% in ameliorating the negative impacts of Na toxicity on plant growth and physiology. Amendment of saline-sodic soil with 2% CSBC increased plant growth, water contents, stomatal conductance, and chlorophyll contents by 60%, 36%, 41%, and 43%, respectively as compared to saline-sodic soil without CSBC. There was a slight increase in soil EC after the addition of CSBC. Additionally, 2% CSBC limited the uptake of Na and caused a 43%, 48%, and 75% increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) activities to ameliorate the oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded through multivariate analysis that 2% CSBC was very promising in reducing Na toxicity and increasing plant biomass and grain yield of quinoa in saline-sodic soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acotton 3agrain yield 3alipid peroxidation 3amultivariate analysis 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aphytomass 3aphytotoxicity 3asaline sodic soils 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3astomatal conductance 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avegetative growth1 aAbrar, Muhammad Mohsin1 aNaeem, Muhammad Asif1 aSiddiqui, Manzer H.1 aAli, Hayssam M.1 aLi, Yantao1 aAhmed, Khalil1 aSun, Nan1 aXu, Minggang0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2022 May, v. 22, no. 5 p.1446-1459dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-022-03159-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013400158300001800292520187400310592002802184650001902212650003702231650001302268650001202281650002302293650001202316650001402328650002102342650002502363650002302388650001502411650001802426650002002444650001202464650001302476650001202489650001102501650001902512650001902531650001802550650001502568650001302583650003702596650001302633700002402646700001702670700002002687700001802707700001502725700002102740700001402761773012502775856007402900852000902974655001202983IND60644800820221121180239.0190522e20190520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064480082DNAL7 a10.1039/c8gc03440k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Naseeb10aMetal–acid nanoplate-supported ultrafine Ru nanoclusters for efficient catalytic fractionation of lignin into aromatic alcohols  ap. 2739-2751.  aThe catalytic fractionation of lignin in a native lignocellulose matrix is crucial to the comprehensive achievement of sustainable and green chemicals. Herein, we prepared a novel metal–acid bifunctional nanocomposite of finely scattered metallic Ru nanoclusters (NCs) sustained on porous hafnium phosphate nanoplates (α-HfP NPs) to effectively depolymerise lignocellulosic biomass. A native lignin fraction of pine lignocellulose was promptly depolymerised into 19.86 wt% yield (lignin based) of valuable phenolic monomers (with dihydroeugenol as the main compound with high selectivity) and few cyclic ketones through one-pot catalytic reductive fractionation under mild conditions (190 °C, 3.5 MPa H₂). Detailed scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption ammonia investigation correlated with the obtained results revealed that the metal–acid synergistic influence and the presence of Brønsted acid sites in the support for dehydration and the well-dispersed metallic role of Ru NCs for hydrodeoxygenation were responsible for the cleavage of lignin–carbohydrate (ester and ether linkages) bonds. Moreover, treating commercial lignin as a substrate in an organic solvent generated 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin) in high yield, as well as other functionalised phenolic monomers up to 85% selectivity, illustrating the high susceptibility of Ru/α-HfP NPs towards C–O bond cleavage through reductive fractionation. Multiple recycling tests of the catalyst were performed without any apparent loss of activity. Overall, this report highlighted the potential of the synthesis strategy of the metal–acid supported catalyst to immediately depolymerise untreated biomass and can thus encourage the green, cost-efficient, large-scale production of intermediate chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBronsted acids 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalcohols 3aammonia 3aaromatic compounds 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acost effectiveness 3adesorption 3afractionation 3agreen chemistry 3ahafnium 3ahydrogen 3aketones 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aphosphates 3asolvents 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avanillin1 aOdda, Atheer Hameid1 aLiang, Kuang1 aKombo, Miza Ali1 aSahar, Shafaq1 aMa, Liu-Bo1 aFang, Xiao-Xiang1 aXu, An-Wu0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 May 20, v. 21, no. 10 p.2739-2751dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc03440k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245005200206300001800258520175600276592002802032596003402060650004102094650001202135650001902147650002002166650001402186650001902200650001502219650002702234650002302261650001402284650000902298650001302307650001702320650002302337650001602360650001502376700006302391700005602454700003702510700006002547773013702607856008302744852000902827655001202836IND60775728720221118022016.0220427e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077572872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-022-03192-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMouris, Kilian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1436-010610aIntroducing seasonal snow memory into the RUSLE  ap. 1609-1628.  aPURPOSE: The sediment supply to rivers, lakes, and reservoirs has a great influence on hydro-morphological processes. For instance, long-term predictions of bathymetric change for modeling climate change scenarios require an objective calculation procedure of sediment load as a function of catchment characteristics and hydro-climatic parameters. Thus, the overarching objective of this study is to develop viable and objective sediment load assessment methods in data-sparse regions. METHODS: This study uses the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the SEdiment Delivery Distributed (SEDD) model to predict soil erosion and sediment transport in data-sparse catchments. The novel algorithmic methods build on free datasets, such as satellite and reanalysis data. Novelty stems from the usage of freely available datasets and the introduction of a seasonal snow memory into the RUSLE. In particular, the methods account for non-erosive snowfall, its accumulation over months as a function of temperature, and erosive snowmelt months after the snow fell. RESULTS: Model accuracy parameters in the form of Pearson’s r and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency indicate that data interpolation with climate reanalysis and satellite imagery enables viable sediment load predictions in data-sparse regions. The accuracy of the model chain further improves when snow memory is added to the RUSLE. Non-erosivity of snowfall makes the most significant increase in model accuracy. CONCLUSION: The novel snow memory methods represent a major improvement for estimating suspended sediment loads with the empirical RUSLE. Thus, the influence of snow processes on soil erosion and sediment load should be considered in any analysis of mountainous catchments.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 776608cJPI Climate 3aRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3amountains 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asediment contamination 3asediment transport 3asediments 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asoil erosion 3asuspended sediment 3atemperature 3awatersheds1 aSchwindt, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7206-05421 aHaun, Stefan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8202-46331 aMorales Oreamuno, Maria Fernanda1 aWieprecht, Silke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6776-24460 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2022 May, v. 22, no. 5 p.1609-1628dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-022-03192-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001200285520167400297592002801971650002001999650002502019650001702044650001902061650001802080650001802098650002202116650001202138650001702150650002102167650002202188650003002210650001202240650000902252650001402261650002702275650001402302650001302316651001002329651002002339700001302359700001502372700001402387700001602401700001702417773010902434856008102543852000902624655001202633IND60466731420221120232150.0151215e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046673142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-015-0955-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaoming10aGenetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of citron (Citrus medica L.) and its relatives in southwest China  ap. 129.  aUnderstanding the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship of citron (Citrus medica L.) is of great importance for making conservation and utilization strategies. Southeast Asia and its vicinity are usually regarded as one of the centers of origin for Citrus. The principal aims of this work were to evaluate the genetic diversity of 56 accessions of citron and its relatives mainly from southwest China, to investigate the genetic structures of citron populations, and to construct a phylogenetic tree to understand the evolution of some hybrids among citrons and other citrus types. SSR analysis detected a total of 387 alleles ranging from 2 to 12 alleles per locus, and nearly all accessions identified could be unequivocally distinguished. The observed and expected heterozygosities averaged 0.36 and 0.49, respectively. From a Bayesian cluster analysis, citrons were characterized by two distinguished genetic structures, which corresponded to the geographical distribution in southwest China. Citron and fingered citron might derive from a common ancestor. Based on the chloroplast sequences, the phylogenetic trees were constructed with congruent topologies and similar levels of statistical support for relationships among citron and its relatives using both maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. Citron formed a monophyletic clade, which was completely different from mandarin (C. reticulata) and pummelo (C. grandis). The genetic contributors of some hybrid species, such as C. limonia, C. aurantifolia, and C. limon, were also discussed, and citron appeared to be a primary contributor to the speciation of these secondary citrus species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3aCitrus limon 3aCitrus limonia 3aCitrus maxima 3aCitrus medica 3aCitrus reticulata 3aalleles 3achloroplasts 3acluster analysis 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amandarins 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonophyly 3apummelos 3aChina 3aSouth East Asia1 aLi, Hang1 aLiang, Mei1 aXu, Qiang1 aChai, Lijun1 aDeng, Xiuxin0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 6 p.129-129dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-015-0955-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006400146245012600210300002000336520099600356592002801352650004901380650002201429650001401451650002301465650001701488650001801505650001401523650002301537650002701560650002101587650001601608650002201624650000901646700005501655700006401710700006601774700005401840700006601894773013801960856008002098852000902178655001202187IND60661468520221120214106.0190829e20190718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066146852DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b045232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShames, Alexander I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0574-191110aUnusual Stabilization of Zinc Peroxide by Manganese Oxide: Mechanistic Understanding by Temperature-Dependent EPR Studies  ap. 20884-20892.  aNanocrystalline zinc peroxide is passivated against further oxidation by the addition of minute, substoichiometric amounts of potassium permanganate, which also endows it with increased thermal stability. The oxidation state of manganese and the passivation mechanism are deciphered by a comparative electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study of the manganese-doped zinc peroxide nanoparticles and manganese oxide formed by reduction of permanganate by hydrogen peroxide as well as unmodified ZnO₂ nanoparticles. Temperature-dependent in situ EPR studies at elevated temperatures allowed us to trace simultaneously the temperature-dependent changes in abundance of superoxide radicals and the formation of Mn(IV) species and also to identify Mn(III) species at cryotemperatures. We conclude that the passivation is caused by Mn(III) complexes that act as antioxidants removing superoxide radicals, which are abundant in zinc peroxide and even more so in the manganese-doped zinc peroxide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amanganese 3amanganese monoxide 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry 3apotassium permanganate 3asuperoxide anion 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3azinc1 aLev, Ovadia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3536-22771 aMikhaylov, Alexey A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1771-64651 aMedvedev, Alexander G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6762-004X1 aGun, Jenny1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7667-76061 aPrikhodchenko, Petr V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9912-69510 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 18, v. 123, no. 34 p.20884-20892dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b045233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03625naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245008600174300001400260520223900274592002802513650001702541650002502558650002302583650001702606650002502623650001102648650001502659650002202674650001502696650001102711650001702722651001502739653002502754653002402779653001602803653002602819653002602845653001602871653002602887700002802913700002202941773009402963856008903057852000903146655001203155IND60611912620221118074138.0190719e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBidaud, Cécile14aThe local costs of biodiversity offsets: Comparing standards, policy and practice  ap. 43-50.  aBiodiversity offsets seek to counterbalance loss of biodiversity due to major developments by generating equivalent biodiversity benefits elsewhere, resulting, at least in theory, in ‘no net loss’ (or even a ‘net positive gain’) in biodiversity. While local costs of major developments themselves receive significant attention, the local costs of associated biodiversity offsets have not. In low income countries, where local populations often depend heavily on natural resources and access to land for their livelihoods, the conservation restrictions introduced around biodiversity offsets can have significant local costs. We consider the international standards which underpin the development of biodiversity offsets around the world and look at the biodiversity offset programme of the Ambatovy nickel mine in eastern Madagascar: a company at the vanguard of biodiversity offset development. Using document review and interviews with key international and national stakeholders (as well as previous fieldwork on local impacts of the Ambatovy biodiversity offset) we identify a mismatch between policies which make clear commitments to avoiding harm to local people, and somewhat weaker implementation on the ground. We explore this policy-practice gap and suggest that it is due to: 1) different interpretations of the meaning of international standards, 2) weak incentives for companies to comply with policies, 3) separation of responsibilities for social and environmental impacts of interventions in operating companies, 4) assumptions that conservation is a ‘good thing’ causing reduced scrutiny of biodiversity offsets relative to other activities of major developments. Biodiversity offsets are resulting in a rapid increase in protected areas funded by corporations (and their international lenders). Many conservation projects in low income countries have local costs. The existence of stringent standards which recognise these costs in the case of biodiversity offset projects is very positive. Biodiversity offsets have the potential to be a successful addition to the conservationist’s toolkit but the real challenges of addressing the local costs of this novel conservation approach need to be resolved.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abusiness enterprises 3aconservation areas 3acorporations 3aenvironmental impact 3aincome 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3anickel 3astakeholders 3aMadagascar 0aBiodiversity offsets 0aForest conservation 0aLivelihoods 0aEnvironmental justice 0aPerformance standards 0aNo net loss 0aNet biodiversity gain1 aSchreckenberg, Kathrin,1 aJones, Julia P.G.0 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.43-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245004700176300002000223500001900243520127300262592002801535650002501563650001501588650001201603650001001615650001801625650001701643650001601660650001601676650004401692650001301736650001101749650001701760700002601777700002301803700006001826773013101886856008402017852000902101655001202110IND60710990420221117203132.0200915e20200824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c022742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoffers, Katarina M.10aNoninvasive Epidermal Metabolite Profiling  ap. 12467-12472.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA buffer placed in brief contact in the skin was assayed by ¹H NMR spectroscopy. We found that this passive extraction of the skin surface yields abundant metabolites. Metabolites of the skin surface originate from a variety of sources, including the sweat gland, which produces lactate from the glucose received from its capillary bed. Little is known about how metabolites resident on and within the skin surface respond to a metabolic or hemodynamic perturbation. As a possible application of epidermal metabolite profiling, we asked whether metabolites extracted from the skin surface are indicative of heart failure. The levels of lactate and other molecules were significantly lower in patients in heart failure than in individuals who reported healthy heart function, possibly due to reduced blood flow to the sweat gland resulting in a lack of tissue perfusion. Most amino acids were unchanged in levels, except for glycine and serine that increased as a percentage of all amino acids. These results have the potential in the long term to help decide the extent to which a patient has heart failure for which objective measures are lacking. Moreover, the results suggest that epidermal metabolite profiling may be useful for other assessments of human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3ablood flow 3aglucose 3aheart 3aheart failure 3ahuman health 3alactic acid 3ametabolites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apatients 3aserine 3asweat glands1 aCronkright, Ashley A.1 aHuggins, Gordon S.1 aBaleja, James D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4841-02470 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 24, v. 92, no. 18 p.12467-12472dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c022743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03461naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100005500154245010400209300001600313520185600329592002802185650003002213650002102243650002302264650001502287650002202302650002002324650001202344650001502356650001502371650002102386650001302407650001002420651001402430653001702444653001802461653002102479653001902500653002102519653001002540653001402550700006202564700002202626700002402648700002202672700001802694700002502712773009602737856008902833852000902922655001202931IND60611912720221118074119.0190719e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSloan, Sean1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7834-020310aInfrastructure development and contested forest governance threaten the Leuser Ecosystem, Indonesia  ap. 298-309.  aThe Leuser Ecosystem in northern Sumatra, Indonesia is a globally-significant landscape for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. It is however increasingly threatened by infrastructure development, enabled by discordant forest governance amongst central and regional governments. Here we identify these infrastructure threats and related shortcomings in forest management and conservation planning. Environment-development conflicts were mapped across the Leuser Ecosystem, in addition to unofficial and official roads as well as planned road, electrical generation, and electrical transmission developments. We find that conflicts concentrate in the Leuser Ecosystem, where many protected forests were formerly degraded and are now undergoing de facto conversion. Unofficial roads, not observed within government maps, were nearly double the length of official roads within the Leuser Ecosystem (6818 km vs 3597 km). Approximately half of all roads occurred in forests, particularly historically-exploited forests. Consequently, small forest patches and narrow forest corridors comprise 27% of the Leuser Ecosystem, and most are subject to ongoing degradation and conversion. We identify eight conservation priority areas where concentrations of road developments have produced particularly vulnerable forests. Planned infrastructure developments would directly impact these priority areas and bisect the Leuser Ecosystem, contradicting national conservation planning directives. These trends are framed by an assertive decentralisation by regional governments, aggravating the legal-administrative volatility surrounding the Leuser Ecosystem and empowering development interests. Such volatility is poised to become more common in Indonesia at a time of rapidly expanding development pressures within remaining natural environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3adecentralization 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aforest management 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3agovernance 3alandscapes 3alocal government 3aplanning 3aroads 3aIndonesia 0aConnectivity 0aDeforestation 0aSpatial planning 0aPrimary forest 0aSecondary forest 0aRoads 0aIndonesia1 aCampbell, Mason J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6803-271X1 aAlamgir, Mohammed1 aCollier-Baker, Emma1 aNowak, Matthew G.1 aUsher, Graham1 aLaurance, William F.0 tLand use policy.g2018 Sept., v. 77 p.298-309dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006600147245012700213506011700340506007600457506010400533520121500637592002801852506003701880650002501917650001501942650001501957650001101972650002801983700001802011700001902029700002102048700002002069700002102089700001902110700002302129700002002152700002602172700002302198700001602221700001802237700001802255773010402273856008202377852000902459655001202468IND60771904820221207050215.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077190482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esg.2022.1001382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarden-Davies, Harriet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8214-518710aCapacity development in the Ocean Decade and beyond: Key questions about meanings, motivations, pathways, and measurements  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aCapacity development is a major priority in the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (the Decade). Persistent disparities in ocean science capacity illustrate the substantial challenges to achieving the Decade's stated goal of eradicating inequality. We argue that a new conversation about capacity development is essential for the success of the Decade and beyond. We question the meaning, motivations, pathways and measurement of capacity development at this critical juncture. While we do not propose a single answer to these context- and situation-specific questions, we do recognize that the lack of accepted, or even defined, approaches to capacity development, its initiation, leadership, desired outcomes, implementation, and evaluation is failing the global ocean community. Explicit focus and reflection on the power of discourses, definitions, positionality, and perspectives has the potential to greatly improve the experience and outcomes of capacity development programs. This Perspective seeks to stimulate reflection and action to seize the substantial opportunity presented by the Decade to facilitate capacity development solutions toward a more equitable world.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEarth system science 3agovernance 3aleadership 3aoceans 3asustainable development1 aAmon, Diva J.1 aVierros, Marjo1 aBax, Nicholas J.1 aHanich, Quentin1 aHills, Jeremy M.1 aGuilhon, Maila1 aMcQuaid, Kirsty A.1 aMohammed, Essam1 aPouponneau, Angelique1 aSeto, Katherine L.1 aSink, Kerry1 aTalma, Sheena1 aWoodall, Lucy0 tEarth system governance.g2022 Apr., v. 12 p.100138-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27266x2589-81167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esg.2022.1001383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245011800159300001600277520186900293592002802162650001202190650004502202650001502247650001302262650002602275650001502301650001602316650001902332650002502351651001102376651001702387651001002404653001202414653003002426653001602456653003902472653000902511700001402520773009902534856008102633852000902714655001202723IND60545050020221119195314.0160901e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054505002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, L.10aImproved time series land cover classification by missing-observation-adaptive nonlinear dimensionality reduction  ap. 478-491.  aDimensionality reduction (DR) is a widely used technique to address the curse of dimensionality when high-dimensional remotely sensed data, such as multi-temporal or hyperspectral imagery, are analyzed. Nonlinear DR algorithms, also referred to as manifold learning algorithms, have been successfully applied to hyperspectral data and provide improved performance compared with linear DR algorithms. However, DR algorithms cannot handle missing data that are common in multi-temporal imagery. In this paper, the Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) nonlinear DR algorithm was refined for application to multi-temporal satellite data with large proportions of missing data. Refined LE algorithms were applied to 52-week Landsat time series for three study areas in Texas, Kansas and South Dakota that have different amounts of missing data and land cover complexity. A series of random forest classifications were conducted on the refined LE DR bands using varying proportions of training data provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL); these classification results were compared with conventional metrics-based random forest classifications. Experimental results show that compared with the metrics approach, higher per-class and overall classification accuracies were obtained using the refined LE DR bands of multispectral reflectance time series, and the number of training samples required to achieve a given degree of classification accuracy was also reduced. The approach of applying the refined LE to multispectral reflectance time series is promising in that it is automated and provides dimensionality-reduced data with desirable classification properties. The implications of this research and possibilities for future algorithm development and application are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aNational Agricultural Statistics Service 3aalgorithms 3acropland 3ahyperspectral imagery 3aland cover 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3atime series analysis 3aKansas 3aSouth Dakota 3aTexas 0aLandsat 0aLand cover classification 0aTime series 0aNonlinear dimensionality reduction 0aWELD1 aRoy, D.P.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 158 p.478-491dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012500208300002000333500001900353520160000372592002801972650001702000650002502017650000902042650002302051650001902074650001502093650002202108650001402130650001202144650001202156650001602168650001802184650003402202650000902236650002902245700001302274700001802287700005402305773013102359856008402490852000902574655001202583IND60710990620221117203112.0200915e20200811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c023032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chenglong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4684-960310aOn-Tissue Derivatization Strategy for Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Carboxyl-Containing Metabolites in Biological Tissues  ap. 12126-12131.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarboxyl-containing metabolites (CCMs) play indispensable roles in cell energy metabolism and cell–cell signaling. Profiling tissue CCMs with spatial signatures is significant for the understanding of molecular histology and may provide new clues to uncover the complex metabolic reprogramming of organisms in response to external or internal stimuli. Here, we develop a sensitive on-tissue CCMs derivatization method, coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), to visualize the spatial distributions of CCMs in biological tissues. A novel reagent, N,N,N-trimethyl-2-(piperazin-1-yl)ethan-1-aminium iodide (TMPA), was synthesized and used for the on-tissue derivatization of CCMs. Meanwhile, the on-tissue derivatization efficiency was significantly improved by introducing acetonitrile gas in the incubation system. With this methodology, a total of 28 CCMs, including 5 tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, 20 fatty acids, and 3 bile acids, were successfully detected and imaged in rat kidney tissues. More importantly, the introduction of a quaternary ammonium group into the chemical structure of CCMs enables simultaneous MALDI-MS imaging of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, fatty acids, bile acids, and their metabolic pathway-related metabolites such as carnitines, cholines, glycerophosphocholine, phospholipids, and so on in the positive ion mode. This on-tissue derivatization MALDI-MSI approach was proven to be a powerful tool for probing the distributions and spatial metabolic networks of CMMs in biological tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aanalytical chemistry 3abile 3achemical structure 3aderivatization 3adesorption 3aenergy metabolism 3ahistology 3aiodides 3akidneys 3ametabolites 3aphospholipids 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3arats 3atricarboxylic acid cycle1 aLiu, Wei1 aGeng, Yanling1 aWang, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4236-24830 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 11, v. 92, no. 18 p.12126-12131dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c023033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003100155245018000186300001400366520105000380592002801430650001501458650002401473650001801497650002201515650001301537650001201550650001401562650002901576650001201605653002501617653003001642653001201672653002201684653002301706653002801729700002701757700002601784700001601810700002201826700002201848773012801870856009001998852000902088655001202097IND60541124420221120223712.0190318e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Rodriguez, Fernando,10aQuantitative assessment of the Salmonella distribution on fresh-cut leafy vegetables due to cross-contamination occurred in an industrial process simulated at laboratory scale  ap. 86-91.  aFecal pathogen distributions in fresh-cut leafy vegetables are essential to develop suitable sampling plans so as to detect pathogen contaminations. In this study, a typical fresh-cut lettuce process was reproduced at pilot scale with different initial inoculum levels of Salmonella on lettuce (6–7, 4 and 1logCFU/g). The pathogen was determined in all processed lettuce samples (n≥50) and obtained count data were used to fit different probability distributions. The study showed that Salmonella is homogenously distributed on fresh-cut leafy vegetables as a result of processing (mainly washing) at all contamination levels. Negative binomial and Poisson-lognormal distributions were suitable to describe pathogen distribution at the high and medium levels. coefficient of variation modified (CV*) indicated no overdispersion (i.e. clustering). Nevertheless, further research will be needed to assess the effect of using disinfectants in washing water on the final distribution pattern of pathogens in processed fresh-cut leafy vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3across contamination 3adisinfectants 3afresh-cut produce 3ainoculum 3alettuce 3apathogens 3aprobability distribution 3awashing 0aFood-borne pathogens 0aProbability distributions 0aLettuce 0aPoisson-lognormal 0aBacterial transfer 0aPredictive microbiology1 aSaiz-Abajo, Mª.

In most species, the predominant anionic PL changes from phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) to phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGro). Because prior studies have shown that the change in the headgroup itself is functionally insignificant, we tested the hypothesis that the PtdIns and PtdGro contain different diacyl pairs. Experiments used electrospray‐ionization mass spectrometry to determine the molecular species in PtdIns, PtdGro, and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) in surfactant from newborn calves and cows. The profiles for the two anionic PL were distinct. The PtdIns contained long, unsaturated fatty acid chains and no disaturated species. The PtdGro more closely resembled the profile from PtdCho. For each headgroup, the molecular species for calf and cow were similar. The differences between the two anionic PL indicate that the switch from PtdIns to PtdGro during maturation involves more than simple substitution of the headgroup, and suggest that the functional significance of the shift may reflect the different pool of diacyl pairs.  aPublisher supplied data  aHL 54209cNational Institutes of Health  a136734cNational Institutes of Health  cAmerican Lung Association of Oregon 3acalves 3acows 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aneonates 3aphosphatidylcholines 3asurfactants1 aHall, Stephen B.0 tLipids.g2021 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.49-57dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.122733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04326naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002500188245007800213300001200291506007600303520248600379592002802865506003702893650003002930650003202960650002302992650000803015650002003023650001503043650002403058650002903082650002303111650001503134650001703149650000903166650001003175650001103185650001303196650002503209650001403234650002403248650004303272650001903315650001303334650001903347650002103366650001003387651001003397700002303407700002603430700001803456700002403474700002003498773009203518856008103610852000903691655001203700IND60124043620221207085104.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012404362DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-015-0824-32doi7 aPMC44073832pmcid7 a258864032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolano-Gallego, Laia10aAcute febrile illness is associated with Rickettsia spp infection in dogs  ap. 216.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Rickettsia conorii is transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks and causes Mediterranean Spotted Fever (MSF) in humans. Although dogs are considered the natural host of the vector, the clinical and epidemiological significance of R. conorii infection in dogs remains unclear. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether Rickettsia infection causes febrile illness in dogs living in areas endemic for human MSF. METHODS: Dogs from southern Italy with acute fever (n = 99) were compared with case–control dogs with normal body temperatures (n = 72). Serology and real-time PCR were performed for Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum/A. platys and Leishmania infantum. Conventional PCR was performed for Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Acute and convalescent antibodies to R. conorii, E. canis and A. phagocytophilum were determined. RESULTS: The seroprevalence rates at first visit for R. conorii, E. canis, A. phagocytophilum and L. infantum were 44.8%, 48.5%, 37.8% and 17.6%, respectively. The seroconversion rates for R. conorii, E. canis and A. phagocytophilum were 20.7%, 14.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The molecular positive rates at first visit for Rickettsia spp., E. canis, A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, L. infantum, Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. were 1.8%, 4.1%, 0%, 2.3%, 11.1%, 2.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Positive PCR for E. canis (7%), Rickettsia spp. (3%), Babesia spp. (4.0%) and Hepatozoon spp. (1.0%) were found only in febrile dogs. The DNA sequences obtained from Rickettsia and Babesia PCRs positive samples were 100% identical to the R. conorii and Babesia vogeli sequences in GenBank®, respectively. Febrile illness was statistically associated with acute and convalescent positive R. conorii antibodies, seroconversion to R. conorii, E. canis positive PCR, and positivity to any tick pathogen PCRs. Fourteen febrile dogs (31.8%) were diagnosed with Rickettsia spp. infection based on seroconversion and/or PCR while only six afebrile dogs (12.5%) seroconverted (P = 0.0248). The most common clinical findings of dogs with Rickettsia infection diagnosed by seroconversion and/or PCR were fever, myalgia, lameness, elevation of C-reactive protein, thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates acute febrile illness associated with Rickettsia infection in dogs living in endemic areas of human MSF based on seroconversion alone or in combination with PCR.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aC-reactive protein 3aDNA 3aEhrlichia canis 3aHepatozoon 3aLeishmania infantum 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aRickettsia conorii 3aantibodies 3adog diseases 3adogs 3afever 3ahumans 3alameness 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aprospective studies 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseroconversion 3aserology 3aseroprevalence 3athrombocytopenia 3aticks 3aItaly1 aCaprì, Alessandra1 aPennisi, Maria Grazia1 aCaldin, Marco1 aFurlanello, Tommaso1 aTrotta, Michele0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.216-216dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0824-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015500170300001400325520173900339592002802078650003102106650001502137650001902152650001902171650001102190650001302201650001102214650001002225650001202235650002202247650001302269650000702282650001902289650003402308650002102342650001602363650002002379650001802399653001902417653001302436653002902449653004702478700002702525700001702552773012002569856008202689852000902771655001202780IND60527912420221116160152.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052791242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBramhachari, P.V.10aBiodegradation of catechol by free and immobilized cells of Achromobacter xylosoxidans strain 15DKVB isolated from paper and pulp industrial effluents  ap. 36-44.  aThe aim of the current study was to isolate and characterize a strain which could utilize catechol as sole source of carbon and energy. The strain Achromobacter xylosoxidans 15DKVB was isolated from paper and pulp industrial effluent contaminated site of Harihar. In the present study 38 bacterial strains isolated were investigated for their ability to degrade catechol in MBM at different concentrations ranging from 100mg/L to 2000mg/L. The taxonomic position of strain 15DKVB was studied by sequencing of 16SrRNA gene with a GenBank accession number HQ448950. The maximum-likelihood algorithm showed that, strain 15DKVB formed a coherent cluster with the clade that comprised type strains of Achromobacter genus. The optimal temperature and pH for biodegradation of catechol by strain 15DKVB were 37°C and pH 7.5 respectively. Among the carbon and nitrogen sources tested, glucose (83.4%) and yeast extract (99.6%) showed highest catechol degradation. Interestingly the strain 15DKVB was able to degrade catechol completely up to 1600mg/L within 198h. Immobilization experiment demonstrated that freely suspended cells could degrade 500mg/L catechol within 60h of incubation, whereas, the same cell population in alginate-immobilized flask, amended with 500mg/L catechol was degraded in 42h. Our results evidently depict that physicochemical parameters of Harihar industrial effluents does not comply with national standards set by ISI to discharge the effluents into irrigation waters. The isolated strain 15DKVB could be a good alternative for the bioremediation of catechol contaminated paper and pulp industrial effluent water and soil. These findings may open new bioremediation applications for the degradation of catechol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter xylosoxidans 3aalgorithms 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acatechol 3aenergy 3agenes 3aglucose 3aimmobilized cells 3anitrogen 3apH 3apolluted soils 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3asoil remediation 3atemperature 3awater pollution 3ayeast extract 0aBiodegradation 0aCatechol 0aMineral base media (MBM) 0aAchromobacter Xylosoxidans, Immobilization1 aReddy, D.

Some A. veronii infections are serious enough to cause death. Lactobacillus plantarum, a probiotic, is one of the most environmentally friendly and safe alternatives to antibiotics for use as a feed additive for aquatic animals such as fish. The present study investigated the effects of L. plantarum C20015 on growth performance, immune responses, and eradication of A. veronii infection in koi carp. During a 6-week feeding experiment in an indoor aquarium and a 14-day A. veronii artificial infection experiment, a control diet group was fed with untreated feed twice a day, while experimental groups were given different concentrations of L. plantarum in their feed. The results indicated that the specific growth rate and percent weight gain of fish were significantly higher in the experimental groups than in the control diet group (P < 0.05). The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and lysozyme (LZM) and the levels of IgM antibody were significantly higher in the L. plantarum–supplemented groups than in the control diet group, and the enzymatic activity in the 10⁸ CFU/g C20015 group was higher than that in the 10⁷ CFU/g C20015 and 10⁹ CFU/g C20015 groups (P < 0.01). In contrast, alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity in the experimental groups was the highest at 42 days. All fish in the control diet group died 7 days after A. veronii infection. After 14 days, the relative percent survival (%, RPS) of the fish in the L. plantarum–supplemented groups was significantly higher than that of the fish in the control group, and the 10⁸ CFU/g C20015 group had the highest RPS. Therefore, we first reported that fish fed with 108 CFU/g of L. plantarum C20015 could promote food intake and growth for koi carp.  aPublisher supplied data  a20180101003JCcNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province  a20190201294JCcNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province 3aAeromonas veronii 3aCyprinus carpio 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantibiotics 3aantibodies 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3afeed additives 3afish communities 3afish diseases 3afood intake 3agrowth performance 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin M 3akoi 3alysozyme 3aornamental fish 3aperoxidase 3aprobiotics 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aweight gain1 aDong, Wen-long1 aChen, Long1 aWang, Yi-ming1 aMuhammad, Inam1 aJu, An-qi1 aShan, Xiao-feng1 aMa, Hong-xia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0165-44121 aKong, Ling-cong0 tAquaculture international.g2020 Oct., v. 28, no. 5 p.1797-1809dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl57531x0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-020-00558-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245008300166300001600249520110100265592002801366650001601394650001401410650002601424650001701450650001601467650001701483650001001500650001801510650001201528650002601540650001401566650002501580650002601605653002501631653001501656653002201671653001401693653002001707700003001727700002701757700002501784700002701809700002301836700002101859700002001880773011101900856008302011852000902094655001202103IND60628713620221121223646.0190415e20190204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062871362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2018.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonte, Isabel12aA Single JAZ Repressor Controls the Jasmonate Pathway in Marchantia polymorpha  ap. 185-198.  aJAZ proteins are negative regulators of jasmonate responses, acting both as repressors of transcription factors and as co-receptors of JA-Ile. The high redundancy of JAZ genes in angiosperms has hindered the characterization of a complete depletion of JAZ function. Moreover, the recent discovery that dn-OPDA is the jasmonate ligand in Marchantia polymorpha demonstrates that JA-Ile is not the sole COI1/JAZ ligand in land plants and highlights the importance of studying JAZ co-receptors in bryophytes. Here, we have exploited the low gene redundancy of the liverwort M. polymorpha to characterize the single MpJAZ in this early diverging plant lineage. We clarify the phylogenetic history of the TIFY family, demonstrate that MpJAZ is the ortholog of AtJAZ with a conserved function, and characterize its repressor activity of dn-OPDA responses. Our results show that, consistent with previous findings in Arabidopsis, MpJAZ represses jasmonates biosynthesis, senescence, and plant defenses, and promotes cell growth and reproductive fitness, highlighting the power of studies in Marchantia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aBryophyta 3aMarchantia polymorpha 3abiosynthesis 3acell growth 3aembryophytes 3agenes 3ajasmonic acid 3aligands 3amosses and liverworts 3aphylogeny 3areproductive fitness 3atranscription factors 0aJasmonate repressors 0aMarchantia 0aHormone signaling 0aevolution 0agene redundancy1 aFranco-Zorrilla, José M.1 aGarcía-Casado, Gloria1 aZamarreño, Angel M.1 aGarcía-Mina, José M.1 aNishihama, Ryuichi1 aKohchi, Takayuki1 aSolano, Roberto0 tMolecular plant.g2019 Feb. 04, v. 12, no. 2 p.185-198dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2018.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245009600174300001400270520131000284592002801594650001301622650002801635650002301663650001501686650001401701650002001715650001601735650001001751650001201761650001401773700002101787700002301808700003201831773007901863856008101942852000902023655001202032IND60575491120221119230940.0170728e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057549112DNAL7 a10.1007/s13237-016-0191-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sreeramulu Arun10aStudies on chromosomal characteristics of Ctenus indicus (Gravely 1931) (Araneae: Ctenidae)  ap. 17-23.  aThe karyological information gathered for the Indian spiders taxa thus far were cytologically derived from only few species but none for the representatives belonging to the genus Ctenus. Ctenus indicus (Gravely 1931), an Indian ctenid spider was cytogenetically analyzed following conventional, C- and NOR-banding techniques so as to gather substantial data for future course of understanding of karyotypic evolution among spider species. The karyotypic data for Ctenus indicus revealed the complement consisting of (2n = 28) 26AA + X₁X₂♂ and (2n = 30) 26AA + X₁X₁X₂X₂♀ acrocentric chromosomes. A closer scrutiny of meiotic progression disclosed many male pachytenic cells displaying the occurrence of ‘bouquet’ formation. The results of C-banding enabled in identifying centromeric constitutive heterochromatin locales, and in some chromosomes also the distal ends of telomeric regions. Silver nitrate stained NOR-specifications were noticed at the distal telomeric regions of two pairs of chromosomes (#8 and #10) in the complement. Cytological evidence procured from the present study not only adds to the ever-growing list of the spider cytogenetic assessments but also offers as a baseline data towards establishing evolutionary relationships within this important group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenidae 3aacrocentric chromosomes 3achromosome banding 3acomplement 3aevolution 3aheterochromatin 3akaryotyping 3amales 3ameiosis 3atelomeres1 aVenu, Govindappa1 aJayaprakash, Gowda1 aVenkatachalaiah, Govindaiah0 tNucleus.g2017 Apr., v. 60, no. 1 p.17-23dSpringer Indiax0029-568X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13237-016-0191-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001300169245010900182300001400291520127400305592002801579650002101607650001601628650001501644650002401659650001701683650002501700650003701725650001001762650001701772650002001789650000901809650005201818650001701870650002401887650002001911650001201931650004001943650003201983650004402015650003402059650003602093650000902129650005002138650002602188650002202214650000902236650002502245650007402270650002702344650003102371650001202402700001702414700001402431700001702445700001702462700001402479700001902493700001802512700001202530700001802542773010802560856008402668990002302752852000902775655001202784IND60097909920221119153622.0141104e20130305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009790992DNAL7 a233997682pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Jing10aBlocking of thromboxane A₂ receptor attenuates airway mucus hyperproduction induced by cigarette smoke  ap. 11-17.  aCigarette smoking is one of the risk factors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study, we investigated the effects of thromboxane A₂ (TxA₂) receptor antagonists on airway mucus production induced by cigarette smoke. Rats were exposed to cigarette smoke 1h/day, 6 days/week for 4 weeks. Seratrodast (2, 5, 10mg/kg day) was administered intragastrically prior to smoke exposure. Thromboxane B₂ (TxB₂) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues was determined by enzyme immunoassay. Airway mucus production was determined by alcin-blue/periodic acid sthiff (AB-PAS) staining, Muc5ac immunohistochemical staining, and RT-PCR. The phosphorylation of ERK and p38 was evaluated by Western blotting. Seratrodast reduced the overproduction of TxB₂ in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues. Cigarette smoke exposure markedly increased AB/PAS-stained goblet cells and rat Muc5ac expression in the airway, which was significantly attenuated by seratrodast administration. The induced phosphorylation of ERK and p38 was also attenuated by seratrodast. TxA₂ receptor antagonist could reduce Muc5ac production induced by cigarette smoke in vivo, possibly through the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantagonists 3acigarettes 3aenzyme immunoassays 3agoblet cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amucus 3apharmacology 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3asignal transduction 3asmoking (habit) 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Asthmatic Agentsxpharmacology 2aBenzoquinonesxpharmacology 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluidxchemistry 2aHeptanoic Acidsxpharmacology 2aLungxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aMucin 5ACxmetabolism 2aMucusxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Thromboxane A2, Prostaglandin H2xantagonists & inhibitors 2aSmokexadverse effects 2aThromboxane B2xmetabolism 2aTobacco1 aLi, Ji-Qiong1 aWang, Tao1 aLi, Xiao'ou,1 aGuo, Ling-Li1 aWan, Chun1 aLiao, Zeng-Lin1 aDong, Jia-Jia1 aXu, Dan1 aWen, Fu-Qiang0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 703, no. 1-3 p.11-17dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0423Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008700165500002200252520138500274592002801659650001601687650001101703650001701714650001001731650002101741650001201762650001401774650002101788650003301809650001401842650001601856650001901872650001401891650002901905650002601934653001601960653001301976653001601989653001002005653001102015700001402026700001202040700001502052700001702067700001802084773008902102856008302191852000902274655001202283IND60628713820221121223453.0190415e20181228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062871382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molp.2018.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Huijuan12aA Crucial Role of GA-Regulated Flavonol Biosynthesis in Root Growth of Arabidopsis  aPre-press version  aFlavonols have been demonstrated to play a series of important roles in plant growth, development, and communications with other organisms. Flavonol biosynthesis is spatiotemporally regulated by the subgroup 7 R2R3-MYB (SG7 MYB) transcription factors including MYB11/MYB12/MYB111. However, whether SG7-MYBs activity is subject to posttranslational regulation remains unclear. Here, we show that gibberellic acid (GA) inhibits flavonol biosynthesis via DELLA proteins in Arabidopsis. Protein interaction analyses revealed that DELLAs (RGA and GAI) interacted with SG7 MYBs (MYB12 and MYB111) both in vitro and in vivo, leading to enhancing the affinity of MYB binding to the promoter region of the key genes for flavonol biosynthesis, and their transcriptional levels. We also observed that the level of auxin in the root tip was negatively correlated to root flavonol content. Furthermore, genetic assays showed that loss-of-function mutations in MYB12 that is dominantly expressed in roots partially rescued the short root phenotype of the GA deficient mutant ga1-3 by increasing root meristem size and mature cell size. Consistently, exogenous application of the flavonol quercetin recovered root meristem size of myb12 ga1-3 to that of ga1-3. Taken together, our data elucidate a molecular mechanism by which GA promotes root growth via directly reducing flavonol biosynthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3agibberellic acid 3amutants 3aphenotype 3apromoter regions 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aquercetin 3aroot growth 3aroot meristems 3aroot tips 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aGibberellin 0aflavonol 0aroot growth 0aAuxin 0astress1 aMan, Cong1 aXie, Ye1 aYan, Jijun1 aChu, Jinfang1 aHuang, Jirong0 tMolecular plant.g2018 Dec. 28, dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000001387x1674-20527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2018.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013800169300001400307520068700321592002801008650002101036650001901057650002501076650001501101650003001116650001201146650001101158650001501169650002101184650002701205650001001232653002101242653002101263653000901284653001101293700001601304773012001320856008201440852000901522655001201531IND60527912720221116160121.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052791272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadhav, Swati B.10aStudies on application of β-1,3 glucanase in the degradation of glucans produced by Botrytis cinerea and inhibition of fungal growth  ap. 45-47.  aThe fungus Botrytis cinerea infect grapes and produces β-1,3 and β-1,6 glucans.

The glucanase enzyme showed effective hydrolysis of glucan produced by B. cinerea. The hydrolysed glucan solution could pass through the filter faster as compared to unhydrolysed glucan solution.

The reactions that occur are Claisen Schmidt condensation followed by Michael addition and Aldol reactions of heteroaryl carbaldehydes and acetyl pyridine derivatives. Mechanistic study of the reactions shows excellent self diastereoselectivity (dr > 99%) in the intermediate steps which results selectively in the formation of one set of enantiomers out of sixteen possible enantiomeric pairs. The self diastereoselectivity of reaction in all the steps dominates due to the steric hindrance induced by the bulky heteroaryl groups. The stereochemistry of the synthesized compounds is established using single crystal XRD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acondensation reactions 3adiastereoselective synthesis 3adiastereoselectivity 3aenantiomers 3amoieties 3apyridines 3astereochemistry 0aMetal free 0aDiastereoselective 0aBranch domino reaction 0aHeteroaryl 0a(±) Cyclohexanol 0aXRD1 aChadha, Anju0 tTetrahedron.g2018 Jan. 04, v. 74 p.204-216dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2017.11.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01549naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011600163300001400279520034000293592002800633650001800661650001400679650002300693650001400716650001700730650001600747650001600763651001000779653000800789653002200797653002200819653001500841653001300856700001800869700002000887700001700907700001700924773009500941856008201036852000901118655001201127IND60746969520221120121008.0210811e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074696952DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.1054.690752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ruiwen10aNew species of the genus Inversidens Haas, 1911 (Unionoida, Unionidae, Gonideinae) from Jiangxi Province, China  ap. 85-93.  aWe diagnose and describe a new freshwater mussel species of the genus Inversidens , I. rentianensis sp. nov. from Jiangxi Province, China based on morphological characters and molecular data.

Naloxone, an antagonist of opioid receptors, eliminates not only ventilatory depression but also analgesic effect of opioids. Pharmacological dissociation of adverse reactions from the main action is important clinically and basically. Cholinergic and serotonergic mechanisms are suggested to counteract the opioid-induced ventilatory disturbances, but their influence on analgesia is still controversial. The present study evaluated the effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and serotonin-1A (5-HT₁A) receptor agonists on morphine (1.0mg/kg, i.v.)-induced ventilatory depression and analgesia in rats. In anesthetized animals, spontaneous ventilation and hind leg withdrawal reflexes against nociceptive thermal stimuli were measured simultaneously. Physostigmine (0.1 and 0.2mg/kg, i.v.) and donepezil (0.5 and 1.0mg/kg, i.v.) relieved the morphine-induced ventilatory depression and enhanced its antinociception. On the other hand, (±)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.03 and 0.1mg/kg, i.v.) and buspirone (0.1 and 0.3mg/kg, i.v.) did not influence antinociception of morphine while they restored the decreased ventilation. In unanesthetized animals, hypercapnic ventilatory response was measured by using whole-body plethysmography. Physostigmine (0.3mg/kg, i.p.), donepezil (1.0mg/kg, i.p.), 8-OH-DPAT (0.3mg/kg, i.p.) and buspirone (3.0mg/kg, i.p.) all recovered the morphine (10mg/kg, i.p.)-induced depression of hypercapnic ventilatory response. The present study suggests that activation of cholinergic or serotonergic (5-HT₁A) mechanisms may be a useful therapeutic approach for morphine-induced ventilatory depression without loss of its analgesic action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aagonists 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesic effect 3aantagonists 3abreathing 3acholinesterase inhibitors 3adissociation 3amorphine 3analoxone 3anarcotics 3aphysostigmine 3arats 3areceptors 3areflexes 2a8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralinxpharmacology 2aAnalgesia 2aAnimals 2aBuspironexpharmacology 2aCholinesterase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aIndansxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMorphine 2aPainxdrug therapy 2aPhysostigminexpharmacology 2aPiperidinesxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aRespiratory Insufficiencyxchemically inducedxdrug therapy. 2aSerotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonistsxpharmacology1 aOhi, Yoshiaki1 aHaji, Akira0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Mar. 5, v. 703, no. 1-3 p.33-41dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001900168245009600187300001400283520104800297592002801345650001601373650001801389650001501407650002101422650002001443650001001463650004201473650001301515650001401528650002501542650001101567650001801578650002601596650001801622650003801640650002401678650002801702650003001730650001401760650002701774700001901801700001201820773007901832856008301911852000901994655001202003IND60080898520221120102125.0140812e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089852DNAL7 a214739072pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaozeng10aGlobal analysis of gene-level microRNA expression in Arabidopsis using deep sequencing data  ap. 40-46.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in eukaryotes. Exclusive focus on mature miRNA in most expression profiling efforts has prevented effective measurement of the expression of individual miRNA (MIR) genes. Using three sequenced small RNA libraries, we adapted miRDeep, which employs a probabilistic model of miRNA biogenesis, to analyze the miRNA transcriptome in Arabidopsis. We determined that less than 40% annotated MIR genes are expressed in shoot, root or inflorescence. We found that within paralogous families the expression pattern of individual genes correlates with the phylogenetic distance. Combining novel candidates identified in this study, we deduced the maximal number of expressed MIR genes. We further estimated the sequencing depth necessary to reach a near-saturated detection rate by curve fitting simulation. These results demonstrate that signature distribution of small RNA reads along the miRNA precursor is an effective model to profile MIR gene expression in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aRNA libraries 3abiogenesis 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicroRNA 3aphylogeny 3aprobabilistic models 3ashoots 3atranscriptome 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMicroRNAsxanalysis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, RNA1 aZhang, Huiyong1 aLi, Lei0 tGenomics.g2011 July, v. 98, no. 1 p.40-46dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03760naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245014600163300001600309520252000325592002802845650003502873650001902908650001602927650001102943650001002954650001502964650001802979650001002997650000903007653002903016653002903045653002403074653002103098653001203119700001403131773012303145856008503268852000903353655001203362IND60711959020221120121246.0201009e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071195902DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2020.17864742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLove, M10aMeasurement of serum zinc concentration in ruminants: a comparison of results from standard serum and specific trace element collection tubes  ap. 349-352.  aAims: To evaluate agreement between the concentration of Zn in serum from samples collected from cattle and sheep into standard collection tubes for serum and from samples collected into tubes developed for trace element measurement. Methods: Eighty-eight animals (78 cattle and 10 sheep) on eight farms had paired blood samples collected into standard serum and trace element vacutainers. The paired samples were submitted the same day to the laboratory to be tested for the concentration of Zn in serum using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The agreement between the paired results was then assessed using limits of agreement analysis. On one farm an additional 10 pairs of samples was taken from the same animals; this second set of paired samples was refrigerated for 48 hours prior to laboratory submission to identify the impact of delaying submission on the apparent concentration of Zn in serum. Results: The limits of agreement analysis found no evidence of a systematic difference between Zn concentrations in serum collected into standard serum tubes and into trace element tubes as neither the intercept nor the slope on the mean-difference plot were significantly different from zero. The SD of the difference between results increased as the concentration of Zn increased, so at the lowest Zn concentration reported in this study (6.9 μmol/L) the limits of agreement were ±1.07 μmol/L, while at the highest (23.5 μmol/L) they were ±3.39 μmol/L. Refrigerating the sample (as whole blood) for 48 hours prior to submission increased the apparent concentration of Zn in serum in both standard serum tubes and trace element tubes by 1.3 μmol/L (95% CI = 0.75–1.85). Conclusions: There was no evidence that the concentration of Zn in serum from standard serum tubes were artificially elevated. In contrast, delaying sample submission by 48 hours did elevate Zn concentrations. Clinical relevance: While these data apply only to the batch of vacutainers used in this study, there is unlikely to be much between batch variation in the potential for contamination. Thus these results suggest that monitoring zinc status in ruminants, by measuring the concentration of Zn in serum from samples collected into standard serum tubes does not result in clinically relevant alterations in Zn concentration compared to using specific trace element tubes. However delaying submission to the laboratory may result in significantly elevated concentrations of Zn in serum so should be avoided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acattle 3afarms 3amonitoring 3arefrigeration 3asheep 3azinc 0aSerum zinc concentration 0afacial eczema monitoring 0atrace element tubes 0ablood collection 0astorage1 aLaven, RA0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2020 Nov. 1, v. 68, no. 6 p.349-352dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2020.17864743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245008100175300001800256520203700274592002802311650002602339650004402365650002002409650004102429650002002470650003002490650001902520650001002539650001502549650001402564650001502578650001202593650001102605650003502616650002402651650001202675650002202687651001502709700002002724700002102744700001602765700002602781700001602807773013802823856008202961852000903043655001203052IND60707182820221120164536.0200819e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070718282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-020-00583-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakrobortty, Dipankar10aViral contamination of tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon broodstock in Bangladesh  ap. 2161-2172.  aStocking specific-pathogen-free (SPF) shrimp postlarvae (PL) has been reported to have much potential to enhance production by notably reducing the infection-driven mortality. In terms of SPF PL production in Bangladesh, except white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), several potential viruses such as hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), monodon baculovirus (MBV), hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV), and yellow head virus (YHV) which may synergistically cause mortality are ignored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the viral contamination in hatchery-brood-shrimps in Bangladesh as the broods horizontally and/or vertically transfer the viruses to their offspring. Five randomly selected representative hatcheries were investigated over 3 months (January to March) to know the status of viral contamination. Broods in all the hatcheries were found to be contaminated with WSSV, IHHNV, MBV, HPV, and YHV. The results showed that the prevalence of WSSV, MBV, HPV, and YHV did not significantly differ between hatcheries. The highest (72%) and the lowest (30%) prevalence of MBV and WSSV, respectively, were recorded in January. In February, the highest (81%) and the lowest (28%) prevalence were found in MBV and HPV, respectively, where the highest and the lowest prevalence were 88% and 40% for IHHNV and HPV, respectively, in March. The prevalence of IHHNV and MBV were not significantly different. The relative prevalence of WSSV, HPV, and YHV were significantly low compared with that of IHHNV and MBV. Notably, increasing water temperature from January (22 ± 0.71 °C) to March (27 ± 1 °C) increased the prevalence of all the viruses and subsequently the extremity of infection. The contamination in broods forwarding to the production of multiple-virus-contaminated PL is considered as an obstacle to higher production of shrimp at farm level in Bangladesh. Hence, the present study suggests focusing on the deleterious-virus-free shrimp broods in commercial shrimp hatcheries in Bangladesh.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGill-associated virus 3aInfectious hematopoietic necrosis virus 3aPenaeus monodon 3aPenaeus monodon nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aProtoparvovirus 3aWhite spot syndrome virus 3abreeding stock 3afarms 3ahatcheries 3amortality 3apostlarvae 3aprogeny 3ashrimp 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3aviral contamination 3aviruses 3awater temperature 3aBangladesh1 aAli, Md.

The new findings may be helpful for future for designing eco-friendly and energy sustainable strategies for selective oxygenation reactions using semiconductors, O2 and sunlight.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3adiastereoselectivity 3aorganic compounds 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3asinglet oxygen 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide 0aHeterogeneous photocatalysis 0aOxygenation 0aSelective oxidation 0aSolar synthesis 0aCascade reaction1 aBiswas, Subharanjan1 aWu, Wenli1 aZhu, Feng1 aTung, Chen-Ho1 aWang, Yifeng0 tTetrahedron.g2018 May 17, v. 74 p.2421-2427dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2018.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001700168245013800185300001400323520099400337592002801331650002301359650001101382650003101393650002301424650002601447650004301473650002001516650005201536650001001588650001301598650001601611650001901627650002401646650002001670650002001690650001701710650003101727650003801758650002001796650003901816650004101855650003401896650004001930650003601970700001802006700001702024700002002041700001902061700002002080700001902100700001502119700001802134700001402152700001602166700001302182773007902195856008302274852000902357655001202366IND60080898620221120102123.0140812e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089862DNAL7 a215698372pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Dongxia10aTranscriptome analysis reveals salt-stress-regulated biological processes and key pathways in roots of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)  ap. 47-55.  aHigh salinity is one of the main factors limiting cotton growth and productivity. The genes that regulate salt stress in TM-1 upland cotton were monitored using microarray and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) with samples taken from roots. Microarray analysis showed that 1503 probe sets were up-regulated and 1490 probe sets were down-regulated in plants exposed for 3h to 100mM NaCl, and RT-PCR analysis validated 42 relevant/related genes. The distribution of enriched gene ontology terms showed such important processes as the response to water stress and pathways of hormone metabolism and signal transduction were induced by the NaCl treatment. Some key regulatory gene families involved in abiotic and biotic sources of stress such as WRKY, ERF, and JAZ were differentially expressed. Our transcriptome analysis might provide some useful insights into salt-mediated signal transduction pathways in cotton and offer a number of candidate genes as potential markers of tolerance to salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3agene expression regulation 3ahormone metabolism 3amicroarray technology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregulator genes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asignal transduction 3asodium chloride 3atranscriptomics 3awater stress 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Markers 2aGossypiumxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics1 aZhang, Xueyan1 aZhao, Xinhua1 aLiu, Chuanliang1 aWang, Chunchao1 aZhang, Zhenghai1 aZhang, Chaojun1 aWei, Qiang1 aWang, Qianhua1 aYan, Hong1 aLi, Fuguang1 aSu, Zhen0 tGenomics.g2011 July, v. 98, no. 1 p.47-55dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03661naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016000166300001600326520207900342592002802421650002602449650001802475650002702493650001002520650001002530650001902540650001202559650001202571650001602583650001502599650000902614650001102623650002002634650001002654650001102664650002102675650001702696650001402713650001502727651001602742653001202758653001902770653002202789653001602811653002002827700001402847700001402861700001502875773012302890856008503013852000903098655001203107IND60711959120221120121249.0201009e20201101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071195912DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2020.17864752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNortjé, R10aChanges in the metabolic profiles of dairy cows before and after calving that were mainly fed fodder beet (Beta vulgaris vulgaris L.) during the dry period  ap. 353-358.  aCase history: Two commercial pasture-based farms within the North Canterbury district of New Zealand were feeding fodder beet (Beta vulgaris vulgaris L.) as a large proportion of the diet to cows during the dry period. On each farm 25 multiparous cows were blood sampled up to six times from 28 days before, to 21 days after calving (Day 0). Plasma samples were analysed for concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), Ca, Mg and P, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. The first sampling visit was performed when cows were being fed their maximum intake of fodder beet. Clinical findings: The mean body condition score (BCS) of cows on Farm 1 was 5.4 (95% CI = 5.3–5.6) and on Farm 2, 5.4 (95% CI = 5.3–5.6) at first sampling. Mean concentrations of BHBA increased between Days −15 and Day −8 then decreased postpartum on Day 2 before increasing again on Day 21. On Farm 2, concentrations remained low (<1.2 mmol/L) on all days of sampling. Mean concentrations of NEFA in plasma remained low during the periparturient period on Farm 1, then increased on Day 2. On Farm 2, concentrations were elevated above 0.3 mmol/L between Days −28 and −17 then decreased on Day −10, before increasing on Day 2. Mean concentrations of Ca, Mg and P were higher than threshold values on both farms prepartum. However on Day 2, there were 8/23 (35%) cows on Farm 1 and 6/23 (26%) cows on Farm 2 with concentrations of Ca in plasma <2.0 mmol/L, and 10/23 (44%) cows on Farm 1 and 8/23 (35%) cows on Farm 2 with concentrations of P in plasma <1.3 mmol/L. Mean AST activities remained relatively constant and below 130 IU/L on both farms at all sampling times. Clinical relevance: On both farms, post-partum hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia were common after calving despite differing fodder beet feeding and mineral supplementation regimes. There was more variation in energy status, especially prior to calving. More research is required on factors affecting mineral and energy status in dry cows fed fodder beet.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aBeta vulgaris 3aaspartate transaminase 3abeets 3ablood 3abody condition 3acalcium 3acalving 3acow feeding 3adairy cows 3adiet 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3afarms 3aforage 3afree fatty acids 3ahypocalcemia 3amagnesium 3aphosphorus 3aNew Zealand 0agrazing 0atransition cow 0ametabolic profile 0afodder beet 0adry cow feeding1 aLaven, RA1 aAllott, B1 aKenyon, AG0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2020 Nov. 1, v. 68, no. 6 p.353-358dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2020.17864753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001700176245010000193300001500293520115000308592002801458650001201486650001401498650002201512650001301534650001901547650001601566700001501582700001901597700002601616773015201642856006901794856009901863990002301962852000901985655001201994IND60643874120221120185350.0190514e20160227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064387412DNAL7 a10.3791/537452doi7 aPMC48281892pmcid7 a269675442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jin-Tae10aThree-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry for turbulence applications: case of a jet flow  ap. e53745.  a3D-PTV is a quantitative flow measurement technique that aims to track the Lagrangian paths of a set of particles in three dimensions using stereoscopic recording of image sequences. The basic components, features, constraints and optimization tips of a 3D-PTV topology consisting of a high-speed camera with a four-view splitter are described and discussed in this article. The technique is applied to the intermediate flow field (5 <x/d <25) of a circular jet at Re ≈ 7,000. Lagrangian flow features and turbulence quantities in an Eulerian frame are estimated around ten diameters downstream of the jet origin and at various radial distances from the jet core. Lagrangian properties include trajectory, velocity and acceleration of selected particles as well as curvature of the flow path, which are obtained from the Frenet-Serret equation. Estimation of the 3D velocity and turbulence fields around the jet core axis at a cross-plane located at ten diameters downstream of the jet is compared with literature, and the power spectrum of the large-scale streamwise velocity motions is obtained at various radial distances from the jet core.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3aequations 3aintermediate flow 3atopology 3aturbulent flow 3avelocimetry1 aKim, David1 aLiberzon, Alex1 aChamorro, Leonardo P.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Feb. 27, , no. 108 p.e53745-e53745dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/537453Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53745/three-dimensional-particle-tracking-velocimetry-for-turbulence  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245010400212300001100316520154600327592002801873650001701901650001701918650003101935650002301966650001901989650001502008650001702023650001102040650002502051700002402076700002802100700002802128773012702156856008302283852000902366655001202375IND60746969820221120095243.0211103e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074696982DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-021-00821-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Meer, Tom V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2418-909310aMacroinvertebrate interactions stimulate decomposition in WWTP effluent-impacted aquatic ecosystems  ap. 65.  aAquatic ecosystems worldwide are impacted by an influx of nutrients and sludge particles from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents, leading to a degradation of benthic habitats and a loss of associated macroinvertebrate taxa. Hence, in habitats impacted by WWTPs, only a few tolerant macroinvertebrate taxa remain. These tolerant detritivore macroinvertebrate taxa play an important role in the degradation of organic matter, and biotic interactions between these taxa may either enhance or reduce the rate of sludge degradation. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine if the interaction between asellids and tubificids, both highly abundant in systems impacted by WWTP effluent, enhances the degradation of sludge. To this end, growth and reproduction of both taxa, sludge degradation and nutrient concentrations in the overlying water were measured in a 28-day laboratory experiment, subjecting WWTP sludge to 4 treatments: a control without macroinvertebrates, a tubificid, an asellid, and an asellid + tubificid treatment. Sludge degradation, phosphate concentration in the overlying water and asellid reproduction were enhanced when asellids and tubificids were jointly present, whereas tubificid growth and reproduction were hampered in comparison to the tubificid treatment. Hence, our results suggest that the biotic interactions between these tolerant detritivores stimulate sludge degradation, and thus possibly mitigating the negative impacts of WWTP-derived sludge particles on the benthic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic zone 3adetritivores 3alaboratory experimentation 3amacroinvertebrates 3aorganic matter 3aphosphates 3areproduction 3asludge 3awastewater treatment1 avan der Lee, Gea H.1 aVerdonschot, Ralf C.

We study the classical thermoresponsive microgel model system N-isopropylacrylamide cross-linked with N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide. Without the typically used polyelectrolyte coating of the substrate, thin microgel films are prepared in a single spin-coating step. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal an extremely dense packing, resulting in a homogeneous compact thin film of microgel particles. The hydration kinetics of these films in H₂O and D₂O atmospheres as well as the kinetics of the solvent exchange between both water species are investigated with in situ time-of-flight neutron reflectometry (TOF-NR) and in situ Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. With accounting for a nonconstant humid atmosphere, the intrinsic diffusion dynamics of water molecules into the thin microgel film are modeled and the specific time constant τ and the effective Flory–Huggins interaction parameter χₑff are determined. Comparing the results in H₂O and D₂O atmospheres, TOF-NR and FTIR spectroscopy results show an increased affinity of the microgel films toward H₂O as compared to D₂O. From the FTIR spectroscopy data, we further identify different kinetics of intermolecular processes and order them according to their temporal evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3adeuterium oxide 3aelectrolytes 3afilms (materials) 3amicrogels 3amodels 3areflectometry 3asolvents1 aKreuzer, Lucas P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9669-21301 aHohn, Nuri1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2865-22651 aBießmann, Lorenz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1046-12361 aWang, Kun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0729-26781 aRinner, Stephan1 aMoulin, Jean-François1 aSchmid, Andreas J.1 aHannappel, Yvonne1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9166-74301 aWrede, Oliver1 aKühnhammer, Matthias1 aHellweg, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2394-58461 avon Klitzing, Regine1 aMüller-Buschbaum, P.q(Peter),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9566-60880 tLangmuir.g2019 Nov. 12, v. 35, no. 49 p.16341-16352dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b031043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245013500178300001500313520151300328592002801841650002001869650001801889650001501907650004301922650001301965650000701978650001601985650003302001650001102034650001602045653002002061653001802081653002402099653005002123653003902173653001702212700003602229773012102265856008202386852000902468655001202477IND60527913120221116160142.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052791312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaby, Kumaranthara Chacko10aEffect of enzyme pretreatment on yield and quality of fresh green chilli (Capsicum annuum L) oleoresin and its major capsaicinoids  ap. 95-101.  aThe effect of enzyme pretreatment on extraction yield and quality of oleoresin from fresh green chilli (Capsicum annuum L) samples and its major capsaicinoids were evaluated using various enzymes viz., Celluclast 1.5L, Pectinex Ultra SP.L, ViscozymeL, Protease and an equal combination of Celluclast 1.5L, Pectinex Ultra SP.L and ViscozymeL. Optimization of the enzyme activity was carried out by varying the enzyme concentration, reaction temperature, pH, and incubation time. The quality of the oleoresin was further evaluated using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with Photo Diode Array (PDA) detector. Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) studies were conducted to visualize the effect of these enzymes on green chilli cell walls. It was observed that the capsaicinoids recovery was higher in ViscozymeL pretreated green chilli (22%) followed by chilli pretreated with enzymes Celluclast (20%) Pectinex (17.5%) and Protease (14%) with respect to the control sample. The HPLC finger printing of capsaicinoids showed no alterations in their profile as compared with the control sample. The SEM analysis revealed that the enzyme pretreatment, especially with enzymes ViscozymeL and Celluclast was potentially effective in rupturing the cell walls and making them more susceptible to extraction medium. In economic point of view, the results of the present study could be used effectively in the spice industry to increase the extraction yield and quality of oleoresin from green chilli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3acapsaicinoids 3acell walls 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3apH 3aproteinases 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspices 3atemperature 0aCapsicum annuum 0aCapsaicinoids 0aEnzyme pretreatment 0aHigh Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) 0aScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 0aGreen chilli1 aRanganathan, Thottiam Vasudevan0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2016 July, v. 7 p.95-101dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2016.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245012800176300001600304520141700320592002801737650001501765650002401780650001801804650001101822650001401833650002801847650002001875650001801895650002801913650001301941650000901954650001401963650001401977650001501991650000702006650001302013650001602026650002202042650001302064650001002077653001402087653001502101653003002116653002202146653002002168700002502188773012202213856008202335852000902417655001202426IND60527913220221116160302.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052791322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlajuyigbe, Folasade M.10aEnhanced production and physicochemical properties of thermostable crude cellulase from Sporothrix carnis grown on corn cob  ap. 110-117.  aIncreasing demand for highly thermostable cellulases for biotechnology and industrial applications is a serious challenge. Production of thermostable cellulase from Sporothrix carnis cultivated on corn cob, a readily available and affordable agricultural residue, was investigated. Effects of some supplements such as carbohydrates, amino acids and metal ions on cellulase production were evaluated. Crude cellulase from S. carnis was characterized in order to evaluate its potentials for industrial applications. Maximum yield of cellulase (285.7U/ml) was at 96h of cultivation using 2.5% inoculum at pH 6.0. Xylan, glutamic acid, tyrosine and Mn2+ enhanced enzyme production with an increase of about 250%. The crude cellulase had optimum activity at 80°C and was highly stable at elevated temperatures (50–90°C) with residual activities above 70% after 120min of incubation. The enzyme showed 75% residual activity after 300min of incubation at 80°C. The crude enzyme had optimum pH of 5.0 and was stable over wide pH range (3.0–9.0) with residual activity above 60% after 180min of incubation. Activity of cellulase was remarkably enhanced in the presence of almost all organic solvents studied. Metal ions (Mn2+, Cu2+, Mg2+ and Fe2+) increased enzyme activity, with 350% relative activity in the presence of 5mM Mn2+. Results reveal potentials of cellulase from S. carnis for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporothrix 3aagricultural wastes 3abiotechnology 3acopper 3acorn cobs 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3aglutamic acid 3aindustrial applications 3ainoculum 3airon 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3apH 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atyrosine 3axylan 0aCellulase 0aProduction 0aOrganic solvent-tolerance 0aSporothrix carnis 0aThermostability1 aOgunyewo, Olusola A.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2016 July, v. 7 p.110-117dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2016.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018400170300001800354500001900372520229800391536024802689592002802937650005202965650001303017650001503030650001603045650001503061650001503076650001503091650001803106700001303124700002203137700001903159773014003178856008503318852000903403655001203412IND60711959320221120121456.0201009e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071195932DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2020.17393532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Taeyoung10aOn-orbit NOAA-20 VIIRS solar diffuser bidirectional reflectance distribution function and screen transmittance characterization using yaw manoeuvres and regular on-orbit SDSM data  ap. 6503-6526.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOn-orbit radiometric calibration of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) NOAA-20 satellite is dependent on Solar Diffuser (SD) and Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor (SDSM) observations for the Reflective Solar Bands (RSBs). The time-dependent degradation of the SD Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) (called H-factor) is measured by the SDSM. To reduce direct illumination from the Sun, SD and SDSM have two independent screens called SD Screen (SDS) and SDSM Sun view screen. Once the instrument is on-orbit, the product of the SD BRDF and SDS transmittance can only be measured by VIIRS and SDSM detectors through the Rotating Telescope Assembly (RTA) and SDSM SD viewport, respectively. Using pre-launch parameter tables, the initial H-factor trends showed abnormal oscillations. To validate the functionality of the pre-launch tables, the NOAA-20 VIIRS spacecraft performed 15 yaw manoeuvres on 25 January and 26 January 2018 as a part of post-launch tests. During the yaw manoeuvres, on-orbit SD and SDSM data were collected and used to characterize the SD screen transmittance functions with BRDFs and the SDSM Sun view screen transmittance functions. On-orbit estimated SD/SDSM BRDFs and SDSM Sun screen transmittance functions showed some differences from the pre-launch version, especially with the SDSM Sun view screen transmittance function. This problem was not resolved by applying the initial yaw manoeuvre-derived table. As an alternative approach, NOAA VIIRS team applied a methodology to add fine features in the SDSM Sun transmittance function from the one-year regular on-orbit SDSM collections to cover a full operational range of the solar azimuth angle in the SDSM Sun viewport. After applying additional SDSM detector gain corrections, the yaw manoeuvre and on-orbit regular SDSM data points are aligned that reduced abnormally large degradations in SDSM detector 6, 7, and 8. Finally, 1% level H-factor oscillations are reduced to 0.2% level. Corresponding SD F-factors, scaling calibration coefficients, are calculated and deliver to the NOAA’s Interface Data Processing Segment (IDPS) to generate the official VIIRS Science Data Record (SDR) products.  aThe paper contents are solely the opinions of the authors and do not constitute a statement of policy, decision, or position on behalf of NOAA or the U.S. government.

The hybrid-based electrode sensor showed attractive electrochemical performance for sensitive and selective nonenzymatic detection of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline, with wide linear detection range (0.5 μM to 50 mM), low detection limit (60 nM), and good sensitivity (39.2 μA mM–¹ cm–²), and without any interference by common interfering agents. In addition, the sensor exhibited a high capability for glucose sensing and H₂O₂ detection in human urine. More interestingly, the hybrid was found to be nontoxic, and the electrode sensor could sensitively detect a trace amount of H₂O₂ in a nanomolar level released from living tumor cells (HeLa and HepG2). Because the hybrid presents significant properties for the detection of bioactive species and certain cancerous cells by the synergistic effect from RGO, PMS, and AuNPs, it could be able to serve as a versatile platform for biosensing, bioanalysis, and biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aglucose 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananogold 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphosphates 3aporous media 3asilica 3asynergism 3aurine 0abiosensing 0acancer detection 0agold nanoparticles 0aperiodic mesoporous silica 0areduced graphene oxide1 aSreejith, Sivaramapanicker1 aMandal, Amal Kumar1 aMa, Xing1 aZhao, Yanli0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 Aug. 27, v. 6, no. 16 p.13648-13656dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam503110s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02411naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012500153300001600278520129000294592002801584650001501612650001101627650001401638650002001652650001601672650002201688650003001710650001501740650002001755651000901775700001401784700001401798700001601812700001701828773009801845856007301943852000902016655001202025IND50090252720221118184828.0150206e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009025272DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.120412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, F.12aA rapid diagnostic tool for two species of Tetradacus (Diptera: Tephritidae: Bactrocera) based on species‐specific PCR  ap. 418-422.  aBactrocera minax and Bactrocera tsuneonis are two sibling species of the Bactrocera subgenus Tetradacus with significant quarantine importance in Asia. It is difficult to identify or distinguish them only based on morphological characteristics. In this study, microscopic observations showed that morphological features of adult samples were congruent with the diagnosis of the two species. In this study, we describe species‐specific PCR for the molecular identification of B. minax and B. tsuneonis. Species‐specific primer pairs were designed on the basis of variations in the mtDNA COI barcode sequences among Bactrocera spp.. A 499 bp‐specific fragment of B. minax and a 337 bp absolute product of B. tsuneonis were generated by their respective primer pairs, whilst no such diagnostic bands were present in any of the other fruit fly species tested. The results of the sensitivity test demonstrated that the detection limit of DNA template concentration was 1 ng/μl for B. minax and 0.1 ng/μl for B. tsuneonis. This assay exhibited high specificity, reliability, rapid and low cost for all ontogenetic stages. Our data show that species‐specific PCR is a powerful tool that can be used for the identification of B. minax and B. tsuneonis in quarantine work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera 3aadults 3abarcoding 3adetection limit 3afruit flies 3amitochondrial DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquarantine 3asibling species 3aAsia1 aLi, Z.

Organoid formation and the process of organogenesis share common developmental pathways; thus, our knowledge of developmental biology can help model the complexity of different organs to refine organoids into a more sophisticated platform. The developmental process is strongly dependent on complex networks and communication of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions among different cell populations and their microenvironment, during embryogenesis. These interactions affect cell behaviors such as proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation. Co-culture systems within the organoid technology were recently developed and provided the highly physiologically relevant systems. Supportive cells including various types of endothelial and stromal cells provide the proper microenvironment, facilitate organoid assembly, and improve vascularization and maturation of organoids. This review discusses the role of the co-culture systems in organoid generation, with a focus on how knowledge of developmental biology has directed and continues to shape the development of more evolved 3D co-culture system-derived organoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoculture 3aembryogenesis 3amedicine 3aorganogenesis 3aorganoids 0aDevelopmental biology 0aOrganoid technology 0aCo-culture 0aStromal cells 0aEndothelial cells1 aKhoshdel-Rad, Niloofar1 aMirzaei, Hamed1 aShpichka, Anastasia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9918-99791 aTimashev, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7773-24351 aMahmoudi, Tokameh1 aVosough, Massoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5924-43660 tDevelopmental biology.g2021 July, v. 475 p.37-53dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2021.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03585naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245013100203300001800334520186000352592002802212596005702240596008502297650002002382650000802402650004402410650003402454650002002488650001202508650001702520650000902537650001802546650001502564650001102579650001402590650002002604650002102624650003502645650001302680650001202693700001802705700001702723700002502740700006202765700002102827773013902848856008302987852000903070655001203079IND60746970220221122010112.0211001e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074697022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-021-03870-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoeda, Sota1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5921-843212aA recessive gene pepy-1 encoding Pelota confers resistance to begomovirus isolates of PepYLCIV and PepYLCAV in Capsicum annuum  ap. 2947-2964.  aKEY MESSAGE: A begomovirus resistance gene pepy-1, which encodes the messenger RNA surveillance factor Pelota, was identified in pepper (C. annuum) through map-based cloning and functional characterization. Pepper yellow leaf curl disease caused by begomoviruses seriously affects pepper (Capsicum spp.) production in a number of regions around the world. Ty genes of tomato, which confer resistance to the tomato yellow leaf curl virus, are the only begomovirus resistance genes cloned to date. In this study, we focused on the identification of begomovirus resistance genes in Capsicum annuum. BaPep-5 was identified as a novel source of resistance against pepper yellow leaf curl Indonesia virus (PepYLCIV) and pepper yellow leaf curl Aceh virus (PepYLCAV). A single recessive locus, which we named as pepper yellow leaf curl disease virus resistance 1 (pepy-1), responsible for PepYLCAV resistance in BaPep-5 was identified on chromosome 5 in an F₂ population derived from a cross between BaPep-5 and the begomovirus susceptible accession BaPep-4. In the target region spanning 34 kb, a single candidate gene, the messenger RNA surveillance factor Pelota, was identified. Whole-genome resequencing of BaPep-4 and BaPep-5 and comparison of their genomic DNA sequences revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (A to G) located at the splice site of the 9th intron of CaPelota in BaPep-5, which caused the insertion of the 9th intron into the transcript, resulting in the addition of 28 amino acids to CaPelota protein without causing a frameshift. Virus-induced gene silencing of CaPelota in the begomovirus susceptible pepper No.218 resulted in the gain of resistance against PepYLCIV, a phenotype consistent with BaPep-5. The DNA marker developed in this study will greatly facilitate marker-assisted breeding of begomovirus resistance in peppers.  aPublisher supplied data  a19H02950cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJSPS-DG-RSTHE Joint Research ProgramcJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aCapsicum annuum 3aDNA 3aPepper yellow leaf curl Indonesia virus 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3agenetic markers 3aintrons 3aleaf curling 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3amonitoring 3apepper 3aphenotype 3arecessive genes 3aresistance genes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atomatoes 3aviruses1 aOnouchi, Mika1 aMori, Namiko1 aPohan, Nadya Syafira1 aNagano, Atsushi J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7891-50491 aKesumawati, Elly0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2021 Sept., v. 134, no. 9 p.2947-2964dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-021-03870-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001400168245013900182300001600321520100400337592002801341650002501369650001701394650001401411650001401425650002001439650001001459650001801469650000901487650002501496650000701521650001501528650005201543650002201595650001701617650002501634650001201659650002301671650001101694650002001705650002601725650000901751650000901760650002301769650003101792650002301823650004401846650003401890700001701924700001801941700001401959700001801973773008101991856008302072852000902155655001202164IND60080899020221122130719.0140812e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089902DNAL7 a216002802pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.04.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ying10aCloning and identification of two novel NBCe1 splice variants from mouse reproductive tract tissues: A comparative study of NCBT genes  ap. 112-119.  aNa⁺-coupled HCO₃⁻ transporters (NCBTs) of the SLC4 family play critical roles in pH regulation as well as transepithelial HCO₃⁻ transport. We systematically examined, in the mouse reproductive tract tissues, the mRNA expression of five NCBTs as well as the five NBCe1 (Slc4a4) variants NBCe1-A through -E, of which NBCe1-D and NBCe1-E are novel. Cloning of NBCe1-D and NBCe1-E, both lacking a 27-nucleotide cassette I, reveals a novel alternative splicing unit in the mouse Slc4a4 gene. Transcripts of Slc4a4 lacking cassette I are expressed in diverse murine tissues as shown by RT-PCR analysis and in diverse tissues of other vertebrate species as shown by blast against GenBank database. Genomic sequence analysis indicates that cassette I of SLC4A4 is conserved in all NCBT genes except for SLC4A5, which presumably lost cassette I during its evolution. Our present study represents an important step towards understanding the molecular physiology of NBCe1, and presumably other NCBTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative splicing 3abicarbonates 3adatabases 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphysiology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atransporters 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aGenitaliaxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aProtein Isoformsxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSodium-Bicarbonate Symportersxgenetics 2aTissue Distributionxgenetics1 aXu, Jiu-Ying1 aWang, Deng-Ke1 aWang, Lei1 aChen, Li-Ming0 tGenomics.g2011 Aug., v. 98, no. 2 p.112-119dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013700169300001800306520127000324592002801594650001401622650002301636650002301659650002101682650001801703650001301721650002101734650001101755650001901766650001401785650002201799650003701821700001401858700001701872700001501889700005301904700005101957700005102008700005602059773012002115856008402235852000902319655001202328IND60677902520221118070051.0191213e20191125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067790252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.9b007572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Ruining10aFunctional Isotactic Polypropylenes via Efficient Direct Copolymerizations of Propylene with Various Amino-Functionalized α-Olefins  ap. 9280-9290.  aA series of novel amino-containing isotactic polypropylenes with high molecular weight and satisfying functional comonomer incorporation were synthesized via direct copolymerization of propylene and α-olefin containing bulky groups protected amino. The highly efficient postmetallocene catalyst system, (pyridylamido)Hf/[Ph₃C][B(C₆F₅)₄]/AliBu₃, exhibited overwhelmingly favorable reactivity toward α-olefin over amino olefin moieties, effectively promoted the copolymerization of propylene with 5-(N,N-diisopropylamino)-1-pentene, 5-(N,N-diphenylamino)-1-pentene, and 4-(7-octen-1-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline, respectively, under mild reaction conditions, in which very high catalytic activity (up to 7.44 × 10⁶ gₚₒₗyₘₑᵣ molCₐₜ.–¹ h–¹) was achieved. The obtained functional copolymers were proved to exhibit high molecular weight (up to 5.90 × 10⁵), amino olefin comonomer incorporation (up to 11.6 mol %) and tacticity ([mmmm] > 99%). Besides, most of the copolymers exhibited high melting points and thermostability (Td around 450 °C). Representative physical properties such as UV–vis absorption and mechanical performances of the newly obtained functional iPPs with different tertiary amine groups have also been explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3amelting point 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3aolefin 3apolypropylenes 3apropylene 3athermal stability 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aGao, Huan1 aLuo, Faliang1 aLi, Yulian1 aWang, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3130-32291 aMa, Zhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2458-41971 aPan, Li1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9463-68561 aLi, Yuesheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4637-42540 tMacromolecules.g2019 Nov. 25, v. 52, no. 23 p.9280-9290dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b007573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002100176245015200197300001500349520139300364592002801757650001501785650002701800650001401827650006601841650001601907650004401923650002101967650002001988650002402008650002302032650001002055700001902065700002502084773015202109856006902261856010602330990002302436852000902459655001202468IND60643874420221120200600.0190514e20160324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064387442DNAL7 a10.3791/537482doi7 aPMC48413052pmcid7 a270778952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatnayake, Sunil10aSequencing of plant wall heteroxylans using enzymic, chemical (methylation) and physical (mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance) techniques  ap. e53748.  aThis protocol describes the specific techniques used for the characterization of reducing end (RE) and internal region glycosyl sequence(s) of heteroxylans. De-starched wheat endosperm cell walls were isolated as an alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR)1 and sequentially extracted with water (W-sol Fr) and 1 M KOH containing 1% NaBH4 (KOH-sol Fr) as described by Ratnayake et al. (2014)2. Two different approaches (see summary in Figure 1) are adopted. In the first, intact W-sol AXs are treated with 2AB to tag the original RE backbone chain sugar residue and then treated with an endoxylanase to generate a mixture of 2AB-labelled RE and internal region reducing oligosaccharides, respectively. In a second approach, the KOH-sol Fr is hydrolyzed with endoxylanase to first generate a mixture of oligosaccharides which are subsequently labelled with 2AB. The enzymically released ((un)tagged) oligosaccharides from both W- and KOH-sol Frs are then methylated and the detailed structural analysis of both the native and methylated oligosaccharides is performed using a combination of MALDI-TOF-MS, RP-HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and ESI-MSn. Endoxylanase digested KOH-sol AXs are also characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that also provides information on the anomeric configuration. These techniques can be applied to other classes of polysaccharides using the appropriate endo-hydrolases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell walls 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aendosperm 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amethylation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3apotassium hydroxide 3asodium borohydride 3awheat1 aFord, Kristina1 aBacic, A.q(Antony),0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Mar. 24, , no. 109 p.e53748-e53748dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/537483Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53748/sequencing-plant-wall-heteroxylans-using-enzymic-chemical-methylation  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245010700165300001600272500001500288520126400303592002801567650001201595650001101607650001301618650001501631650001301646650001101659650000901670650001201679651002101691653001601712700001801728700002001746773009901766856007301865852000901938655001201947IND50090260320221118184836.0150218e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009026032DNAL7 a10.1111/fog.120722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnauffer, Evgeniya L.10aModelling the dispersal of herring and hake larvae in the Strait of Georgia for the period 2007–2009  ap. 375-388.  a2019-12-05  aThe Strait of Georgia (SoG), between Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia, is a larval rearing ground for both hake and herring stocks, which are commercially important. Year‐to‐year variability in larval retention within the strait is examined by simulating drift tracks of larvae for these species using an ocean circulation model and a particle‐tracking model. Larvae with different vertical swimming behaviors were tracked in the springs of 2007, 2008, and 2009. Since herring larvae mostly stay near the surface, their distribution is heavily influenced by the wind. Strong winds to the north soon after the hatching period tend to wash herring larvae out of SoG and winds to the south help retain herring larvae inside the Strait. In 2007, the model indicates a massive wind‐driven export of herring larvae which may have led to the observed failure of herring production. In contrast, hake larvae reside deeper in the water column (50–200 m). Their distribution is less sensitive to surface forcing but is shaped by a deep gyre with cross‐strait currents. This study also suggests that the northern and southern SoG are weakly connected for herring larvae dispersal, which makes both regions potentially important to recruitment.  aPublisher supplied data 3arearing 3amodels 3aswimming 3awind speed 3ahatching 3alarvae 3ahake 3aherring 3aBritish Columbia 0arecruitment1 aMasson, Diane1 aAllen, Susan E.0 tFisheries oceanography.g2014 July, v. 23, no. 4 p.375-388dBlackwell Sciencex1054-60067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fog.120723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02714naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245017800178300001800356520138200374592002801756650001301784650001801797650001501815650001101830650001201841650001101853650002301864650001701887650002301904650001701927650001301944653004701957653001302004653002302017653002202040700002202062773012802084856008302212852000902295655001202304IND60753096120221117091157.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075309612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasquadibisceglie, Andrea10aStructural determinants of ligands recognition by the human mitochondrial basic amino acids transporter SLC25A29. Insights from molecular dynamics simulations of the c-state  ap. 5600-5612.  aIn mitochondria, metabolic processes require the trafficking of solutes and organic molecules, such as amino acids. This task is accomplished by the Mitochondrial Carrier Family members (also known as SLC25), among which the SLC25A29 is responsible for the translocation of basic amino acids. In this regard, nitric oxide levels originated by the arginine mitochondrial catabolism have been shown to strongly affect cancer cells’ metabolic status. Furthermore, the metabolic disease saccharopinuria has been linked to a mitochondrial dysregulation caused by a toxic intermediate of the lysine catabolism. In both cases, a reduction of the activity of SLC25A29 has been shown to ameliorate these pathological conditions. However, no detailed structural data are available on SLC25A29. In the present work, molecular modelling, docking and dynamics simulations have been employed to analyse the structural determinants of ligands recognition by SLC25A29 in the c-state. Results confirm and reinforce earlier predictions that Asn73, Arg160 and Glu161, and Arg257 represent the ligand contact points I, II, and III, respectively, and that Arg160, Trp204 and Arg257 form a stable interaction, likely critical for ligand binding and translocation. These results are discussed in view of the experimental data available for SLC25A29 and other homologous carriers of the same family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3abiotechnology 3acatabolism 3ahumans 3aligands 3alysine 3ametabolic diseases 3amitochondria 3amolecular dynamics 3anitric oxide 3atoxicity 0aMitochondrial carrier of basic amino acids 0aSLC25A29 0aLigand recognition 0aMolecular docking1 aPolticelli, Fabio0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2021, v. 19 p.5600-5612dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01606naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009000160300001600250520055900266592002800825650001800853650002400871650003000895650002900925650001500954650001900969650001500988650001701003650001601020650002101036773012801057856007401185852000901259655001201268IND60765104320221119163226.0220904e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510432DNAL7 a10.17221/3865-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobšíková, R.10aAcute toxicity of carbofuran to selected species of aquatic and terrestrial organisms  ap. 103-108.  aCarbofuran is an anticholinesterase carbamate commonly used as an insecticide, nematicide and acaricide in agricultural practice throughout the world.

Pathological investigation revealed macroscopic lesion of pale, friable, haemorrhagic and swollen liver. Hydropericardium was seen in most of the cases. Occasionally, the pericardial fluid was coagulated giving cloudy appearance. Kidneys were pale and swollen. Histopathologically, changes like necrotic foci and reticulation in hepatic parenchyma were commonly observed, with presence of fatty changes in most of the instances. Intranuclear inclusions were often detected in hepatocytes that were taken as diagnostic for IBH. The disease occurred alone or in association with infectious bursal disease and colibacillosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3abroiler chickens 3ahepatitis 3ahepatocytes 3ahistopathology 3ainfectious bursal disease 3aliver 3apericardium 0aBroiler 0aHydropericardium 0aInclusion body hepatitis1 aPanda, S.K.1 aPanda, H.K.1 aAcharya, A.P.1 aDas, Nabagopal,d1910-0 tIndian journal of veterinary pathology.g2015 Mar. 1, v. 39, no. 1 p.46-49dIndian Association of Veterinary PathologistswJournal:1998x0973-970X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00010.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014400162300001400306520123200320592002801552650002501580650002801605650002501633650002801658650001301686650001501699650001701714650001401731650001201745650001201757650001301769650004401782650003401826650002301860653002501883653002501908653002801933653002001961653002301981700001902004700001802023700001202041700001302053700001202066700005702078773011902135856008102254852000902335655001202344IND60558372220221122031330.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055837222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hang10aSpoilage potential of three different bacteria isolated from spoiled grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) fillets during storage at 4 °C  ap. 10-17.  aIn this study, the growth of Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas jessenii and Shewanella putrefaciens in sterile grass carp fillets stored at 4 °C was evaluated, as well as their effect on physicochemical and sensory spoilage. A. hydrophila and P. jessenii strains increased rapidly during the first 10 days, but S. putrefaciens showed a lag phase. The highest producers of total volatile basic nitrogen were A. hydrophila and P. jessenii, which reached a maximum level around 30 mg/100 g after 16 days. P. jessenii was an active producer of biogenic amines in grass carp fillets and was the only bacterium that produced histamine among the three bacteria. All the inoculated samples produced abundant cadaverine, which reached 51.5, 54.8 and 37.8 mg/mL for A. hydrophila, P. jessenii, and S. putrefaciens, respectively. The influence of bacteria on the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value of grass carp fillets was slight. Volatile compounds, such as tetradecanal and 1-hexadecanol, were detectable only for S. putrefaciens, which also produced the highest amount of 1-octen-3-ol, nonanal and 2-ethylcyclohexanol. P. jessenii produced high levels of ketones such as 2-nonanone and 2-undecanone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aPseudomonas jessenii 3aShewanella putrefaciens 3abacteria 3acadaverine 3afish fillets 3ahistamine 3aketones 3aoctenol 3aspoilage 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3avolatile compounds 0aAeromonas hydrophila 0aPseudomonas jessenii 0aShewanella putrefaciens 0aBiogenic amines 0aVolatile compounds1 aLiu, Xiaochang1 aZhang, Yuemei1 aLu, Han1 aXu, Qian1 aShi, Ce1 aLuo, Yongkang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1049-68150 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 Aug., v. 81 p.10-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245014900176520136100325592002801686650001601714650001601730650001501746650001701761650000901778650001501787650000901802653002601811653002801837653003501865653001601900653002501916653001301941700002301954700002401977773011902001856008802120852000902208655001202217IND60733324920221121035818.0220906e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073332492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1468752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRommel, Steffen H.10aSequential extraction of heavy metals from sorptive filter media and sediments trapped in stormwater quality improvement devices for road runoff  aThe performance of stormwater quality improvement devices (SQIDs), commonly based on sedimentation and media filtration, is generally examined either at lab scale or in field tests. However, there has so far been only little investigation into the remobilization of heavy metals retained in sediments and sorptive filter media. It is, moreover, unknown whether current lab-scale experiments are able to replicate the conditions of full-scale operation. To assess the potential impact of differences in conditions between lab-scale and field tests on the strength of association of heavy metals, filter media taken from three SQIDs were subjected to analysis by sequential extraction after prestressing both on a lab scale and in field tests. Sediments and filter cake trapped in the SQIDs were additionally analyzed. These displayed significantly higher heavy metal content than filter media that had been prestressed in the field. The zinc in the sediments and filter media displayed particularly high mobility. This study reveals a discrepancy between field and lab-scale conditions that creates differences in the content and strength of association of heavy metals. It is hence possible to show that previous lab-scale experiments potentially overestimated the risk of heavy-metal leaching, due to their predominant occurrence in more mobile fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3afilter cake 3afiltration 3aheavy metals 3arisk 3astormwater 3azinc 0aSorptive filter media 0aRoad-deposited sediment 0aManufactured treatment devices 0aRoad runoff 0aStormwater treatment 0aLeaching1 aStinshoff, Philipp1 aHelmreich, Brigitte0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 782 p.146875-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1468753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001600191245014100207300001800348506007600366520167200442592002802114506003702142650001702179650001102196650001002207650002102217650001702238650002202255650003002277650002102307650000902328650002002337650002902357650002602386653004102412653008702453653002302540653001402563653002402577700001602601700002102617700002302638700002902661700003102690773009202721856008402813852000902897655001202906IND60542008920221207103144.0161020e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054200892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.03.0042doi7 aPMC43356562pmcid7 a246318282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicca, Anna12aA comparison among the tissue-specific effects of aging and calorie restriction on TFAM amount and TFAM-binding activity to mtDNA in rat  ap. 2184-2191.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM) is regarded as a histone-like protein of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), performing multiple functions for this genome. Aging affects mitochondria in a tissue-specific manner and only calorie restriction (CR) is able to delay or prevent the onset of several age-related changes also in mitochondria.Samples of the frontal cortex and soleus skeletal muscle from 6- and 26-month-old ad libitum-fed and 26-month-old calorie-restricted rats and of the livers from 18- and 28-month-old ad libitum-fed and 28-month-old calorie-restricted rats were used to detect TFAM amount, TFAM-binding to mtDNA and mtDNA content.We found an age-related increase in TFAM amount in the frontal cortex, not affected by CR, versus an age-related decrease in the soleus and liver, fully prevented by CR. The semi-quantitative analysis of in vivo binding of TFAM to specific mtDNA regions, by mtDNA immunoprecipitation assay and following PCR, showed a marked age-dependent decrease in TFAM-binding activity in the frontal cortex, partially prevented by CR. An age-related increase in TFAM-binding to mtDNA, fully prevented by CR, was found in the soleus and liver. MtDNA content presented a common age-related decrease, completely prevented by CR in the soleus and liver, but not in the frontal cortex.The modulation of TFAM expression, TFAM-binding to mtDNA and mtDNA content with aging and CR showed a trend shared by the skeletal muscle and liver, but not by the frontal cortex counterpart.Aging and CR appear to induce similar mitochondrial molecular mechanisms in the skeletal muscle and liver, different from those elicited in the frontal cortex.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afrontal lobe 3agenome 3aliver 3alow calorie diet 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprecipitin tests 3arats 3askeletal muscle 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aMitochondrial Transcription Factor A 0aMitochondrial Transcription Factor A–mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid binding 0aTissue-specificity 0aAging rat 0aCalorie restriction1 aPesce, Vito1 aFracasso, Flavio1 aJoseph, Anna-Maria1 aLeeuwenburgh, Christiaan1 aLezza, Angela Maria Serena0 tBBA - General Subjects.g2014 July, v. 1840 p.2184-2191dElsevier B.V.x0304-41657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2014.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016400165300001400329520105600343592002801399650002201427650001401449650002101463650002101484650000901505650001901514650001901533650001401552650002401566650001301590650001701603650001801620650001601638650002801654650001801682653002001700653002201720653001901742653001401761653002001775653001301795653001801808653002101826653000701847653000901854653000701863653000701870653000801877653000801885653000801893653000901901653000901910653001001919653001101929700001901940700002201959700002201981700002802003773012602031856008102157852000902238655001202247IND60113646820221118002213.0190318e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011364682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoman, Olesea10aOxidative reactivity of unsaturated fatty acids from sunflower, high oleic sunflower and rapeseed oils subjected to heat treatment, under controlled conditions  ap. 49-59.  aThe oxidation kinetics of three vegetable oils (sunflower, high oleic sunflower and rapeseed) were followed during heat treatment (100 °C, 120 °C and 150 °C for 6 h), in the absence or presence of α-tocopherol (around 15 × 10−4 molL−1) or a mixture of α-tocopherol and chlorogenic acid (around 15 × 10−4 molL−1 of each). The kinetics were followed by measuring several chemical markers: fatty acids, conjugated dienes, hydroperoxides and aldehydes. The results showed that the unsaturation degree of the oils tested was the predominant parameter influencing the progress of oxidation kinetics. In this sense, sunflower oil was systematically more oxidized than rapeseed oil, which itself was more oxidized than high oleic sunflower oil.Oxygenation conditions and oil temperature were also determinant inducers of oxidation. The addition of α-tocopherol significantly delayed the formation of oxidation products while chlorogenic acid did not enhance the oxidative stability of oils but protected α-tocopherol during heating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aaldehydes 3aalpha-tocopherol 3achlorogenic acid 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydroperoxides 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3arapeseed 3arapeseed oil 3asunflower oil 3atemperature 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3avegetable oil 0aLipid oxidation 0aConjugated dienes 0aHydroperoxides 0aSunflower 0aOleic sunflower 0aRapeseed 0aα-Tocopherol 0aChlorogenic acid 0aSO 0aHOSO 0aRO 0aLH 0aLAH 0aLBH 0aLCH 0aLOOH 0aL• 0aLO• 0aLOO•1 aHeyd, Bertrand1 aBroyart, Bertrand1 aCastillo, Roberto1 aMaillard, Marie-Noëlle0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 June, v. 52, no. 1 p.49-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01575naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013600167300001400303520043600317592002800753650001600781650001800797650002300815650001100838650002500849653001800874653002000892653003000912653001700942653001300959700002400972700001800996773010601014856008401120852000901204655001201213IND60598947820221120132840.0180702e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059894782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2014.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDey, Supriya10aDense network of OH⋯O and CH⋯O interactions in the solid state structure of n-pentyl-2-chloro-2-deoxy-α-d-manno-sept 3-uloside  ap. 37-42.  aSingle crystal X-ray structural analysis of a septanoside, namely, n-pentyl-2-chloro-2-deoxy sept-3-uloside (1) provides many finer details of the molecular structure, in addition to its preferred twist-chair conformation, namely, ⁵,⁶TC3,4 conformation.

Therefore, a study was carried out to know the land characteristics for determining suitability and management of land for tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) culture in brackishwater ponds to increase the productivity and sustainability. Factors considered in land characteristics are: topography and tidal range, soil quality, water quality and climate. Spatial analysis in Geographic Information System is used for determining the land suitability for tiger prawn culture in brackishwater ponds. Land management is determined based on land characteristics to conform to technology that can be applied in brackishwater ponds. The results of study showed that brackishwater ponds soil in Luwu Regency are classified as acid sulfate soil and acid sulfate soil associated with peat soils that are characterized by low pH and macro nutrient content as well as high potential acidity and toxic elements content. Texture is generally classified as loamy sand, sand, sandy clay loam and sandy loam. Water quality in general can support brackishwater pond culture, except the forms of nitrogen which has relatively high content. Low rainfall was found from September to February and high rainfall in the other months. The analysis shows the actual land suitability of the existing brackishwater ponds in Luwu, namely 11,740.9 ha, where no land is classified as highly suitable (S1 class), 10,434.4 ha classified as moderately suitable (S2 class) and 1,306.5 ha classified as marginally suitable (S3 class) for tiger prawn culture. One of the recommendations for land management is through remediation, in the form of drying, submerging and flushing or liming for improving soil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPenaeus monodon 3aacid sulfate soils 3aacidity 3abrackish water 3aclay 3aclimate 3acoasts 3adrying 3afish 3ageographic information systems 3aland suitability 3aliming 3anitrogen 3anutrient content 3apH 3apeat soils 3apond culture 3aponds 3arain 3aremediation 3asand 3asandy loam soils 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3asoil quality 3atexture 3atopography 3atoxic substances 3awater quality 3aIndonesia1 aHasnawi, Hasnawi1 aAsaad, Andi Indra Jaya1 aPaena, Mudian0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2014 Dec., v. 18, no. 6 p.595-608dSpringer-Verlagx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-014-0327-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010700161300001500268520139700283592002801680650003501708650001801743650002101761650001101782650001501793650001601808650001001824650001301834650001301847651001301860773011601873856007801989852000902067655001202076IND60765104720221119163206.0220419e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510472DNAL7 a10.17221/3869-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaganová, V.10aTaxonomic reliability of leaf and fruit morphological characteristics of the Pyrus L. taxa in Slovakia  ap. 98-107.  a&nbsp;A population of 1,149 pear individuals from Slovakia is analysed according to their morphological characteristics of fruits and leaves. Three basic taxa were identified &ndash; Pyrus pyraster, Pyrus amphigenea and Pyrus nivalis. Qualitative traits (shape of leaf blade, fruit shape, type of leaf or fruit base, etc.) allowed the exact identification of a particular taxon only in some cases. Quantitative characteristics of leaves proved to be more suitable for the identification of analysed taxa. Statistically significant differences were found between all studied taxa in the values of leaf length and width, and also in the values of relative characteristics that described the leaf shape. Exceptionally the length of leaf petiole had very variable values (S<sub>x</sub><sub>% </sub>= 25.70&ndash;29.75%), therefore it was impossible to classify the species according to this character. Generally, fruit shapes and dimensions are less representative for taxonomy use although significant differences between all studied taxa were found in the values of fruit length. The correct taxonomic classification of pears cannot be done according to one characteristic. It is important to consider a few of them (shape and length of leaf blade or its slenderness, shape quotients and also the shape and length of fruits) for the appropriate classification of pear individuals. &nbsp; &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrus communis subsp. pyraster 3aPyrus nivalis 3afruit morphology 3afruits 3aleaf blade 3aleaf length 3apears 3apetioles 3ataxonomy 3aSlovakia0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 30, no. 3 p.98-107dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3869-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012100156300002000277520123600297592002801533650004401561650002201605650003701627650001401664650002301678650002301701650001801724650001901742650001801761650001301779650001801792650002001810650003301830650002301863700002501886700001801911700001601929700001801945700001601963700001601979773012401995856007402119852000902193655001202202IND60672341220221118061721.0191016e20191007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234122DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra05172d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Huizhi12aA noble bimetal oxysulfide CuVOS catalyst for highly efficient catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol and organic dyes  ap. 31828-31839.  aA novel copper–vanadium bimetallic oxysulfide (CuVOS) nanoparticle catalyst was successfully synthesized by a facile method. The samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), UV-Vis diffuse spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and N₂ adsorption–desorption isotherms. In order to check the catalytic efficiencies toward reduction reaction, 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and other organic dyes such as rhodamine-B (RhB), methylene blue (MB), and methyl orange (MO) were used. The results showed that the CuVOS prepared in the presence of a suitable amount of N₂H₄ during the synthesis of the nanoparticles exhibited the fastest reduction capabilities by using NaBH₄ as a reducing agent. It was demonstrated that a 100 mL 4-NP (20 ppm) solution was completely reduced by 5 mg CuVOS-3 within 2 min. Moreover, the complete reduction of 100 mL of MO, RhB, and MB solutions of 100 ppm was also achieved by 5 mg CuVOS-3 within 2 min, 6 min, and 5 min, respectively. Hence, the CuVOS is an efficient catalyst for reducing 4-NP and organic dyes and can have great potential for industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3amethyl orange 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen 3ap-nitrophenol 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium borohydride1 aZelekew, Osman Ahmed1 aChen, Xiaoyun1 aGuo, Yuanbo1 aKuo, Dong-Hau1 aLu, Qingxin1 aLin, Jinguo0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 07, v. 9, no. 55 p.31828-31839dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05172d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002500183245013600208300001800344506007600362520182300438592002802261506003702289650000802326650003202334650002102366650001102387650001902398700001802417700001702435700002102452700002102473700002302494700002202517773013202539856007802671852000902749655001202758IND60541308620221207061122.0160821e20150805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054130862DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b020742doi7 aPMC49253162pmcid7 a261477142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPugliese, Kaitlin
M.10aProcessive Incorporation of Deoxynucleoside Triphosphate Analogs by Single-Molecule DNA Polymerase I (Klenow Fragment) Nanocircuits  ap. 9587-9594.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA polymerases exhibit a surprising tolerance for analogs of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), despite the enzymes’ highly evolved mechanisms for the specific recognition and discrimination of native dNTPs. Here, individual DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (KF) molecules were tethered to a single-walled carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (SWCNT-FET) to investigate accommodation of dNTP analogs with single-molecule resolution. Each base incorporation accompanied a change in current with its duration defined by τcₗₒₛₑd. Under Vₘₐₓ conditions, the average time of τcₗₒₛₑd was similar for all analog and native dNTPs (0.2 to 0.4 ms), indicating no kinetic impact on this step due to analog structure. Accordingly, the average rates of dNTP analog incorporation were largely determined by durations with no change in current defined by τₒₚₑₙ, which includes molecular recognition of the incoming dNTP. All α-thio-dNTPs were incorporated more slowly, at 40 to 65% of the rate for the corresponding native dNTPs. During polymerization with 6-Cl-2APTP, 2-thio-dTTP, or 2-thio-dCTP, the nanocircuit uncovered an alternative conformation represented by positive current excursions that does not occur with native dNTPs. A model consistent with these results invokes rotations by the enzyme’s O-helix; this motion can test the stability of nascent base pairs using nonhydrophilic interactions and is allosterically coupled to charged residues near the site of SWCNT attachment. This model with two opposing O-helix motions differs from the previous report in which all current excursions were solely attributed to global enzyme closure and covalent-bond formation. The results suggest the enzyme applies a dynamic stability-checking mechanism for each nascent base pair.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acarbon nanotubes 3amodels 3apolymerization1 aGul, O.

To assist this trend, a number of techniques were integrated into a single instrumental platform for high-throughput quality analysis of new strawberry cultivars. This platform was used to monitor the intrinsic properties of strawberries during ripening and to identify differences in sensory quality among nine strawberry cultivars.Through multivariate statistical analysis, 1-penten-3-ol was identified as a marker for unripe strawberries, whereas esters as methyl butanoate, pentyl acetate and methyl hexanoate distinguish ripe strawberries. Furthermore, ripe strawberries were characterized by higher sugar levels and decreased acidity and firmness. Additionally, the high-throughput platform could successfully discriminate between the different tested cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aacidity 3abreeding 3acultivars 3afirmness 3aflavor 3amultivariate analysis 3aripening 3astrawberries 3asugars 0aFragaria × ananassa 0aFlavor 0aAroma 0aAnti-oxidants 0aChemometrics 0aHS SPME fast GC–MS 0aQuality 0aRipening 0aCultivar1 aVermeir, S.1 aMayayo Martinez, C.1 aHendrickx, Y.1 aLammertyn, J.1 aNicolaï, B.M.1 aHertog, M.L.A.T.M.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 July, v. 52, no. 2 p.62-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2011.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245016800170300001600338520132400354592002801678650002201706650003501728650001701763650001701780650003901797650001601836650002801852650001301880650002501893650001401918650002001932650002701952653004101979653002302020653001802043653002302061700001802084773012702102856008402229852000902313655001202322IND60543955720221117230951.0190415e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054395572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtusci.2015.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Vinayika10aInvestigations of mixed surfactant systems of lauryl alcohol-based bissulfosuccinate anionic gemini surfactants with conventional surfactants: A fluorometric study  ap. 477-489.  aIn this study, fluorescence techniques have been utilized to investigate the association and aggregation properties of aqueous solutions of a pure lauryl alcohol-based bis-sulfosuccinate anionic gemini surfactant (BSGSLA1,8) with a flexible methylene (CH2)8 spacer. In addition to the fluorescence interaction behaviour of surfactant solutions of BSGSLA1,8 mixed with conventional surfactants, surfactant formulations using the anionic (sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)), cationic (cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)) and non-ionic surfactants (Triton X-100) used in industrial applications were also studied. The aggregation number and micropolarity of the pure and mixed surfactant systems were investigated using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. The electrolyte effect of different concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) on the aggregation number and micropolarity was also explored for pure BSGSLA1,8. The best synergistic behaviour of BSGSLA1,8 was obtained with SDS compared to CTAB and Triton X-100. The maximum reduction of the pyrene intensity ratio (I1/I3) was observed with a BSGSLA1,8 and SDS mixed surfactant solution. The enhanced I1/I3 value of the mixed gemini Triton X-100 solution showed that mixed system is not as compact as pure BSGSLA1,8 surfactant micelles in the non-ionic surfactant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3aelectrolytes 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorometry 3aindustrial applications 3amicelles 3anonionic surfactants 3aoctoxynol 3asodium chloride 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 0aBis-sulfosuccinate gemini surfactant 0aAggregation number 0aMicropolarity 0aElectrolyte effect1 aTyagi, Rashmi0 tJournal of Taibah University for Science.g2015 Oct., v. 9, no. 4 p.477-489dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23224x1658-36557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtusci.2015.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01597naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007900169300001400248520055800262592002800820650002100848650001300869650001500882650001500897653001400912653002000926700001600946700001600962700001700978700001400995773015501009856008601164852000901250655001201259IND60721264020221121060627.0201224e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072126402DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2015.00016.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrar, A.P.S.10aHematological changes in neonatal diarrheic calves of different age groups  ap. 73-77.  aThe study was conducted on 100 neonatal calves of different age groups suffering from diarrhoea to identify any changes in the hematology.

The aim of this work was to reveal the efficiency order of soy protein isolate (SPI), soluble starch (ST), maltodextrin (MD), and Doikham soybean flour (SBF) for protecting B. subtilis SB-MYP-1 cells under sub-lethal stress of freeze-dried encapsulation. The combination criteria, including the survival rate, low water activity, and moisture content of freeze-dried cells with SBF, were approximately 63.72% (1.30 × 108 CFU/g as cell viability), 0.285, and 2.31% wet basis, respectively, which were relative to the standard quality of powdered starter culture. In addition, the cell membrane fluidity, metabolic retardation, activities of three intracellular enzymes (glutamate dehydrogenase, GDH; 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, GOGAT; and glutamine synthetase, GS), and pgsB gene expression of freeze-dried cells were maintained by SBF protection. Surprisingly, the mode of action of SBF could preserve the protein stabilization, phospholipid bilayer, and peptidoglycan surface in freeze-dried cells, whereas the partial cell surface and lipid bilayer of cells with SPI, ST and MD were destroyed after sub-lethal freeze drying.

It was found that compared with the un-promoted catalyst, when Sm was added at a proper content, the catalyst showed a larger BET surface area and promoted the formation of iron particles with a smaller size. The presence of Sm could increase the surface charge density of iron, which enhanced the Fe–C bond and promoted the stability and amount of CO dissociated adsorption, as confirmed by XPS and CO-TPD. Furthermore, according to MES, Sm could promote the formation of Fe₅C₂, which was the active phase of FTS. In addition, Sm could also enhance the basicity of the catalysts and suppress the H₂ adsorption capacity, which inhibited the hydrogenation reaction and the conversion of olefins to paraffins, as verified by the results of CO₂-TPD and H₂-TPD.

Dispersed MIP–MWCNTs indicated good tendency and selectivity to low amounts of morphine in relatively acidic condition. Some important factors containing buffer and its pH, ionic buffer, incubation time, eluent, etc., were optimized for extraction step. KMnO₄–carbon dots (C-dots) chemiluminescence (CL) reaction was applied as recognition device for extracted morphine. Morphine can linearly quench the CL emission of this system via its interaction with C-dots. The calibration graph was obtained in the range of 0.003–1.2 mg L⁻¹ morphine concentration with a detection limit (3 s) of 0.82 μg L⁻¹. The relative standard deviation (RSD%) for five determinations of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.8 mg L⁻¹ morphine were 1.11%, 2.54% and 1.98%, respectively. The developed method has acceptable features in comparison with other reported methods and was satisfactorily applied to the accurate determination of morphine in pharmaceutical and urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3acalibration 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemiluminescence 3acopolymerization 3adetection limit 3amorphine 3apH 3apolymers 3astandard deviation 3aurine1 aKarimi, Sepideh1 aHassanzadeh, Javad0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 29, v. 6, no. 96 p.93445-93452dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra22074f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008600168300001600254520132200270592002801592650004401620650001301664650001901677650001001696650001601706650001901722650001101741650000701752650001901759650001101778650003301789650002101822653001301843653002001856653001901876653001901895653000901914700003201923700002701955700002001982700001702002773012702019856008502146852000902231655001202240IND60543956120221118133403.0200330e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054395612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtusci.2015.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJawad, Ali H.10aKinetics of photocatalytic decolourization of cationic dye using porous TiO2 film  ap. 352-362.  aIn this work, the kinetics of the photocatalytic decolourization of methylene blue (MB) is investigated using different surface morphologies of multilayer TiO₂ coating onto a glass plate under irradiation from a 55-W household florescent lamp. A simple direct dip-coating technique was used, and the coating properties of TiO₂ powder were improved by adding epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) as an organic binder in the coating formulation. The effects of the fundamental parameters that govern the kinetics of the photocatalytic decolourization of MB, such as the mass of TiO₂ coated onto the glass plate, the pH and the TiO₂ surface morphology, were also studied. The kinetics of the MB decolourization in all cases was found to be pseudo-first-order kinetics and was fitted to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. The degraded part of the ENR binder led to generating pores within the surface of the TiO₂/ENR film and converting it into porous form, as confirmed by SEM analysis. Furthermore, TGA, FTIR and leachability analyses were conducted to further confirm the depletion of the ENR from the TiO₂/ENR film. The kinetics of the MB decolourization and the efficiency of the MB colour removal indicated that the porous TiO₂/ENR film becomes approximately twice as fast as the non-porous TiO₂/ENR film.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acoatings 3adecolorization 3aglass 3airradiation 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3arubber 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atitanium dioxide 0aKinetics 0aDecolourization 0aMethylene blue 0aImmobilization 0aTiO21 aMubarak, Nur Shazwani Abdul1 aIshak, Mohd Azlan Mohd1 aIsmail, Khudzir1 aNawawi, W.I.0 tJournal of Taibah University for Science.g2016 May, v. 10, no. 3 p.352-362dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23224x1658-36557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtusci.2015.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245012300158300001600281520152300297592002801820650001901848650001301867650001801880650001401898650001101912650001301923650001101936650001201947650001201959700001701971700001501988700001902003700001502022773011702037856007802154852000902232655001202241IND60765105220221119163327.0220904e20111128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510522DNAL7 a10.17221/3873-hortsci2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolák, J.10aDifference in reactions of apricot and peach cultivars to Plum pox virus: serological and symptomatological evaluation  ap. 129-134.  aDifferences in reactions to infection and different development of Plum pox virus (PPV) symptoms were observed in leaves and fruits of one hundred sixty-five apricot and seventy-nine peach cultivars and hybrids. A very broad spectrum of reactions from high susceptibility to high resistance and immunity was proved in apricot cultivars and hybrids and the results were published (Pol&aacute;k et al. 1997). A much narrower spectrum of reactions was proved in peach cultivars. Relative concentrations of PPV by ELISA in flowers, intensity of virus symptoms in leaves and fruits of peach cultivars were evaluated. The relative concentration of PPV coat protein (PPV-CP) in flowers was found to be positively correlated with the intensity of leaf and fruit symptoms in most cultivars. On the basis of obtained results cultivars of peaches were divided into four groups and classified as medium resistant, tolerant, medium susceptible and susceptible to PPV. None of the investigated cultivars was immune, highly resistant or resistant to PPV. Eighteen peach cultivars were classified to be medium resistant to PPV. Nine peach cultivars were characterized as tolerant to PPV, with high relative concentration of PPV-CP protein in flowers and mild symptoms in leaves and fruits. Twenty-seven peach cultivars were characterized as medium susceptible to PPV. Twenty-five peach cultivars were rated as susceptible to PPV. It is recommended to grow medium resistant peach cultivars in the areas where PPV is widely distributed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlum pox virus 3aapricots 3acoat proteins 3acultivars 3afruits 3aimmunity 3aleaves 3apeaches 3aviruses1 aOukropec, I.1 aKrška, B.1 aPívalová, J.1 aMiller, W.0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 30, no. 4 p.129-134dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3873-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013200163506010400295506007600399520225600475592002802731506003702759650001202796650001902808650001902827650001602846650002002862650001802882650001302900650001202913650002002925650001702945651001102962653002002973653003002993653001403023653002103037653002603058773009903084856008203183852000903265655001203274IND60753097420221207074252.0220714s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075309742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crm.2021.1003702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiréhn, L.10aClimate indices for the tailoring of climate information – A systematic literature review of Swedish forestry and agriculture  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClimate information is an important support for national adaptation plan processes, but there is at the same time a general desire that climate information should be more relevant and appropriate in relation to decision-making contexts. An initial step in such a development towards tailored climate information would be to understand the currently available climate indices, their definitions and contexts. This study systematically reviews the scientific literature on climate indices and factors related to specific climate impacts, and in this way identifies currently available climate indices for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The identified indices are analysed relative to climate change impact categories from the vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans set out by the Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, to indicate development potentials and research gaps in climate indices. The review identifies 79 definitions of climate indices for forestry and 63 indices for agriculture in Sweden. The reviewed literature has employed or developed climate indices for only 11 of the 25 types of climate impact emphasised as important by the two sectoral authorities. Most of the climate indices identified have been adopted for use in modelling forest growth or crop growth and productivity. The results of the review found indices lacking for a substantial number of impacts that are relevant for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The study shows that scientific literature on climate indices to a very limited degree addresses the specific tailoring of climate indices. Potential reasons for the lack of climate indices are discussed, and the study suggests that there is a need to continue climate model development such that the models better represent relevant processes, to advance research on the co-design of indices together with sectoral stakeholders, and to enhance collaboration between adaptation, impact modelling and climatology research. The results of this study may be used in future research to analyse if and how the identified climate indices can be actionable for different stakeholders, and as a foundation to examine the demands and feasibilities of developing new tailored climate indices.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3adecision making 3aforest growth 3aforestry 3aforests 3arisk management 3astakeholders 3aSweden 0aClimate indices 0aClimate change adaptation 0aCo-design 0aClimate services 0aTailoring information0 tClimate risk management.g2021, v. 34 p.100370-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23250x2212-09637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2021.1003703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245019100185300001600376520142100392592002801813650001401841650001401855650002001869650001201889650002101901650002601922650002201948650002301970650001801993650000902011650001202020650001402032650001102046650001102057650001202068650003902080650001402119650002202133650002502155650001402180650003702194650001902231650001102250651000902261651001702270651001302287651000902300651001302309653002902322653002802351653003802379653001702417653002002434700001802454700001402472700001802486700001502504700001802519700001202537700001802549700001502567773012102582856008102703852000902784655001202793IND4462295120221120150922.0160325e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446229512DNAL7 a215548002pmid7 a10.1017/S000748531100023X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTantrawatpan, C.10aGenetic differentiation among populations of Brachytrupes portentosus (Lichtenstein 1796) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) in Thailand and the Lao PDR: the Mekong River as a biogeographic barrier  ap. 687-696.  aThe Mekong River is known to act as a boundary between a number of terrestrial and freshwater species, including various parasites and their intermediate hosts as well as endangered mammal species. Little information is available, however, on the genetic differentiation between terrestrial invertebrates to the east and the west of this wide river. The genetic diversity among eight natural populations of Brachytrupes portentosus (Lichtenstein, 1796) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) collected from Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) were analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. The allelic profiles of 20 enzymes encoding 23 loci were analyzed. An average of 41% fixed differences was detected between the populations from Thailand and Lao PDR, which are separated by the Mekong River. The percent fixed differences ranged between 4% and 26% within the populations from Thailand and between 4% and 22% within the populations from Lao PDR. A phenogram shows that the eight populations fell into two major clusters based on the Thai and Lao sampling sites. The genetic distance between the samples within Thailand and within Lao PDR was related to the distances between sampling areas. The genetic variability between populations of this cricket indicates that genetic relationships are influenced by a natural barrier as well as by the geographical distance between these allopatric populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGryllidae 3aallopatry 3aelectrophoresis 3aenzymes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3aintermediate hosts 3ainvertebrates 3aloci 3amammals 3aparasites 3apeople 3arivers 2aAnimals 2aElectrophoresis, Cellulose Acetate 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aGryllidaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPhylogeography 2aRivers 3aLaos 3aMekong River 3aThailand 0aLaos 0aThailand 0aBrachytrupes portentosus 0agenetic differentiation 0amultilocus enzyme electrophoresis 0aMekong River 0anatural barrier1 aSaijuntha, W.1 aPilab, W.1 aSakdakham, K.1 aPasorn, P.1 aThanonkeo, S.1 aThiha, 1 aSatrawaha, R.1 aPetney, T.0 tBulletin of entomological research.g2011 Dec., v. 101, no. 6 p.687-696dCambridge University Pressx1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748531100023X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01728naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245004800170300001600218520069200234592002800926650001600954653001000970653001000980653001000990653002401000653002201024653002801046653001701074653002001091700005901111773012701170856008401297852000901381655001201390IND60543956220221118133403.0190415e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054395622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtusci.2015.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBamerni, Nareen10aOperators with diskcyclic vectors subspaces  ap. 414-419.  aIn this paper, we prove that if T is a diskcyclic operator then the closed unit disk multiplied by the union of the numerical range of all iterations of T is dense in H. Also, if T is a diskcyclic operator and |λ|≤1, then T−λI has dense range. Moreover, we prove that if α>1, then 1αT is hypercyclic in a separable Hilbert space H if and only if T⊕αIℂ is diskcyclic in H⊕ℂ. We show at least in some cases a diskcyclic operator has an invariant, dense linear subspace or an infinite dimensional closed linear subspace, whose non-zero elements are diskcyclic vectors. However, we give some counterexamples to show that not always a diskcyclic operator has such a subspace.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematics 0a47A16 0a47A12 0a47A15 0aDiskcyclic operator 0aDiskcyclic vector 0aDiskcyclicity Criterion 0aCondition B1 0aNumerical range1 aKilicman, Adem,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1217-963X0 tJournal of Taibah University for Science.g2015 July, v. 9, no. 3 p.414-419dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23224x1658-36557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtusci.2015.02.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245013800164300002200302520106600324592002801390650002201418650002201440650000801462650002201470650003501492650002001527650001401547650001501561650003701576650001401613650001101627650001101638650003301649650001101682650001701693650001601710650003701726700002101763700001701784773012701801856007401928852000902002655001202011IND60641305920221121094836.0190505e20161208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064130592DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra22080k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Dilip Kumar10aCatalytic wet air oxidation of aqueous solution of phenol in a fixed bed reactor over Ru catalysts supported on ceria promoted MCM-41  ap. 114383-114395.  aCatalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) of phenol was carried out in a fixed bed reactor over a noble metal (Ru) supported on silica MCM-41 material. The addition of small amounts of ceria as a promoter to the MCM-41 material enhanced both the activity and selectivity of Ru in this reaction, with significant conversions of about 99% obtained at 413 K and 18 bar oxygen pressure. The oxidation of phenol required moderate temperature and oxygen pressure, and the oxidizing capacity of the catalyst required adjustment. The activation energy of the oxidation reaction was found to be 33 kJ mol⁻¹ at 413 K using the ceria promoted Ru/MCM-41 catalyst. The supports and catalysts were characterized using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), CO chemisorption, temperature programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3aair 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMondal, Chandona1 aRoy, Shyamal0 tRSC advances.g2016 Dec. 08, v. 6, no. 115 p.114383-114395dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra22080k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02024naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113024002200148040001800170100001200188245012200200300001200322506007600334520069400410592002801104506003701132650003101169650002001200650001901220650002501239650001701264650001001281650001801291650001301309650001301322650002101335700002201356700002001378700002101398773009301419856008101512852000901593655001201602IND60119645420221207084442.0161031e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011964542DNAL7 a255121472pmid7 a10.1186/s13567-014-0131-62doi7 aPMC42671272pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa, Tom10aAbsence of a set of plasmid-encoded genes is predictive of reduced pathogenic potential in Brachyspira hyodysenteriae  ap. 131.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe gene content of 14 strains of the intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae was compared using a DNA microarray. A consistent difference occurred in a block of four genes on the ~36 Kb plasmid, with these being present in six virulent strains and absent in eight strains with reduced pathogenic potential. These genes encoded a predicted radical S-adenosylmethionine domain protein, a glycosyl transferase group 1-like protein, an NAD dependant epimerase and a dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 2–5 epimerase: they may be involved in rhamnose biosynthesis and glycosylation.

Samples were treated at pressures of 100, 200, 300 and 400 MPa, at two temperatures, 20 °C and 50 °C, for 15 min. Ascorbic acid content remained fairly constant after all the high pressure treatments in comparison to the control. However, the values of the samples pressurized at 50 °C were lower than the samples pressurized at 20 °C. Concentration of anthocyanins remained similar after all pressure treatments at both temperatures. Pectin methylesterase decreased in the samples pressurized at 50 °C, and it is remarkable that with this enzyme inactivation a gel-network formation in the strawberry purée was not found. However, a gel-network was observed in the control and in all the samples pressurized at 20 °C throughout cold storage. Immediately after pressurization, strawberry colour showed significant differences between the two temperatures, but no differences were observed between pressures. However, after cold storage no significant differences were observed, for hue and chroma parameters, between the samples pressurized at the two temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3aascorbic acid 3acold storage 3acolor 3aenzyme inactivation 3ahigh pressure treatment 3apectinesterase 3astrawberries 3atemperature 0aHigh pressure processing 0aStrawberry purée 0aAnthocyanins 0aColour 0aPectin methylesterase 0aHP 0aPME 0al-AA 0aPPO 0aPOD1 aAvizcuri, José-Miguel1 aFernández-Zurbano, Purificación1 aDizy, Marta1 aPréstamo, Guadalupe0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2013 July, v. 52, no. 2 p.123-130dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245010100198300001800299500002000317520176100337592002802098650001602126650002402142650001502166650000902181650002802190650002002218650001702238650002602255650001302281650001402294650004202308650001502350650001302365650001802378650002402396700005802420700006502478700006402543773014202607856007502749852000902824655001202833IND60760466820221121201231.0211222e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076046682DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.162752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlova, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6025-159510aMedical conditions associated with gastroduodenal ulceration or erosion in 168 dogs: 2008‐2018  ap. 2697-2704.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Many medical conditions are thought to cause gastroduodenal ulceration or erosion (GUE) in dogs. However, evidence for the association between many of these conditions and GUE in dogs is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To identify medical conditions associated with GUE in dogs. ANIMALS: One hundred and sixty‐eight dogs with GUE and 168 randomly selected control dogs without evidence of GUE identified on necropsy between January 2008 and September 2018. METHODS: Patient signalment, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine concentrations, recently administered ulcerogenic drugs, as well as necropsy findings were recorded. The association between these findings and presence of GUE was assessed by univariable and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: In the final multivariable model, the following factors were associated with GUE: Nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration (odds ratio [OR], 6.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3‐17.4; P = .0004), glucocorticoid administration (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5‐5.9; P = .001), gastrointestinal neoplasia (OR, 13.5; 95% CI, 1.7‐108.0; P = .01) and gastrointestinal mechanical disease (foreign bodies, gastric dilatation, and volvulus; OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.2‐19.7; P = .03). Additionally, working dog breeds were predisposed to GUE compared to mixed breed dogs (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1‐7.4; P = .04). Insufficient clinical data was available to either support or refute a role of other putative risk factors evaluated. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Administration of NSAID or glucocorticoid and gastrointestinal neoplasia or mechanical disease were associated with GUE in dogs. The potential predisposition of working breed dogs for GUE requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3acreatinine 3adogs 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucocorticoids 3amixed breeds 3amultivariate analysis 3anecropsy 3aneoplasms 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aurea nitrogen 3aveterinary medicine1 aGold, Randi M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1226-72821 aTolbert, M.

Embryo-larval bioassays were conducted to determine growth and morphology after 48 h of incubation with MP (1000 and 3000 particles/mL); with filtered sea water at pH = 7.6; and with their combinations. A second experiment was conducted to study the effect of pH and MP in combination with a temperature increase of 4 °C compared to control (20 °C). We found that the inhibition of growth in embryos reared at pH = 7.6 was around 75%. Larvae incubated at 3000 MP particles/mL showed a 20% decrease in growth compared to controls. The exposure to MP also induced an increase in the postoral arm separation or rounded vertices. The combined exposure to a pH 7.6 and MP caused a significant decrease of larval growth compared to control, to MP and to pH 7.6 treatments. Morphological alterations were observed in these treatments, including the development of only two arms. Increasing the temperature resulted in an increased growth in control, in pH 7.6 and pH 7.6 + MP3000 treatments, but the relative stomach volume decreased. However, when growth parameters were expressed per Degree-Days the lower growth provoked by the thermal stress was evidenced in all treatments. In this work we demonstrated that MP could aggravate the effect of a decreased pH and that an increase in water temperature generated an additional stress on P. lividus larvae, manifested in a lower growth and an altered development.

(Cupressaceae) is world’s largest juniper, but is currently threatened owing to multiple anthropogenic factors. This paper describes mechanisms for the successful biological restoration of African pencilcedar in a degraded landscape that had been depleted of organic matter and essential nutrient elements as a consequence of relentless deforestation, soil erosion, unsustainable farming and overgrazing. We used stecklings (= planting materials derived from rooted cuttings) of J. procera, and deployed Acacia abyssinica Hochst. ex Benth. (Fabaceae) to serve as a putative foster tree. The study was conducted for a period of 7years, with major soil fertility indicators determined at years 0, 3 and 7. We found that mean height, crown length, crown diameter, branch length, and branch numbers of J. procera trees grown in association with A. abyssinica were significantly (p=0.001) higher than those grown without the putative foster tree. Mean plant-available P (15±2.1ppm) and soil N-content (0.42±0.04%) were approximately 3- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in the A. abyssinica-treated plots than in the non-treated ones. Similarly, the levels of exchangeable cations and soil organic carbon were twice higher in the A. abyssinica-treated plots than in the non-treated ones. Cation exchange capacity improved with restoration time, both in the 0–15 and 15–30cm soil profiles, but the extent of improvement was significantly (p=0.001) higher in the 0–15cm soil profile of the A. abyssinica-treated plots than in the non-treated ones. We conclude that successful restoration of Juniperus procera in degraded landscapes and across the species’ range of habitats is feasible provided that strong and well-fortified stecklings are established along with the N2-fixing, fast-growing and drought-tolerant Acacia abyssinica.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil profiles 3asoil organic carbon 3aexchangeable cations 3acation exchange capacity 3aAcacia 3alandscapes 3adrought tolerance 3afarming systems 3atrees 3adeforestation 3aplanting 3asoil erosion 3aJuniperus procera 3asoil fertility 3ahabitats 3aovergrazing 0aorganic matter 0aTulu–Korma 0aMountainous region 0aHighlands 0aCenter for Indigenous Trees 0aSoil fertility 0aStecklings1 aKagnew, Birhanu0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 310 p.476-482dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.08.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03849naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245013500166506011700301506007600418520172100494592002802215506003702243650001902280650001502299650001602314650002302330650002502353650002102378650002602399650000902425650001402434650001102448650002702459650001802486653004602504653001902550653003302569653002302602653001202625653001002637653000902647653000802656653000802664653000902672653000802681653000802689653000702697653000902704653000702713653000802720653000902728653000702737653000902744653000802753653000802761653000902769653000802778700002002786700002202806700001502828700002102843700002102864700002102885773011402906856008603020852000903106655001203115IND60776649120221207102302.0220621e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077664912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1290462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chun10aParallel quantitation of salt dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS) and fingerprinting analysis of dispersed oil in aqueous samples  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn many jurisdictions, dispersants are included in contingency plans as a viable countermeasure that can help reduce the overall environmental impact of marine oil spills. When used, it is imperative to monitor the progression of dispersant and oil to assess their environmental fate and behaviour. Amphiphilic salt dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS) is the major effective component of the most commonly available dispersants, such as Corexit® EC9500A. Without proper sample preparation, dispersed oil in water samples could interfere with the accurate analysis of DOSS and easily contaminate the LC-MS system. In this work, solid phase extraction (SPE) weak anion exchange (WAX) cartridges were used to separate oil and DOSS in aqueous samples. DOSS was accurately determined by liquid chromatography coupled with a high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS). Oil fingerprinting analysis was conducted and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and petroleum biomarkers were determined by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This SPE-LC/GC-MS method was used for the analysis of oil-dispersant water samples containing a mixture of Corexit® EC9500A and a selection of crude oils and refined petroleum products. Nearly a 100% DOSS recovery was obtained for various oil-surfactant conditions. Parallel quantitation of oils with dispersants was achieved using this method. A portion of the TPH loss was possibly attributed to oil retained by the SPE column. Chemical fingerprints and diagnostic ratios of target compounds in recovered dispersed oil overall remain unchanged compared with those of all studied oils.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanion exchange 3abiomarkers 3adispersants 3aenvironmental fate 3aenvironmental impact 3aflame ionization 3aliquid chromatography 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asodium 3asolid phase extraction 3aspectrometers 0aSalt dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS) 0aOil dispersant 0aSolid phase extraction (SPE) 0aOil fingerprinting 0aLC-HRMS 0aGC-MS 0aASMB 0aDCM 0aDEA 0aDOSS 0aESI 0aFID 0aGC 0aHRMS 0aLC 0aLLE 0aMeOH 0aMS 0aPAHs 0aSIM 0aSPE 0aTPHs 0aWAX1 aFieldhouse, Ben1 aWaldie, Alexander1 aYang, Zeyu1 aHollebone, Bruce1 aLambert, Patrick1 aBeaulac, Vanessa0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 435 p.129046-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1290463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011800161300002000279520144200299592002801741650001701769650001601786650002101802650001501823650001701838650002201855650001101877650001001888650001501898650001101913650001301924650001701937700001201954700001701966700001701983700001602000773012402016856007402140852000902214655001202223IND60672342420221118061846.0191016e20191010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234242DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra05840k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeka, Lemu Girma12aA hierarchical NiCo₂S₄ honeycomb/NiCo₂S₄ nanosheet core–shell structure for supercapacitor applications  ap. 32338-32347.  aTransition metal sulphides are becoming one of the promising materials for energy storage applications. Particularly, an advanced electrode material architecture, which gives favourable electronic and ionic conductivity, is highly in demand. Herein, a hierarchical NiCo₂S₄ honeycomb/NiCo₂S₄ nanosheet core–shell structure is reported for supercapacitor applications. The core–shell structure was in situ grown on a nickel foam via two consecutive hydrothermal processes, followed by an electrochemical deposition process. Moreover, we tuned the deposition cycle to get abundant active sites with gaps of suitable sizes between the walls of the honeycomb structure for efficient electrolyte diffusion routes. The 3D honeycomb core structure was used as superhighway for electron transport to the current collector, while the ultrathin shell structure offered a large surface area with short electron and ion diffusion paths, thus leading to the faster kinetics and higher utilization of active materials. Thus, using the synergistic advantages of the core material and the shell material, the as-synthesized optimized electrode material came up with an excellent specific capacitance of 17.56 F cm⁻² at a current density of 5 mA cm⁻² and the highest cycling stability of 88.2% after 5000 cycles of charge–discharge process. Such advanced electrode architectures are highly promising for the future electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3afoams 3ananosheets 3anickel 3asulfides 3asurface area1 aLi, Xin1 aWang, Xiaoli1 aHan, Chuanyu1 aLiu, Weihua0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 10, v. 9, no. 55 p.32338-32347dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05840k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245019400163300001600357520039100373592002800764650001200792650001200804650002900816650002600845650001600871650002600887650001600913653002700929653002800956653002600984653001401010653001601024700002401040700002101064700002401085773015001109856007701259852000901336655001201345IND60521933420221121212251.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052193342DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-04242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalek, Wolfgang10aNotizen: Trennung und biologische Wirksamkeit der Enantiomeren eines chiralen Thiadiazolylsulfoxides/Separation and Biological Activity of the Enantiomers of a Chiral Thiadiazolyl Sulfoxide  ap. 597-599.  aThe enantiomers of the fungicidal and bactericidal (3-chloro-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5-yl)-(3´-chloro-1´,2´,4´-thiadiazoyl-5´-ylthiomethyl)-sulfoxide (2) have been separated by liquid chromatography on triacetylcellulose.

B.14aThe role of surface copper content on biofilm formation by drinking water bacteria  ap. 32184-32196.  aCopper pipes are conventionally used to supply tap water. Their role in biofilm prevention remains to be understood. This study evaluates the ability of selected surface materials with different copper contents (0, 57, 79, 87, 96, 100% of copper) to control biofilm formation and regrowth. Further experiments were performed to assess copper leaching and corrosion under conditions mimicking real plumbing systems. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from a drinking water distribution system were used as model bacteria. All the copper materials showed positive results on the control of single and dual species biofilms presenting high reductions of bacterial culturability > 4 log CFU per cm². The antimicrobial action of the selected materials seem not to be related to copper leaching or to the formation of reactive oxygen species. However, bacterial-copper contact demonstrated damage to bacterial membranes. The alloy containing 96% copper was the most promising surface in reducing biofilm culturability and viability, and was the only surface able to avoid the regrowth of single species biofilms when in contact with high nutrient concentrations. The alloy with 87% copper was shown to be unsuitable for use in chlorinated systems due to the high copper leaching observed when exposed to free chlorine. The presence of viable but non-culturable bacteria was remarkable, particularly in dual species biofilms. The overall results provide novel data on the role of copper alloys for use under chlorinated and unchlorinated conditions. Copper alloys demonstrated comparable or even higher biofilm control effects than elemental copper surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus 3aStenotrophomonas maltophilia 3aalloys 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acell membranes 3achlorine 3acopper 3acorrosion 3aleaching 3amodels 3anutrient content 3apipes 3areactive oxygen species 3aregrowth 3atap water 3aviability 3awater distribution1 aSimões, L.

The present study investigated curcumin′s potential in modulating diabetes induced neurochemical changes in brainstem. Expression analysis of cholinergic, insulin receptor and GLUT-3 in the brainstem of streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats were studied. Radioreceptor binding assays, gene expression studies and immunohistochemical analysis were done in the brainstem of male Wistar rats. Our result showed that Bₘₐₓ of total muscarinic and muscarinic M₃ receptors were increased and muscarinic M₁ receptor was decreased in diabetic rats compared to control. mRNA level of muscarinic M₃, α₇-nicotinic acetylcholine, insulin receptors, acetylcholine esterase, choline acetyltransferase and GLUT-3 significantly increased and M₁ receptor decreased in the brainstem of diabetic rats. Curcumin and insulin treatment restored the alterations and maintained all parameters to near control. The results show that diabetes is associated with significant reduction in brainstem function coupled with altered cholinergic, insulin receptor and GLUT-3 gene expression. The present study indicates beneficial effect of curcumin in diabetic rats by regulating the cholinergic, insulin receptor and GLUT-3 in the brainstem similar to the responses obtained with insulin therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abrain stem 3acholine acetyltransferase 3acognition 3acurcumin 3adiabetes mellitus 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsulin 3ainsulin receptors 3amessenger RNA 3arats 3astreptozotocin 3atherapeutics 2aAcetylcholinesterasexgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBrain Stemxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCholine O-Acetyltransferasexgenetics 2aCurcuminxpharmacology 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlucose Transporter Type 3xgenetics 2aMale 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReceptor, Insulinxgenetics 2aReceptors, Muscarinicxmetabolism 2aalpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptorxmetabolism1 aGeorge, Naijil1 aAntony, Sherin1 aSkaria Paulose, Cheramadathikudiyil0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 702, no. 1-3 p.323-331dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245011600183300001600299520092700315592002801242650001801270650001601288650001201304650001201316650001801328650001601346650001501362650001001377650000901387650000901396650002801405653001801433653002301451653001501474653002801489700003801517700002601555700002301581700002701604773013801631856008501769852000901854655001201863IND60639730420221117070911.0190503e20190504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063973042DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2019.15713662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Jorge Alberto Vieira10aPotential of microalgae as biopesticides to contribute to sustainable agriculture and environmental development  ap. 366-375.  aThe loss of yields from agricultural production due to the presence of pests has been treated over the years with synthetic pesticides, but the use of these substances negatively affects the environment and presents health risks for consumers and animals. The development of agroecological systems using biopesticides represents a safe alternative that contributes to the reduction of agrochemical use and sustainable agriculture. Microalgae are able to biosynthesize a number of metabolites with potential biopesticidal action and can be considered potential biological agents for the control of harmful organisms to soils and plants. The present work aims to provide a critical perspective on the consequences of using synthetic pesticides, offering as an alternative the biopesticides obtained from microalgal biomass, which can be used together with the implementation of environmentally friendly agricultural systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagrochemicals 3aagroecology 3aanimals 3abiomass 3abiopesticides 3ametabolites 3amicroalgae 3apests 3arisk 3asoil 3asustainable agriculture 0aBiopesticides 0abiological control 0amicroalgae 0asustainable agriculture1 aFreitas, Bárbara Catarina Bastos1 aCruz, Camila Gonzales1 aSilveira, Jéssica1 aMorais, Michele Greque0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2019 May 4, v. 54, no. 5 p.366-375dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11541x1532-41097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2019.15713663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245007800206300002000284500001900304520151800323592002801841650000801869650001201877650002801889650001101917650001201928650002201940650001501962650001501977650002001992650002002012650001902032650001102051650002002062650001402082650001602096653002702112653002602139653002402165700005102189700001802240700001402258700001602272700005502288700005102343700005402394773014602448856008502594852000902679655001202688IND60707180420221121140841.0200819e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070718042DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c041962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0641-542910aFundamental Advances in Biomass Autothermal/Oxidative Pyrolysis: A Review  ap. 11888-11905.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPyrolysis is an important thermochemical route to decompose lignocellulose biomass into biogas, bio-oil, and biochar, which can be then converted into value-added biofuels, chemicals, and biomaterials. Conventionally, the pyrolysis reaction is carried out under inert atmosphere. The quality of biocrudes and biochars from the conventional pyrolysis could significantly vary, depending on the types of feedstocks and reaction conditions. After intensive studies on the conventional biomass pyrolysis for decades, the external heat supply for the endothermic pyrolytic reactions is still one of the most important roadblocks to inhibit the scale-up and commercialization of biomass pyrolysis technologies. Different from the pyrolysis under inert gas atmosphere, autothermal pyrolysis tends to depolymerize the biomass (polymers) with restricted supply of oxygen/air, also called oxidative pyrolysis. The presence of oxygen in the pyrolyzer will induce the exothermic char-oxygen and/or volatile-oxygen reactions, thus in situ providing the heat for the primary thermal degradation of biomass and the subsequent secondary reactions. Besides the change in product distributions, the key advantage of autothermal pyrolysis is its self-sustainability in terms of heat supply and requirement, facilitating the ease of further scaling up. This review will thus mainly focus on the sum of the recent advances in autothermal pyrolysis and also discuss some innovative pathways for improving/adjusting the product quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiochar 3abiocompatible materials 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acommercialization 3aendothermy 3afeedstocks 3agreen chemistry 3aheat production 3alignocellulose 3aoxygen 3aproduct quality 3apyrolysis 3avalue added 0aConventional pyrolysis 0aAutothermal pyrolysis 0aOxidative pyrolysis1 aLi, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2404-99711 aLiu, Dongjing1 aXie, Xing1 aZhang, Hong1 aSun, Hongqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0907-56261 aHu, Xun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4329-20501 aZhang, Shu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4137-07480 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 July 20, v. 8, no. 32 p.11888-11905dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c041963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010700166300001600273500001900289520136300308592002801671650002101699650001801720650001601738650001501754650001101769650000901780650000901789650002101798650001701819650002701836650001301863653001101876653002601887700001801913700001901931700006001950700002102010700001802031700005902049773013902108856008302247852000902330655001202339IND60730630120221120200306.0210401e20210423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073063012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hong-im,10aARID1A and PGR proteins interact in the endometrium and reveal a positive correlation in endometriosis  ap. 151-157.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEndometriosis is a disorder in which endometrial cells normally limited to the lining of the uterus proliferate outside the uterine cavity and can cause pelvic pain and infertility. ARID1A levels are significantly reduced in the eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis. Uterine specific Arid1a knock-out mice were infertile due to loss of epithelial progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling. However, the functional association of ARID1A and PGR in endometriosis has not been studied. We examined the expression patterns and co-localization of ARID1A and PGR in eutopic endometrium from women with and without endometriosis using immunostaining and Western blot analysis. ARID1A and PGR proteins co-localized in the epithelium during the proliferative and the early secretory phases. Our immunoprecipitation analysis and proximity ligation assay (PLA) revealed physical interaction between ARID1A and PGR-A but not PGR-B in the mouse and human endometrium. ARID1A levels positively correlated with PGR levels in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis. Our results bring new perspectives on the molecular mechanisms involved in endometrial receptivity and progesterone resistance in endometriosis. The interrelationship between ARID1A and PGR may contribute to explaining the non-receptive endometrium in endometriosis-related infertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aendometriosis 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3amice 3apain 3aprecipitin tests 3aprogesterone 3aprogesterone receptors 3aresearch 0aARID1A 0aProgesterone receptor1 aKim, Tae Hoon1 aYoo, Jung-Yoon1 aYoung, Steven L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5205-44951 aLessey, Bruce A.1 aKu, Bon Jeong1 aJeong, Jae-Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5368-64780 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 550 p.151-157dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002500137245007200162300001600234520134500250592002801595650001101623650002701634650001101661650001501672650001401687650002701701650002101728650001601749650001201765650001401777650002801791650001001819653002201829653001301851653001901864653001401883653001101897653001501908700002301923700002001946700002101966700002001987700002202007700002102029700002102050700002602071700001702097773013002114856007102244852000902315655001202324IND60746967420221121225816.0210811s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074696742DNAL7 a10.1071/RD210862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuengel, Jennifer L.14aThe ovarian follicle of ruminants: the path from conceptus to adult  ap. 621-642.  aThis review resulted from an international workshop and presents a consensus view of critical advances over the past decade in our understanding of follicle function in ruminants. The major concepts covered include: (1) the value of major genes; (2) the dynamics of fetal ovarian development and its sensitivity to nutritional and environmental influences; (3) the concept of an ovarian follicle reserve, aligned with the rise of anti-Müllerian hormone as a controller of ovarian processes; (4) renewed recognition of the diverse and important roles of theca cells; (5) the importance of follicular fluid as a microenvironment that determines oocyte quality; (6) the ‘adipokinome’ as a key concept linking metabolic inputs with follicle development; and (7) the contribution of follicle development to the success of conception. These concepts are important because, in sheep and cattle, ovulation rate is tightly regulated and, as the primary determinant of litter size, it is a major component of reproductive efficiency and therefore productivity. Nowadays, reproductive efficiency is also a target for improving the ‘methane efficiency’ of livestock enterprises, increasing the need to understand the processes of ovarian development and folliculogenesis, while avoiding detrimental trade-offs as greater performance is sought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanti-Mullerian hormone 3acattle 3aconception 3aconceptus 3afollicular development 3afollicular fluid 3alitter size 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3areproductive efficiency 3asheep 0afetal programming 0agenetics 0agranulosa cell 0anutrition 0aoocyte 0atheca cell1 aCushman, Robert A.1 aDupont, Joëlle1 aFabre, Stéphane1 aLea, Richard G.1 aMartin, Graeme B.1 aMossa, Francesca1 aPitman, Janet L.1 aPrice, C.q(Chris A.)1 aSmith, Peter0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2021, v. 33, no. 10 p.621-642dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD210863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01997naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245008400204300002000288520084500308592002801153650001301181650001601194650001201210650001601222700001401238700001401252700001501266700002301281700001201304700001501316700001501331700001501346700005301361773011601414856008401530852000901614655001201623IND60677899720221122060416.0191213e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b025922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTadmor, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6300-464510aDrops That Change Their Mind: Spontaneous Reversal from Spreading to Retraction  ap. 15734-15738.  aA liquid drop may spread faster on surfaces when surfactants are added. Here we show that after some time the spreading in such systems can, under certain conditions, spontaneously reverse to retraction and the droplet pulls itself back, receding from areas it has just recently wetted, elevating its center of mass in a jerklike motion. The duration from drop placement to the onset of retraction ranges from hours to less than a second primarily as a function of surfactant concentration. When the retraction is asymmetric, it results in drop motion, and when it is symmetric, the mass of the drop collects itself on its spot. This phenomenon, which was predicted theoretically in 2014, is apparently a general one for drops with surfactants; however, other factors, such as evaporation and contamination, prevented its observance so far.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aevaporation 3aliquids 3asurfactants1 aBaksi, A.1 aGulec, S.1 aJadhav, S.1 aN’guessan, H.

The methods used to screen the metagenomic libraries fall into two categories, which are based on sequence or function of the enzymes. The sequence-based approaches rely on the known sequences of the target gene families. In contrast, the function-based approaches do not involve the incorporation of metagenomic sequencing data and, therefore, may lead to the discovery of novel gene sequences with desired functions. In this review, we discuss the function-based screening strategies that have been used in the identification of enzymes from metagenomes. Because of its simplicity, agar plate screening is most commonly used in the identification of novel enzymes with diverse functions. Other screening methods with higher sensitivity are also employed, such as microtiter plate screening. Furthermore, several ultra-high-throughput methods were developed to deal with large metagenomic libraries. Among these are the FACS-based screening, droplet-based screening, and the in vivo reporter-based screening methods. The application of these novel screening strategies has increased the chance for the discovery of novel enzyme genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagar 3aenzymes 3agenes 3agenomic libraries 3ametagenomics 3amicroorganisms 3anucleotide sequences 3ascreening 0aMetagenomics 0aFunction-based screening 0aAgar plate screening 0aMicrofluidics 0aFACS-based screening1 aZhang, Houjin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2647-08150 tGenomics, proteomics & bioinformatics.g2018 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.405-415dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12107x1672-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2018.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245009900177300002000276500001900296520165700315592002801972650001802000650003002018650002602048650002502074700002202099700005802121773011602179856008402295852000902379655001202388IND60715779920210903000000.0201103e20201026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071577992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c020922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLethuillier, Jérémie10aAbout the Role of Falling Droplets’ Sweeping in Surface Renewal during Dropwise Condensation  ap. 12877-12886.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo determine the heat transfer coefficient during dropwise condensation, two models are necessary: a heat transfer model through a single drop and a model of drop-size distribution. To model the distribution of the drop size, most studies dissociate the drop population into two distinct parts. A semiempirical model is then used to evaluate the drop-size distribution of “large” drops (i.e., typically greater than few micrometers), while the drop-size distribution of “small” drops is modeled using a statistical approach based on population balance. Currently, no accurate data are available to validate this latter distribution. In the present study, the statistical approach is compared to an individual-based numerical approach. This numerical approach takes into account the entire lifecycle of a drop: nucleation, growth, coalescence, and disappearance by sweeping of moving drops (jumping droplets are not considered in this paper). The drop-size distributions of large drops obtained thanks to this model are very similar to those obtained from the classical law in all configurations studied. Nevertheless, the distributions of “small” drops are notably different between the two types of modeling. In the configurations considered in the present study, an analysis of the main hypotheses used in the statistical approach (in particular, the assumption of a constant removal characteristic time τ irrespective of the range of drop size) revealed that the main mechanism for surface renewal is not the sweeping of the surface by moving drops. From these results, a modification of the statistical model is proposed and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3asemi-empirical models 3astatistical analysis1 aLavieille, Pascal1 aMiscevic, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5821-43760 tLangmuir.g2020 Oct. 26, v. 36, no. 43 p.12877-12886dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c020923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005600092040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002100193245023500214300001800449500002400467520181000491650001802301650001402319650001602333650002002349650002202369650002002391650002402411650001902435650001402454650003002468650002102498651001702519653002902536653002902565653002902594653002702623653002502650653001402675773014002689852000902829856006902838856011002907930003303017945002503050946001303075655001203088IND4386022920221120140729.0061215e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438602292DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99[1064:RAPAOA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL700 0aL001 0aL4001 aSolodovnikov, A.10aRevision and Phylogenetic Assessment of Afroquedius gen. nov. from South Africa: Toward New Concepts of the Genus Quedius, Subtribe Quediina and Reclassification of the Tribe Staphylinini (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Staphylininae)  ap. 1064-1084.  aIncludes references  aStudy of the South African endemic Quedius sexpunctatus Bernhauer, 1917 revealed a complex of four very similar species, here referred to as the Q. sexpunctatus group, three of them described as new. Although superficially similar to Quedius, members of the Q. sexpunctatus group differ significantly, in some morphological characters, from all other members of that genus, but they do not display any other affiliation within the tribe Staphylinini. To assess the position of these "Quedius" within the system of the tribe, a parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 63 morphological characters for a taxon sample, including 10 species representing the genus Quedius, 24 species of other genera of the subtribe Quediina, 11 species from other subtribes of the tribe Staphylinini, and one species each of the tribes Maorothiini, Platyprosopini, and Arrowinini (altogether 48 terminal taxa). It showed that the Q. sexpunctatus group is a relatively basal lineage of Staphylinini, rather remote from the genus Quedius, and neither the latter, nor the whole subtribe Quediina, is monophyletic. The whole phylogenetic pattern yielded by the analysis, briefly discussed in the article, disagrees with the current conventional classification of the tribe Staphylinini. To translate the newly obtained phylogenetic information into the system, the new genus Afroquedius is proposed to accommodate the Q. sexpunctatus group. Other, more radical taxonomic changes suggested by the analysis are postponed pending a broader and more rigorous study with more extensive coverage of the tribe Staphylinini, for which this article is a stepping stone. A lectotype is designated for Quedius sexpunctatus Bernhauer, the type species of Afroquedius. The key to all known species of Afroquedius is provided. 3aStaphylinidae 3anew genus 3anew species 3anew combination 3ainsect morphology 3ainsect taxonomy 3ataxonomic revisions 3ataxonomic keys 3aphylogeny 3ageographical distribution 3atype collections 3aSouth Africa 0aAfroquedius sexpunctatus 0aAfroquedius latitarsalis 0aAfroquedius brachelytrus 0aAfroquedius sebastiani 0aQuedius sexpunctatus 0alectotype0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2006 Nov., v. 99, no. 6 p.1064-1084dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ann/3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99%5B1064:RAPAOA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20061218b20070102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/12/15  aOther US 7aarticle02623naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245009800163300002000261520146600281592002801747650001301775650001301788650001501801650001501816650002401831650001901855650002301874650001501897650002001912650001901932650001601951700005501967700001802022773011602040856008402156852000902240655001202249IND60677899820221122060521.0191213e20191108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789982DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b026032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Lin10aDroplet Morphology and Mobility on Lubricant-Impregnated Surfaces: A Molecular Dynamics Study  ap. 16377-16387.  aSlippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) are gaining remarkable attention and have advanced performance in many fields. Although all SLIPS are related to lubricant-impregnation within nano/microstructures on a surface, they differ in many aspects, such as the morphology of droplets, the state of cloaking, the wetting edge, and the lubricant thickness. Requirements of the droplet morphology on SLIPS might change according to a specific application. A molecular-dynamics-based numerical model that can correctly simulate SLIPS is developed and is validated by comparing against the theoretical predictions for all possible stable states for a given droplet, lubricant, and solid surface. On the basis of this model, a detailed analysis of the equilibrium states is conducted. In particular, we discover that the four possible stable states on SLIPS predicted by theoretical studies can be extended to eight states by considering the effects of lubricant thickness and surface geometry in addition to the interfacial tension and surface wettability. These findings could be used to determine the conditions under which a thermodynamically stable state exists on SLIPS. The dynamic behavior of a nanodroplet on SLIPS is also studied, which provides insight into how a proper increase in the lubricant thickness might increase the sliding velocity. The above findings and developed model are expected to provide significant guidelines for designing SLIPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3ageometry 3aguidelines 3alubricants 3amathematical models 3amicrostructure 3amolecular dynamics 3aprediction 3asurface tension 3athermodynamics 3awettability1 aTang, G.

Within the administrative boundaries of the city, 66 allotment gardens are located which totally cover an area of more than 300 ha. They occupy 3% of the city area. None of the studied mineral surface horizons meets the criteria for hortic horizon according to WRB 2015, due to too low phosphorus content. Other hortic criteria were fulfilled.

Direct visualization of centromere-kinetochore proteins during the cell cycle remains a fundamental tool in investigating the mechanism(s) of these proteins. Advanced imaging methods in fluorescence microscopy provide remarkable resolution of centromere-kinetochore components and allow direct observation of specific molecular components of the centromeres and kinetochores. In addition, methods of indirect immunofluorescent (IIF) staining using specific antibodies are crucial to these observations. However, despite numerous reports about IIF protocols, few discussed in detail problems of specific centromere-kinetochore proteins.1-4 Here we report optimized protocols to stain endogenous centromere-kinetochore proteins in human cells by using paraformaldehyde fixation and IIF staining. Furthermore, we report protocols to detect Flag-tagged exogenous CENP-A proteins in human cells subjected to acetone or methanol fixation. These methods are useful in detecting and quantifying endogenous centromere-kinetochore proteins and Flag-tagged CENP-A proteins, including those in human cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aantibodies 3acell division 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3akinetochores 3amethanol 3aproteins 3astaining1 aKitagawa, Katsumi0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Mar. 03, , no. 109 p.e53732-e53732dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/537323Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53732/immunofluorescence-analysis-endogenous-exogenous-centromere  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245010600164300001500270520142100285592002801706650002201734650001901756650002201775650002001797650001901817650002401836650002201860650002201882653004901904653002501953653002201978653002602000653001502026700001202041700001902053700001302072700001302085700001802098700002102116773011202137856008302249852000902332655001202341IND60547068320221123044028.0161023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054706832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Chao10aDegradation of chlorothalonil through a hydrolytic dehalogenase secreted from Bacillus subtilis WB800  ap. 97-104.  aTo achieve the secretory expression of chlorothalonil hydrolytic dehalogenase (Chd), the chd gene was cloned into the vector pP43NMK under the control of the P43 promoter and the NprB signal peptide-encoding sequence and extracellularly expressed in the protease-deficient strain Bacillus subtilis WB800. The optimization of Chd production in submerged culture through Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken designs enhanced the activity of Chd from 6.80 to 14.50 U l−1 and the protein expression amount from 1.93 μg ml−1 to 5.65 μg ml−1. The obtained Chd catalyzed a hydroxyl substitution at the 4-chlorine atom of chlorothalonil to form 4-hydroxy-trichloroisophthalonitrile, which is more soluble in water and easier to remove from the surface of vegetables. Six types of vegetables classified by the edible organ were selected for the chlorothalonil enzymatic degradation assay. After enzymatic reaction for 120 min, almost all of the 25 mg kg−1 chlorothalonil on cherry tomatoes was removed, approximately 82% of the 45 mg kg−1 chlorothalonil on lactuca sativa was removed, and approximately 40%–67% of the chlorothalonil on all other vegetables was removed. Moreover, the chlorothalonil eluted from the vegetables could be degraded to <1 mg l−1 after 3 h. The results of the present study demonstrated the potential of Chd to clean up chlorothalonil residue on the surfaces of vegetables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aLactuca sativa 3achemical elements 3acherry tomatoes 3achlorothalonil 3aenzymatic reactions 3amolecular cloning 3aprotein synthesis 0aChlorothalonil hydrolytic dehalogenase (Chd) 0aSecretory expression 0aBacillus subtilis 0aEnzymatic degradation 0aVegetables1 aHe, Qin1 aHuang, Jun-Wei1 aCao, Qin1 aYan, Xin1 aLi, Shun-Peng1 aJiang, Jian-Dong0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2015 Oct., v. 104 p.97-104dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100002100168245010300189300001600292520101700308592002801325650001101353650002901364650001901393650001001412650002901422650001301451650003001464650001601494650003001510650001201540650003201552650002801584650001801612650003801630650002001668650002301688650003901711700001701750700002001767700002301787773008001810856008301890852000901973655001201982IND60080897120221123044156.0140812e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008089712DNAL7 a213164452pmid7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiegand, Stephan10aEfficient generation of gene knockout plasmids for Dictyostelium discoideum using one-step cloning  ap. 321-325.  aThe amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a well-established model organism for studying numerous aspects of cellular and developmental functions. Its rather small (~34Mb) chromosomal genome and the high efficiency of gene disruption by homologous recombination have enabled researchers to dissect various specific gene functions. We describe here the use of one-step cloning for the fast and efficient generation of deletion vectors that are produced in a one-step reaction by inserting two PCR products into an organism-specific, generic acceptor system. This worked efficiently for all 16 tested constructs directed against genes in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Saving cost and time, the used protocol represents a significant advancement in the generation of such plasmids compared to the conventionally applied restriction enzyme/ligation approach. Using appropriate selection markers, similar systems could also be useful in other organisms, where genes can be knocked out by homologous recombination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmoeba 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3agene targeting 3agenes 3ahomologous recombination 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aresearchers 3arestriction endonucleases 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aDictyosteliumxgenetics 2aGene Deletion 2aGene Knockout Techniquesxmethods 2aGenetic Vectors 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods1 aKruse, Janis1 aGronemann, Sina1 aHammann, Christian0 tGenomics.g2011 May, v. 97, no. 5 p.321-325dElsevier Inc.x0888-75437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245014600175300001600321520153600337592002801873650002701901650002001928650001301948650001901961650001101980650001801991650002002009650001002029650004102039650001202080650001202092650001602104650001602120650001302136650000702149650001802156650002702174650001802201653001202219653001902231653001202250653002202262653002102284653003102305700002802336700003002364700002102394773011302415856008302528852000902611655001202620IND60547068520221123044219.0161023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054706852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdnan, Liyana Amalina10aMetabolites characterisation of laccase mediated Reactive Black 5 biodegradation by fast growing ascomycete fungus Trichoderma atroviride F03  ap. 274-282.  aIn this study, fast growing ascomycete fungus Trichoderma atroviride F03 was explored to biodegrade bis-azo dye, Reactive Black 5 (RB5). The maximum RB5 biodegradation (91.1%) was achieved in the culture medium supplemented with an appropriate carbon source (glucose, 20 g l−1), and nitrogen source (yeast extract, 20 g l−1) at pH 5 and 27 °C. The laccase produced by T. atroviride F03 was involved in the RB5 biodegradation processes. The metabolites such as (I) 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, (II) 2,4-ditertbutylphenol, and (III) benzoic acid-TMS) were identified as the biodegradation products of RB5 using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The presence of these metabolites suggested that RB5 biodegradation was initiated by the cleavage of azo bond forming naphthalene-1,2,8-triol and sulphuric acid mono-[2-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-ethyl] ester. The sulphuric acid mono-[2-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-ethyl] ester was further desulphonated to 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. Then, the oxygenated ring of C1 and C2 naphthalene-1,2,8-triol was cleaved to 2-(2-carboxy-ethyl)-6-hydroxy-benzoic acid. The degradation of 2-(2-carboxy-ethyl)-6-hydroxy-benzoic acid could be proceeded with two pathways: (i) decarboxylation and methylation to form 2,4-ditertbutylphenol and (ii) decarboxylation mechanism that induced the formation of benzoic acid-TMS. Finally, this study proved that T. atroviride F03 might be a good candidate in treating textile effluent containing azo dye as this treatment does not generating aromatic amines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma atroviride 3aaromatic amines 3aazo dyes 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3aculture media 3adecarboxylation 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglucose 3alaccase 3ametabolites 3amethylation 3anitrogen 3apH 3asulfuric acid 3atextile mill effluents 3ayeast extract 0aAzo dye 0aBiodegradation 0aLaccase 0aMetabolic pathway 0aReactive black 5 0aTrichoderma atroviride F031 aSathishkumar, Palanivel1 aMohd Yusoff, Abdull Rahim1 aHadibarata, Tony0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2015 Oct., v. 104 p.274-282dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014100170300001600311520164900327592002801976650002302004650002902027650000902056650000902065650002402074650001802098650002102116650001002137650001302147650002202160650000902182650001902191650002902210650002302239650002902262650003002291653002102321653002902342653000902371653000902380653001202389653001202401700001902413700001902432700001902451700001502470773012202485856008202607852000902689655001202698IND60527911320221116162213.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052791132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrianta, Ignatius10aComparison of Monascus purpureus growth, pigment production and composition on different cereal substrates with solid state fermentation  ap. 181-186.  aThe growth and pigment production of Monascus purpureus during 14 days solid state fermentation on different cereal substrates i.e. rice, corn, whole sorghum grain (WSG), dehulled sorghum grain (DSG) and sorghum bran (SB); and pigment composition of the fermented-products have been evaluated. Fungal biomass was used as a basis of its growth. Pigment content was measured by using spectrophotometer and thin-layer chromatography, and its composition was analyzed by using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. M. purpureus grew faster on rice substrate than did on other substrates. Production of pigments was observed at the end of logarithmic phase on all substrates tested. Similar pigment compounds were found on all substrates and the highest production of pigments was on rice, followed by DSG>WSG>Corn>SB. Twelve pigments, six of which were well-known, were detected on the Monascus-fermented products at different levels. Among those, Monapilol B, found in Monascus-fermented dioscorea, was found. On all cases, the red pigment Rubropunctamine was the major one (57–87%), except on SB substrate which produced Yellow II as the major one. Interestingly, fermented-DSG contained a large amount of Rubropunctatin compared to other fermented products. Among the non-rice substrates, DSG is the most potential substrate, on which the fungus exhibited the highest growth and pigment production. These data suggest that the fermented products are good candidates for development of natural food colorant, food supplement, functional food and or medicine with antiinflammation, anticancer and antimicrobial activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonascus purpureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3abran 3acorn 3adietary supplements 3afood coloring 3afunctional foods 3afungi 3amedicine 3amicrobial biomass 3arice 3arubropunctatin 3asolid state fermentation 3aspectrophotometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athin layer chromatography 0aMonascus pigment 0aSolid state fermentation 0aRice 0aCorn 0aSorghum 0aLC–MS1 aZubaidah, Elok1 aEstiasih, Teti1 aYamada, Mamoru1 aHarijono, 0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2016 July, v. 7 p.181-186dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2016.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01934naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014800174500001900322520054100341592002800882650001500910650001200925650001300937650001300950653003600963653002500999653001101024653002001035653002101055700005901076700002101135700002101156700002001177700005701197700005601254700001501310773010501325856008501430852000901515655001201524IND60730630920221120211533.0210610e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073063092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2021.1082802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIchikawa, Yoshiyasu10aProtecting group-free method for synthesis of N-glycosyl carbamates and an assessment of the anomeric effect of nitrogen in the carbamate group  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe first protecting group-free synthesis of N-glycosyl carbamates has been developed through reaction of d-glucose with n-butyl carbamate in acidic aqueous media.

N-linked glycosylation is one of the most important and robust post-translational modifications on proteins and regulates critical cell functions such as signaling, adhesion, and enzymatic function. Analytical techniques to purify and analyze N-glycans have remained relatively static over the last decade. While accurate and effective, they commonly require significant expertise and resources. Though some high-throughput purification schemes have been developed, they have yet to find widespread adoption and often rely on the enrichment of glycopeptides. One promising method, developed by Thomas-Oates et al., filter aided N-glycan separation (FANGS), was qualitatively demonstrated on tissues. Herein, we adapted FANGS to plasma and coupled it to the individuality normalization when labeling with glycan hydrazide tags strategy in order to achieve accurate relative quantification by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and enhanced electrospray ionization. Furthermore, we designed new functionality to the protocol by achieving tandem, shotgun proteomics and glycosylation site analysis on hen plasma. We showed that N-glycans purified on filter and derivatized by hydrophobic hydrazide tags were comparable in terms of abundance and class to those by solid phase extraction (SPE); the latter is considered a gold standard in the field. Importantly, the variability in the two protocols was not statistically different. Proteomic data that was collected in-line with glycomic data had the same depth compared to a standard trypsin digest. Peptide deamidation is minimized in the protocol, limiting non-specific deamidation detected at glycosylation motifs. This allowed for direct glycosylation site analysis, though the protocol can accommodate 18O site labeling as well. Overall, we demonstrated a new in-line high-throughput, unbiased, filter based protocol for quantitative glycomics and proteomics analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acell adhesion 3adeamidation 3aglycomics 3aglycopeptides 3aglycosylation 3ahens 3ahydrazides 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asolid phase extraction 3astable isotopes 3atissues 3atrypsin1 aMcCord, James P.1 aMuddiman, David C.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Mar. 08, , no. 109 p.e53735-e53735dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/537353Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53735/a-quantitative-glycomics-and-proteomics-combined-purification-strategy  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03706naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009800167300001600265520170200281536037201983592002802355596001302383596001902396650002002415650001202435650001202447650002102459650001402480650000902494650000902503650002102512650001402533650001302547650000702560650002102567650002002588650001902608650001602627650001002643650001302653650001902666653002002685653001702705653002202722653001702744653001902761653002302780700001402803700002102817700001302838700001702851700001302868773012802881856008603009852000903095655001203104IND60711957420221116160234.0210811e20200503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071195742DNAL7 a10.1080/00380768.2020.17473622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Honghua10aCadmium and lead affect the status of mineral nutrients in alfalfa grown on a calcareous soil  ap. 506-514.  aCadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are toxic trace elements which are not essential for plants but can be easily taken up by roots and accumulated in various organs, and cause irreversible damages to plants. A pot experiment was carried out to investigate the individual and combined effects of Cd (0, 10, 20 mg kg⁻¹) and Pb (0, 500, 1000 mg kg⁻¹) level in a calcareous soil on the status of mineral nutrients, including K, P, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn, in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plants. Soil Pb level considerably (P ≤ 0.05) affected the concentrations of more elements in plants than soil Cd level did, and there were combined effects of soil Cd level and Pb level on the concentrations of some nutrients (Ca, Mg, and Cu) in plants. The effects of soil Cd level and Pb level on plant nutrient concentrations varied among plant parts. Cd and Pb contamination did not considerably affect the exudation of carboxylates in the rhizosphere. An increase in rhizosphere pH and exudation of significant amounts of carboxylates (especially oxalate) in the rhizosphere might contribute to the exclusion and detoxification of Cd and Pb. Neither shoot dry mass nor root dry mass was significantly influenced by soil Cd level, but both of them were considerably reduced (by up to 25% and 45% on average for shoot dry mass and root dry mass, respectively) by increasing soil Pb level. The interaction between soil Cd level and Pb level was significant for root dry mass, but not significant for shoot dry mass. The results indicate that alfalfa is tolerant to Cd and Pb stress, and it is promising to grow alfalfa for phytostabilization of Cd and Pb on calcareous soils contaminated with Cd and Pb.  aThis work was supported by The National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2017YFC0504504], The National Natural Science Foundation of China [41301570], The Light of West China Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities.

The training set, comprised of a composition of major and minor lipid components as inputs and outputs. Crude oil extracted from the genetically modified maize (Bt-176) and non-transgenic maize was characterized in terms of its fatty acids, phytosterols and tocopherols distribution as well as of its lipid classes and unsaponifiables amounts. The results obtained from lipid distribution analysis showed that the grains of Bt-176 maize were comparable in their composition to that of the control maize. The analytical data have been elaborated by supervised pattern recognition technique ANN in order to classify genetically modified maize (Bt-176) and conventional maize as well as to authenticate the origin of the samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3acorn 3afatty acids 3aneural networks 3aphytosterols 3atocopherols 3atransgenic plants0 tJournal für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit.g2011 Mar., v. 6, no. 1 p.13-23dBirkhäuser-Verlagx1661-57517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00003-010-0579-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010300156300002000259520094900279592002801228650002101256650001501277650001401292650001101306650000901317650001201326650001701338650001601355700001401371700001201385700001601397700001701413773014201430856007401572852000901646655001201655IND60617252620221118052746.0181024e20181023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061725262DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta08559e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chao10aContinuously 3D printed quantum dot-based electrodes for lithium storage with ultrahigh capacities  ap. 19960-19966.  aAlthough 3D printing has been explored to construct various well-designed architectures for energy storage, it is still stagnated by poor electrochemical performance owing to the slow kinetics for both electron and ion diffusion. Here, ultra-fine and mono-disperse SnO₂ quantum dots (QDs) with sizes of 2–4 nm were produced on a large scale through a facile controllable sol–gel approach, affording a favorable QD-based printable ink for continuous 3D printing without clogging. Remarkably enough, the 3D printed QD-based microelectrode exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity of 991.6 mA h g⁻¹ (4 layers), high areal capacity and good rate capability. This superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the favorable kinetics for both electrons and ions in the 3D printed SnO₂ QD-based microelectrode. This work provides an efficient, green and scalable route to apply 3D printing in the area of rechargeable microbatteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aions 3alithium 3aquantum dots 3atin dioxide1 aShen, Kai1 aLi, Bin1 aLi, Songmei1 aYang, Shubin0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Oct. 23, v. 6, no. 41 p.19960-19966dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta08559e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009300159300001600252520178400268592002802052650002502080650001502105650000902120650001002129650001702139650001102156650001402167650002302181650001302204700001802217700001902235700002402254700002002278773009602298856007302394852000902467655001202476IND50090249120221118190439.0150218e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009024912DNAL7 a10.1111/eff.120982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuir, Andrew M.10aMorphology and life history of the Great Slave Lake ciscoes (Salmoniformes: Coregonidae)  ap. 453-469.  aThe taxonomy of the North American ciscoes (Salmoniformes: Coregonidae) remains unresolved. We provide the first comprehensive description of the Great Slave Lake ciscoes. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the Great Slave Lake cisco complex includes at least two nominate species (Coregonus artedi and Coregonus sardinella) and an adfluvial C. artedi morph that is distinct from its lacustrine conspecific in terms of life history, morphology, age, growth and mortality. Coregonus sardinella has previously been identified from Great Slave Lake, but we provide the first comprehensive description of this species in the lake and confirm a significant range extension for the species. The lacustrine C. artedi differs little from descriptions throughout its range. In addition to these three ciscoes, linear phenotypic traits, gillraker number and morphology, and growth data support the possible occurrence of two other, less‐distinct morphs, the big‐eye cisco and a shortjaw‐like morph Coregonus zenithicus. Although the big‐eye morph was not identified by body shape and linear phenotypic measures, it was visually identified on the basis of differences in traditional phenotypic proportions, such as orbital length, paired fin lengths, head and gillraker morphology expressed as thousands of standard length and showed different age and growth structure compared with the other lacustrine cisco morphs. Coregonus zenithicus was distinguished visually and by a statistical model of linear phenotypic traits as well as by gillraker number and morphology. Identifying, characterising and managing locally adapted cisco morphs that reflect important ecological and bioenergetic linkages are critical to conserving the ecological integrity of northern ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoregonus zenithicus 3aecosystems 3ahead 3alakes 3alife history 3amorphs 3amortality 3astatistical models 3ataxonomy1 aVecsei, Pál,1 aPower, Michael1 aKrueger, Charles C.1 aReist, James D.0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2014 July, v. 23, no. 3 p.453-469dMunksgaardx0906-66917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.120983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013600164300001300300520120000313592002801513650001501541650001501556650001201571650003101583650001001614650001101624650003701635650001101672650002001683650001201703650001301715650001701728650001201745650001701757650002201774650002601796653001001822653001501832653001801847653001501865653002101880653003001901653001001931653000801941653000901949653000801958653000801966653000901974653000801983653000701991653001001998653000702008653000902015653000702024653000902031653000802040653000902048653000802057700001802065700001302083700001702096700001902113700001402132773011802146856008202264852000902346655001202355IND60628712720221121193234.0190325e20190120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062871272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2018.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Mingyue10aDrosophila homolog of the intellectual disability-related long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 is required for neuroblast proliferation  ap. 5-17.  aMutations in long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) are associated with non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability (ID). However, the neural functions of ACSL4 and how loss of ACSL4 leads to ID remain largely unexplored. We report here that mutations in Acsl, the Drosophila ortholog of human ACSL3 and ACSL4, result in developmental defects of the mushroom body (MB), the center of olfactory learning and memory. Specifically, Acsl mutants show fewer MB neuroblasts (Nbs) due to reduced proliferation activity and premature differentiation. Consistently, these surviving Nbs show reduced expression of cyclin E, a key regulator of the G1- to S-phase cell cycle transition, and nuclear mislocalization of the transcriptional factor Prospero, which is known to repress self-renewal genes and activate differentiating genes. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis reveals downregulated Nb- and cell-cycle-related genes and upregulated neuronal differentiation genes in Acsl mutant Nbs. As Drosophila Acsl and human ACSL4 are functionally conserved, our findings provide novel insights into a critical and previously unappreciated role of Acsl in neurogenesis and the pathogenesis of ACSL4-related ID.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3acell cycle 3acyclins 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3along-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase 3amemory 3amushroom bodies 3amutants 3amutation 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3apathogenesis 3asequence analysis 3atranscription factors 0aACSL4 0aDrosophila 0aMushroom body 0aNeuroblast 0aNeural stem cell 0aPremature differentiation 0aACSL4 0aAPF 0aCycE 0aDpn 0aEdU 0aFACS 0aGMC 0aID 0aMARCM 0aMB 0aMira 0aNb 0aNSPC 0aPH3 0aPros 0aSEM1 aMeng, Danqing1 aChen, Mo1 aLi, Tingting1 aZhang, Yong Q.1 aYao, Aiyu0 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2019 Jan. 20, v. 46, no. 1 p.5-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2018.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010900158300001600267520143000283592002801713650001601741650001101757650001201768650001101780650001101791650002601802650002501828650001301853650001501866650001401881650001401895650002301909650001301932650000901945650003301954650001101987650001301998650001202011650001402023650000902037651001502046700002102061700001702082773009602099856004002195852000902235655001202244IND50090249220221118190454.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009024922DNAL7 a10.1111/eff.120822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngstedt, Olof10aElemental fingerprinting in otoliths reveals natal homing of anadromous Baltic Sea pike (Esox lucius L.)  ap. 313-321.  aWe examined the element pattern in the otoliths of a migratory fish species that inhabit the coastal areas in the brackish of the Baltic Sea. The northern pike (Esox lucius) show migratory behaviour, spawning in streams and rivers and foraging in the sea. We examined spawning migration in four nearby streams in the south‐west part of the Baltic. Otolith analysis by microPIXE revealed unique elemental patterns (Sr, Zn, Br, Co and Mn) for the juveniles in each of the different streams. The strontium signal in the otolith of the juveniles was used as an indicator of freshwater origin and the time spent in the stream. Adult pike in their migrating spawning phase were caught in each of the streams. The elemental composition in otoliths in their freshwater phase (using juvenile pike in the streams as references) was determined. A principal component analysis showed that the elemental fingerprint during the freshwater phase several years back in time was similar for the adult fish and for juveniles inhabiting the stream today. The results indicated natal homing of the adults to a specific stream, a conclusion that was strengthened by the fact that marked fish returned to spawn over consecutive years. Anadromous pike in the Baltic Sea may thus be divided in subpopulations. The results of the study may have implications for fishery management, as pike in the Baltic Sea cannot be seen as homogenous population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEsox lucius 3aadults 3abromine 3acoasts 3acobalt 3aelemental composition 3afisheries management 3aforaging 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3amanganese 3amigratory behavior 3aotoliths 3apike 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3aspawning 3astreams 3astrontium 3azinc 3aBaltic Sea1 aEngkvist, Roland1 aLarsson, Per0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2014 July, v. 23, no. 3 p.313-321dMunksgaardx0906-66917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12082  aDNAL 7aarticle03564naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245016500208300001600373500001900389520202900408592002802437596006502465650002002530650001002550650002302560650001502583650000902598650001702607650001202624650002802636650001102664650000902675650001302684650001802697650001302715650002302728651001202751700001502763700002602778700002102804700002402825700002102849773012102870856008202991852000903073655001203082IND60707181520221120151032.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070718152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-020-09368-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrem, William H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4990-053910aEcosystem-Scale Modeling and Field Observations of Sulfate and Methylmercury Distributions in the Florida Everglades: Responses to Reductions in Sulfate Loading  ap. 191-220.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Florida Everglades has one of the most severe methylmercury (MeHg) contamination issues in the USA, resulting from factors including high rates of atmospheric mercury (Hg) deposition and sulfate inputs from agricultural lands. Sulfate loading stimulates microbial sulfate reduction and production of toxic and bioaccumulative MeHg. Controls on regional Hg emissions have been successful in reducing Hg deposition and MeHg production in wetlands in other areas, but this has not been the case for the Everglades as the Hg deposited here appears to come from unknown global sources of emissions. We posit that reductions in sulfate loading to the Florida Everglades can be an effective alternative approach used to reduce MeHg production. This study tested this hypothesis (1) by evaluating temporal trends in MeHg concentrations in response to a reduction in sulfate loading at a site in central Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3 and (2) using ecosystem-scale models to predict the effects of reductions in sulfate loading on sulfate concentrations in surface water and MeHg Risk. At the WCA site, we report a decline in sulfate concentrations (from about 9 mg/L in the late 1990s to levels of < 1 mg/L by 2001) due to changes in water delivery as part of Everglades restoration. Concurrent with the decline in sulfate, declines in MeHg concentrations in surface water and fish and wading bird tissues were observed at this site. These results suggest the efficacy of reducing MeHg production and bioaccumulation in the ecosystem through a reduction in sulfate loading. A previously developed model was used to predict the effects of reductions in sulfate loading (97%, 33%, and 10% reduction scenarios) on sulfate concentrations in surface water and MeHg Risk in the Everglades. The model identified areas of the ecosystem where MeHg Risk is most sensitive to the reductions in sulfate loading. Results show that reductions of > 33% in sulfate loading will significantly benefit the Everglades by reducing MeHg Risk.  aPublisher supplied data  aEcosystems Progeam for South FloridacU.S. Geological Survey 3abioaccumulation 3abirds 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3afish 3ageochemistry 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3amodels 3arisk 3asulfates 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3awater conservation 3aFlorida1 aFitz, Carl1 aKrabbenhoft, David P.1 aPoulin, Brett A.1 aVaronka, Matthew S.1 aAiken, George R.0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 26, no. 3 p.191-220dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl4118901x1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-020-09368-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245016000161300001400321500001900335520093500354592002801289650001101317650001401328650001301342650001101355650002601366650001601392653001801408653004201426653003701468653001201505653004201517653001201559773010901571856008001680852000901760655001201769IND60695834920221120080053.0200519e20070301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069583492DNAL7 a10.1179/174328207X1751752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Len12aA revision of the moss Syrrhopodon spiculosus Hook. & Grev.

The effect of different culture conditions, namely pH of the medium, time and temperature of incubation and the agar concentration in the medium, on the agarase production by the strain, was evaluated. The agarase production was significantly (p<0.05) affected by the culture conditions. The optimum conditions as determined by response surface methodology were found to be a temperature of 35°C, pH of 7.0 and time of fermentation of 33h and agar concentration of 0.5%. Under the optimum conditions, the isolate produced 0.17 units of agarase per ml of the medium. Ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate were the best nitrogen source in the medium for agarase production by the isolate. Supplementing the agar containing minimal media with simple sugars like glucose and galactose was found to enhance agarase production significantly by two fold. The isolate was also able to degrade carrageenan, which indicates its role in utilization of marine polysaccharides for the production of bioactive oligosaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter junii 3aagar 3aammonium nitrate 3abacteria 3acarrageenan 3acoasts 3afermentation 3agalactose 3aglucose 3amarine sediments 3anitrogen 3aoligosaccharides 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asodium nitrate 3atemperature 3aIndia 0aAgar 0aAgarase 0aAcinetobacter junii 0aResponse surface methodology1 aSachindra, N.M0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2016 Apr., v. 6 p.219-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:23286x1878-81817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245009100154300001600245520141300261592002801674650002501702650001701727650001601744650002401760650001701784650001101801650002301812650000901835650001301844650001901857650002801876650002401904650001601928650002501944700002001969773009601989856007102085852000902156655001202165IND60119151020221121010013.0141204s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011915102DNAL7 a10.1071/AN131102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aM.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary EA supplementation on semen quality parameters in chickens. Forty roosters (Dahlem Red breed), 28 weeks of age, were randomly assigned to four groups and fed diets containing EA at 0, 25, 50, or 75 mg/kg for 8 weeks. Semen was evaluated for volume, appearance, individual motility, sperm concentration, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction test, and live, dead and abnormal sperm counts. The seminal plasma was separated and evaluated for protein, alkaline phosphatase, and lipid peroxidation. At the end of the experiment, blood from individual birds was collected, and serum was separated and evaluated for superoxide dismutase activity, lipid peroxidation, and ferric-reducing ability of plasma. Supplementation with EA had no effect (P > 0.05) on gross semen parameters. Seminal plasma protein and lipid peroxidation were different (P < 0.01) between the treatment groups. The group fed EA at 75 mg/kg had high (P < 0.01) seminal plasma lipid peroxidation and lower (P < 0.05) serum superoxide dismutase activity. In conclusion, dietary supplementation of EA in chickens had no effect on the gross semen qualities and increased lipid peroxidation in seminal plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3adietary supplements 3aellagic acid 3afruits 3alipid peroxidation 3anuts 3aroosters 3aseminal plasma 3aseminal plasma proteins 3asperm concentration 3aspermatozoa 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aRao, S.

Merr.] early in the growing season. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to determine if the presence of both pathogens resulted in an increased negative impact on early soybean growth compared with each pathogen alone. Treatment factors consisted of four inoculation treatments: a non-inoculated control, inoculation with F. graminearum only (FG), inoculation with F. virguliforme only (FV), and a combination of both pathogens (FG + FV). As well, three soybean cultivars (CH2105R2, P92Y51 and ‘Sloan’), and three seed treatments (a control, mefenoxam + fludioxonil, and fluxapyroxad) were evaluated. Results indicated FG + FV did not result in increased root disease, a decrease in shoot growth, or reduced root growth compared with FG and FV. The FV inoculation treatment exhibited more root disease severity compared with FG, but there were no differences between the two inoculation treatments for the other below-ground measurements, as well as all above-ground measurements. Fungicide seed treatment did not reduce root disease severity or lead to increased early soybean growth compared with the non-treated control. Cultivar differences were the primary factor which influenced early-season soybean growth. Because there was no evidence of an increased effect between presence of F. graminearum and F. virguliforme, these results suggest management decisions for both pathogens can remain separate for soybean growers in Wisconsin, but management of F. virguliforme should take priority over F. graminearum due to its prevalent cause of soybean sudden death syndrome.  aWe thank the Wisconsin Soybean Marketing Board (Grant #161389) for funding this research.  aPublisher supplied data  a#161389cWisconsin Soybean Marketing Board 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium virguliforme 3aGlycine max 3acultivars 3adisease severity 3afludioxonil 3afungi 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agrowers 3agrowing season 3amefenoxam 3aplant development 3aroot diseases 3aroot growth 3aseed treatment 3asoybean sudden death syndrome 3asoybeans 3aWisconsin 0acultivar 0asoybean 0asudden death syndrome1 aSmith, Damon L.1 aConley, Shawn P.0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 41, no. 2 p.251-260dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43214x1715-29927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2019.15661803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245006700189300001600256520144100272592002801713650002101741650001301762650001601775650001901791650001001810650001401820650001001834650001001844650001401854650001401868650002501882650001101907650001401918650001201932650001301944650003701957650005901994650005802053650002202111650001402133650002402147650002402171653002902195653001302224653002002237653001502257653002502272700001902297700001802316773011902334856008502453852000902538655001202547IND50060478720221122230951.0200106e20130323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006047872DNAL7 a231029892pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Hyuk-Joon10aMolecular prophage typing of avian pathogenic Escherichia coli  ap. 785-792.  aEscherichia coli prophages confer virulence and resistance to physico-chemical, nutritional, and antibiotic stresses on their hosts, and they enhance the evolution of E. coli. Thus, studies on profiles of E. coli prophages are valuable to understand the population structure and evolution of E. coli pathogenicity. Large terminase genes participate in phage genome packaging and are one of the cornerstones for the identification of prophages. Thus, we designed primers to detect 16 types of large terminase genes and analyzed the genomes of 48 E. coli and Shigella reference strains for the prophage markers. We also investigated the distribution of the 16 prophage markers among 92 avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strains. APEC strains were classified into 61 prophage types (PPTs). Each strain was different from the reference strains as measured by the PPTs and from the frequency of each prophage marker. Investigation of the distribution of prophage-related serum resistance (bor), toxin (stx1 and cdtI), and T3SS effector (lom, espK, sopE, nleB, and ospG) genes revealed the presence of bor (44.1%), lom (95.5%) and cdtI (9.1%) in APEC strains with related prophages. Therefore, the molecular prophage typing method may be useful to understand population structure and evolution of E. coli pathogenicity, and further studies on the mobility of the prophages and the roles of virulence genes in APEC pathogenicity may be valuable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aShigella 3aantibiotics 3abacteriophages 3abirds 3aevolution 3agenes 3ahosts 3anutrition 3apackaging 3apopulation structure 3atoxins 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aEndodeoxyribonucleasesxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxdiagnosisxmicrobiology. 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aPhylogeny 2aProphagesxgenetics 2aVirulencexgenetics 0aAvian pathogenic E. coli 0aProphage 0aLarge terminase 0aToxin gene 0aPopulation structure1 aSeong, Won-Jin1 aKim, Jae-Hong0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2013 Mar. 23, v. 162, no. 2-4 p.785-792dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001700167245015100184300001800335520201900353650004202372650001402414650002102428650001802449650002302467650002502490650002502515650002102540650002302561650003502584650001802619650001802637650002102655650003602676650003102712650004302743650004202786650002102828650002802849650003702877650005802914650005302972650003903025650001603064653001203080700001103092700001603103773011503119852000903234856008803243930003303331945001303364946001303377655001203390IND2207609220221120030415.0001103e200010  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220760922DNAL7 a110434682pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.10.10712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowley, K.B.10aMolecular analysis of thermoregulation of phaseolotoxin-resistant ornithine carbamoyltransferase (argK) from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola  ap. 1071-1080.  aThe phaseolotoxin-resistant ornithine carbamoyltransferase (ROCT) and phaseolotoxin are produced by Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola at 18 degrees C but not at 28 degrees C. At 28 degrees C, the pathogen produces a protein(s) that binds (in vitro) to a 485-bp fragment (thermoregulatory region, TRR) from a heterologous clone from the pathogen genomic library, which in multiple copies overrides thermoregulation of phaseolotoxin production in wild-type cells (K. B. Rowley, D. E. Clements, M. Mandel, T. Humphreys, and S. S. Patil, Mol. Microbiol. 8:625-635, 1993). We report here that DNase I protection analysis of the 485-bp fragment shows that a single site is protected from cleavage by the protein in the 28 degrees C extract and that this site contains two repeats of a core motif G/C AAAG separated by a 5-bp spacer. Partially purified binding protein forms specific complexes with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing four tandem repeats of this motif. A 492-bp upstream fragment from argK encoding ROCT also forms specific complexes with the protein in the 28 degrees C crude extract, and a 260-bp subfragment from the TRR containing the binding site cross competes with the argk fragment, indicating that the same protein binds to nucleotides in both fragments. DNase I protection analysis of the fragment from argK revealed four separate protected sequence elements, with element III containing half of the core motif sequence (CTTTG), and the other elements containing similar sequences. Gel shift assays were done with DNA fragments from which one or all of the sites were removed as competitor DNAs against the argK probe. The results of these experiments confirmed that the binding sites (in argK) are necessary for the protein to bind to the argK fragment in a specific manner. Taken together, the results of studies presented here suggest that in cells of P. syringae pv. phaseolicola grown at high temperature argK may be negatively regulated by the protein produced at this temperature. 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 3aornithine 3athermoregulation 3aphaseolotoxin 3abacterial proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding proteins 3aDNA fingerprinting 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aDNA Footprinting 2aDeoxyribonuclease Ixmetabolism 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aExotoxinsxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrnithinexanalogs & derivatives 2aOrnithine Carbamoyltransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPseudomonasxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aTemperature 0abinding1 aXu, R.1 aPatil, S.S.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2000 Oct., v. 13, no. 10 p.1071-1080wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.10.10713Available from publisher's Web site  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle04484naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002200167245014400189300001800333500001500351520218100366650002702547650001602574650002202590650003002612650002002642650001702662650001602679650001302695650002302708650002302731650002102754650002002775650005602795650005302851650002302904650002902927650002002956650005202976650002803028650003103056650003303087650001303120650003903133650002703172650002803199650001403227653001203241653002303253653002803276653002503304653002103329653003003350653002103380653002103401700001303422700001703435700001203452700001503464700001803479773009703497852000903594856008803603930003303691945001303724946001303737655001203750IND2207609820221120030506.0001103e200010  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220760982DNAL7 a110434692pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.10.10812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalanichelvam, K.12aA second T-region of the soybean-supervirulent chrysopine-type Ti plasmid pTiChry5, and construction of a fully disarmed vir helper plasmid  ap. 1081-1091.  a2019-12-04  aAgrobacterium tumefaciens Chry5, which is particularly virulent on soybeans, induces tumors that produce a family of Amadori-type opines that includes deoxyfructosyl glutamine (Dfg) and its lactone, chrysopine (Chy). Cosmid clones mapping to the right of the known oncogenic T-region of pTiChry5 conferred Amadori opine production on tumors induced by the nopaline strain C58. Sequence analysis of DNA held in common among these cosmids identified two 25-bp, direct repeats flanking an 8.5-kb segment of pTiChry5. These probable border sequences are closely related to those of other known T-regions and define a second T-region of pTiChry5, called T-right (T(R)), that confers production of the Amadori opines. The oncogenic T-left region (T(L)) was located precisely by identifying and sequencing the likely border repeats defining this segment. The two T-regions are separated by approximately 15 kb of plasmid DNA. Based on these results, we predicted that pKYRT1, a vir helper plasmid derived from pTiChry5, still contains all of T(R) and the leftmost 9 kb of T(L). Consistent with this hypothesis, transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants selected for with a marker encoded by a binary plasmid following transformation with KYRT1 coinherited production of the Amadori opines at high frequency. All opine-positive transgenic plants also contained T(R)-DNA, while those plants that lacked T(R)-DNA failed to produce the opines. Moreover, A. thaliana infected with KYRT1 in which an nptII gene driven by the 35S promoter of Cauliflower mosaic virus was inserted directly into the vir helper plasmid yielded kanamycin-resistant transformants at a low but detectable frequency. These results demonstrate that pKYRT1 is not disarmed, and can transfer Ti plasmid DNA to plants. A new vir helper plasmid was constructed from pTiChry5 by two rounds of sacB-mediated selection for deletion events. This plasmid, called pKPSF2, lacks both of the known T-regions and their borders. pKPSF2 failed to transfer Ti plasmid DNA to plants, but mobilized the T-region of a binary plasmid at an efficiency indistinguishable from those of pKYRT1 and the nopaline-type vir helper plasmid pMP90. 3agenetic transformation 3aGlycine max 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aplasmid vectors 3atransfer DNA 3ametabolites 3aplasmids 3achromosome mapping 3abacterial proteins 3apromoter regions 3agenetic markers 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGlutaminexanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesis. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Tumorsxmicrobiology 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlasmids 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSoybeansxmicrobiology 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aVirulence 0acosmids 0ain vitro selection 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/af229155 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0agenbank/af229157 0agenbank/af2291561 aOger, P.1 aClough, S.J.1 aCha, C.1 aBent, A.F.1 aFarrand, S.K.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2000 Oct., v. 13, no. 10 p.1081-1091x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2000.13.10.10813Available from publisher's Web site  a20001231b20010109c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02663naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001900163245011000182300001600292520083100308650001401139650000901153650001301162650001801175650002401193650001601217650002501233650002001258650003301278650001601311650002301327650002301350650002301373650001401396650004801410650001201458650007401470650007101544650001501615650006301630650006101693650002401754650002401778650003101802650005001833700002101883700001801904773008301922852000902005930003302014945002502047946001302072655001202085IND4412002620221120022631.0081030e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441200262DNAL7 a185673132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

After being purified by gel-permeation chromatography in ethyl actate-tetrahydrofuran, the organotin compounds were derivatized by pentylmagnesium bromide. The derivative products were injected into the GC system and detected by PFPD (sulfur mode). The method was validated by analysis of the certified reference material and spiked samples. Recoveries of organotins ranged from 84.1 to 116.6% with relative standard deviation between 1.3 and 16.0% when spiked at levels of 2, 10, and 40 μg/kg. The limits of detection varied from 0.1 to 1.2 μg/kg for shellfish and 0.1 to 0.5 μg/kg for fish. The proposed method was suitable for determining organotins in aquatic foods. 3ashellfish 3afish 3aseafoods 3afood analysis 3aorganotin compounds 3astabilizers 3ainsecticide residues 3awater pollution 3acapillary gas chromatography 3aphotometers 3afood contamination 3aantifouling agents 3awood preservatives 3acatalysts 2aAnimal Feedxanalysisxstandardsxtoxicity. 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gasxmethodsxstandardsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFlame Ionizationxmethodsxstandardsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aFood Chain 2aFood Contaminationxanalysisxstatistics & numerical data. 2aOrganometallic Compoundsxanalysisxstandardsxtoxicity. 2aPhotometryxmethods 2aReference Standards 2aReproducibility of Results 2aTin Compoundsxanalysisxstandardsxtoxicity.1 aZhao, Kong-Xiang1 aWu, Yong-Ning0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2008 , v. 91, no. 3 p.653-659x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20081119b20081206c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/11/18  aOther US 7aarticle01721naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245012700151300001800278520020300296650002400499650002800523650002000551650001200571650001000583650003700593650002400630650001100654650001100665650000900676650003800685650002300723650002400746650004200770650003800812650005300850650003300903651001000936653002800946700001700974700001800991700001701009700001701026773010901043852000901152939003301161945000801194946001301202655001201215991612516770742620221123035639.0830411e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830038732DNAL7 a68907752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeldmeier, H.10aEfficacy of metrifonate in urinary schistosomiasis: Comparison of reduction of Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni eggs  ap. 1188-1194.  aSchistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, human, mixed infections, excretion of eggs of both species in both urine and stool, effect of two-dose metrifonate treatment on excretion of eggs in urine: Sudan 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aSchistosoma haematobium 3amixed infection 2aAnimals 2aChild 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOvumxdrug effectsxparasitology. 2aParasite Egg Count 2aRegression Analysis 2aSchistosoma haematobiumxdrug effects 2aSchistosoma mansonixdrug effects 2aSchistosomiasisxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxurine. 2aTrichlorfonxtherapeutic use 3aSudan 0aUrine and urinary tract1 aDoehring, E.1 aDaffala, A.A.1 aOmer, A.H.S.1 aDietrich, M.0 tAmerican journal of tropical medicine and hygiene.g1982 Nov., v. 31, no. 6 p.1188-1194x0002-96377nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830411c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02262naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011600130300001600246500001500262520127500277650001201552650002101564650002401585650001301609650001601622650002701638650002801665650002001693653001301713653002201726700001601748773007001764852000901834930003301843945001301876946001101889655001201900IND2036991020221123030534.0940131e199309  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203699102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVianen, A. van.14aThe adult component of selection in Drosophila melanogaster: some aspects of early-remating activity of females  ap. 269-276.  a2019-12-05  aAs an important factor of the adult component of selection, mating behaviour was studied in Drosophila melanogaster, with emphasis on non-virgin females. We found that 30-50 per cent of the females in a laboratory population will remate within 6 h of first mating under no-choice conditions. This high percentage of early rematings was not due to the continuous confinement of the females with males but indicated a rapid return of receptivity of a significant proportion of the females. Remating behaviour was significantly influenced by both the genotype of the female and the genotype of her two successive partners. Age of females was only important insofar as it concerned young, 1 or 2-day old, females. These females showed less remating than older females. Willingness to remate was also affected by the number of sperm stored. Females that had been inseminated by less fertile males, i.e. males that had already mated two or three times, showed higher remating percentages than females inseminated by more fertile males. Notwithstanding this sperm effect, females were estimated to remate approximately every second day. It is suggested that a high frequency of remating and the resulting sperm competition are significant components of Drosophila life-history. 3afemales 3asexual selection 3asexual reproduction 3agenotype 3aspermatozoa 3aecological competition 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3amating behavior 0aremating 0anatural selection1 aBijlsma, R.0 tHeredity.g1993 Sept., v. 71, no. pt.3 p.269-276x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01549naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245014200148300001800290520027300308650002400581650001000605650001300615650002300628650001200651650004200663650002300705650001900728650002500747650001500772650002600787650003400813651001600847651001600863653002100879653002200900700002100922773010900943852000901052939003301061945000801094946001301102655001201115991612515530742620221123014013.0830411e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830038742DNAL7 a71491032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulvey, M.10aPopulation structure in Biomphalaria glabrata: Examination of an hypothesis for the patchy distribution of susceptibility to schistosomes  ap. 1195-1200.  aBiomphalaria glabrata populations characterized using electrophoretic techniques, data are consistent with hypothesis that random genetic drift and low rates of migration might be responsible for patchy distribution of snail susceptibility to schistosomes: Puerto Rico 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3ahosts 3agenetics 3apopulation ecology 2aAnimals 2aBiomphalariaxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetics, Population 2aInbreeding 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSchistosomiasisxtransmission 3aPuerto Rico 0aPuerto Rico 0aResistance, Host 0aVectors, Mollusca1 aVrijenhoek, R.C.0 tAmerican journal of tropical medicine and hygiene.g1982 Nov., v. 31, no. 6 p.1195-1200x0002-96377nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830411c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01333naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245008600152300001800238520015900256650002700415650001300442650002100455650001200476650003000488650005500518650003700573650002000610650004600630650001500676700001800691700001500709700002000724700001900744773010900763852000900872939003300881945000800914946001300922655001200935991612514320742620221123001843.0830411e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830038782DNAL7 a68160802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrotoski, W.A.10aDemonstration of hypnozoites in sporozoite-transmitted Plasmodium vivax infection  ap. 1291-1293.  aPlasmodium vivax, demonstration of hypnozoites in sporozoite-transmitted infection in chimpanzees, added support for hypnozoite theory of malarial relapse 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aProtozoa 3aPlasmodium vivax 2aAnimals 2aApicomplexaxparasitology 2aLiver Diseases, Parasiticxetiologyxtransmission. 2aMalariaxetiologyxtransmission. 2aPan troglodytes 2aPlasmodium vivaxxanalysisxparasitology. 2aRecurrence1 aCollins, W.E.1 aBray, R.S.1 aGarnham, P.C.C.1 aCogswell, F.B.0 tAmerican journal of tropical medicine and hygiene.g1982 Nov., v. 31, no. 6 p.1291-1293x0002-96377nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830411c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle04195naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171072001700188100001400205245011700219300001600336520206100352650001302413650001302426650002902439650001802468650001402486650001402500650001702514650002102531650002002552650006302572650004602635650004802681650001202729650002102741650002602762650003002788650002902818650004602847650000902893650002202902650003002924650002202954650004602976653002803022700001503050700001203065700002003077700001703097700001603114700001503130773022303145852000903368856007603377930003303453945002503486946001103511990002303522655001203545IND4383613220221122225336.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438361322DNAL7 a169706332pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0442.2006.00849.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSingh, P.10aXylazine, Ketamine and their Combination for Lumbar Epidural Analgesia in Water Buffalo Calves (Bubalus bubalis)  ap. 423-431.  aThe study was conducted to evaluate the effects of xylazine individually (0.05 mg/kg), ketamine individually (2.5 mg/kg), and a combination of xylazine and ketamine (0.05 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg) after lumbar epidural administration in water buffalo calves. Fifteen non-descript, male water buffalo calves of 6-8 months of age weighing between 55 and 75 kg were randomly placed in three groups (groups A, B and C). The agents were administered at the first lumbar epidural space. Clinico-physiological parameters, such as analgesia, ataxia, sedation, salivation, heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature were studied. Other haematological and biochemical parameters monitored were haemoglobin, packed cell volume, total leukocyte count, plasma glucose, cortisol, protein albumin, globulin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanineamino transferase (ALT), sodium, potassium and chloride. The onset of analgesia (mean ± SEM) was faster in group C (3.2 ± 0.20 min) compared with that of group B (4.6 ± 0.22 min) and group A (34.0 ± 1.86 min). Analgesia of the thorax, flank, inguinal region, hind limbs, perineum and tail was complete in group C, but mild to moderate in groups A and B. Ataxia was severe in group C and mild in groups A and B. Mild to deep sedation was produced by groups A and C animals. Group B animals failed to produce sedation. Longer duration and greater depth of analgesia was produced in animals of group C. Heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature decreased in groups A and C. The haematological parameters decreased in all the groups. The biochemical parameters like glucose, cortisol, BUN, creatinine, and ALT increased in all the animals. However, total proteins and albumin decreased in the three groups. The plasma electrolytes sodium, potassium and chloride did not show any significant change. The results of this study indicated a possible synergistic analgesic interaction between epidurally administered xylazine and ketamine, without causing any marked systemic effects in water buffalo calves. 3axylazine 3aketamine 3acombination drug therapy 3ayoung animals 3aanalgesia 3abuffaloes 3alumbar spine 3aanalgesic effect 3adrug evaluation 2aAdrenergic alpha-Agonistsxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aAnalgesia, Epiduralxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnalgesicsxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aArea Under Curve 2aBuffaloesxphysiology 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aKetaminexpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aRandom Allocation 2aRespirationxdrug effects 2aTreatment Outcome 2aXylazinexpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 0aepidural administration1 aPratap, K.1 aAmarpal1 aKinjavdekar, P.1 aAithal, H.P.1 aSingh, G.R.1 aPathak, R.0 tZentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

A greenhouse process computer has been developed with an architecture that allows for easy implementation of custom algorithms without risk to control continuity. The system in question was demonstrated by implementing a transpiration model that predicts actual crop transpiration from greenhouse climate measurements. In addition, the process computer was connected to a system that calculates the transpiration rate from the rooting substrate weight, irrigation supply, drainage water and crop weight. The transpiration model was calibrated and validated with historical data from the weighing system collected at a Dutch commercial greenhouse from April to May 2014. Then, the model was implemented in the process control computer at commercial nurseries in The Netherlands and Texas USA, respectively. It can be assumed that the model predicts the transpiration rate of a healthy and productive crop. Therefore, suboptimal crop-performance is indicated when the measured transpiration rate is less than predicted. In the time period when the tests were conducted, the crops exhibited both low transpiration rates at midday and reduced transpiration rates due to insufficient irrigation. On those occasions, the process computer generated an alarm in order to warn the grower that a problem had occurred. This study demonstrates that additional intelligence, such as simulation models, when implemented in a greenhouse process computer and combined with the appropriate measurements, can automatically alert the grower of potentially damaging conditions, e.g. reduced crop performance or a system malfunction in the greenhouse. The developed architecture will facilitate the design of new generation computer controls that take advantage of increasing knowledge of crop-functioning and other greenhouse processes. 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3acrops 3adrainage water 3agreenhouse effect 3agreenhouses 3agrowers 3airrigation 3aprocess control 3arisk 3arooting 3asimulation models 3atranspiration 3aNetherlands 3aTexas1 aTsafaras, I.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 July 31, , no. 1170 p.301-308dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1170.36  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002800181245008800209300001800297500002400315506007600339520250700415506003702922650003202959650002502991650002103016650003003037650002703067650001903094650001303113650001203126650001903138650002103157650002503178650001703203650001803220700002103238700002403259773013603283852000903419856008003428856004803508655001203556IND4395589520221207134620.0070930e20071001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439558952DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00837-072doi7 aPMC20750102pmcid7 a176754332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimões, Lúcia Chaves.10aBiofilm Interactions between Distinct Bacterial Genera Isolated from Drinking Water  ap. 6192-6200.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the environment, multiple microorganisms coexist as communities, competing for resources and often associated as biofilms. In this study, single- and dual-species biofilm formation by, and specific activities of, six heterotrophic intergeneric bacteria were determined using 96-well polystyrene plates over a 72-h period. These bacteria were isolated from drinking water and identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A series of planktonic studies was also performed, assessing the bacterial growth rate, motility, and production of quorum-sensing inhibitors (QSI). This constituted an attempt to identify key attributes allowing bacteria to effectively interact and coexist in a drinking-water environment. We observed that in both pure and dual cultures, all of the isolates formed stable biofilms within 72 h, with specific metabolic activity decreasing, in most cases, with an increase in biofilm mass. The largest single- and dual-biofilm amounts were found for Methylobacterium sp. and the combination of Methylobacterium sp. and Mycobacterium mucogenicum, respectively. Evidences of microbial interactions in dual-biofilm formation, associated with appreciable biomass variation in comparison with single biofilms, were found for the following cases: synergy/cooperation between Sphingomonas capsulata and Burkholderia cepacia, S. capsulata and Staphylococcus sp., and B. cepacia and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and antagonism between S. capsulata and M. mucogenicum, S. capsulata and A. calcoaceticus, and M. mucogenicum and Staphylococcus sp. A neutral interaction was found for Methylobacterium sp.-M. mucogenicum, S. capsulata-Staphylococcus sp., M. mucogenicum-A. calcoaceticus, and Methylobacterium sp.-A. calcoaceticus biofilms, since the resultant dual biofilms had a mass and specific metabolic activity similar to the average for each single biofilm. B. cepacia had the highest growth rate and motility and produced QSI. Other bacteria producing QSI were Methylobacterium sp., S. capsulata, and Staphylococcus sp. However, only for S. capsulata-M. mucogenicum, S. capsulata-A. calcoaceticus, and M. mucogenicum-Staphylococcus sp., dual-biofilm formation seems to be regulated by the QSI produced by S. capsulata and Staphylococcus sp. and by the increased growth rate of S. capsulata. The parameters assessed by planktonic studies did not allow prediction and generalization of the exact mechanism regulating dual-species biofilm formation between the drinking-water bacteria.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus 3aBurkholderia cepacia 3aMethylobacterium 3aMycobacterium mucogenicum 3aSphingomonas capsulata 3aStaphylococcus 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3adrinking water 3amicrobial growth 3anucleotide sequences 3apolystyrenes 3aribosomal RNA1 aSimões, Manuel.1 aVieira, Maria João0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 Oct. 1, v. 73, no. 19 p.6192-6200dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00837-073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03380naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009100171300001400262500017200276520187500448650002102323650001302344650002202357650001902379650002002398650001402418650001002432650001202442650001902454650000902473650001302482650001502495650001602510650001102526650001202537650000902549650001102558650001102569650001602580650001002596650001102606651001502617700001502632700002102647773014302668856005402811852000902865655001202874IND60588324520221122220918.0180111e10-3-217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058832452DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1175.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeJong, T. M.10aChallenges to prune production in increasingly variable Californian weather conditions  ap. 25-28.  aPaper presented at the III EUFRIN Plum and Prune Working Group Meeting on Present Constraints of Plum Growing in Europe, held August 20, 2015, Skopelos Island (Greece)  aThere are approximately 20,000 ha of bearing prune trees in California but the industry is heavily reliant on one cultivar (Prunus domestica 'Improved French'). While, prior to a decade ago, the central valleys of California presented almost ideal conditions for growing prunes (winters cool enough to provide ample chilling, minimal risk of frost and moderate temperatures during and after bloom in the spring, a long, warm summer growing season and ample water available for irrigation) in the recent decade prune growers have experienced increasingly volatile winter and spring weather patterns and several years in which yields have been limited by environmental stresses. Interestingly, while California has experienced a number of “low-chill” winters in recent years this has had little apparent effect on prune crop production. The most important weather-related limitation to prune yields has been excessive temperatures that occur during bloom. In the past decade there have been 4 years in which crops yields appear to have been significantly reduced because of unusually warm temperatures during bloom and because statewide production is dependent on one cultivar in some years most of the trees bloom at nearly the same time. A second important weather related issue affecting cropping is the accumulated heat-units during the first 30 days after bloom. High heat accumulation after bloom shortens the period between bloom and harvest and can lead to smaller fruit sizes. The UC Davis prune breeding program is attempting to address these issues by developing new cultivars that present a broader range of bloom and harvest timings, have higher tolerance to high spring temperatures, while increasing fruit size and quality. Details of weather-related problems experienced in California and progress toward achieving our breeding goals will be discussed. 3aPrunus domestica 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3acold treatment 3acrop production 3acultivars 3afrost 3agrowers 3agrowing season 3aheat 3aindustry 3airrigation 3anew variety 3aprunes 3apruning 3arisk 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3awinter 3aCalifornia1 aCastro, S.1 aNiederholzer, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Oct. 30, , no. 1175 p.25-28dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1175.6  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007500173300001400248500017200262520047200434650001100906650001400917650001300931650001400944650001600958650002700974650002801001700002201029700001501051700001901066700001701085700001501102700001401117700001701131700000301148700001701151700001701168773014301185856005401328852000901382655001201391IND60588324420180323000000.0180111e10-3-217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058832442DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1175.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHjeltnes, S.

  1 aMousley, A.10aExpression and bioactivity of allatostatin-like neuropeptides in helminths  ap. 1557-1567.  a2019-12-04  aAllatostatins are the largest family of known arthropod neuropeptides. To date more than 150 different arthropod type-A allatostatins have been identified and are characterized by the C-terminal signature, (Y/F)XFG(L/I)amide. Using specific allatostatin antisera, positive immunoreactivity has been identified within the central and peripheral nervous systems of the flatworm (platyhelminth) Procerodes littoralis and the roundworm (nematode) Panagrellus redivivus. Comparative analyses of the allatostatin-like immunoreactivity and that of other known helminth neuropeptides (FMRFamide-like peptides [FLPs]) indicate differences in the distribution of these peptide families. Specific differences in neuropeptide distribution have been noted within the pharyngeal innervation of flatworms and in the cephalic papillary neurons of nematodes. In arthropods, type-A allatostatins have functions that include potent myoactivity. In this study, seven members of the allatostatin superfamily induced concentration-dependent contractions of flatworm muscle fibres. Pharmacological studies indicate that these peptides do not interact with muscle-based FLP receptors. The type-A allatostatins, therefore, represent the second family of neuropeptides that induce muscle contraction in flatworms. Although the majority of arthropod type-A allatostatins examined did not affect the somatic body wall muscle or the ovijector of the pig nematode, Ascaris suum, two type-A allatostatins (GDGRLYAFGLamide and DRLYSFGLamide) exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the A. suum ovijector at 10 μM. These data suggest that allatostatin-like peptides and receptors occur in helminths. Further, although arthropod type-A allatostatins display inter-phyla activities, their receptors are less compelling as potential targets for broad-spectrum parasiticides (endectocides) than FLP receptors. 3amuscle contraction 3adose response 3abioactive properties 3aTricladida 3aallatostatin 3aAscaris suum 3atissue distribution 3anervous system 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ahelminths 2aAnimals 2aAscarisxchemistry 2aBiological Assay 2aFemale 2aHelminthsxchemistry 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMuscle Fibers, Skeletalxchemistry 2aNeuropeptidesxanalysis 2aPlatyhelminthsxchemistry 2aReceptors, Invertebrate Peptide 0atype-A allatostatins 0aProcerodes littoralis 0aneuropeptides 0amyoactivity1 aMoffett, C.L.1 aDuve, H.1 aThorpe, A.1 aHalton, D.W.1 aGeary, T.G.1 aThompson, D.P.1 aMaule, A.G.1 aMarks, N.J.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2005 Dec., v. 35, no. 14 p.1557-1567x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2005.08.0023electronic resource  a20061002b20061102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02806naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013000168300001600298520142600314650001401740650001101754650002001765650001601785650002001801650001901821650001601840650001501856650002601871650001601897650001001913650001801923650002901941650001701970700001701987700001802004700001902022700002002041700001502061700002002076700002102096773017102117856005102288852000902339655001202348IND60646474720221122180906.0190612e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064647472DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-4992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Po-Tsun10aQuantification of the β2-Adrenergic Feed Additives Ractopamine and Salbutamol by Reductive Amination–Assisted Modification  ap. 696-702.  aβ2-Adrenergic compounds such as ractopamine and salbutamol can cause smooth muscle relaxation and are used for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment. However, β2-adrenergic compounds may also cause some adverse cardiovascular effects or behavioral changes in humans; therefore, it is important for analytical chemists to determine the amounts of β2-adrenergic compounds in raw biological materials. Herein, novel analogs for standards and internal standard analogs were synthesized through reductive amination with isotopic H2-formaldehyde, D2-formaldehyde, and sodium cyanoborohydride. These analogs were used for quantifying β2-adrenergic compounds such as ractopamine and salbutamol in ground pork samples under multiple reaction monitoring scanning modes by tandem mass spectrometry. H2-Formaldehyde–modified ractopamine and H2-formaldehyde–modified salbutamol acting as standards were used to prepare calibration curves, whereas D2-formaldehyde was used to generate D2-modified ractopamine and D2-modified salbutamol analogs acting as internal standards. The H2-modified ractopamine and H2-modified salbutamol showed excellent correlation coefficients, limits of detection, and limits of quantification. In mass spectrometric detection, H2-modified ractopamine showed 202% signal enhancement after modification and H2-modified salbutamol showed 17% signal enhancement after modification. 3aamination 3aasthma 3abronchodilators 3acalibration 3adetection limit 3afeed additives 3aground pork 3amonitoring 3aquantitative analysis 3aractopamine 3asalts 3asmooth muscle 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atherapeutics1 aWu, You-Ying1 aChang, Yu-Tzu1 aZheng, Jiewen,1 aHuang, Mei-Fang1 aChen, Ziyu1 aShiue, Yow-Ling1 aLiang, Shih-Shin0 tJournal of food protection.g2019 Apr., v. 82, no. 4 p.696-702dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-499  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245008200172300001400254500015600268520139200424650000801816650001301824650001901837650001901856650001601875650000901891650001101900650001301911650001501924650001501939773014301954856005402097852000902151655001202160IND60588320320221122180901.0180110e20170731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058832032DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1170.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuroyanagi, T.10aPrediction of leakage rate of a greenhouse using computational fluid dynamics  ap. 87-94.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on New Technologies and Management for Greenhouses - GreenSys2015 held July 19-23, 2015, Evora, Portugal  aAir leakage causes loss of heat and carbon dioxide from greenhouses. The magnitude of the leakage is evaluated by the tracer gas method or energy balance method, but these methods often require cost and time. An alternative to these experimental methods is proposed in this study. The feasibility of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for the prediction of leakage rate of a greenhouse was investigated. The procedure commenced with the calculation of the external pressure coefficient of each surface of the greenhouse using CFD simulation. Subsequently, the leakage rate was calculated numerically, as well as the internal pressure coefficient, using a model that estimates the leakage airflow through apertures, which is induced by the difference between the external and internal pressures on either side of a wall. For validation, a single-span greenhouse (floor area: 6×14 m, and height: 3.5 m) was used. A net-covered windbreak (a porosity of 0.604) was used to investigate the robustness of the model; the influence of the presence of obstacles on the accuracy of the predicted leakage rate was studied. The simulation was validated by comparing with the information available in literatures and the leakage measurements. The leakage rate predicted based on CFD simulation has similar levels as the values obtained from leakage measurements using the concentration decay method. 3aair 3aair flow 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy balance 3agreenhouses 3aheat 3amodels 3aporosity 3aprediction 3awindbreaks0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 July 31, , no. 1170 p.87-94dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1170.9  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245014000172300001600312500015600328520132900484650001301813650001601826650001601842650001001858650000901868700001401877700001601891700001801907700002301925773014501948856005502093852000902148655001202157IND60588321120221122180840.0180110e20170731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058832112DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1170.162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNtinas, G.

The high density of greenhouses affects the local wind characteristics and subsequently the pressure coefficient distribution on the greenhouse frame, which is usually constructed by steel. The external pressure coefficient (cp) is used for the design and construction of the metal frame in order to ensure the static integrity of the structure against the wind load. The EC1 in conjunction with EN 13031-1:2001, which is specialized for greenhouses, gives values for this coefficient. However, when two structures are situated very close to each other the Eurocode do not provide values for the pressure coefficients on them, which is a common situation in greenhouse areas. The present work studied the external pressure coefficient over two greenhouses with parabolic roofs in tandem arrangement. A CFD approximation was suggested to simulate the incompressible, two-dimensional, steady and viscous airflow around the structures. The numerical results, as contours of pressure (isobars) and coefficients of pressure, were compared qualitatively and quantitatively with available data from the EN 13031-1:2001 for a single structure. The results of this study will be useful for agricultural engineers in the design of greenhouses. 3aair flow 3agreenhouses 3arural areas 3asteel 3awind1 aDados, I.1 aKateris, D.1 aFragos, V.

Population genetic structure of Schistosoma japonicum between definitive host species  ap. 1317-1325.  aMulti-host parasites, those capable of infecting more than one species of host, are responsible for the majority of all zoonotic, emerging or persistent human and animal diseases and are considered one of the major challenges for the biomedical sciences in the 21st century. We characterized the population structure of the multi-host parasite Schistosoma japonicum in relation to its definitive host species by genotyping miracidia collected from humans and domestic animals across five villages around the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, mainland China, using microsatellite markers. High levels of polymorphisms were observed and two main genetic clusters were identified which separated water buffalo, cattle and humans from goats, pigs, dogs and cats. We thereby believe that we present the first evidence of definitive host-based genetic variation in Schistosoma japonicum which has important epidemiological, evolutionary, medical and veterinary implications. 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3amiracidia 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahumans 3adomestic animals 3aschistosomiasis 3ahost strains 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domesticxparasitology 2aBuffaloesxparasitology 2aCats 2aCattle 2aDNA, Helminthxgenetics 2aDogs 2aGene Frequencyxgenetics 2aGenetics, Populationxmethods 2aGenotype 2aGoatsxparasitology 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aRural Health 2aSchistosoma japonicumxclassificationxgenetics. 2aSchistosomiasis japonicaxepidemiologyxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSwinexparasitology 3aChina 0aChinaxepidemiology.1 aShrivastava, J.1 aJohansen, M.V.1 aZhang, S.Q.1 aWang, F.F.1 aWebster, J.P.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2006 Oct., v. 36, no. 12 p.1317-1325x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2006.06.0113electronic resource  a20061002b20061102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03656naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167100001500184245012600199300001800325520155400343650002501897650003101922650002401953650002501977650002202002650004302024650002202067650002502089650002002114650001402134650002702148650002302175650001202198650001802210650002802228650003302256650003302289650003002322650003002352650002502382650001302407650002402420650004202444650002702486650003302513650001402546650003602560650002802596650002402624653001402648700001702662700001902679700001902698700001602717773009902733852000902832856007202841930003302913945002502946946001102971655001202982IND4383934820221122161949.0060928e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438393482DNAL7 a169502662pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2006.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The genetic variability was studied using both amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and nad4 sequences of the mitochondrial genome. To examine the performance and information content of the two different marker systems, comparative assessment of population genetic diversity was undertaken in 19 isolates of H. contortus, a parasitic nematode of small ruminants. A total of 150 individual adult worms representing 14 countries from all inhabited continents were analysed. Altogether 1,429 informative AFLP markers were generated using four different primer combinations. Also, the genetic variation was high, which agrees with results from previous AFLP studies of nematode parasites of livestock. The genetic structure was high, indicating limited gene flow between the different isolates and populations from each continent mostly formed monophyletic groups in the phylogenetic analysis. However, for isolates representing Australia, Greece and one laboratory strain that originated from South Africa (WRS), there was no clear genetic relationship between the isolates and the distance between their geographical origins. Basically the same pattern was observed for the mitochondrial marker, although the phylogenetic analysis was less resolved than for AFLP. In contrast with previous findings on the population genetic structure of H. contortus, the calculation of population structure gave high values (Nst = 0.59). The strong structure was present also 3aHaemonchus contortus 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 3agenetic variation 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic markers 3aphylogeny 3ageographical variation 3astrain differences 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Helminthxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aGene Amplificationxgenetics 2aGenes, Helminthxgenetics 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aGoatsxparasitology 2aHaemonchusxclassificationxgenetics. 2aMitochondriaxgenetics 2aNADH Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aRuminantsxparasitology 2aSheepxparasitology 0anad4 gene1 aEngstrom, A.1 aMorrison, D.A.1 aMattsson, J.G.1 aHoglund, J.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2006 Oct., v. 36, no. 12 p.1305-1316x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2006.06.0153electronic resource  a20061002b20061102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02240naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121072001700139072001700156100001600173245006100189300001600250520105300266650002501319650001801344650001401362650002501376650003101401650001801432650001401450650002101464653003501485653003501520700001901555700001701574700001501591773007101606852000901677856006301686930003301749945002501782946001101807655001201818IND4384228120221122113441.0061011e20060119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438422812DNAL7 a10.1038/nature043732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRazem, F.A.14aThe RNA-binding protein FCA is an abscisic acid receptor  ap. 290-294.  aThe phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates various physiological processes in plants. The molecular mechanisms by which this is achieved are not fully understood. Genetic approaches have characterized several downstream components of ABA signalling, but a receptor for ABA has remained elusive. Although studies indicate that several ABA response genes encode RNA-binding or RNA-processing proteins, none has been found to be functional in binding ABA. Here we show that FCA, an RNA-binding protein involved in flowering, binds ABA with high affinity in an interaction that is stereospecific and follows receptor kinetics. The interaction between FCA and ABA has molecular effects on downstream events in the autonomous floral pathway and, consequently, on the ability of the plant to undergo transition to flowering. We further show that ABA binding exerts a direct control on the FCA-mediated processing of precursor messenger RNA. Our results indicate that FCA is an ABA receptor involved in RNA metabolism and in controlling flowering time. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3areceptors 3aRNA-binding proteins 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3aflowering 3abinding capacity 0amessenger RNA-binding proteins 0aabscisic acid-binding proteins1 aEl-Kereamy, A.1 aAbrams, S.R.1 aHill, R.D.0 tNature.g2006 Jan. 19, v. 439, no. 7074 p.290-294x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature043733electronic resource  a20070319b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02702naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002200127245008100149300002100230520155800251650001101809650001101820650001501831650001201846650001601858650002201874650002301896650001601919650002201935650001301957650001601970650002501986700001902011700001602030700001902046700001802065773011702083852000902200930003302209945002502242946001302267655001202280IND4424739020221122113435.0090821e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442473902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYeh, Tian-Chyi J.10aRiver stage tomography: A new approach for characterizing groundwater basins  ap. W05409 (14 p.  aData from tomographic surveys make an inverse problem better posed in comparison to the data from a single excitation source. A tomographic survey provides different coverages and perspectives of subsurface heterogeneity: nonfully redundant information of the subsurface. Fusion of these pieces of information expands and enhances the capability of a conventional survey, provides cross validation of inverse solutions, and constrains inherently ill posed field-scale inverse problems. Basin-scale tomography requires energy sources of great strengths. Spatially and temporally varying natural stimuli are ideal energy sources for this purpose. In this study, we explore the possibility of using river stage variations for basin-scale subsurface tomographic surveys. Specifically, we use numerical models to simulate groundwater level changes in response to temporal and spatial variations of the river stage in a hypothetical groundwater basin. We then exploit the relation between temporal and spatial variations of well hydrographs and river stage to image subsurface heterogeneity of the basin. Results of the numerical exercises are encouraging and provide insights into the proposed river stage tomography. Using naturally recurrent stimuli such as river stage variations for characterizing groundwater basins could be the future of geohydrology. However, it calls for implementation of sensor networks that provide long-term and spatially distributed monitoring of excitation as well as response signals on the land surface and in the subsurface. 3abasins 3arivers 3atomography 3asurveys 3agroundwater 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3awater table 3ahydrologic models 3aaquifers 3astream flow 3astochastic processes1 aXiang, Jianwei1 aXu, Guojin.1 aLee, Cheng-Haw1 aWen, Jet-Chau0 tWater resources research.g2009 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.W05409 (14 p-W05409 (14 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20090921b20091106c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/09/21  aOther US 7aarticle01658naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001400169245005000183300001200233520068200245650002300927650000900950650000900959650002300968653001400991653001201005653002501017700001701042700001701059773007101076852000901147856005901156930003301215945002501248946001101273655001201284IND4384235820221122085758.0061011e20060330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438423582DNAL7 a10.1038/440621a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The ductility and strength of spider draglines means that they outperform the best synthetic fibres, but surprisingly little is known about the torsional properties of this remarkable filament. Unlike a mountain climber swinging from a rope, a spider suspended from its silk thread hardly ever twists. Here we show that a spider dragline has a torsional shape 'memory' in that it can reversibly and totally recover its initial form without any external stimulus; its observed relaxation dynamics indicate that these biological molecules have successively different torsional constants. 3aAraneus diadematus 3asilk 3awebs 3atorsional strength 0adraglines 0atorsion 0atorsional properties1 aLe Floch, A.1 aVollrath, F.0 tNature.g2006 Mar. 30, v. 440, no. 7084 p.621-621x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/440621a3electronic resource  a20070319b20070402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/03/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03230naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245011200166300001500278520173700293650002102030650001202051650004302063650002202106650000902128650001002137650002002147650001502167650001302182650001902195650001702214650001802231650001302249650001402262650005202276650002202328650001202350650002402362700002102386700002002407700002802427700002602455700002702481700002502508773015102533856004302684852000902727655001202736IND60588318420221122085835.0180109e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058831842DNAL7 a10.2460/ajvr.79.1.982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliver, James A.

ANIMALS 63 Shar-Pei and 96 dogs of other breeds. PROCEDURES ADAMTS17 exon resequencing was performed on buccal mucosal DNA from 10 Shar-Pei with a diagnosis of POAG, PLL, or both (affected dogs). A candidate causal variant sequence was identified, and additional dogs (53 Shar-Pei [11 affected and 42 unaffected] and 95 dogs of other breeds) were genotyped for the variant sequence by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Total RNA was extracted from ocular tissues of 1 affected Shar-Pei and 1 ophthalmologically normal Golden Retriever; ADAMTS17 cDNA was reverse transcribed and sequenced, and ADAMTS17 expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR assay. RESULTS All affected Shar-Pei were homozygous for a 6-bp deletion in exon 22 of ADAMTS17 predicted to affect the resultant protein. All unaffected Shar-Pei were heterozygous or homozygous for the wild-type allele. The variant sequence was significantly associated with affected status (diagnosis of POAG, PLL, or both). All dogs of other breeds were homozygous for the wild-type allele. The cDNA sequencing confirmed presence of the expected variant mRNA sequence in ocular tissue from the affected dog only. Gene expression analysis revealed a 4.24-fold decrease in the expression of ADAMTS17 in ocular tissue from the affected dog. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results supported that the phenotype (diagnosis of POAG, PLL, or both) is an autosomal recessive trait in Shar-Pei significantly associated with the identified mutation in ADAMTS17. 3aGolden Retriever 3aalleles 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3acomplementary DNA 3adogs 3aexons 3agene expression 3agenotyping 3aglaucoma 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3aphenotype 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atissues 3aveterinary medicine1 aRustidge, Sophie1 aPettitt, Louise1 aJenkins, Christopher A.1 aFarias, Fabiana H.

To test the contribution of MAK1 to the virulence of N. haematococca MP VI on chickpea, the MAK1 gene was disrupted in a highly virulent Mak+ isolate or added to a weakly virulent Mak- isolate via transformation. The disruption of MAK1 decreased virulence to a moderate level, while addition of multiple copies of MAK1 increased virulence to either a moderate or a high level. These data demonstrate that maackiain detoxification is a determinant, but not the only determinant, of virulence in N. haematococca MP VI isolates capable of causing disease on chickpea. MAK1 is located on a 1.6-Mb conditionally dispensable chromosome. To ascertain if there are additional genes influencing virulence toward chickpea stems on the MAK1 chromosome, the loss of this chromosome was chemically induced in an isolate containing the disrupted MAK1 gene. Loss of the MAK1 chromosome did not reduce virulence toward chickpea stems further, thus indicating that no additional genes for virulence on this part of the host plant are located on the MAK1 chromosome. 3agenetic transformation 3agenetically modified organisms 3astems 3achromosomes 3ametabolic detoxification 3aplasmid vectors 3agenes 3aFusarium eumartii 3atoxicity 3aCicer arietinum 3avirulence 3aphytoalexins 0aNectria haematococca 0agene location1 aBhatt, G.1 aCovert, S.F.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Apr., v. 11, no. 4 p.317-326wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.4.3173Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03098naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008200183300001800265500002400283520137500307650001101682650001301693650001201706650001701718650001101735650002401746650002001770650001101790650001701801650001201818650002001830650001301850650003201863650003201895650002201927650002101949650002701970650001101997650001802008650002502026650002302051650002602074651001802100651001802118700001702136700002102153700002002174700002002194700002102214700001702235700002002252773013002272852000902402856008502411655001202496IND4461314320221122061035.0110812s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446131432DNAL7 a213561462pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800110000482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatz, David L.12aA cost comparison of more and less nutritious food choices in US supermarkets  ap. 1693-1699.  aIncludes references  aObjective: The present study directly compared prices of more and less nutritious foods within given categories in US supermarkets. Design: Foods selected from six supermarkets in Jackson County were categorized using the five criteria of the Nutrition Detectives (ND) programme and an item-to-item cost comparison was made using posted prices. The nutritional quality of foods was distinguished using the clues of the ND nutrition education programme for elementary-school children and validated using the Overall Nutritional Quality Index. Setting: Supermarkets in Jackson County, MO, USA. Subjects: Not applicable. Results: The average price of the item for more nutritious foods did not differ significantly from that of less nutritious foods overall ($US 2·89 (sd $US 0·74) v. $US 2·85 (sd $0·68), P = 0·76). More nutritious breads cost more than less nutritious breads ($US 3·36 (sd $ US 0·28) v. $US 2·56 (sd $US 0·80, P = 0·03), whereas more nutritious cereals ($US 2·46 (sd $US 0·69) v. $US 3·50 (sd $US 0·30), P < 0·01) and cookies ($US 2·76 (sd $US 0·50) v. $US 3·40 (sd $US0·28), P < 0·01) cost less. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that it is possible to choose more nutritious foods within many common categories without spending more money and suggest that making small improvements in dietary choices does not invariably cost more. 3abreads 3achildren 3acookies 3afood choices 3agrains 3anutrition education 3anutritive value 3aprices 3asupermarkets 2aBudgets 2aChoice Behavior 2aCommerce 2aDietxeconomicsxstandards. 2aFoodxeconomicsxstandards. 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFood Preferences 2aFood Supplyxeconomics 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutritional Status 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aDoughty, Kim1 aNjike, Valentine1 aTreu, Judith A.1 aReynolds, Jesse1 aWalker, Jennifer1 aSmith, Erica1 aKatz, Catherine0 tPublic health nutrition.g2011 Sept., v. 14, no. 9 p.1693-1699dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx1475-27277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800110000483Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03330naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164072001700182100002400199245011700223300001800340506007600358520122600434506003701660650002501697650002601722650001901748650001901767650002401786650002301810650001401833650002301847650002501870650002401895650001201919650003901931650004501970650004002015650002502055650001302080650004702093650002002140650002802160650003302188650001402221650004102235650003202276650004502308650002302353653002802376700002402404773011502428852000902543856008102552930003302633945002502666946001302691655001202704IND4379674720221207134500.0060416e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437967472DNAL7 a166070282pmid7 aPMC14358042pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.105.0738332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMukherjee, Krishanu10aMEKHLA, a Novel Domain with Similarity to PAS Domains, Is Fused to Plant Homeodomain-Leucine Zipper III Proteins  ap. 1142-1150.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHomeodomain (HD) proteins play important roles in the development of plants, fungi, and animals. Here we identify a novel domain, MEKHLA, in the C terminus of HD-Leu zipper (HD-ZIP) III plant HD proteins that shares similarity with a group of bacterial proteins and a protein from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The group of bacterial MEKHLA proteins is found in cyanobacteria and other bacteria often found associated with plants. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a MEKHLA protein transferred, possibly from a cyanobacterium or an early chloroplast, into the nuclear genome of an early plant in a first step, and attached itself to the C terminus of an HD-ZIP IV homeobox gene in a second step. Further position-specific iterated-BLAST searches with the bacterial MEKHLA proteins revealed a subregion within the MEKHLA domain that shares significant similarity with the PAS domain. The PAS domain is a sensory module found in many proteins through all kingdoms of life. It is involved in light, oxygen, and redox potential sensation. The fact that HD-ZIP III proteins are transcription factors that have this sensory domain attached to their C terminus uncovers a potential new signaling pathway in plants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahomeodomain proteins 3atranscription factors 3aleucine zipper 3aplant proteins 3aconserved sequences 3abacterial proteins 3aevolution 3aplant biochemistry 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenomics 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aLeucine Zippers 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProtozoan Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 0amolecular sequence data1 aBürglin, Thomas R.0 tPlant physiology.g2006 Apr., v. 140, no. 4 p.1142-1150dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1532-25487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.105.0738333Available from publisher's Web site  a20060620b20060702c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/06/20  aOther US 7aarticle01142naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245016100131300001600292500001500308520014800323650001400471650002000485650002000505650002100525650003300546653001300579653001600592700002400608700001300632773009800645852000900743939003300752945000800785946001100793655001200804991612503310742620221122010217.0830419e198110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830041282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, P.J.10aNippostrongylus brasiliensis infection in the rat. 2.

C. 10aQuickBird satellite versus ground-based multi-spectral data for estimating nitrogen status of irrigated maize  ap. 274-290.  aIn-season nitrogen (N) management of irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) requires frequent acquisition of plant N status estimates to timely assess the onset of crop N deficiency and its spatial variability within a field. This study compared ground-based Exotech nadir-view sensor data and QuickBird satellite multi-spectral data to evaluate several green waveband vegetation indices to assess the N status of irrigated maize. It also sought to determine if QuickBird multi-spectral imagery could be used to develop plant N status maps as accurately as those produced by ground-based sensor systems. The green normalized difference vegetation index normalized to a reference area (NGNDVI) clustered the data for three clear-day data acquisitions between QuickBird and Exotech data producing slopes and intercepts statistically not different from 1 and 0, respectively, for the individual days as well as for the combined data. Comparisons of NGNDVI and the N Sufficiency Index produced good correlation coefficients that ranged from 0.91 to 0.95 for the V12 and V15 maize growth stages and their combined data. Nitrogen sufficiency maps based on the NGNDVI to indicate N sufficient (≥0.96) or N deficient (<0.96) maize were similar for the two sensor systems. A quantitative assessment of these N sufficiency maps for the V10-V15 crop growth stages ranged from 79 to 83% similarity based on areal agreement and moderate to substantial agreement based on the kappa statistics. Results from our study indicate that QuickBird satellite multi-spectral data can be used to assess irrigated maize N status at the V12 and later growth stages and its variability within a field for in-season N management. The NGNDVI compensated for large off-nadir and changing target azimuth view angles associated with frequent QuickBird acquisitions. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acorrelation 3adevelopmental stages 3airrigation 3amultispectral imagery 3anitrogen 3anormalized difference vegetation index 0aPlant N status 0aVegetation indices 0aGround-based 0aSatellite1 aKhosla, R. 0 tPrecision agriculture.g2010 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.274-290dBoston : Springer USx1385-22567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-009-9133-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02674naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072001700143072001700160072001700177100001900194245008200213520129200295650001001587650001201597650001201609650001101621650003601632650003001668650002201698650002601720650001301746650001801759650001201777650001301789650001501802651001101817653002101828653001801849700002601867700002001893700001901913700001801932773005501950852000902005856008302014930003302097945002502130946001302155655001202168IND4424485820221121235339.0090814s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442448582DNAL7 a10.2509/naf2008.003.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKayes, Lori J.10aChemical variation of Usnea longissima Ach. in the central Oregon Coast Range  aThe lichenized ascomyceteUsnea longissima occurs in cool forests with coastal climates in Europe, Asia and North America and is threatened throughout its range. The Pacific Northwest region of North America is considered a stronghold of this species. While many studies have focused on the ecology of U. longissima, knowledge of the secondary chemistry of U. longissima is sparse for the region. The objectives of this study were to analyze collections of U. longissima for chemotypic variation using thin-layer chromatography and to examine ecological and geographic patterns of chemotype variation within the central Oregon Coast Range. Three major chemotypes were found within the study area with some additional chemotypic variation documented throughout the global range of U. longissima. The most common chemotype (chemotype 1: usnic, barbatic and norbarbatic acids) accounted for 70.9% of samples, with the other 2 chemotypes accounting for 24% (chemotype 2: usnic and diffractaic acids) and 4.2% (chemotype 3: usnic and a minor unknown acid) of samples. Chemotype 2 generally occurred farther west and at higher elevations than chemotype 1. Different chemotypes may deserve protection to ensure the persistence and genetic variation of U. longissima throughout its current range. 3aUsnea 3alichens 3aforests 3acoasts 3achemical constituents of plants 3athin layer chromatography 3agenetic variation 3asecondary metabolites 3aaltitude 3aforest stands 3astreams 3ahabitats 3ausnic acid 3aOregon 0aUsnea longissima 0abarbatic acid1 aVan Wormer, Katherine1 aKofranek, David1 aSale, Kathleen1 aMcCune, Bruce0 tNorth American fungi.g2008, v. 3x1937-786X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2509/naf2008.003.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090902b00000000c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/09/02  aOther US 7aarticle03484naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072001700148072001700165100001600182245015800198300001800356520197000374650001802344650001302362650001902375650002302394650001002417650001402427650002502441650000902466650001102475650002402486650002402510650003202534650001602566651001002582653001302592653002302605653002302628653001302651700001902664700001602683700001402699773010302713852000902816856007202825930003302897945002502930946001102955655001202966IND4383477620221121224715.0060911e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438347762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2006.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aOtranto, D.10aPhortica variegata as an intermediate host of Thelazia callipaeda under natural conditions: Evidence for pathogen transmission by a male arthropod vector  ap. 1167-1173.  aKnowledge about Phortica variegata (Drosophilidae, Steganinae), the intermediate host of the eyeworm Thelazia callipaeda (Spirurida, Thelaziidae), is confined to experimental studies. To investigate the role P. variegata plays in the transmission of T. callipaeda under natural conditions, the population dynamics of these flies in the natural environment and their feeding preferences (on vegetables and/or animal lachrymal secretions) were examined. From April to November 2005, a total number of 969 (557 males and 412 females) P. variegata flies were collected weekly in a region of southern Italy with a history of canine thelaziosis. The flies were identified and dissected or subjected to a PCR assay specific for a region within the ribosomal ITS-1 DNA of T. callipaeda. The zoophilic preferences of P. variegata were assessed by collecting flies around the eyes of a person or around a fruit bait. Seven hundred and twenty flies (398 males and 322 females) were dissected under a stereomicroscope; 249 flies (158 males and 91 females) that died prior to the dissection were subjected to molecular investigation. Only P. variegata males were infected with larval T. callipaeda both at dissection (six, 0.83%) and with the specific PCR (seven, 2.81%), representing a total percentage of 1.34% flies infected. Interestingly, only males were collected around the eyes, compared with a male/female ratio of 1:4 around the fruit. This survey indicated that P. variegata males act as intermediate hosts of T. callipaeda under natural conditions in Europe. Both the zoophilic behaviour of P. variegata males on lachrymal secretions and their role as vector of T. callipaeda have been discussed as they represent a peculiarity in medical and veterinary entomology. The synchrony between the fly population dynamics and the biology of the nematode in the definitive host provides an interesting model for exploring the co-evolution of Thelazia spp. with their hosts. 3aDrosophilidae 3aThelazia 3ainsect vectors 3aintermediate hosts 3amales 3ainfection 3adisease transmission 3adogs 3ahumans 3apopulation dynamics 3afeeding preferences 3ahost-parasite relationships 3acoevolution 3aItaly 0aeyeworms 0acanine thelaziosis 0aseasonal abundance 0azoophily1 aCantacessi, C.1 aTestini, G.1 aLia, R.P.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2006 Sept., v. 36, no. 10-11 p.1167-1173x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2006.06.0063electronic resource  a20060918b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02507naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001500154245008100169300001800250500001500268520143400283650001601717650001001733650002201743650002101765650001301786650001201799653001401811700001201825700001801837700001701855700001901872773010601891852000901997856007702006945002502083946001302108655001202121IND4362090920221121224629.0040414e20031231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436209092DNAL7 a10.1021/jf03032152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDuenas, M.10aProanthocyanidin composition in the seed coat of lentils (Lens culinaris L.)  ap. 7999-8004.  a2019-12-04  aLentils (Lens culinaris L.) are a popular food in many countries. However, little is known about their phenolic composition. Because polyphenols in lentils are located essentially in their seed coat, the objective of this work was to study the composition of proanthocyanidins, the major group of polyphenols, in this part of the tissue. The use of C18 Sep-Pak cartridges permitted the fractionation of lentil seed coat extract into monomer, oligomer, and polymer proanthocyanidin fractions. Subsequent thiolysis of oligomer and polymer fractions followed by HPLC analysis allowed the mean degree of polymerization (mDP) and the structural composition of proanthocyanidins to be determined. A fractionation of lentil seed coat extracts on a polyamide column followed by HPLC and HPLC-DAD-MS analyses was used to identify the individual proanthocyanidins. The results showed that the major monomeric flavan-3-ol was (+) catechin-3-glucose, with lesser amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. In the oligomer fraction, various dimer, trimer, and tetramer proanthocyanidins constituted of catechin, gallocatechin, and catechin gallate units were identified, and several procyanidins and prodelphinidins from pentamers to nonamers constitute the polymer fraction. The most abundant proanthocyanidins in the seed coat of lentils are the polymers (65-75%), with a mDP of 7-9, followed by the oligomers (20-30%), with a mDP of 4-5. 3aepicatechin 3atesta 3aproanthocyanidins 3afood composition 3acatechin 3alentils 0aflavanols1 aSun, B.1 aHernandez, T.1 aEstrella, I.1 aSpranger, M.I.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Dec. 31, v. 51, no. 27 p.7999-8004x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf03032153Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRHFe2004/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle02632naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007500166300001600241520129800257650001801555650001501573650002401588650000901612650002301621650001101644650001101655650001501666650001501681650001101696651002501707653001601732653003501748653001901783653002101802653002101823700002201844700002901866700002201895773011901917852000902036856008502045930003302130946001102163655001202174IND4433912220221121224636.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443391222DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-009-9462-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavy, Robert J. 10aStatistical Downscaling of Wind Variability from Meteorological Fields  ap. 161-175.  aMeasurements show that on numerous occasions the low-level wind is highly variable across a large portion of south-eastern Australia. Under such conditions the risk of a large rapid change in total wind power is increased. While variability tends to increase with mean wind speed, a large component of wind variability is not explained by wind speed alone. In this work, reanalysis fields from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are statistically downscaled to model wind variability at a coastal location in Victoria, Australia. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, the NCEP fields are each decomposed using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) techniques. The downscaling technique is applied to two periods in the seasonal cycle, namely (i) winter to early spring, and (ii) summer. In each case, data representing 2 years are used to form a model that is then validated using independent data from another year. The EOFs that best predict wind variability are examined. To allow for non-linearity and complex interaction between variables, all empirical models are built using random forests. Quantitatively, the model compares favourably with a simple regression of wind variability against wind speed, as well as multiple linear regression models. 3alinear models 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awind power 3awind speed 3awinter 3aVictoria (Australia) 0aDownscaling 0aEmpirical orthogonal functions 0aRandom forests 0aWind forecasting 0aWind variability1 aWoods, Milton J. 1 aRussell, Christopher J. 1 aCoppin, Peter A. 0 tBoundary-layer meteorology.g2010 Apr., v. 135, no. 1 p.161-175dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0006-83147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-009-9462-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01398naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245011900151300001600270520023500286650001200521650001700533650001200550650002700562650002800589650002200617650004000639650002500679650000900704650003000713650000900743650002500752700001800777700001700795700001700812773009800829852000900927939003300936945000800969946001100977655001200988991612500980742620221121224752.0830415e198208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830041002DNAL7 a71435312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcElnay, J.C.10aIn vitro experiments on chloroquine and pyrimethamine absorption in the presence of antacid constituents or kaolin  ap. 153-158.  achloroquine, pyrimethamine, in vitro study indicates decreased antimalarial bioavailability in the presence of antacid constituents and kaolin, suggests that concomitant administration of these agents should be avoided if possible 3amalaria 3apharmacology 2aAnimals 2aAntacidsxpharmacology 2aChloroquinexmetabolism 2aDrug Interactions 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aKaolinxpharmacology 2aMale 2aPyrimethaminexmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains1 aMukhtar, H.A.1 aD'Arcy, P.F.1 aTemple, D.J.0 tJournal of tropical medicine and hygiene.g1982 Aug., v. 85, no. 4 p.153-158x0022-53047nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830415c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01371naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245009200151300001600243520015200259650001200411650001700423650001000440650002800450650002800478650001100506650004000517650002500557650002800582650002400610650000900634650003100643650003400674700001800708700001700726700001700743700001800760773009800778852000900876939003300885945000800918946001100926655001200937991612499910742620221121202353.0830415e198208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830041012DNAL7 a62924432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcElnay, J.C.14aThe effect of magnesium trisilicate and kaolin on the in vivo absorption of chloroquine  ap. 159-163.  achloroquine taken by male volunteers, magnesium trisilicate and kaolin decrease oral availability of antimalarial, study confirms in vitro findings 3amalaria 3apharmacology 2aAdult 2aBiological Availability 2aChloroquinexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aKaolinxpharmacology 2aMagnesiumxpharmacology 2aMagnesium Silicates 2aMale 2aSilicic Acidxpharmacology 2aSilicon Dioxidexpharmacology1 aMukhtar, H.A.1 aD'Arcy, P.F.1 aTemple, D.J.1 aCollier, P.S.0 tJournal of tropical medicine and hygiene.g1982 Aug., v. 85, no. 4 p.159-163x0022-53047nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830415c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03342naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001400215245013000229300001600359500001500375520143100390650001401821650003001835650002001865650002401885650002401909650001001933650002001943650002301963650001401986650000702000650002002007650001102027650001202038650002902050650003802079650002602117650003102143650004202174650002202216650003602238650002402274650002302298653001202321653003002333653002002363700001402383773014902397852000902546856006902555930003302624945002502657946001102682990002302693655001202716IND4383519120221121125736.0060912e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438351912DNAL7 a167216232pmid7 a10.1007/s00360-006-0090-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aStief, P.14aThe gut microenvironment of sediment-dwelling Chironomus plumosus larvae as characterised with O2, pH, and redox microsensors  ap. 673-683.  a2019-12-04  aWe devised a set-up in which microsensors can be used for characterising the gut microenvironment of aquatic macrofauna. In a small flow cell, we measured microscale gradients through dissected guts (O2, pH, redox potential [E h ]), in the haemolymph (O2), and towards the body surface (O2) of Chironomus plumosus larvae. The gut microenvironment was compared with the chemical conditions in the lake sediment in which the animals reside and feed. When the dissected guts were incubated at the same nominal O2 concentration as in haemolymph, the gut content was completely anoxic and had pH and E h values slightly lower than in the ambient sediment. When the dissected guts were artificially oxygenated, the volumetric O2-consumption rates of the gut content were at least 10x higher than in the sediment. Using these potential O2-consumption rates in a cylindrical diffusion-reaction model, it was predicted that diffusion of O2 from the haemolymph to the gut could not oxygenate the gut content under in vivo conditions. Additionally, the potential O2-consumption rates were so high that the intake of dissolved O2 along with feeding could be ruled out to oxygenate the gut content. We conclude that microorganisms present in the gut of C. plumosus cannot exhibit an aerobic metabolism. The presented microsensor technique and the data analysis are applicable to guts of other macrofauna species with cutaneous respiration. 3asediments 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aredox potential 3amathematical models 3aChironomus plumosus 3alakes 3aaquatic habitat 3aoxygen consumption 3ahemolymph 3apH 3adigestive tract 3alarvae 2aAnimals 2aChironomidaexphysiology 2aElectrochemistryxinstrumentation 2aHemolymphxphysiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIntestinesxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aMicrochemistryxinstrumentation 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygen Consumption 0asensors 0adiffusion-reaction models 0agut oxygenation1 aEller, G.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.

The fluid is assumed to have a constant (eddy) viscosity, and the Coriolis force is neglected. A numerical simulation has been used to verify the model, which is shown to revert to the classical Prandtl model if the strip width goes to infinity. The effects of the strip width and slope angle on the katabatic flow are studied. The buoyancy and downslope velocity reach maximum values at the centre of the strip, and spread outwards in the cross-slope direction. The downslope wind maximum weakens for narrow strips and shallow slopes. In contrast to the Prandtl solution, which shows a counter flow above the wind maximum, our model predicts the counter flow to occur outside the strip. The cross-slope variation in the surface forcing induces cross-slope and slope-normal velocities, which are manifested in vortices at the strip edges. Below the wind maximum, the fluid above the cooling surface descends and moves toward the strip edge where it is detrained from the strip region. Replenishment of fluid into the strip region takes place above the wind maximum. 0aKatabatic flow 0aInhomogeneous surface forcing 0aAnalytical solution1 aShapiro, Alan 1 aFedorovich, E.

At microscale, however, additional positive feedbacks between hydrology and vegetation such as increase of infiltration due to increase of vegetation, have been reported and have a large impact on vegetation distribution and spatial pattern formation. If both macroscale and microscale positive feedbacks are present in the same region, it is reasonable to assume that these feedback mechanisms are connected. In this study, we develop and analyse a soil-vegetation-atmosphere model coupling large-scale evapotranspiration-precipitation feedback with a model of microscale vegetation-hydrology feedback to study the integration of these nonlinearities at disparate scales. From our results, two important conclusions can be drawn: (1) it is important to account for spatially explicit vegetation dynamics at the microscale in climate models (the strength of the precipitation feedback increased up to 35% by accounting for these microscale dynamics); (2) studies on resilience of ecosystems to climate change should always be cast within a framework of possible large-scale atmospheric feedback mechanism (substantial changes in vegetation resilience resulted from incorporating macroscale precipitation feedback). Analysis of full-coupled modelling shows that both type of feedbacks markedly influence each other and that they should both be accounted for in climate change models. 3aspatial distribution 3aSahel 3aclimate change 3ahydrology 3aclimate models 3aecosystems 3aenergy transfer 3avegetation 0aalternative stable states 0asemiarid zones 0asemiarid regions 0avegetation dynamics1 aRietkerk, Max.1 aBIERKENS, MARC F.P.0 tGlobal change biology.g2007 Mar., v. 13, no. 3 p.671-678dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01327.x3electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03284naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001800215245007400233300001600307500001500323520142400338650001601762650001201778650001901790650002201809650001601831650001701847650002301864650001101887650003001898650001201928650003301940650004201973650002902015650003502044650004602079650000902125650003402134650003002168650004302198653003302241653002002274653004702294653002902341653002202370700001802392700002002410773009302430852000902523856006902532930003302601945002502634946001102659655001202670IND4383519520141222000000.0060912e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438351952DNAL7 a166761882pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-006-0129-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effects of high temperature on a locust visual interneuron (the descending contralateral movement detector, DCMD) have previously been shown to be mitigated by prior exposure to sub-lethal, elevated temperatures (heat shock, HS). Activity in the DCMD is reduced at high temperature in naïve animals (control), whereas HS animals show a maintained spike count at all temperatures. We examined whether this finding was due to direct effects of temperature on visual processing, or whether other indirect feedback mechanisms were responsible for the observed effect in the DCMD. Activity in the DCMD was elicited using a computer-generated looming image, and the response was recorded extracellularly. The temperature of visual processing circuits contributes directly to HS-induced plasticity in the DCMD, as maintaining the brain at 25°C during a thoracic temperature ramp eliminated the high frequency activity associated with HS. Removing ascending input by severing the thoracic nerve cord reduced DCMD thermosensitivity, indicating that indirect feedback mechanisms are also involved in controlling the DCMD response to increased thoracic temperature. Understanding how thermosensitive feedback within the locust affects DCMD function provides insight into critical regulatory mechanisms underlying visually-guided behaviors. 3atemperature 3alocusts 3aheat tolerance 3aaction potentials 3aheat stress 3ainterneurons 3aLocusta migratoria 3avision 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperaturexphysiology 2aEvoked Potentials, Visualxphysiology 2aInterneuronsxphysiology 2aIon Channel Gatingxphysiology 2aLocusta migratoriaxcytologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMotion Perceptionxphysiology 2aThermosensingxphysiology 2aVisual Pathwaysxcytologyxphysiology. 0athermosensitive interneurons 0aneurophysiology 0adescending contralateral movement detector 0aneural thermosensitivity 0aelectrophysiology1 aDeCarlo, C.A.1 aRobertson, R.M.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2006 Sept., v. 192, no. 9 p.915-925x0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-006-0129-23electronic resource  a20060915b20061003c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/09/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02660naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001100112245017900123300001600302520123600318650001801554650001001572650002301582650002001605650001901625650002801644650005001672650003101722650002101753650001001774650001601784650002401800650001201824650001201836700001201848700001601860700001401876700001301890700001301903700001601916700001301932773021101945856004902156852000902205655001202214IND60646472920190628000000.0190612e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064647292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, T.12aA comparative study of the efficacy of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome subunit and a modified-live virus vaccine against respiratory diseases in endemic farms  ap. 110-121.  aThe efficacy of a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) subunit vaccine was evaluated and compared with a modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine under field conditions. Three farms were selected based on their history of respiratory diseases caused by co-infection with both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2. In each farm, 60 pigs were randomly allocated to 2 vaccinated and 1 unvaccinated groups (20 pigs per group). One group of pigs were administered the PRRS subunit vaccine at 21 and 42 days of age and another group administered the PRRS MLV vaccine at 21 days of age. The subunit vaccine had similar efficacy and, in some instances, performed even better than the MLV vaccine. Vaccination of pigs with either of the PRRS vaccines resulted in significantly improved growth performance in Farm B but not in Farm C. In Farm A, pigs vaccinated with the PRRS subunit vaccine had a better growth performance statistically compared to those vaccinated with the PRRS MLV vaccine. At the peak of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 viremia, neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses against PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 were at low levels suggesting that either vaccine is only able to provide a partial protection against co-circulating PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2. 3aT-lymphocytes 3afarms 3agrowth performance 3amixed infection 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asubunit vaccines 3aswine 3avaccination 3aveterinary medicine 3aviremia 3aviruses1 aKim, H.1 aPark, K.

NGR234  ap. 592-600.  aSoil bacteria of the genera Azorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Rhizobium liberate morphogenetic lipochitin-oligosaccharides (Nod factors) into legume rhizospheres. Nod factors, which are synthesized by the products of rhizobial nodulation (nod) genes, vary in core length as well as in the number and type of substitutions. In Rhizobium sp. NGR234, the N-acylated pentamers of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine carry an O-methylfucose group on the reducing terminus that is substituted, on a mutually exclusive basis, with either an acetyl or a sulfuryl group. A sulfotransferase encoded by noeE is required for adjunction of activated sulfate donated by 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). Here we show that when expressed in NGR234 cured of its symbiotic plasmid (= ANU265) or when purified as a fusion protein (MBP-NoeE), NoeE transfers sulfate from PAPS to fucosylated lipochitin-oligosaccharides. Enzyme assays showed that sulfotransferase activity is dependent on the presence of an acyl group (stearic and vaccenic acids were tested) since no activity was detected when fucosylated oligochitins (oligomers of two to six N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units) were used as substrates. Thus, NoeE is unique in that it is the only characterized sulfotransferase that is specific for fucosylated Nod factors. It probably acts after NodA, which acylates the amino-sugar backbone. 3aRhizobium 3atransferases 3abacterial proteins 3anodulation 3aoligosaccharides 3agenes 3achemical structure 3asulfates 3agene expression 3aplasmids 3aenzyme activity 3achitin 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aChitinxbiosynthesis 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia coli 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotides 2aOligosaccharidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxmetabolism. 2aRhizobiumxenzymology 2aSulfotransferasesxmetabolism 0asubstrates1 aHanin, M.1 aBroughton, W.J.1 aJabbouri, S.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.592-600wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.7.5923Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03878naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010900169300001600278520247400294650001802768650003002786650002002816650002702836650002602863650002802889650001802917650001302935650001202948650001502960650001302975650002402988650002803012650002603040650001903066650001603085650001703101650001503118650002003133700001803153700001803171773017103189856005103360852000903411655001203420IND60646474120221121065449.0190612e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064647412DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-2442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Min-Jeong10aEnzymatic Inactivation of Pathogenic and Nonpathogenic Bacteria in Biofilms in Combination with Chlorine  ap. 605-614.  aThis study investigated the effects of enzyme application on biofilms of bacterial isolates from a cafeteria kitchen and foodborne pathogens and the susceptibility of Salmonella biofilms to proteinase K combined with chlorine treatment. For four isolates from a cafeteria kitchen (Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Kocuria) and six strains of foodborne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus), the inhibitory effect of enzymes on biofilm formation at 25°C for 24 h or the degradative efficacy of enzymes on 24-h mature biofilm at 37°C for 1 h in tryptic soy broth (TSB) was examined in a polystyrene microtiter plate. The effect of enzymes was also evaluated on a subset of these strains in 20 times diluted TSB (1/20 TSB) at 25°C. The working concentrations of five enzymes were 1 U/100 μL for α-amylase, amyloglucosidase, cellulase, and DNase and 1 milli-Anson unit/100 μL for proteinase K. In addition, 24-h mature Salmonella Typhimurium biofilm on a stainless steel coupon was treated with proteinase K for 1 h at 25°C followed by 20 ppm of chlorine for 1 min at 25°C. The results showed that certain enzymes inhibited biofilm formation by the kitchen-originated bacteria; however, the enzymatic effect was diminished on the mature biofilms. Biofilm formation of V. parahaemolyticus was suppressed by all tested enzymes, whereas the mature biofilm was degraded by α-amylase, DNase I, and proteinase K. Proteinase K was effective in controlling Salmonella biofilms, whereas a strain-dependent variation was observed in S. aureus biofilms. In 1/20 TSB, Enterobacter cancerogenus and Kocuria varians were more susceptible to certain enzymes during biofilm formation than those in TSB, whereas the enzymatic effect was much decreased on 24-h mature biofilms, regardless of nutrient conditions. Furthermore, synergistic inactivation of Salmonella Typhimurium in biofilms was observed in the combined treatment of proteinase K followed by chlorine. Live/Dead assays also revealed a decrease in density and loss of membrane integrity in Salmonella Typhimurium biofilms exposed to the combined treatment. Therefore, certain enzymes can control biofilms of isolates residing in a cafeteria kitchen and foodborne pathogens. This study demonstrates the potential of enzymes for the sanitation of food processing environments and of proteinase K combined with chlorine to control Salmonella biofilms on food contact surfaces. 3aAcinetobacter 3aEnterobacter cancerogenus 3aKocuria varians 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aalpha-amylase 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acafeterias 3achlorine 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afood contact surfaces 3afood pathogens 3apeptidase K 3apolystyrenes 3asanitation 3astainless steel1 aLim, Eun Seob1 aKim, Joo-Sung0 tJournal of food protection.g2019 Apr., v. 82, no. 4 p.605-614dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-18-244  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001500164245018600179300001600365520119000381650003601571650001001607650001901617650002301636650001801659650002301677650002801700650001301728650002001741650001701761650001301778650001701791650004101808650002901849650002601878650003901904650004001943650001301983650002701996653001302023653001702036653002802053700002902081700001602110700001802126700001502144700001902159700001602178773009402194852000902288856008602297930003302383945001302416946001302429655001202442IND2138040020221121061215.0980807e199807  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213804002DNAL7 a96502952pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.7.6182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLauber, E.10aCell-to-cell movement of beet necrotic yellow vein virus.

Heterologous complementation experiments provide evidence for specific interactions among the triple gene block proteins  ap. 618-625.  aCell-to-cell movement of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) requires three proteins encoded by a triple gene block (TGB) on viral RNA 2. A BNYVV RNA 3-derived replicon was used to express movement proteins of other viruses and the ability of these proteins to functionally substitute for the BNYVV TGB proteins was tested by coinoculation of TGB-defective BNYVV with the various replicons to Chenopodium quinoa. Trans-heterocomplementation was successful with the movement protein (P30) of tobacco mosaic virus but not with the tubule-forming movement proteins of alfalfa mosaic virus and grapevine fanleaf virus. Trans-complementation of BNYVV movement was also observed when all three TGB proteins of the distantly related peanut clump virus were supplied together but not when they were substituted for their BNYVV counterparts one by one. When P30 was used to drive BNYVV movement in trans, accumulation of the first TGB protein of BNYVV was adversely affected by null mutations in the second and third TGB proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that highly specific interactions among cognate TGB proteins are important for their function and/or stability in planta. 3aBeet necrotic yellow vein virus 3agenes 3aviral proteins 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aplant viruses 3achromosome mapping 3agenetic complementation 3amutation 3amixed infection 2aGenes, Viral 2aMovement 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlant Virusesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlants, Ediblexvirology 2aProtoplastsxvirology 2aRNA Virusesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRNA, Viralxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aReplicon 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amovement 0ainteractions 0aexperimental infections1 aBleykasten-Grosshans, C.1 aErhardt, M.1 aBouzoubaa, S.1 aJonard, G.1 aRichards, K.E.1 aGuilley, H.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.618-625x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.7.6183Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03684naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001500164245016100179300001600340500001500356520122800371650001301599650001801612650001001630650002401640650002101664650002501685650001101710650002801721650001201749650002501761650002501786650002201811650001701833650000801850650001401858650001501872650002401887650001801911650002501929650002301954650002401977650003402001650002302035650004502058650002302103650002902126650002802155650002402183650001402207650002202221650004102243650004702284650004202331650002302373650003402396650004502430650001402475653002102489653001702510653002802527653002302555653002502578700001902603700002002622773009402642852000902736856008602745930003302831945001302864946001302877655001202890IND2138039420221121061211.0980807e199807  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND213803942DNAL7 a96502942pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.7.6012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJian, J.H.12aA virulence-associated, 6.4-kb, double-stranded RNA from Rhizoctonia solani is phylogenetically related to plant bromoviruses and electron transport enzymes  ap. 601-609.  a2019-12-04  aWe have recently shown that acquisition of a 6.4-kb, double-stranded (ds) RNA (M1) by hyphal anastomosis is associated with enhanced vigor and virulence, whereas its removal by hyphal tipping correlates with diminished virulence in the plant-pathogenic basidiomycete Rhizoctonia solani. The M1 dsRNA is not encapsidated by a typical nucleocapsid, has a circular and/or concatemeric form, and is associated with the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions. M1 possesses six open reading frames (ORFs) the longest of which (ORF 2) is located on the (+) strand, and encodes a putative polypeptide consisting of 1,747 amino acids or 199.4 kDa. This polypeptide has a significant amino acid sequence similarity, including six conserved helicase domains and an ATP/GTP binding motif, with the 1A protein of broad bean mottle virus (BBMV) and other bromoviruses. ORF 5, which is located on the (-) strand of M1 and is complementary to a region of ORF 2, codes for a putative polypeptide that has a significant amino acid sequence similarity with the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor. This complementarity provides direct evidence suggesting that the long-standing hypothesis of viruses evolving from cellular genes may be valid. 3aproteins 3afractionation 3avigor 3aopen reading frames 3amolecular weight 3aspatial distribution 3ahyphae 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3acytosol 3aamino acid sequences 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aelectron transfer 3amitochondria 3aRNA 3avirulence 3aBromovirus 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBromovirusxgenetics 2aConserved Sequence 2aCytosolxmetabolism 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistry 2aElectron Transport 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxchemistry 2aFabaceaexvirology 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhylogeny 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aRNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRhizoctoniaxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aViral Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aVirulence 0agenbank/af020042 0ainteractions 0amolecular sequence data 0achemical structure 0anucleotide sequences1 aLakshman, D.K.1 aTavantzis, S.M.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.601-609x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.7.6013Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03998naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171072001700188100001400205245016700219300001600386520178100402650002602183650001002209650000902219650001302228650000902241650001502250650001802265650001302283650003502296650001502331650002202346650002202368650001202390650002202402650002102424650003102445650001602476650004702492650001202539650003302551650004602584650002102630650001102651650001302662650001102675650004902686650000902735650002102744700002502765700001602790700002102806700001302827700001502840700001702855700001602872773022302888852000903111856007603120930003303196945002503229946001103254990002303265655001203288IND4383612520221121061201.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438361252DNAL7 a169706262pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0442.2006.00853.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJenet, A.10aEvidence for Different Nutrient Partitioning in Boran (Bos indicus) and Boran x Holstein Cows When Re-allocated from Low to High or from High to Low Feeding Level  ap. 383-393.  aThis study tested the hypothesis that purebred Boran (Bos indicus) cows and crossbreds of Boran and Holstein respond differently to long-term changes of feeding level in nutrient partitioning to milk and body fat stores. A total of 27 cows of these two genotypes were subjected either to a low or a high feeding level from their first oestrus as heifers until birth of their third calf. Half of the cows of each genotype were then switched to the other feeding level during the third reproduction cycle. If at all, Boran cows responded to a change in the feeding level almost exclusively by a corresponding change in body weight but not milk yield. Crossbred cows kept continuously on the low feeding level had a lower milk yield than those continuously fed the high level, but lost similar amounts of body weight. In crossbred cows, changing the feeding level from high to low was accompanied by a mobilization of body reserves, whereas a change from low to high level resulted mostly in an increase in milk yield. Certain other genotype differences in metabolic response were obvious from differences in body composition and from the metabolic profile either reflected in blood (particularly insulin-like growth factor I) or in adipose tissue (lipoprotein lipase). Reproductive performance differed between genotypes, with shorter lactations associated with earlier occurrences of the first oestrus in the Boran cows. Generally, feeding history appeared to have at least as much influence on energy partitioning as the actual feeding level. In conclusion, purebred Boran cows seem to react to long-term food fluctuations mainly by mobilizing and restoring body fat reserves, whereas cows crossbred with Holstein tend to spend extra energy preferentially for milk production. 3anutrient partitioning 3aBoran 3azebu 3aHolstein 3acows 3acrossbreds 3afeeding level 3abody fat 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3amilk yield 3ametabolic studies 3abreed differences 3aheifers 3afeeding frequency 3aanimal nutrition 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aCattlexgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aLactationxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMale 2aMilkxsecretion.1 aFernandez-Rivera, S.1 aTegegne, A.1 aWettstein, H.-R.1 aSenn, M.1 aSaurer, M.1 aLanghans, W.1 aKreuzer, M.0 tZentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

In this work, we present a model based on artificial neural networks (ANN), which can be used to support the measuring of plant signals and help to improve the reliability of the data collected. This is important to support control strategies that can link the plants to the actuators. This project was carried out in the framework of the German ZINEG Project, which aims to reduce the energy input needed in the German greenhouse industry. The ZINEG facility, located at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, comprises two similar greenhouses, one operated as closed greenhouse and the other as a standard reference greenhouse, both with a tomato crop grown on rockwool in a closed hydroponic system. Transpiration and Photosynthesis rates, as well as leaf temperature, were measured every five minutes using a phytomonitoring system (BERMONIS) developed at the university. To support the measurements for a reliable control operation, a model was developed using ANN with climatic and theoretical inputs. The model was trained using data from four production years (2010 to 2013) in both aforementioned greenhouses. The trained model is capable of giving a correct output even when the phytomonitoring system fails or is taken away for calibration. The prediction of the model can then be used by two control strategies developed so far: The threshold for opening and closing the thermal screen was triggered by the photosynthesis, and the irrigation was controlled by the transpiration. The results show that the combination of models and measurements can help to introduce and spread plant-related environmental control strategies for greenhouses. 3aactuators 3aautomation 3adata collection 3aecological footprint 3aenergy 3agreenhouses 3ahydroponics 3aindustry 3airrigation 3aleaves 3aneural networks 3aphotosynthesis 3aprediction 3arockwool 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3atranspiration 3avegetable growing1 aLara, B.1 aRocksch, T.1 aDannehl, D.1 aSchmidt, U.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 July 31, , no. 1170 p.193-200dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1170.22  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001600154245021000170300001800380500001500398520108300413650002001496650002301516650001801539650002301557650002301580650001701603650002701620650003101647650001001678650001401688653002301702700001601725700001301741700001401754700001501768773010601783852000901889856007701898945002501975946001302000655001202013IND4362083420221121061329.0040414e20031231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436208342DNAL7 a10.1021/jf03456042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A new approach of the aroma extract dilution analysis applied to the characterization of wine aroma  ap. 7861-7865.  a2019-12-04  aThe relationship between the composition and the aroma of the wine can be established by using gas chromatography with olfactometric detection (sniffing or GCO), which combines the chromatographic response with the human nose response. To evaluate the contribution of the odor compounds in wine aroma, we designed a new approach of the aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) that lies in the GCO analysis of serially diluted wine samples using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) as the extraction technique. The fiber coating used was Flex divinyl-carboxen-polydimethylsiloxane. The method developed was applied to determine the aromatic composition of a red Grenache wine from Priorat (Spain). The method allows 38 important odorants to be determined in the AEDA study, 30 of them precisely identified. These results are similar to those reported by other studies related to this variety of wine. HS-SPME is a suitable technique to obtain representative extracts of wine aroma with several advantages such as simplicity, speediness, and little sample manipulation. 3amicroextraction 3asensory evaluation 3afood analysis 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aolfactometry 3asolid phase extraction 3avolatile organic compounds 3aodors 3ared wines 0avolatile compounds1 aMestres, M.1 aSala, C.1 aBusto, O.1 aGuasch, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Dec. 31, v. 51, no. 27 p.7861-7865x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf03456043Available from publisher's Web site  aINDdRHFe2004/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle03356naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001700164245016100181300001600342500001500358520120500373650001901578650002701597650001801624650002501642650001701667650001601684650002201700650001401722650001401736650002301750650001101773650001501784650002001799650002001819650001301839650001401852650004301866650003601909650005901945650001402004650003902018650005202057650004802109650001902157650004002176653002702216653002002243653001802263653001702281653001902298700001602317700001802333700001702351700001802368700001802386773011202404852000902516856008602525930003302611945001302644946001302657655001202670IND2123983320221121050947.0980714e199803  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212398332DNAL7 a94876972pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.3.2282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelton, R.E.10aHeterologous expression of Septoria lycopersici tomatinase in Cladosporium fulvum: effects on compatible and incompatible interactions with tomato seedlings  ap. 228-236.  a2019-12-04  aThe anti-fungal, steroidal, glycoalkaloid saponin, alpha-tomatine, is present in uninfected tomato plants in substantial concentrations, and may contribute to the protection of tomato plants against attack by phytopathogenic fungi. In general, successful fungal pathogens of tomato are more resistant to alpha-tomatine in vitro than fungi that do not infect this plant. For a number of tomato pathogens, this resistance has been associated with the ability to detoxify alpha-tomatine through the action of enzymes known as tomatinases. In contrast, the biotrophic tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum is sensitive to alpha-tomatine and is unable to detoxify this saponin. This paper describes the effects of heterologous expression of the cDNA encoding tomatinase from the necrotroph Septoria lycopersici in two different physiological races of C. fulvum. Tomatinase-producing C. fulvum transformants showed increased sporulation on cotyledons of susceptible tomato lines. They also caused more extensive infection of seedlings of resistant tomato lines. Thus, alpha-tomatine may contribute to the ability of tomato to restrict the growth of C. fulvum in both compatible and incompatible interactions. 3aalpha-tomatine 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aSeptoria lycopersici 3aglycosidases 3asporulation 3acomplementary DNA 3aseedlings 3abranching 3adefense mechanisms 3ahyphae 3acotyledons 3aPassalora fulva 3agene expression 3asaponins 3aapoptosis 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCladosporiumxdrug effectsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aCotyledon 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxbiosynthesis 2aSolanum lycopersicumxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aMitosporic Fungixdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSpores, Fungal 2aTomatinexmetabolismxpharmacology. 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aincompatibility 0acompatibility 0aFulvia fulva 0aglycoalkaloids1 aFlegg, L.M.1 aBrown, J.K.M.1 aOliver, R.P.1 aDaniels, M.J.1 aOsbourn, A.E.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.228-236wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.3.2283Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02629naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245011200127300001600239520133100255650001501586650002501601650001601626650001701642650001501659650002301674650001601697650001801713650000901731650001101740650003101751650001501782650001901797650002301816650002401839700001701863700002001880700001601900700002201916773021101938856004902149852000902198655001202207IND60646473320190628000000.0190612e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064647332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArgano, M.10aUse of a colorimetric assay to evaluate the proliferation of canine mammary tumor cells exposed to propofol  ap. 149-153.  aDrugs applied on human cancer cells can influence the rate of cell proliferation. The present study investigates the use of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay to evaluate canine tumor cell proliferation after exposure to the injectable anesthetic, propofol. Primary (CIPp) and metastatic (CIPm) canine tubular adenocarcinoma cell lines were incubated with cell culture medium (control) or propofol (1, 5, and 10 μg/mL). The MTT assays were performed after 6 and 12 hours of exposure. Measurements of absorbance were obtained for each condition with a spectrophotometer and compared with controls using a 3-way analysis of variance (P < 0.05). An increased cell proliferation rate was observed in CIPp exposed to 5 and 10 μg/mL of propofol for 6 hours and 1, 5, and 10 μg/mL for 12 hours. No significant changes were observed in CIPm after 6 hours of exposure. All propofol concentrations decreased the cell proliferation rate in CIPm after 12 hours of exposure. The MTT assays showed that exposure of CIPp to propofol for 6 and 12 hours increased cell proliferation. A decrease in the CIPm proliferation rate was observed when propofol exposure lasted for 12 hours. Further studies are warranted to better understand the role of propofol on cancer cell proliferation. 3aabsorbance 3aanalysis of variance 3aanesthetics 3acell culture 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3acolorimetry 3aculture media 3adogs 3ahumans 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aspectrophotometers 3aveterinary medicine1 aDe Maria, R.1 aRodlsberger, K.1 aBuracco, P.1 aMenzies, M.

This can be achieved by a differentiation strategy with supporting and promoting the local products of each area. Through this process it is aimed to create synergies among the local producers and the various distributors, and more over to add value on the final local product. The importance of the quality of the products has created a world trend on nutritional topics. This has caused a highly competitive food market, and the aspect of quality and locality can be a unique asset to sustain competitiveness on a global scale. Consumers, the last years, are getting more and more interested in the origin of their food not only for health and security reasons but also for an inner need to satisfy the lack of 'original' and 'traditional' flavours and tastes of their daily life. The geographical correlation of local products, with or without certification standards (PGO, PGI in the EU), can be considered by the consumer as a main quality characteristic, like 'traditional', 'original', etc. For a country like Greece, with a very long tradition in small local farms and producers and a very strong bond that exists between them and the rural areas, the SYAL approach is the ideal tool for promoting rural development and local economies with respect on economic competitiveness, social aspect and environmental restrictions. So through the SYAL approach local resources and local know-how are incorporated in the local products. This process increases the added value of the products on a collective intellectual property of the local agricultural society. The present research is a study in order to promote the effort of Skopelos island for the emergence of the uniqueness of the plum, as a PGO local product and the impact that it will have on the local economy. 3aEuropean Union 3aassets 3acertification 3afarms 3aflavor 3aplums 3arural areas 3arural development 3aGreece0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Oct. 30, , no. 1175 p.1-4dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1175.1  aDNAL 7aarticle03990naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171100001800188245016400206300001600370500001500386520201900401650001502420650002602435650002802461650001602489650002402505650002602529650001902555650002002574650001202594650004302606650001102649650002702660650001102687650004202698650005802740650003402798650002202832650007902854650002202933653002602955653001502981700001502996700001303011773022303024852000903247856007603256930003303332945002503365946001103390990002303401655001203424IND4383613120221121034258.0060917e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438361312DNAL7 a169706322pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0442.2006.00848.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

At dry-off, cows were assigned to two treatment groups by randomized blocks on the basis of parity and somatic cell count (SCC). Two antibiotic DCT regimens were used, namely: (1) a single intramammary infusion containing sodium nafcillin, procaine benzylpenicillin and dihydrostreptomycin; and (2) systemic cefquinome administered intramuscularly, twice at a 24-h interval. In the intramammary (IMM) treatment group, the S. aureus intramammary infection (IMI) rate was reduced from 40% (56/140 quarters) before dry-off to 20% (28/140) after calving. Seventy per cent (39/56) of the S. aureus-positive quarters were negative after calving, and 13% (11/84) of the negative quarters were positive after calving. In the systemic treatment group, the S. aureus IMI rate increased from 39% (29/74 quarters) before dry-off to 55% (41/74) after calving. Twenty-eight per cent (8/29) of the S. aureus-positive quarters were negative after calving and 45% (20/45) of the negative quarters were positive after calving. The odds ratio of an S. aureus-positive quarter being negative after calving in the IMM group relative to the systemic therapy group was 44.6 (95% confidence interval = 2.1-909.1, P < 0.01). Parity, quarter, milk SCC and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase were tested in the model, and were found to have no significant effect on S. aureus cure rates or new IMI rates. The IMM treatment resulted in a higher cure rate compared with that observed in previous studies. The very low cure rate after systemic cefquinome treatment was comparable to the spontaneous cure rate observed in untreated controls in previous studies. The unfavourable results of the cefquinome systemic DCT might reflect inadequate pharmacokinetic properties of the drug regarding poor udder penetration in subclinical mastitis and short antimicrobial effect compared with the IMM treatment. 3adairy cows 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aintramuscular injection 3aantibiotics 3aveterinary medicine 3afield experimentation 3amammary glands 3abovine mastitis 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCattle 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aFemale 2aInjections, Intramuscularxveterinary 2aMastitis, Bovinexdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aMilkxcytologyxmicrobiology. 2aRandom Allocation 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxdrug therapyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aTreatment Outcome 0aintramammary infusion 0adry period1 aKass, P.H.1 aSaran-a.0 tZentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin.

S. 10aCross-shelf variation in browsing intensity on the Great Barrier Reef  ap. 499-508.  aHerbivory is widely accepted as a key process determining the structure and resilience of coral reefs, with regional reductions in herbivores often being related to shifts from dominance by coral to leathery macroalgae. The removal of leathery macroalgae may therefore be viewed as a critical process on coral reefs. However, few studies have examined this process beyond a within-reef scale. Here, browsing activity was examined across the entire Great Barrier Reef shelf using bioassays of the leathery macroalga Sargassum to directly quantify algal removal. The assays revealed marked cross-shelf variation in browsing intensity, with the highest rates recorded on mid-shelf reefs (55.2-79.9% day⁻¹) and decreasing significantly on inner- (10.8-17.0% day⁻¹) and outer-shelf (10.1-10.4% day⁻¹) reefs. Surprisingly, the variation in browsing intensity was not directly related to estimates of macroalgal browser biomass; rather, it appears to be shaped primarily by the local environment and behaviour of the component species. Removal rates across the inner- and mid-shelf reefs appear to be related to the attractiveness of the assays relative to the resident algal communities. Controlling for the influence of the resident algal communities revealed a positive relationship between removal rates and the biomass of a single macroalgal browsing species, Naso unicornis. In contrast, the low removal rates on the outer-shelf reefs displayed no relationship to algal or herbivore communities and appeared to reflect a negative behavioural response by the resident fishes to a novel, or unfamiliar, alga. These findings not only highlight the complexities of the relationship between fish presence and ecological function, but also the value of examining ecological processes across broader spatial scales. 3aherbivores 3amacroalgae 0aSargassum swartzii 0aEcosystem process 0aDietary conservatism 0aResilience1 aBellwood, D.

Here, we test the hypothesis that animals could minimize interference competition by shifting their temporal niches in relation to competitors. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes in order to study agonistic interactions between elephants and other herbivore species. We also used a long-term data set from a yearly survey of waterhole attendance by herbivores to evaluate the influence of the presence of elephants on the use of waterholes by other herbivore species. Our results show that in drier years, waterholes are crowded with elephants early in the afternoon. In general, the species most affected by interference competition with elephants shift their temporal niches at the waterholes, thus maintaining a constant temporal overlaps with elephants. The species less affected by interference competition with elephants show no temporal niche shifts and increase their temporal overlap with elephants at waterholes, as predicted from a noncompetition hypothesis. This study provides evidence that interference competition with a behaviorally dominant large species influences the temporal niches of smaller species, and suggests that the potential costs associated with interference between elephants and other herbivores at waterholes are linked to shifts in diurnal activities rather than interactions and water acquisition itself. 3aElephantidae 3aanimals 3adiurnal activity 3aherbivores 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3aniches 3aprediction 3asurveys 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aEcosystem 2aElephantsxphysiology 2aEquidaexphysiology 2aRuminantsxphysiology 2aSwinexphysiology 2aTime Factors 2aWater 3aZimbabwe 0aZimbabwe 0aBehavioural adjustments 0aHwange National Park 0aKeystone competitor 0aNiche overlap1 aChamaillé-Jammes, Simon1 aFritz, Hervé0 tOecologia.g2007 Sept., v. 153, no. 3 p.739-748dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-007-0764-5 7aarticle02628naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245010300164300001800267500001500285520123100300650001301531650002101544650002301565650002201588650001401610650002501624650002001649650002201669650001001691650002301701650001101724650002801735650001401763650002001777653002101797653001701818700002501835700001701860700001601877773009701893852000901990856008801999930003302087945001302120946001302133655001202146IND2199287920221121014501.0990614e199812  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219928792DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.12.11552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiedras, P.10aRapid, Cf-9- and Avr9-dependent production of active oxygen species in tobacco suspension cultures  ap. 1155-1166.  a2019-12-04  aThe tomato Cf-9 gene confers resistance to races of Cladosporium fulvum expressing the corresponding avirulence gene Avr9. The availability of transgenic tobacco lines carrying Cf-9, and the well-characterized 28 amino acid Avr9 elicitor; make this an excellent system to study resistance gene function. In this paper we establish tobacco suspension cultures derived from transgenic tobacco plants containing Cf-9, as well as from plants without Cf-9. Cultures derived from Cf9 tobacco produce active oxygen species (AOS) within 5 mm of treatment with pure or synthetic Avr9. This enabled us to perform biochemical and pharmacotogical analysis in cell culture of the very earliest events in resistance gene function. In addition to AOS production an increase in oxygen uptake was detected in the Avr9-treated Cf9 cells. Both phenomena were inhibited by low concentrations of diphenylenciodonium (DPI). Additional pharmacological inhibitor studies suggest that uptake of calcium activation of protein kinases and probably phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity are intermediates in the Cf-9- and Avr9-dependent signaling pathway that leads to AOS production. Interestingly, those defense responses did not result in plant cell death. 3aproteins 3aphospholipase A2 3agenetic resistance 3atransgenic plants 3avirulence 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3aoxygen 3acell suspension culture 3aapoptosis 3aPassalora fulva 0aavirulence genes 0aFulvia fulva1 aHammond-Kosack, K.E.1 aHarrison, K.1 aJones, D.G.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Dec., v. 11, no. 12 p.1155-1166x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.12.11553Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03407naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001800169245012900187300001700316520219400333650003502527650001102562650001302573650001402586650001502600651001502615700001702630700001502647700001702662700001502679773013902694852000902833856007502842930003302917945002502950946001102975990002302986655001203009IND4411464620221121014344.0081014s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441146462DNAL7 a10.1071/AR081462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aIrwin, J.A.G.10aUse of single cross hybrids to measure heterosis for yield in diverse lucerne genotypes growing in a subtropical environment  ap. 999-1009.  aYield stagnation is a worldwide issue for lucerne breeding, and reasons for the yield plateau include emphasis on disease and pest resistance and not yield per se, and the broad-based synthetic approach to lucerne breeding which is generally used. In this study, an incomplete diallel was made between 50 lucerne clones with representatives from the 3 hypothetical heterotic groups, Medicago sativa subsp. falcata, dormant subsp. sativa, and non-dormant subsp. sativa. Male sterile clones were also included among the dormant group. The single crosses were compared in a subtropical environment at Gatton, Queensland, for yield and other relevant agronomic traits against the adapted synthetics Sequel (dormancy group 9), UQL-1 (group 7), and a highly non-dormant experimental synthetic (line B) derived by introgression of highly non-dormant Arabian germplasm into Sequel. The trial was conducted in a known low-disease-pressure site for Phytophthora root rot, and anthracnose was managed by regular application of prophylactic treatments. The best single cross outyielded Sequel and line B by 13% and 8%, respectively. In this environment, yield was very much influenced by the dormancy group of the test material, with group 9 material significantly outyielding more dormant material. General combining ability (GCA) effects were more important determinants of cumulative yields than specific combining ability (SCA) effects, with these effects being significantly greater than zero for only 4 of the 236 crosses tested over the 15-month period. Similarly, GCA effects were more important for determining autumn height and persistence. The research did identify a small number of clones with good GCA for yield per se, and it would appear that future work should focus on developing more narrow-based synthetics with 4-8 parents which have been selected on the basis of their GCA for yield per se. DNA markers would appear to have a role in selecting clones carrying multiple resistances, and in establishing marker pedigrees for high-yielding parental clones such as we have identified, which can be traced through subsequent generations of recurrent selection in cultivar improvement. 3aMedicago sativa subsp. falcata 3aclones 3agenotype 3aheterosis 3acrop yield 3aQueensland1 aPepper, P.M.1 aArmour, D.1 aMackie, J.M.1 aLowe, K.F.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2008, v. 59, no. 11 p.999-1009dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR081463Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/11/10  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02816naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001300148245011800161300001800279500001500297520131000312650002501622650002301647650000901670650001301679650001401692650001301706650003601719650002501755650001001780650002301790650001401813650004001827650003401867650002301901653002301924653001201947653002601959700001801985700002002003700001702023700001702040773009702057852000902154856008802163930003302251945001302284946001302297655001202310IND2199288620221121014237.0990614e199812  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219928862DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.12.11962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoch, J.10aAnalysis of resistance gene-mediated defense responses in Arabidopsis thaliana plants carrying a mutation in CPR5  ap. 1196-1206.  a2019-12-04  aIn resistant plants, pathogen attack often leads to rapid activation of defense responses that limit multiplication and spread of the pathogen. To investigate the signaling mechanisms underlying this process, we carried out a screen for mutants in the signaling pathway governing resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. This involved screening for suppressor mutations that restored resistance to a susceptible line carrying a mutation in the RPS2 resistance gene. A mutant that conferred resistance by activating defense responses in the absence of pathogens was isolated. This mutant, which carries a mutation at the CPR5 locus and was thus designated cpr5-2, exhibited resistance to P. syringae, spontaneous development of necrotic lesions, elevated PR gene expression in the absence of pathogens, and abnormal trichomes. Resistance gene-mediated defenses, including the hypersensitive response, restriction of pathogen growth, and induction of defense-related gene expression, were functional in cpr5-2 mutant plants. Additionally, in cpr5-2 plants RPS2-mediated induction of PR-1 expression was enhanced, whereas RPM1- mediated induction of ELI3 was not. These findings suggest that CPR5 encodes a negative regulator of the RPS2 signal transduction pathway. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenetic resistance 3aloci 3anecrosis 3atrichomes 3amutation 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3abiochemical pathways 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3ascreening 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3adefense mechanisms 0agenetic regulation 0alesions 0abiological resistance1 aVerbsky, M.L.1 aRobertson, T.L.1 aLarkin, J.C.1 aKunkel, B.N.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Dec., v. 11, no. 12 p.1196-1206x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.12.11963Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02914naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245007800171300001600249500002400265520135300289650001801642650002601660650001101686650004401697650001301741650001001754650001201764650002601776650002801802650001701830650003001847650001601877650001801893650001801911650001801929650002401947650001201971650001901983650001202002700002402014700002502038700002602063700002102089700002002110700002302130700002002153773011002173852000902283856009202292655001202384IND4461410220221121014430.0110812s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446141022DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01150.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Shengjing10aEffects of selected root exudate components on soil bacterial communities  ap. 600-610.  aIncludes references  aLow-molecular-weight organic compounds in root exudates play a key role in plant-microorganism interactions by influencing the structure and function of soil microbial communities. Model exudate solutions, based on organic acids (OAs) (quinic, lactic, maleic acids) and sugars (glucose, sucrose, fructose), previously identified in the rhizosphere of Pinus radiata, were applied to soil microcosms. Root exudate compound solutions stimulated soil dehydrogenase activity and the addition of OAs increased soil pH. The structure of active bacterial communities, based on reverse-transcribed 16S rRNA gene PCR, was assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and PhyloChip microarrays. Bacterial taxon richness was greater in all treatments than that in control soil, with a wide range of taxa (88-1043) responding positively to exudate solutions and fewer (<24) responding negatively. OAs caused significantly greater increases than sugars in the detectable richness of the soil bacterial community and larger shifts of dominant taxa. The greater response of bacteria to OAs may be due to the higher amounts of added carbon, solubilization of soil organic matter or shifts in soil pH. Our results indicate that OAs play a significant role in shaping soil bacterial communities and this may therefore have a significant impact on plant growth. 3aPinus radiata 3abacterial communities 3acarbon 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3afructose 3agenes 3aglucose 3amicroarray technology 3aorganic acids and salts 3aplant growth 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aroot exudates 3asoil bacteria 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3asolubilization 3asucrose1 aRichardson, Alan E.1 aO'Callaghan, Maureen1 aDeAngelis, Kristen M.1 aJones, Eirian E.1 aStewart, Alison1 aFirestone, Mary K.1 aCondron, Leo M.0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2011 Sept., v. 77, no. 3 p.600-610dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01150.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03481naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245016200166300001800328500001500346520165600361650001502017650002802032650000902060650002402069650002102093650001602114650001302130650001302143650001302156650002002169650001002189650001202199650002802211650001502239650001602254653001302270653002102283653001202304653002102316653002802337653002402365653002102389653002302410653001302433653002102446653002102467653002502488700002002513700002002533700001502553700001602568773011502584852000902699856008802708930003302796945001302829946001302842655001202855IND2199288220221121014228.0990614e199812  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219928822DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.12.11752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOresnik, I.J.10aPlasmid-encoded catabolic genes in Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii: evidence for a plant-inducible rhamnose locus involved in competition for nodulation  ap. 1175-1185.  a2019-12-04  aCosmids carrying genes involved in utilization of rhamnose, sorbitol, and adonitol were isolated from a genomic library of Rhizobium leguminosarum by complementation of plasmid-cured derivatives of strain Rlt100 that were unable to grow on these carbon sources. Transposon mutagenesis was used to identify regions of each cosmid necessary for catabolism of the respective carbon source-, partial DNA sequencing, as well as analysis of gene fusions created with transposon Tn5-B20, helped to determine the orientation and possible function of genes required for growth on the three substrates. Representative Tn5 insertions in the cosmids were recombined into the wild-type strain Rlt100 by gene replacement to generate isogenic strains unable to use either rhamnose, sorbitol. or adonitol. These strains were tested for their nodulation competitiveness compared with Rlt100 in co-inoculation experiments on clover plants. While sorbitol and adonitol catabolic mutants were unaltered in their competitive behavior, the nodulation competitiveness of three different rhamnose utilization mutants was significantly impaired. This result, coupled with the fact that the rhamnose catabolic genes were inducible by clover root extracts, suggests an important role for rhamnose catabolism in the early stages of the interaction of R. 1eguminosarum with clover plants. Hybridization studies with probes derived from the rhamnose, sorbitol, and adonitol catabolic toci demonstrated that these genes are plasmid encoded in virtually all R. leguminosarum strains,. including representatives from all three biovars from a variety of different geographic locations. 3ametabolism 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aloci 3arestriction mapping 3aTrifolium repens 3amutagenesis 3asorbitol 3aplasmids 3arhamnose 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3agenetic complementation 3anodulation 3atransposons 0aadonitol 0agenbank/af085688 0acosmids 0agenbank/af085687 0amolecular sequence data 0acompetitive ability 0agenbank/af086782 0agenetic regulation 0aalditols 0agenbank/af086781 0anutrient sources 0anucleotide sequences1 aPacarynuk, L.A.1 aO'Brien, S.A.P.1 aYost, C.K.1 aHynes, M.F.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Dec., v. 11, no. 12 p.1175-1185wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.12.11753Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03333naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245022900195300001600424520126600440650002201706650002401728650002101752650001601773650001301789650000901802650001601811650001601827650001001843650002001853650002101873650001601894650002101910650001401931650001001945650001201955650003001967650002501997650004002022650002702062650007002089650002602159650000902185650003502194650003702229650001602266650005302282650002602335653002002361653003602381700002502417773013202442852000902574856009202583930003302675946001102708655001202719IND4434537720221121014234.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443453772DNAL7 a204385092pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-0929.2009.00736.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAengwanich, Worapol10aEffect of polyphenols extracted from Tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.) seed coat on physiological changes, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, oxidative stress and body weight of broilers (Gallus domesticus) under chronic heat stress  ap. 264-270.  aThe aim of this experiment was to determine the effect of polyphenols extracted from tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.) seed coat on physiological changes, oxidative stress and production of male broilers maintained at high environmental temperatures. The results found that body temperature and respiratory rate of broilers maintained at 38 +/- 2°C was higher than broilers maintained at 26 +/- 2°C (P < 0.05).

At week 1, the body weights of broilers that were maintained at 38 ± 2°C who received polyphenols at 100-500 mg/ kg in diets, and broilers maintained at 26 ± 2°C were higher than that of the control group which had not been treated with a polyphenol diet (P < 0.05). This study indicated that polyphenols could reduce heat stress, oxidative stress and improve the growth rate of heat-stressed broilers. 3aTamarindus indica 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3abody weight 3achickens 3adiet 3aheat stress 3aheterophils 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3arespiratory rate 3atamarinds 3atesta 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aChickensxphysiology 2aFlavonoidsxadministration & dosage 2aGranulocytesxcytology 2aHeat Stress Disordersxdrug therapyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aLymphocytesxcytology 2aMale 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPhenolsxadministration & dosage 2aPolyphenols 2aPoultry Diseasesxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aTamarindusxchemistry 0aanthrocyanidins 0atamarind (Tamarindus indica L.)1 aMaitrī Sutthačhit.0 tAnimal science journal =.g2010 Apr., v. 81, no. 2 p.264-270dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1344-39417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-0929.2009.00736.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120413b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03304naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001400148245015000162300001800312520175500330650002202085650002002107650001302127650001402140650002302154650002302177650001102200650002502211650001802236650001802254650001302272650002502285650002202310650002002332650002302352650001902375650003602394650002802430700001702458700001902475700001502494700001802509773011502527852000902642856008802651930003302739945001302772946001302785655001202798IND2198460420221120232733.0990430e199811  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219846042DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.11.11022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorey, S.10aTobacco class I and II catalases are differentially expressed during elicitor-induced hypersensitive cell death and localized acquired resistance  ap. 1102-1109.  aExpression of tobacco class I (CAT1) and class II (CAT2) catalases was analyzed in leaves reacting hypersensitively to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or to a fungal glycoprotein elicitor. In TMV-infected plants, Cat1 transcript levels declined rapidly while Cat2 transcripts accumulated strongly. The spatial and temporal changes in catalase transcripts, proteins, and activity during the hypersensitive reaction (HR) were further investigated in tobacco leaves infiltrated with a glycoprotein elicitor. Two functionally different zones were discriminated: the infiltrated tissue in which cells undergo the HR, called the HR-zone 1; and the surrounding tissue showing strong induced defense responses, called the LAR (Localized Acquired Resistance)-zone 2. Levels of Cat1 and Cat2 mRNA and proteins and catalase activity decreased in the HR-zone 1. In the LAR-zone 2, Cat1 transcripts became rapidly undetectable, but levels of Cat2 mRNA and protein and catalase activity increased. Catalase expression in elicitor-infiltrated leaves reflected that in TMV-infected leaves. A strong rise in hydrogen peroxide occurred in the HR-zone 1 and paralleled the CAT activity decline. No H2O2 increase was measured in the LAR-zone 2. There was no correlation between salicylic acid levels and catalase activity. Modulation of catalase activity in tobacco leaves undergoing the HR appeared predominantly supported by changes in catalase transcripts and proteins. We have shown that neither H2O2 nor salicylic acid can be the primary mobile signal diffusing from the HR-zone 1 to the LAR-zone 2 and inducing CAT2 expression. Furthermore, the signaling pathway responsible for decreased CAT2 expression in the HR-zone 1 does not involve reactive oxygen intermediates. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3agene expression 3acatalase 3aapoptosis 3adefense mechanisms 3ainduced resistance 3aleaves 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aglycoproteins 3amessenger RNA 3aisozymes 3aspatial distribution 3aprotein synthesis 3aenzyme activity 3atemporal variation 3asalicylic acid 3achemical constituents of plants 3ahypersensitive response1 aBailieul, F.1 aSaindrenan, P.1 aFritig, B.1 aKauffmann, S.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Nov., v. 11, no. 11 p.1102-1109wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.11.11023Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03118naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001700169245012800186300001800314520180200332650001602134650001302150650001702163650002802180650002002208650002302228650001902251650001602270650002002286700001602306700001702322700001502339700001402354773014002368852000902508856007502517930003302592945002502625946001102650990002302661655001202684IND4412520620221120232702.0081114s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441252062DNAL7 a10.1071/AR081042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChen, Huatao10aIdentification of quantitative trait loci associated with salt tolerance during seedling growth in soybean (Glycine max L.)  ap. 1086-1091.  aSalt stress is an important factor affecting the growth and development of soybean. The inheritance and expression of traits associated with salt tolerance during the seedling stage are complex. The present study was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with salt tolerance during seedling growth in soybean. Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate 184 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Kefeng No. 1 and Nannong1138-2 for salt tolerance and QTLs that are associated with salt tolerance. The molecular map of this RIL population, covering 2625.9cM of the genome, converged into 24 linkage groups and consisted of 221 SSR markers and 1 disease-resistant gene (Rsc-7). QTL mapping was conducted using WinQTLCart. Eight putative QTLs significantly associated with salt tolerance were identified. One QTL was identified both in field and greenhouse experiments. In the field, salt tolerance was assessed (tolerance rating, TR) visually on a 0 (death) to 5 (unaffected by salt stress) scale. Three QTLs were detected on two linkage groups explaining 7.1-19.7% of the total phenotypic variance for salt tolerance. In the greenhouse, plant survival days (PSD) and percentage of plant survival (PPS) under salt stress were measured. Six QTLs were detected on six linkage groups, and explained 7.8-19.2% of total phenotypic variation for salt tolerance. A major QTL was identified between markers Sat_164 and Sat_358 on linkage group G in both the field and greenhouse. This QTL qppsN.1 was identified in the same location as a salt tolerance QTL previously reported in soybean. The detection of new QTLs will provide important information for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and further genetic studies on salt tolerance in soybean. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3ainbred lines 3aquantitative trait loci 3agenetic markers 3achromosome mapping 3asalt tolerance 3asalt stress 3aseedling growth1 aCui, Shiyou1 aFu, Sanxiong1 aGai, Junyi1 aYu, Deyue0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2008, v. 59, no. 12 p.1086-1091dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR081043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090211b20090301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/02/11  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02859naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169100001600186245014300202300001800345520148700363650001201850650002001862650002301882650002301905650000901928650001501937650002201952650002401974650001401998651002502012651002002037651002202057700001802079773014002097852000902237856007502246930003302321945002502354946001102379990002302390655001202413IND4411464220221120232622.0081014s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441146422DNAL7 a10.1071/AR080752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLodge, G.M.10aAgricultural drought analyses for temperate Australia using a biophysical pasture model. 1. Identifying and characterising drought periods  ap. 1049-1060.  aThe SGS Pasture Model was used to estimate daily total soil water content (mm) for the period 1998-2001 (using experimental data) and from July 1905 to June 2005 (using a 100-year daily climate file). For both model simulations, the correlation coefficient for actual and predicted data was >0.86. Four sites were examined, three in the winter-rainfall zone (Albany, Western Australia; Hamilton, Victoria; and Wagga Wagga, New South Wales) and one in the predominantly summer-rainfall zone (Barraba, New South Wales) of temperate Australia. Trends were detected in long-term rainfall data for lower mean annual rainfall at the Albany site since the mid 1950s and at the Hamilton site since the mid 1970s. Analyses of days in which herbage accumulation was likely to be limited only by water allowed a minimum soil water content to be defined; below this value, soil water was in deficit. A drought period was defined as occurring after >50 consecutive days of predicted soil water deficit. For the four sites, six categories of drought duration were described, ranging from >50-120 days (seasonal drought) to >364 days (exceptional drought). Numbers of predicted droughts were 90, 90, 65, and 60, respectively, at Albany, Hamilton, Wagga Wagga, and Barraba sites. At the three winter-rainfall sites, most predicted droughts occurred in a regular pattern and were an extension of a seasonal drought, but at the Barraba site they were of a longer duration and irregular in occurrence. 3adrought 3atemperate zones 3asoil water content 3asoil water deficit 3arain 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3aregression analysis 3aequations 3aVictoria (Australia) 3aNew South Wales 3aWestern Australia1 aJohnson, I.R.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2008, v. 59, no. 11 p.1049-1060dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR080753Available from publisher's Web site  a20081110b20081206c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/11/10  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02823naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245010600179300001600285500002400301520133100325650001801656650001501674650001501689650001001704650001001714650001201724650002301736650001601759650002601775650001401801650001101815650001401826650001401840650003001854650001801884650001401902650002201916700002301938700002101961700001801982700001602000700002202016700001902038700001802057700001902075773011002094852000902204856009202213655001202305IND4461409620221120221821.0110812s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446140962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01134.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiderre-Petit, Corinne10aIdentification of microbial communities involved in the methane cycle of a freshwater meromictic lake  ap. 533-545.  aIncludes references  aLake Pavin is a meromictic crater lake located in the French Massif Central area. In this ecosystem, most methane (CH₄) produced in high quantity in the anoxic bottom layers, and especially in sediments, is consumed in the water column, with only a small fraction of annual production reaching the atmosphere. This study assessed the diversity of methanogenic and methanotrophic populations along the water column and in sediments using PCR and reverse transcription-PCR-based approaches targeting functional genes, i.e. pmoA (α-subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase) for methanotrophy and mcrA (α-subunit of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase) for methanogenesis as well as the phylogenetic 16S rRNA genes. Although methanogenesis rates were much higher in sediments, our results confirm that CH₄ production also occurs in the water column where methanogens were almost exclusively composed of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, whereas both hydrogenotrophs and acetotrophs were almost equivalent in the sediments. Sequence analysis of markers, pmoA and the 16S rRNA gene, suggested that Methylobacter may be an important group actively involved in CH₄ oxidation in the water column. Two main phylotypes were characterized, one of which could consume CH₄ under conditions where the oxygen amount is undetectable. 3aMethylobacter 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3agenes 3alakes 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphylogeny 3aphylotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asequence analysis1 aJézéquel, Didier1 aDugat-Bony, Eric1 aLopes, Filipa1 aKuever, Jan1 aBorrel, Guillaume1 aViollier, Eirc1 aFonty, Gerard1 aPeyret, Pierre0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2011 Sept., v. 77, no. 3 p.533-545dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01134.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02591naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245008000200300001300280506007600293520127400369506003701643650000801680650002001688650001001708650001101718650002201729650002201751650001301773700002001786700002001806700001901826700001801845773008301863852000901946856007801955856005702033930003302090946001102123990002302134655001202157IND4385175520221207124231.0061112e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438517552DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkl7162doi7 aPMC16364942pmcid7 a170280982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMantovani, Julie12aA high throughput method for genome-wide analysis of retroviral integration  ap. e134.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRetroviral and lentiviral vectors integrate their DNA into the host cell genome leading to stable transgene expression. Integration preferentially occurs in the proximity of active genes, and may in some case disturb their activity, with adverse toxic consequences. To efficiently analyze high numbers of lentiviral insertion sites in the DNA of transduced cells, we developed an improved high-throughput method called vector integration tag analysis (VITA). VITA is based on the identification of Genomic Tags associated to the insertion sites, which are used as signatures of the integration events. We use the capacity of MmeI to cleave DNA at a defined distance of its recognition site, in order to generate 21 bp long tags from libraries of junction fragments between vector and cellular DNA. The length of the tags is sufficient in most cases, to identify without ambiguity an unique position in the human genome. Concatenation, cloning and sequencing of the tags allow to obtain information about 20-25 insertion sites in a single sequencing reaction. As a validation of this method, we have characterized 1349 different lentiviral vector insertion sites in transduced HeLa cells, from only 487 sequencing reactions, with a background of <2% false positive tags.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3amolecular cloning 3asequence analysis 3atoxicity1 aHolic, Nathalie1 aMartinez, Kelly1 aDanos, Olivier1 aPerea, Javier0 tNucleic acids research.g2006 Nov., v. 34, no. 19 p.e134-e134x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl7163Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20061112b20061202c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03308naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003800110040001800148100001700166245012900183300001800312500001500330520136900345650002001714650002401734650001601758650001301774650002501787650001801812650002301830650001201853650002401865650001801889650002301907650001901930650002801949650001301977650002401990650001302014650002902027650003402056650004202090653001802132653002102150653001702171653002802188653002502216653002102241700001602262700001302278700001902291700001702310700001502327700001602342700001902358700001602377773009702393852000902490856008802499930003302587945001302620946001302633655001202646IND2198459420221120202319.0990430e199811  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219845942DNAL7 a98053902pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.11.10312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuboyama, T.12aA plasmid isolated from phytopathogenic onion yellows phytoplasma and its heterogeneity in the pathogenic phytoplasma mutant  ap. 1031-1037.  a2019-12-04  aA 3.6-kbp DNA fragment was cloned from the extrachromosomal DNA of a pathogenic plant mollicute, onion yellow; phytoplasma (OY-W). Sequence analysis of the fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the replication (Rep) protein of rolling-circle replication (RCR)-type plasmids. This result suggests the existence of a plasmid (pOYW1) in OY-W that uses the RCR mechanism. This assumption was confirmed by detecting the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of a replication intermediate that is specifically produced by the RCR mechanism. This is the first report on the identification of the replication system of this plasmid and the genes encoded in it. With a DNA fragment including the Rep gene region of pOYW1 used as a probe, Southern and Northern (RNA) blot hybridizations were employed to examine the heterogeneity between the plasmids found in OY-W and a pathogenic mutant (OY-M) isolated from OY-W. Multiple bands were detected in the DNA and RNA extracted from both OY-W and OY-M infected plants, although the banding patterns were different. Moreover, the copy number of plasmids from OY-W was about 4.2 times greater than that from OY-M. These results indicate constructive heterogeneity between OY-W and OY-M plasmids, and the possibility of a relationship between the plasmid-encoded genes and the pathogenicity of the phytoplasma was suggested. 3aDNA replication 3aopen reading frames 3aAllium cepa 3aplasmids 3aamino acid sequences 3apathogenicity 3abacterial proteins 3amutants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlasmids 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTenericutesxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 0aheterogeneity 0agenbank/ab010421 0aphytoplasmas 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/ab0104221 aHuang, C.C.1 aLu, X.Y.1 aSawayanagi, T.1 aKanazawa, T.1 aKagami, T.1 aMatsuda, I.1 aTsuchizaki, T.1 aNamba, S.T.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Nov., v. 11, no. 11 p.1031-1037x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.11.10313Available from publisher's Web site  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02576naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002200164245015000186300001600336520077700352650002001129650002601149650001701175650002001192650001501212650002001227650001701247650001801264650001701282650001301299650002001312650003301332650002301365650001601388650002101404650002001425650003601445650003401481650003201515650003001547650002301577650004701600650003601647653002401683700002401707700001301731773011201744852000901856856008601865930003301951945001301984946001301997655001202010IND2196806720221120190235.0990202e199808  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219680672DNAL7 a96758972pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.8.8392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDillewijn, P. van10aMulticopy vectors carrying the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifA gene do not enhance the nodulation competitiveness of Sinorhizobium meliloti on alfalfa  ap. 839-842.  aIt has been reported that Sinorhizobium meliloti strains harboring IncQ and IncP multicopy vectors containing constitutively expressed Klebsiella pneumoniae nifA exhibit an increase in nodulation competitiveness on alfalfa (J.

In our efforts to understand the mechanisms involved, in this work, we have found that the observed enhancement on nodulation competitiveness by IncQ derivatives carrying K. pneumoniae nifA was not dependent on the plasmid-borne nifA activity but on the sensitivity of nonresistant strains to the streptomycin carried over from growth cultures. Furthermore, it was also determined that the nifA of K. pneumoniae on an IncP vector does not have an effect on competitiveness. 3aMedicago sativa 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aRhizobiaceae 3aplasmid vectors 3anodulation 3agene expression 3astreptomycin 3aculture media 3aroot nodules 3aplasmids 3aregulator genes 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Dosage 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Vectors 2aKlebsiella pneumoniaexgenetics 2aMedicago sativaxmicrobiology 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRhizobiumxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 0acompetitive ability1 aMartinez-Abarca, F.1 aToro, N.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Aug., v. 11, no. 8 p.839-842wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.8.8393Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03562naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003700110040001800147100001300165245010600178300001600284500001500300520123000315650002801545650001401573650002201587650001501609650002601624650003001650650001501680650001401695650002101709650002501730650001801755650002501773650001701798650000801815650003101823650002001854650002401874650001201898650001801910650005601928650002601984650002302010650002602033650003302059650002802092650004502120650003202165650005702197650002802254650003002282650003402312650005502346650003302401653002402434653001202458653002102470653002802491700001602519700001402535700001702549773009502566852000902661856008702670930003302757945001302790946001302803655001202816IND2197384920221120190200.0990304e199810  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219738492DNAL7 a97685122pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.10.9522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, X.12aA secretory cellulose-binding protein cDNA cloned from the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita)  ap. 952-959.  a2019-12-04  aA cDNA encoding a secretory cellulose-binding protein was cloned from the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) with RNA fingerprinting. The putative full-length cDNA, named Mi-cbp-1, encoded a 203 amino acid protein containing an N-terminal secretion signal peptide. The C-terminal sequence of the putative MI-CBP-1 was similar to a bacterial-type cellulose-binding domain, whereas the N-terminal sequence did not show significant similarity to any proteins in data bases. Recombinant MI-CBP-1 lacked cellulase activity, but bound to cellulose and plant cell walls. In Southern blot hybridization, Mi-cbp-1 hybridized with genomic DNA from M. incognita, M. arenaria, and M. javanica, but not M. hapla, Heterodera glycines, or Caenorhabditis elegans. Polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant MI-CBP-1 strongly labeled secretory granules in subventral gland cells of second-stage juveniles in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection of MI-CBP-1 in stylet secretions of second-stage juveniles with the polyclonal antibodies indicated MI-CBP-1 could be secreted through the nematodes' stylet, suggesting that the cellulose-binding protein may have a role in pathogenesis. 3ainterspecific variation 3asecretion 3acomplementary DNA 3acell walls 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3acellulases 3acellulose 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenesis 3aRNA 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDNA, Helminthxgenetics 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aGlucan 1,4-beta-Glucosidase 2aHelminth Proteinsxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Rootsxparasitology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTylenchoideaxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2abeta-Glucosidasexmetabolism 0aspecies differences 0abinding 0agenbank/af049139 0amolecular sequence data1 aShields, J.1 aAllen, R.1 aHussey, R.S.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Oct., v. 11, no. 10 p.952-959x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.10.9523Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02050naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245007700202300001300279506007600292520066000368506003701028650001001065650002001075650001301095650002601108650002601134650001801160650002101178650002001199650001401219700002501233700002601258700001901284700003001303773008301333852000901416856007801425856005701503930003301560946001101593655001201604IND4385175220221207122302.0061112e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438517522DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkl7132doi7 aPMC16364912pmcid7 a170209162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDressman, Holly K.10aAssessing incomplete deprotection of microarray oligonucleotides in situ  ap. e131.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEn masse analysis of gene structure and function by array technologies will have a lasting and profound effect on biology and medicine.

In this study we have investigated the effects on mtDNA replication of manipulating TFAM expression in cultured human cells. Mammalian mtDNA replication intermediates (RIs) fall into two classes, whose mechanistic relationship is not properly understood. One class is characterized by extensive RNA incorporation on the lagging strand, whereas the other has the structure of products of conventional, strand-coupled replication. TFAM overexpression increased the overall abundance of RIs and shifted them substantially towards those of the conventional, strand-coupled type. The shift was most pronounced in the rDNA region and at various replication pause sites and was accompanied by a drop in the relative amount of replication-termination intermediates, a substantial reduction in mitochondrial transcripts, mtDNA decatenation and progressive copy number depletion. TFAM overexpression could be partially phenocopied by treatment of cells with dideoxycytidine, suggesting that its effects are partially attributable to a decreased rate of fork progression. TFAM knockdown also resulted in mtDNA depletion, but RIs remained mainly of the ribosubstituted type, although termination intermediates were enhanced. We propose that TFAM influences the mode of mtDNA replication via its combined effects on different aspects of mtDNA metabolism. 3atranscription factors 3ametabolism 3aDNA replication 3ahumans 3amitochondrial DNA 3aribosomal DNA 3acultured cells 3amitochondria 3aRNA 2aCell Line 2aDNA Replicationxdrug effects 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aHumans 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aTranscription Factorsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aZalcitabinexpharmacology 0aproteins 0amammals1 aWanrooij, Sjoerd1 aHyvärinen, Anne K.1 aGoffart, Steffi1 aHolt, Ian J.1 aSpelbrink, Johannes N.1 aJacobs, Howard T.0 tNucleic acids research.g2006 Nov., v. 34, no. 20 p.5815-5828x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl7033Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110330b20110402c00000000  aINDdTEMeYLP 2011/0  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03391naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001400164245013000178300001600308500001500324520130600339650001301645650002401658650003201682650001301714650001901727650001401746650002501760650001201785650003001797650002001827650001201847650002301859650001401882650002401896650001801920650003501938650005201973650004202025650001802067650001802085650002002103650003102123650003702154650002802191650003002219650002602249650003402275653001602309653002802325653002102353653001002374653002502384653001402409700001602423700001802439773009402457852000902551856008602560930003302646945001302679946001302692655001202705IND2196805020221120171419.0990202e199808  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219680502DNAL7 a96758932pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.8.7722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarre, V.10aCloning, characterization, and targeted disruption of cpcat1, coding for an in planta secreted catalase of Claviceps purpurea  ap. 772-783.  a2019-12-04  aClaviceps purpurea has been shown to secrete catalases in axenic and parasitic culture. In order to determine the importance of these enzymes in the host-parasite interaction, especially their role in overcoming oxidative stress imposed on the pathogen by the plant's defense system, the catR gene from A. niger was used to isolate a putative catalase gene from a genomic library of C. purpurea. cpcat1 consists of an open reading frame of 2,148 bp that is interrupted by five introns. Its derived gene product shows significant homology to fungal catalases and contains a putative signal peptide of 19 amino acids and three putative N-glycosylation sites, which indicates that CPCAT1 is a secreted catalase. Disruption of the gene by a gene replacement approach resulted in the loss of two catalase isoforms, CATC and CATD, strongly suggesting that they are both encoded by cpcat1. CATD is the major secreted catalase of C. purpurea and is furthermore the only catalase present in the honeydew of infected rye ears. Deletion mutants of cpcat1 were inoculated on rye plants and showed no significant reduction in virulence. Ovarian tissue and honeydew of plants inoculated with the mutants lacked CATD, confirming that this catalase is not essential for colonization of the host tissue by C. purpurea. 3acatalase 3aopen reading frames 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aisozymes 3aSecale cereale 3avirulence 3aamino acid sequences 3amutants 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aenzyme activity 3aintrons 3aClaviceps purpurea 3ainfection 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCatalasexgeneticsxsecretion. 2aClavicepsxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxsecretion. 2aGene Deletion 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenomic Library 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxsecretion. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aSecalexmicrobiology. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acpcat1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/aj001386 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0adeletions1 aMüller, U.1 aTudzynski, P.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g1998 Aug., v. 11, no. 8 p.772-783x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.1998.11.8.7723Available from publisher's Web site  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle04054naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245011400187300001600301520238500317650002302702650001102725650002302736650001502759650001102774650001402785650002302799650002202822650002502844650000902869650001302878650001302891650001502904650001202919650001402931650002602945650001602971650003102987650002303018650001203041651002003053651002103073653003303094653002303127653002403150653002803174700002003202773012103222852000903343856009203352930003303444946001103477655001203488IND4434499520221120155506.0100326e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443449952DNAL7 a201808762pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01667.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, K.D.10aDensity as an explanatory variable of movements and calf survival in savanna elephants across southern Africa  ap. 662-673.  a1. Southern Africa's 'elephant problem' is often attributed to an overabundance of elephants (Loxodonta africana) in conservation areas. Paradoxically, the African elephant is listed as 'vulnerable' (IUCN Redlist) despite occupying a large geographical range and numbering about 600 000. How densities influence elephant populations is therefore important for conservation management decisions, particularly because a move towards non-equilibrium management of savannas implies a need for elephant populations to fluctuate in response to variation in intrinsic (demographic) and extrinsic (resource) factors. 2. A study on one of the world's largest elephant populations demonstrated that population regulation is driven by a spatial response to water availability, environmental stochasticity and density. The challenge remains to identify the demographic and behavioural variables that drive density dependence. 3. We evaluated whether the movements of elephant family groups from 13 populations across a wide resource gradient were explained by variability in primary productivity, rainfall and population density. We then assessed whether density-related movements explained variability in juvenile survival, hence inferring a spatially driven behavioural mechanism that may explain density-dependent population growth. We also analysed whether management actions modified this mechanism. 4. In the dry season, daily-displacement distances (DDDs) increased non-linearly with density, and declined with increased vegetation productivity and previous wet season rainfall. In the wet season, DDDs were primarily explained by vegetation productivity. 5. The survival of weaned calves (4-7 years) decreased with increasing dry season DDDs, but this did not hold for suckling calves (1-3 years) or sub-adults (8-11 years). 6. Fences and supplementary water modified the shape and strength of relationships between DDDs and densities, vegetation productivity and rainfall and negated the relationships between DDDs and weaned calf survival. 7. We suggest that density dependence in weaned calf survival is driven by the response of dry season roaming activities of family groups to variations in density, rainfall and the distribution of food. Fences and supplementary water that alter this mechanism may contribute to the relatively high population growth rates of some populations. 3aLoxodonta africana 3acalves 3aconservation areas 3adry season 3afences 3ajuveniles 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aprimary productivity 3arain 3asavannas 3asuckling 3awet season 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aElephantsxphysiology 2aEnvironment 2aMotor Activityxphysiology 2aPopulation Density 2aSeasons 3aSouthern Africa 0aAfrica, Southern 0adaily-displacement distances 0adensity dependence 0aresource limitation 0avegetation productivity1 aVan Aarde, R.J.0 tJournal of animal ecology.g2010 May, v. 79, no. 3 p.662-673dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01667.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100326b20100403c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03341naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100002200203245007600225300001600301500001500317520162300332650001901955650002501974650002601999650002702025650001902052650002802071650002602099650002102125650003702146650001302183650001502196650002002211650002202231650001102253651001202264651001302276651001202289653001702301700002002318700001902338700001902357700001802376700001602394700001602410773013702426852000902563856007502572930003302647945002502680946001102705990002302716655001202739IND4410860120221120134604.0081001s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441086012DNAL7 a10.1071/AR080012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAnnicchiarico, P.10aAdaptation of sulla cultivars to contrasting Mediterranean environments  ap. 702-706.  a2019-12-05  aSulla coronaria (L.) Choi & Ohashi (syn. Hedysarum coronarium L.) may become a major forage species in various Mediterranean-climate areas. This study aimed to assess the extent of genotype x environment (GE) interaction in the western Mediterranean region and its implications for breeding programmes. The milestone Italian varieties Grimaldi and Sparacia, one recent Italian variety, and the Tunisian cv. D'Italie (evolved under moderately favourable conditions from Italian germplasm introduced about 40 years ago) were evaluated in three environments of Tunisia (of which two were irrigated), two of Algeria, and one of Sardinia (Italy). Water available over the crop cycle (rainfall + possible irrigation from October 2004 to June 2006), ranging from 881 to 1906 mm, accounted for 85% of the variation among environments and 72% of the GE interaction variation for dry matter yield. The latter was adequately described by one-covariate factorial regression, which was preferable to joint regression and additive main effects and multiplicative interaction modelling. D'Italie was specifically adapted to environments with available water exceeding 1200 mm, Grimaldi was top-ranking between 950 and 1200 mm, and Sparacia below 950 mm. The crossover GE interaction between top-yielding material (P < 0.05) has implications for adaptation targets, genetic resources, selection environments, and opportunities for international co-operation between breeding programmes. It suggests breeding either for rainfed cropping in semi-arid or near semi-arid environments, or for definitely subhumid or irrigated environments. 3aplant breeding 3aHedysarum coronarium 3aplant available water 3ageographical variation 3aforage legumes 3adry matter accumulation 3aenvironmental factors 3aplant adaptation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agenotype 3aprovenance 3adryland farming 3agenetic variation 3ayields 3aAlgeria 3aSardinia 3aTunisia 0aforage crops1 aAbdelguerfi, A.1 aBen Younes, M.1 aBouzerzour, H.1 aCarroni, A.M.1 aPecetti, L.1 aTibaoui, G.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2008, v. 59, no. 8 p.702-706dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR080013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/13  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03162naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001600169245013800185300001600323500001500339520145500354650002801809650002201837650002701859650002301886650001401909650002301923650003701946650001901983650002202002650002702024650002302051650002302074650001702097650002002114653003702134653002802171653001202199700001902211700001602230700001402246700002002260700001502280773013702295852000902432856007502441930003302516945002502549946001102574990002302585655001202608IND4410860320221120120420.0081001s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441086032DNAL7 a10.1071/AR073782doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMuranty, H.12aA quantitative approach detects three QTLs involved in powdery mildew resistance at the seedling stage in the winter wheat line RE714  ap. 714-722.  a2019-12-05  aPowdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) is one of the major diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The objective of the present study was to describe the quantitative resistance to powdery mildew of the winter wheat line RE714 at the seedling stage and to identify microsatellite markers tightly linked to the RE714 resistance QTL, which could be used in marker-assisted selection. A population of 160 recombinant inbred lines obtained from the cross between RE714 (resistant) and Hardi (susceptible) was genotyped with microsatellite and AFLP markers. Fifteen powdery mildew isolates were used to test the resistance of these lines at the seedling stage. QTL analysis enabled us to identify three major QTLs controlling powdery mildew resistance in RE714: a QTL located on chromosome 2A, corresponding to the Pm4b gene, explaining 76-93% of the phenotypic variance for resistance to six isolates; two QTLs located on chromosomes 5D and 6A, each explaining 20-67% of the phenotypic variance for resistance to five isolates. A minor QTL for resistance to four of the six isolates revealing Pm4b was detected in the same region as the 5D QTL. Other minor QTLs were detected on chromosomes 2A and 6B, explaining, respectively, 10.9 and 11.5% of the phenotypic variance for resistance to isolate 96-27. The maps around the three major QTLs were enriched with microsatellite markers that could be used in marker-assisted selection of these QTLs. 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseedling diseases 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic resistance 3aseedlings 3astrain differences 3aBlumeria graminis f. sp. tritici 3apowdery mildew 3aTriticum aestivum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3alinkage (genetics) 3awinter wheat 3agenetic markers 0aErysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici 0amolecular sequence data 0astrains1 aPavoine, M.-T.1 aJaudeau, B.1 aRadek, W.1 aDoussinault, G.1 aBarloy, D.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2008, v. 59, no. 8 p.714-722dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR073783Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/13  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03446naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001700203245008200220300001600302520166900318650001301987650001202000650001702012650002202029650001602051650002302067650002802090650001902118650001902137650002602156650002502182650001502207650001102222650002002233650002302253650001502276650002002291650001902311651001402330651001602344700001702360700001702377700001802394700001802412700001902430700001702449700001402466700001502480773013702495852000902632856007502641930003302716945002502749946001102774990002302785655001202808IND4410860820221120120509.0081001s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441086082DNAL7 a10.1071/AR073712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCullen, B.R.10aSimulating pasture growth rates in Australian and New Zealand grazing systems  ap. 761-768.  aDairyMod, EcoMod, and the SGS Pasture Model are mechanistic biophysical models developed to explore scenarios in grazing systems. The aim of this manuscript was to test the ability of the models to simulate net herbage accumulation rates of ryegrass-based pastures across a range of environments and pasture management systems in Australia and New Zealand. Measured monthly net herbage accumulation rate and accumulated yield data were collated from ten grazing system experiments at eight sites ranging from cool temperate to subtropical environments. The local climate, soil, pasture species, and management (N fertiliser, irrigation, and grazing or cutting pattern) were described in the model for each site, and net herbage accumulation rates modelled. The model adequately simulated the monthly net herbage accumulation rates across the range of environments, based on the summary statistics and observed patterns of seasonal growth, particularly when the variability in measured herbage accumulation rates was taken into account. Agreement between modelled and observed growth rates was more accurate and precise in temperate than in subtropical environments, and in winter and summer than in autumn and spring. Similarly, agreement between predicted and observed accumulated yields was more accurate than monthly net herbage accumulation. Different temperature parameters were used to describe the growth of perennial ryegrass cultivars and annual ryegrass; these differences were in line with observed growth patterns and breeding objectives. Results are discussed in the context of the difficulties in measuring pasture growth rates and model limitations. 3apastures 3agrazing 3aplant growth 3asimulation models 3acrop models 3agrazing management 3adry matter accumulation 3aLolium perenne 3aforage grasses 3aenvironmental factors 3anitrogen fertilizers 3airrigation 3amowing 3aair temperature 3aseasonal variation 3asubtropics 3atemperate zones 3aplant breeding 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand1 aEckard, R.J.1 aCallow, M.N.1 aJohnson, I.R.1 aChapman, D.F.1 aRawnsley, R.P.1 aGarcia, S.C.1 aWhite, T.1 aSnow, V.O.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2008, v. 59, no. 8 p.761-768dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR073713Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/13  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02378naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002000154245011800174300001800292500001500310520087800325650001601203650001501219650002101234650001601255650001601271650002701287650002001314650001301334650002201347650001501369650001901384650001001403650002501413650002701438650001501465650001701480650001101497653001001508700001601518700001701534700002101551700001501572773010401587852000901691856007701700930003301777945002501810946001301835655001201848IND4362081420221120105940.0040414e20040407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436208142DNAL7 a10.1021/jf03459072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBollinger, D.W.12aA simple in vitro test tube method for estimating the bioavailability of phosphorus in feed ingredients for swine  ap. 1804-1809.  a2019-12-04  aA simplified in vitro test tube (TT) method was developed to estimate the percentage of available P in feed ingredients for swine. The entire digestion procedure with the TT method consists of three consecutive enzymatic digestions carried out in a 50-mL conical test tube: (1) Pre-digestion with endo-xylanase and beta-glucanase for 1 h, (2) peptic digestion for 2 h, and (3) pancreatic digestion for 2 or 4 h. The TT method is simpler and much easier to perform compared to the dialysis tubing (DT) method, because dialysis tubing is not used. Reducing sample size from 1.0 to 0.25 g for the TT method improved results. In conclusion, the accuracy and validity of the TT method is equal to that of our more complicated DT method (r = 0.97, P < 0.001), designed to mimic the digestive system of swine, for estimating the availability of P in plant-origin feed ingredients. 3afeed grains 3afeed meals 3anutrient content 3aphytic acid 3acolorimetry 3ain vitro digestibility 3abioavailability 3asoybeans 3achemical analysis 3apancreatin 3abeta-glucanase 3aswine 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aphosphorus 3asoybean meal 3apepsin 0afeeds1 aTsunoda, A.1 aLedoux, D.R.1 aEllersieck, M.R.1 aVeum, T.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2004 Apr. 7, v. 52, no. 7 p.1804-1809x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf03459073Available from publisher's Web site  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/07/14  aOther US 7aarticle03929naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245013600193300001600329520165700345650000902002650002002011650001302031650001202044650002002056650002502076650001902101650001502120650001602135650001902151650001502170650001402185650001102199650001302210650002402223650001302247650002202260650001802282650002302300650001502323650002202338650003202360650001102392650002602403650002902429650002702458650001402485650004502499650003102544650002402575650002402599650003302623650004202656650002002698650004102718651001002759651001002769653002102779653001702800653002402817653001702841700002202858700002402880773012902904852000903033856008503042930003303127946001103160655001203171IND4436321920221120094856.0100430e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443632192DNAL7 a198941272pmid7 a10.1007/s10653-009-9281-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiménez-Forcada, Elena 10aHydrogeochemical considerations about the origin of groundwater salinization in some coastal plains of Elba Island (Tuscany, Italy)  ap. 243-257.  aSeveral coastal plains of the Elba Island (Marina di Campo, Portoferraio, Schiopparello, Mola, Porto Azzurro and Barbarossa plains) in Tuscany (Italy) were studied to determine the causes of decline in groundwater quality, using major ion chemistry to establish the causes of groundwater salinization. The study demonstrates that salinization of coastal plain alluvial aquifers is not simply linked to seawater intrusion but is also intimately related to inflows from adjacent aquifers. Ionic ratios, correlation graphs and distribution value maps were employed as the means to understand the hydrochemistry of the study areas. The Mg/Cl ratio in particular can be considered a good tracer to distinguish the main salinization processes that control groundwater chemistry. Seawater intrusion only partly determines the chemistry of some groundwaters, which generally belong to a chloride facies where the salinity is derived principally from freshwater-seawater mixing and the participation of cation exchange. Proceeding inland groundwater quality seems to be principally determined by the inflow of Mg, Ca-HCO₃ or Ca, Na-HCO₃ waters formed from the weathering of silicate minerals in adjoining aquifers. Hydrolysis of these minerals is of prime importance in controlling groundwater chemistry in adjacent alluvial plains. The lateral recharge flows introduce water with a different chemical composition and this variable of freshwater recharge changes the hydrochemistry as a result of mixing between two or more waters types. This situation is further complicated when seawater and base exchange reactions participate, due to seawater intrusion. 3aMola 3aalluvial plains 3aaquifers 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3achemical composition 3acoastal plains 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ahydrochemistry 3ahydrolysis 3amagnesium 3amixing 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3aseawater 3asilicate minerals 3awater quality 3awater salinization 3aweathering 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aCalcium Carbonatexanalysis 2aCities 2aElectric Conductivity 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aGeography 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aIonsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMagnesiumxanalysis 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aSodium Bicarbonatexanalysis 2aSodium Chloridexanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aItaly 0aItaly 0aCoastal aquifers 0aSalinization 0aGroundwater quality 0aIonic ratios1 aBencini, Alberto 1 aPranzini, Giovanni 0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2010 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.243-257dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0269-40427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-009-9281-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02612naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001600179245011500195300001800310506007600328520122800404506003701632650000801669650001801677650002101695650002401716650001601740650002101756650002201777700002101799700001801820700002401838700002201862773008301884852000901967856007801976856005702054930003302111946001102144990002302155655001202178IND4385869420221207132455.0061210e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438586942DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkl6332doi7 aPMC16352792pmcid7 a170747472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zunyi10aArtificially expanded genetic information system: a new base pair with an alternative hydrogen bonding pattern  ap. 6095-6101.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo support efforts to develop a 'synthetic biology' based on an artificially expanded genetic information system (AEGIS), we have developed a route to two components of a non-standard nucleobase pair, the pyrimidine analog 6-amino-5-nitro-3-(1'-β-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone (dZ) and its Watson-Crick complement, the purine analog 2-amino-8-(1'-β-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4(8H)-one (dP). These implement the pyDDA:puAAD hydrogen bonding pattern (where 'py' indicates a pyrimidine analog and 'pu' indicates a purine analog, while A and D indicate the hydrogen bonding patterns of acceptor and donor groups presented to the complementary nucleobases, from the major to the minor groove). Also described is the synthesis of the triphosphates and protected phosphoramidites of these two nucleosides. We also describe the use of the protected phosphoramidites to synthesize DNA oligonucleotides containing these AEGIS components, verify the absence of epimerization of dZ in those oligonucleotides, and report some hybridization properties of the dZ:dP nucleobase pair, which is rather strong, and the ability of each to effectively discriminate against mismatches in short duplex DNA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3ahybridization 3ahydrogen bonding 3ainformation systems 3anucleosides 3aoligonucleotides 3asynthetic biology1 aHütter, Daniel.1 aSheng, Pinpin1 aSismour, A.

Here, we report on variations in the C3/C4 pattern of Inner Mongolian grassland derived from soil and vegetation. Soil samples from 149 sites covering an area of approximately 250 000 km² within Inner Mongolia, People's Republic of China were analyzed for the isotopic composition (δ¹³C) of soil organic carbon (SOC). The contrast in δ¹³C between C3 and C4 plants allowed for calculation of the C3/C4 ratio from δ¹³C of SOC with a two-member mixing model, which accounted for influences of aridity and altitude on δ¹³C of the C3 end-member and for changes in δ¹³C of atmospheric CO₂. Maps were created geostatistically, and showed a substantially lower C4 abundance in soil than in recent vegetation (-10%). The difference between soil and vegetation varied regionally and was most pronounced within an E-W belt along 44°N and in a mountainous area, suggesting a spread of C4 plants toward northern latitudes (about 1°) and higher altitudes. The areas of high C4 abundance for present vegetation and SOC were well delineated by the isotherms of crossover temperature based on the climatic conditions of the respective time periods. Our study indicates that change in the patterns of C3/C4 composition in the Inner Mongolia grassland was mainly triggered by increasing temperature, which overrode the antagonistic effect of rising CO₂ concentrations. 3agrasslands 3acarbon dioxide 3aC4 plants 3asoil organic carbon 3adry environmental conditions 3asoil 3aglobal warming 3alatitude 3asoil sampling 3aaltitude 3atemperature 3aclimatic factors 3astatistical models 3aChina 0acarbon isotope discrimination 0asemivariogram 0aSuess effect 0acrossover temperature 0aδ¹³C 0acarbon1 aAuerswald, Karl.1 aBai, Yongfei.1 aSCHÄUFELE, RUDI1 aSchnyder, Hans.0 tGlobal change biology.g2010 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.605-616dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02033.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100112b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02556naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245012000166300001600286520142000302650003401722653002501756653002201781653001101803653001601814653002301830653001601853653003301869700001301902700001701915700001301932773010401945852000902049856009202058930003302150946001102183655001202194IND4432617520221120065418.0100213e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443261752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.01027.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chao10aProstaglandin E₂ Promotes Nav1.8 Trafficking via Its Intracellular RRR Motif Through the Protein Kinase A Pathway  ap. 405-417.  aVoltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) are essential for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Nav1.8 activity is regulated by prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂). There is, however, no direct evidence showing the regulated trafficking of Nav1.8, and the molecular and cellular mechanism of PGE₂-induced sodium channel trafficking is not clear. Here, we report that PGE₂ regulates the trafficking of Nav1.8 through the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, and an RRR motif in the first intracellular loop of Nav1.8 mediates this effect. In rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, prolonged PGE₂ treatment enhanced Nav1.8 currents by increasing the channel density on the cell surface. Activation of PKA by forskolin had the same effect on DRG neurons and human embryonic kidney 293T cells expressing Nav1.8. Inhibition of PKA completely blocked the PGE₂-promoted effect on Nav1.8. Mutation of five PKA phosphorylation sites or the RRR motif in the first intracellular loop of Nav1.8 abolished the PKA-promoted Nav1.8 surface expression. Furthermore, a membrane-tethered peptide containing the intracellular RRR motif disrupted the PGE₂-induced promotion of the Nav1.8 current in DRG neurons. Our data indicate that PGE₂ promotes the surface expression of Nav1.8 via an intracellular RRR motif, and provide a novel mechanism for functional modulation of Nav1.8 by hyperalgesic agents. 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 0adorsal root ganglion 0ainflammatory pain 0aNav1.8 0apatch clamp 0aprostaglandin E₂ 0atrafficking 0avoltage-gated sodium channel1 aLi, Qian1 aSu, Yuanyuan1 aBao, Lan0 tTraffic.g2010 Mar., v. 11, no. 3 p.405-417dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1398-92197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2009.01027.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100213b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03847naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001400161245014300175300001600318500002400334520147400358650001901832650003101851650001201882650001301894650002901907650001401936650002401950650002001974650001701994650000902011650001902020650001202039650001302051650001402064650000902078650001602087650002102103650001602124650003602140650002602176650003902202650005002241650001202291650002402303650003802327650001402365650003902379650000902418650003102427650003902458650005602497650000902553650000902562650002402571650002102595650004302616650002902659650003402688650003102722650002202753650005302775700002102828700002102849700002202870700002002892773011102912852000903023856004503032655001203077IND4448964920221120053953.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444896492DNAL7 a208276752pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2010001762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Min10ac9t11-Conjugated linoleic acid-rich oil fails to attenuate wasting in colon-26 tumor-induced late-stage cancer cachexia in male CD2F1 mice  ap. 268-277.  aIncludes references  aScope: Cancer cachexia is characterized by muscle and adipose tissue wasting caused partly by chronic, systemic inflammation. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) are a group of fatty acids with various properties including anti-inflammatory cis9, trans11 (c9t11)-CLA and lipid-mobilizing trans10, cis12 (t10c12)-CLA. The purpose of this study was to test whether dietary supplementation of a c9t11-CLA-rich oil (6:1 c9t11:t10c12) could attenuate wasting of muscle and adipose tissue in colon-26 adenocarcinoma-induced cachexia in mice. Methods and results: Loss of body weight, muscle and adipose tissue mass caused by tumors were not rescued by supplementation with the c9t11-CLA-rich oil. In quadriceps muscle, c9t11-CLA-rich oil exacerbated tumor-induced gene expression of inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6 receptor and the E3 ligase MuRF-1 involved in muscle proteolysis. In epididymal adipose tissue, tumor-driven delipidation and atrophy was aggravated by the c9,t11-CLA-rich oil, demonstrated by further reduced adipocyte size and lower adiponectin expression. However, expression of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage markers were not altered by tumors, or CLA supplementation. Conclusion: These data suggest that addition of c9t11-CLA-rich oil (0.6% c9t11, 0.1% t10c12) in diet did not ameliorate wasting in mice with cancer cachexia. Instead, it increased expression of inflammatory markers in the muscle and increased adipose delipidation. 3aadipose tissue 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aatrophy 3acachexia 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3acytokines 3adietary supplements 3agene expression 3ainflammation 3amice 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aoils 3aproteolysis 3awasting syndrome 3aweight loss 2aAdenocarcinomaxphysiopathology 2aAdipocytesxpathology 2aAdiponectinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAdipose Tissue, Whitexmetabolismxpathology. 2aAnimals 2aAtrophyxmetabolism 2aCachexiaxdiet therapyxetiology. 2aCell Size 2aColonic Neoplasmsxphysiopathology 2aDiet 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aInflammation Mediatorsxmetabolism 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred DBA 2aMuscle Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aNeoplasm Transplantation 2aQuadriceps Musclexmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligasesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aKliewer, Kara L.1 aAsp, Michelle L.1 aStout, Michael B.1 aBelury, Martha.0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2011 Feb., v. 55, no. 2 p.268-277dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.201000176 7aarticle02998naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152072001700169072001700186100001800203245013100221300001600352500011000368520137400478650001201852650002401864650001901888650002401907650002001931650002001951650002301971650001701994650002002011650003002031650002002061651001402081653003102095700001702126700001702143700001802160773013802178852000902316856007502325930003302400945002502433946001102458990002302469655001202492IND4410855920221120053923.0081001s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441085592DNAL7 a10.1071/AR062002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Jarraud.  aSeasonal climate forecasts (SCFs) from public institutions have been issued to Australian farmers since the late 1980s. Surveys suggest that 30?50% of farmers take seasonal climate forecasts into account when making farm management decisions. Even for the farmers who have adopted SCFs, integrating them into decisions on the farm seems to be a greater challenge than first thought. We use adoption theory to consider SCFs as an innovation presented to farmers. We consider the problem that SCFs is seeking to solve, the nature of the innovation, and how SCFs compare with other innovations that Australian farmers are encouraged to adopt. We conclude that there are unique challenges presented by the problem of managing climate uncertainty. Demonstrating the relative advantage of a probabilistic SCF is difficult because it is an information-based public good, relatively complex, difficult to trial, and only partially compatible with existing practices. In their favour, SCFs are free or relatively low cost and the information can be applied across different paddocks and different enterprises. We compare and contrast SCFs with other innovations that Australian farmers have been encouraged to adopt over their working life time, such as grain-price forecasts, new wheat varieties, the increased use of nitrogen fertiliser, no-tillage, and precision agriculture. 3afarmers 3ainnovation adoption 3aclimate models 3aweather forecasting 3afarm management 3adecision making 3afarmers' attitudes 3afarm surveys 3arisk management 3ainformation dissemination 3aeconomic impact 3aAustralia 0aseasonal climate forecasts1 aCrean, Jason1 aMullen, John1 aParton, Kevin0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2007, v. 58, no. 10 p.975-984dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR062003Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02682naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002300155245008300178300001600261500002400277520103200301650002901333650001101362650002001373650001001393650003001403650000901433650001401442650001401456650001301470650001101483650001801494650003801512650003901550650003001589650004201619650004101661650002801702650003801730650003001768650006201798650002701860650003501887700002201922700001901944700002001963700002001983773008902003852000902092856003902101655001202140IND4394664120221120042703.0070902e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439466412DNAL7 a175974902pmid7 a10.1002/yea.15112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirisola, Mario G.10aYeast vectors for the integration/expression of any sequence at the TYR1 locus  ap. 761-766.  aIncludes references  aWe have constructed new yeast vectors for targeted integration and conditional expression of any sequence at the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TYR1 locus which becomes disrupted. We show that vector integration is not neutral, causing prototrophy for tyrosine and auxotrophy for the vector's selectable marker (uracil or leucine, depending on the vector used). This feature allows a double screening of transformed yeast cells, improving the identification of colonies with the desired chromosomal structure. The GAL10 gene promoter has been added to drive conditional expression of cloned sequences. Using these vectors, chromosomal structure verification of recombinant clones is no longer necessary, since the noise of non-homologous recombination, as well as spontaneous reversion of the selected phenotype, can easily be identified. The ability of the vector to conditionally control gene expression has been confirmed using the gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter.

Isolates were initially characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). One hundred were chosen for MLST genotyping. PFGE identified 69 distinct types compared to 44 different sequence types (STs) identified with MLST. Eighteen STs had not been described previously, while the remaining 26 STs were assigned to previously known clonal complexes. The majority of isolates were of genotypes noted in broilers and in humans in earlier studies. However, three clonal complexes, ST-206 complex, ST-677 complex and ST-1034 complex, previously associated with wild bird and environmental samples, were among the genotypes found. This study shows that most of the Swedish broiler isolates were of genotypes noted as common in broilers. However, it also highlights the potential influence of environmental sources on the broiler C. jejuni genotypes. 3aclonal variation 3apoultry production 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3astrains 3abroiler chickens 3apathotypes 3aepidemiological studies 3asequence analysis 3apathogen identification 3adisease surveillance 3azoonoses 3acampylobacteriosis 3adisease prevalence 3apoultry diseases 3adisease transmission 3aenvironmental factors 3afood pathogens 3anucleotide sequences 3adigestive system diseases 3aCampylobacter jejuni 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aCampylobacter jejunixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aChickens 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aPhylogeny 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 3aSweden 0aSwedenxepidemiology. 0amolecular sequence data 0agenotype 0amultilocus sequence typing 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0agenetic variation1 aEngvall, Eva Olsson1 aOlsen, Bjørn.1 aWaldenström, Jonas0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2010 Jan. 6, v. 140, no. 1-2 p.180-185dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.07.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20100107b20100205c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/12/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02811naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001400169245015200183300001800335520123300353650002201586650001001608650002301618650002701641650001801668650002301686650002301709650002301732650002001755650001401775650002801789650001901817650002101836650001501857650001401872650002201886651001401908653002101922700001501943700001901958773014001977852000902117856007502126930003302201945002502234946001102259990002302270655001202293IND4410857420221120031326.0081001s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441085742DNAL7 a10.1071/AR070022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSingh, D.10aCharacterisation of wheat leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 in Australian wheats using components of resistance and the linked molecular marker csLV34  ap. 1106-1114.  aA significant proportion of Australian wheat cultivars do not support leaf rust infections over winter and early spring periods despite available inoculum. To investigate why this occurs, tests of the leaf rust responses of 84 cultivars were conducted over 2 years in early (autumn) sown rust nurseries. More than 50% of the cultivars showed evidence of slow rusting and produced low to moderate area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) values. Many of the slow rusting cultivars showed features including leaf tip necrosis (LTN), long incubation period (IP) and longer latent period (LP), all characteristically associated with gene Lr34. The molecular marker csLV34, which is closely linked to Lr34, was applied to these wheats and confirmed the presence of Lr34 in all. Application of this marker identified Lr34 in a further 10 cultivars that could not be assessed for slow rusting because of the presence of seedling resistance genes effective against pathotypes used in field nurseries. It was concluded that a major role of Lr34 resides in reducing initial rust increase, thereby minimising inoculum development through winter and early spring, and subsequently delaying the onset of epidemics and lowering yield losses. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3aPuccinia recondita 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arust diseases 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic markers 3acultivars 3aplant genetic resources 3adisease course 3adisease severity 3apathotypes 3aseedlings 3adisease outbreaks 3aAustralia 0aresistance genes1 aPark, R.F.1 aMcIntosh, R.A.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2007, v. 58, no. 11 p.1106-1114dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR070023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03152naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001300179245010200192300001800294506007600312520174700388506003702135650002102172650001302193650002302206650001002229650001802239650001902257650003002276650001802306650001402324650001902338700001202357700001702369700002402386700001302410773008302423852000902506856007802515856005702593930003302650946001102683655001202694IND4385174120221207134541.0061112e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438517412DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkl7152doi7 aPMC16364932pmcid7 a170383322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Yu10aRational design and rapid screening of antisense oligonucleotides for prokaryotic gene modulation  ap. 5660-5669.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAntisense oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) are widely used for functional studies of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes. However, the identification of effective target sites is a major issue in antisense applications. Here, we study a number of thermodynamic and structural parameters that may affect the potency of antisense inhibition. We develop a cell-free assay for rapid oligo screening. This assay is used for measuring the expression of Escherichia coli lacZ, the antisense target for experimental testing and validation. Based on a training set of 18 oligos, we found that structural accessibility predicted by local folding of the target mRNA is the most important predictor for antisense activity. This finding was further confirmed by a direct validation study. In this study, a set of 10 oligos was designed to target accessible sites, and another set of 10 oligos was selected to target inaccessible sites. Seven of the 10 oligos for accessible sites were found to be effective (>50% inhibition), but none of the oligos for inaccessible sites was effective. The difference in the antisense activity between the two sets of oligos was statistically significant. We also found that the predictability of antisense activity by target accessibility was greatly improved for oligos targeted to the regions upstream of the end of the active domain for β-galactosidase, the protein encoded by lacZ. The combination of the structure-based antisense design and extension of the lacZ assay to include gene fusions will be applicable to high-throughput gene functional screening, and to the identification of new drug targets in pathogenic microbes.

Although the production and preservation of the carrot juice technology have not been improved and are not prevalent, an intensive study has been carried out on this subject recently. In this study, the effects on the yield and quality of carrot juice produced with and without total enzymatic liquefaction (Pectinex Ultra SP-L, Novo Nordisk Ferment, Dittingen, Switzerland) as well as lactofermentation or citric acid addition have been investigated. Generally, enzymatic liquefaction of mash increased the juice yield (89.32 ± 1.17 and 90.43 ± 0.47% for lactofermented and citric-acid-added samples, respectively), while the control sample juice yield was found to be 59.90 ± 0.81%. Lactofermented and acid-added samples demonstrated lower pH value. In enzyme-treated samples, the total acidity increments were also determined. Accordingly, galacturonic acid formed after enzymatic breakdown of pectin in the raw material increased the total acidity of the samples. Magnesium contents of lactofermented juices were found to be low because lactic acid bacteria require magnesium for their growth. β-Carotene contents have been found to be higher in both lactofermented and in nonenzyme-treated samples. This article describes the effects of different processing methods on the characteristics of carrot juice. It is difficult to preserve vegetable juices such as carrot juice because of their low acidity. The acidity of carrot juice (pH ~6.2) can be adjusted by the addition of citric acid or the lactofermentation method to pH 4.5. With these processes carrot juice can be preserved by pasteurization as occurs for low pH fruit juices, increasing shelf life. According to the results of this study, increasing the acidity of mash with lactofermentation or citric acid addition also increases the juice yield. 3aacidity 3acarrot juice 3acitric acid 3afruit juices 3agalacturonic acid 3ajuice quality 3alactic acid bacteria 3amagnesium 3amash 3apH 3apasteurization 3apectins 3araw materials 3ashelf life 3aSwitzerland1 aBahceci, K.

The RusA enzyme cleaves HJs, the fourway DNA branchpoints formed by homologous recombination, by introducing symmetrical cuts in the phosphodiester backbone in a Mg²⁺ dependent reaction. Although, RusA shows a high level of selectivity for DNA junctions, preferring to bind fourway junctions over other substrates in vitro, it has also been shown to have appreciable affinity for duplex DNA. However, RusA does not show DNA cleavage activity with duplex substrates. Our structure suggests the possible basis for structural selectivity as well as sources of the sequence specificity observed for DNA cleavage by RusA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aEscherichia coli 3ahomologous recombination 3amagnesium1 aSedelnikova, Svetlana1 aBaker, Patrick J.1 aBolt, Edward L.1 aLloyd, Robert G.1 aRafferty, John B.0 tNucleic acids research.g2006 Nov., v. 34, no. 19 p.5577-5584x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkl4473Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nar.oupjournals.org/3electronic resource  a20061112b20061202c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01918naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245014000166300001600306520078900322650002201111650001201133650001401145650001901159650002701178650000901205650001001214650001101224650002301235651001101258700002001269773012701289852000901416856008501425930003301510946001301543655001201556IND4422171220221120031240.0090619e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442217122DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954090601182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvankova, E.

A total of 12 loci were tested, and eight of these were shown to be polymorphic. The greatest contribution to the samples differentiation was made by the EST-D1* and sIDHP-2* loci. Most of the allele diversity was distributed among the individuals within the samples. The among-sample differences within races were statistically significant and accounted for slightly more than 7% of total variation. The differences between the races constituted 0.1% and were statistically nonsignificant. Genetic similarity of seasonal races within single locality allowed suggestion on their secondary formation after settling of founder population into a certain region. 3aOncorhynchus keta 3aalleles 3aallozymes 3afounder effect 3ageographical variation 3aloci 3araces 3arivers 3atemporal variation 3aRussia1 aEfremov, V.

Three doubled haploid barley populations, Alexis/Sloop, WI2875-1/Alexis, and Arapiles/Franklin, were used to identify genes conferring adult plant resistance to NFNB in field trials. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identified were specific for adult plant resistance because seedlings of the parental lines were susceptible to the NFNB isolates used in this study. QTLs were identified on chromosomes 2H, 3H, 4H, and 7H in both the Alexis/Sloop and WI2875-1/Alexis populations and on chromosomes 1H, 2H, and 7H in the Arapiles/Franklin population. Using QTLNetwork, epistatic interactions were identified between loci on chromosomes 3H and 6H in the Alexis/Sloop population, between 2H and 4H in the WI2875-1/Alexis population, and between 5H and 7H in the Arapiles/Franklin population. Comparisons with earlier studies of NFNB resistance indicate the pathotype-dependent nature of many resistance QTLs and the importance of establishing an international system of pathotype nomenclature and differential testing. 3agermplasm 3aquantitative trait loci 3aPyrenophora teres 3abarley 3agenetic resistance 3aloci 3aHordeum vulgare 3afungal diseases of plants 3aepistasis 3achromosome mapping 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3adoubled haploids 3apathotypes 3aAustralia 0achromosomes1 aPlatz, G.J.1 aMace, E.1 aPoulsen, D.1 aSutherland, M.W.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2007, v. 58, no. 12 p.1191-1197dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR071413Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02315naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245008700160300001600247520110400263650001201367650002301379650001601402650001601418650001101434650001001445650001001455650001901465650001801484650001501502650001001517650001201527650001101539650003501550650002501585700001601610773012701626852000901753856008501762930003301847946001301880655001201893IND4422171420221120030210.0090619e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442217142DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954090601312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulig, H. 10aAssociation between leptin gene polymorphisms and growth traits in Limousin cattle  ap. 738-741.  aA total of 129 Limousin calves were used to investigate how leptin gene polymorphisms affect growth traits, such as body weight, average daily gain, wither height, sacrum height and chest girth in beef cattle. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, including the Sau3AI polymorphism in intron 2 and the A59V polymorphism in exon 3. The genotype and allele frequencies for each SNP and the haplotype frequencies for both SNPs were estimated in the studied herd. Statistical analysis revealed that the A59V polymorphism significantly affected the body weight at 210 days of age (P <= 0.01) and the average daily gain between 3 and 210 days of age (P <= 0.05) with T as a desirable allele. No associations were observed between the Sau3AI polymorphism and the growth traits mentioned above. However, the average daily gain between 3 and 210 days of age was significantly higher in the CT/CT haplotype animals compared with the CC/CC and CC/CT individuals. These results indicated that selection for the A59V TT animals might contribute to an improved body weight in Limousin cattle. 3aalleles 3aaverage daily gain 3abeef cattle 3abody weight 3acalves 3achest 3aexons 3agene frequency 3agrowth traits 3ahaplotypes 3aherds 3aintrons 3aleptin 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astatistical analysis1 aKmieć, M. 0 tRussian journal of genetics.g2009 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.738-741dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1022-79547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10227954090601313Available from publisher's Web site  a20090619b20090703c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01656naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245007600159300001600235520081200251653001701063653002001080653002301100700002001123773009701143852000901240856008501249930003301334946001101367655001201378IND4422171920221117181317.0090619e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442217192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11249-009-9437-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Nan 10aTemperature Effect on a HDD Slider's Flying Performance at Steady State  ap. 105-112.  aThe temperature inside modern hard disk drives (HDDs) can become as high as 100°C during operation. The effects of such high temperatures on the slider's flying attitude and the shear forces on the slider and the disk are investigated in this paper. General formulae for the shear forces are derived, and the generalized Reynolds equation is modified to take into account the temperature effect on the mean free path of air as well as the air viscosity. Numerical results are obtained for two different air bearing surface designs. It is shown that the temperature changes result in non-negligible changes in the slider's flying height and the shear forces. These changes could further induce changes in the deformation and instability of the lubricant layer and thereby affect the reliability of the HDDs. 0aAir bearings 0aHDD reliability 0aTemperature effect1 aBogy, David B. 0 tTribology letters.g2009 Aug., v. 35, no. 2 p.105-112dBoston : Springer USx1023-88837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11249-009-9437-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20090619b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04227naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072001700135072001700152100001700169245015100186300001800337500001500355520268800370650002103058650002803079650002103107650001003128650001803138650001903156650001003175650001903185650001203204650001603216650002103232650002403253650001803277650002403295650001703319653002403336653000903360653001103369700001303380773014003393852000903533856007503542930003303617945002503650946001103675990002303686655001203709IND4410858620221122153812.0081001s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441085862DNAL7 a10.1071/AR071872doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCharmley, E.10aUsing plant wax markers to estimate diet composition and intakes of mixed forages in sheep by feeding a known amount of alkane-labelled supplement  ap. 1215-1225.  a2019-12-05  aThe feeding of known amounts of supplements to grazing animals can be accomplished relatively easily. If the supplement and the other diet components have distinctive profiles of cuticular wax n-alkanes, then the supplement intake and the alkane profiles of the supplement, other dietary components and faeces can be used to estimate the proportions and hence intakes of several forages by the grazing animal. However, this method requires knowledge of recoveries of n-alkanes in faeces. Twenty four wethers were fed one of four diets comprising equal combinations of 1, 2, 3 or 4 forages. Forages used were subterranean clover, phalaris, annual ryegrass and wheat straw. Forages were chopped using a chaff cutter and fed with solvent-extracted cottonseed meal (CSM) labelled with beeswax and synthetic C28 alkane to provide a characteristic alkane profile. Faecal grab samples were taken from sheep from 14 to 23 days after administration of an intra-ruminal controlled-release device (CRD) containing 1 g of each of C32 and C36 alkane. Total faeces were collected from half the sheep on each treatment in order to measure alkane recoveries in individual sheep. Faecal concentrations of the n-alkanes C25 to C31 and C33 were corrected for recovery using the individual sheep value, the treatment mean or the grand mean for all four treatments. Dietary compositions were then estimated from corrected faecal concentrations of n-alkanes using a least-squares procedure and, together with the known supplement intakes, were used to estimate the intakes of all other diet components. Estimates from this ?labelled supplement' method were compared with the amounts fed or those estimated using the alkanes derived from the CRD. The labelled supplement method accurately and precisely estimated dietary component proportions and intake for all treatments when measured recoveries for individual sheep were used. Precision declined when recovery was based on estimated recoveries for treatment means or the grand mean. Estimates of intake based on dietary C33 and the measured release rates of C32 or C36 alkanes from the CRD did not differ from measured intakes. Estimates based on the C32 : C31 alkane pair over-estimated intake. Estimates of whole-diet digestibility based on the various ways of estimating intake were all very close to the digestibilities calculated from directly-measured intakes and faecal outputs. It is concluded that the feeding of a known amount of supplement can be successfully used to estimate dietary proportions and hence intakes of diet components, in mixed diets with up to five ingredients, but this approach requires estimates of faecal alkane recovery. 3aepicuticular wax 3ainterspecific variation 3afeed supplements 3asheep 3asheep feeding 3aforage legumes 3afeces 3aforage grasses 3aalkanes 3afeed intake 3afeed composition 3areference standards 3adigestibility 3afeeding preferences 3afeed rations 0aspecies differences 0adiet 0aforage1 aDove, H.0 tAustralian journal of agricultural research.g2007, v. 58, no. 12 p.1215-1225dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0004-94097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR071873Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03137naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002900157245011100186300001600297500002400313520143200337650002201769650001101791650001201802650001901814650001601833650001601849650001101865650002101876650001001897650003001907650003001937650002301967650002401990650002102014650006302035650002802098650006502126650006502191650005902256650002402315650002002339650006002359700001902419773010602438852000902544856007802553655001202631IND4455989820221122122147.0110408e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445598982DNAL7 a214215702pmid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcr0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMwakaboko, Alinanuswe S.10aStrigolactone Analogs Derived from Ketones Using a Working Model for Germination Stimulants as a Blueprint  ap. 699-715.  aIncludes references  aStrigolactones are important signaling compounds in the plant kingdom. Here we focus on their germination stimulatory effect on seeds of the parasitic weeds Striga and Orobanche spp. and more particularly on the design and synthesis of new active strigolactone analogs derived from simple cyclic ketones. New analogs derived from 1-indanone, 1-tetralone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone and a series of substituted cyclohexanones (including carvone and pulegone) are prepared by formylation of the ketones with ethyl formate followed by coupling with a halo butenolide. Both enantiomers of the analog derived from 1-tetralone have been prepared by employing a homochiral synthon for the coupling reaction. For three other strigolactone analogs the antipodes have been obtained by chromatography on a chiral column. All analogs have an appreciable germinating activity towards seeds of Striga hermomonthica and Orobanche crenata and O. cernua. Stereoisomers having the same configuration at the D-ring as in naturally occurring strigol have a higher stimulatory effect than the corresponding antipodes. The analogs obtained from 1-indanone and 1-tetralone have an activity comparable with that of the well known stimulant GR 24. Analogs derived from 2-phenyl-cylohexanone, carvone and pulegone also have a good germinating response. The results show that the working model for designing new bioactive strigolactones is applicable. 3aOrobanche crenata 3aStriga 3acarvone 3achromatography 3aenantiomers 3agermination 3amodels 3aparasitic plants 3aseeds 2aBiological Assayxmethods 2aGerminationxdrug effects 2aKetonesxchemistry 2aLactonesxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aOrobanchexdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Growth Regulators 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Weedsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aStereoisomerism 2aStrigaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aZwanenburg, B.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2011 Apr., v. 52, no. 4 p.699-715dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcr0313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02567naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002600154245009400180300001600274500015600290520113600446650002501582650001801607650001001625650001101635650001101646650001301657650001201670650001301682650002001695650000701715650001001722650002301732650001301755650002501768651001101793700001801804700002101822700001901843700001801862700002001880773014501900856005502045852000902100655001202109IND60588327520180323000000.0180112e20170731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058832752DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1170.482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, T.

The hybrid Ivete from Sakata Seeds® was cultivated in 16×12×2.2 m3, 40% red shading screenhouse and open field conditions for comparison. The experiment was conducted from May 21st to November 1st, 2014, in Goiânia, Brazil. Nutritional analyses were performed: physicochemical properties (fresh weight, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), flavour index (TSS/TA), pH, hardness and colour); and nutritional qualities (vitamin C and lycopene) in harvests of fruits made 98 and 129 days after transplanting, from the 2nd and 5th bunches. All the measures were carried out by official methods. The results were analyzed by an ANOVA for repeated measures and the averages compared by the Tukey test (p‹0.05). The results provide useful data for detecting differences among environment variation in tomato composition and cropping methods on the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of tomato fruits. 3aanalysis of variance 3aascorbic acid 3acolor 3aflavor 3afruits 3ahardness 3ahybrids 3alycopene 3anutritive value 3apH 3ashade 3atitratable acidity 3atomatoes 3atotal soluble solids 3aBrazil1 aSantos, T.

The yield performance has been evaluated by using the tomato plant growth TOMGRO model. This model predicts the number and dry mass of leaves, stem segments and fruits, as well as the increase in leaf area as new organs are initiated, age, and senesce or are picked. The model uses a source-sink approach for partitioning carbohydrate into growth of different organs. TOMGRO was applied to simulate tomato production under two different photovoltaic greenhouse types: Venlo and Asymmetric. In each greenhouse, the plant density varied from low density (1.5 plants m-2) to high density (5 plants m-2). On the basis of these simulations, it has been observed that the decreased crop yields caused by shading may reach 70% under the asymmetric greenhouse with a planting density of 5 plants m-2 and 58% under Venlo greenhouse with a planting density of 1.5 plants m-2. 3acarbohydrates 3acrop yield 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amodels 3aplant density 3aplant growth 3ashade 3asolar collectors 3atomatoes1 aFatnassi, H.1 aVercambre, G.1 aPoncet, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 July 31, , no. 1170 p.425-432dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1170.52  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147100001700156245010300173300001600276500002400292500001500316520091500331650001501246650001401261650001601275650001101291650001201302650001301314650001101327650002301338650002301361650001301384651002101397653002401418653001501442700001201457700001401469773007801483852000901561856008701570930003301657945002501690946001101715655001201726IND4428861120221122032153.0091118s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442886112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2008.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aLlorens, Ll.10aReproductive biology of Launaea cervicornis: A keystone species of the Balearic coastal shrublands  ap. 456-462.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLaunaea cervicornis (Boiss.) Font Quer & Rothmaler, an endemic of the islands of Majorca and Minorca (Balearic Islands), is a keystone species of the cushion-like plant communities of the coastal rocky places. The study of its reproductive biology shows the existence of differential strategies, with reference to other species of the genus. The principal features are: (1) the absence of continuous iteroparity; (2) short average duration of the flowering period (36.8 days); (3) high value of intrapopulational flowering overlap index (0.86); (4) high levels of aptitude to produce fruits having atelechory as preferential mechanism of dispersion; and (5) germination capacity is increased during the autumn of the first year (fruits are not capable of joining the seedbank of the soil). These characteristics are considered to be determinants for its adaptation to the peculiar habitat in which it prospers. 3ashrublands 3aflowering 3agermination 3aautumn 3aLaunaea 3aduration 3acoasts 3aindigenous species 3aplant reproduction 3afruiting 3aBalearic Islands 0aLaunaea cervicornis 0aadaptation1 aGil, L.1 aBoira, H.0 tFlora.g2009, v. 204, no. 6 p.456-462dG.

A cross-sectional survey using a snowball sampling technique. Data on food habits and eating patterns were obtained using semi-structured, face-to-face interviews from November 2001 to April 2002. A total of 139 households of demographically diverse recent migrants from across sub-Saharan Africa. Melbourne metropolitan and Melbourne fringes. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics. SSA migrants and refugees indicated dietary acculturation characterised by three processes: substitution, supplementation and modification of recipes. They experienced difficulty locating their traditional foods, in particular, African vegetables (34.2%), unprocessed maize meal (29.1%), camel milk (23.1%) and maize grain (13.7%). The new foods adopted since arrival were pizza, breakfast cereals and fast foods, but also included new fruits and vegetables. Takeaway food such as Pizza Hut or McDonalds featured prominently in the SSA post-migration diet. Reasons for eating out were favourite food (48.3%), routine family outing (38.3%), special occasion (33.3%) and no time to cook (25%). A significant change in meal pattern was the inclusion of breakfast, although 21% reported skipping breakfast. Many of the observed dietary changes were not consistent with good health and may predispose this population to rapid weight gain and chronic disease. Rapid modernisation and the Anglo-Australian culture interact in a complex way with traditional eating and socialisation practices of SSA migrants. Understanding these forces can allow effective health promotion and community development strategies to be developed for the future health of SSA migrants and their communities. 3aAfricans 3aacculturation 3abreakfast 3abreakfast cereals 3acamel milk 3achronic diseases 3acommunity health 3acorn 3acorn meal 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3aeating out 3afruits 3ahouseholds 3aingestion 3ainterviews 3amodernization 3apizza 3arecipes 3astatistics 3asurveys 3atakeout foods 3atraditional foods 3avegetables 3aweight gain1 aBURNS, Cate0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2006 June, v. 63, no. 2 p.91-102dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1446-63687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2006.00055.x 7aarticle02547naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001800142245008800160300001800248520144100266650001501707650001301722650001701735650002001752650001901772650001501791650001301806650001101819650001101830700002201841700001901863700003001882700002001912773009401932852000902026856008202035930003302117946001102150655001202161IND4422193920221121224341.0090619e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442219392DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2008006882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNehmé, Reine10aInfluence of polyelectrolyte capillary coating conditions on protein analysis in CE  ap. 1888-1898.  aCE of biomolecules is limited by analyte adsorption on the capillary wall. To prevent this, monolayer or successive multiple ionic-polymer layers (SMILs) of highly charged polyelectrolytes can be physically adsorbed on the inner capillary surface. Although these coatings have become commonly used in CE, no systematic investigation of their performance under different coating conditions has been carried out so far. In a previous study (Nehmé, R., Perrin, C., Cottet, H., Blanchin, M. D., Fabre, H., Electrophoresis 2008, 29, 3013-3023), we investigated the influence of different experimental parameters on coating stability, repeatability and peptide peak efficiency. Optimal coating conditions for monolayer and multilayer (SMILs) poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride/ poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) coated capillaries were determined. In this study, the influence of polyelectrolyte concentration and ionic strength of the coating solutions, and the number of coating layers on coating stability and performance in limiting protein adsorption was carried out. EOF magnitude and repeatability were used to monitor coating stability. Coating ability to limit protein adsorption was investigated by monitoring variations of migration times, time-corrected peak areas and separation efficiency of test proteins. The separation performance of polyelectrolyte coatings were compared with those obtained with bare silica capillaries. 3aadsorption 3acoatings 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrophoresis 3aionic strength 3amonitoring 3aproteins 3asilica 3asodium1 aPerrin, Catherine1 aCottet, Hervé1 aBlanchin, Marie-Dominique1 aFabre, Huguette0 tElectrophoresis.g2009 June, v. 30, no. 11 p.1888-1898dWiley-VCH Verlagx0173-08357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2008006883Available from publisher's Web site  a20090619b20090703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02103naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006400126300001600190520101200206650001501218650001301233650002601246650002001272650002001292650002501312650002301337650002401360650002201384650001501406650002701421650001801448650002001466650002401486653002201510700002001532773007501552852000901627930003301636945001301669946001101682655001201693IND2204647520221118224610.0000518e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220464752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, R.K.10aCarbofuran-induced biochemical changes in Clarias batrachus  ap. 285-290.  aThe effect of carbofuran, an organo-carbamate pesticide, upon the level of protein as well as the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.28, LDH) was studied by exposing the teleost fish, Clarias batrachus, to different subacute concentrations (0.01 and 0.02 mg litre-1) for 96 h and 15 days. The results showed a drastic decrease in the protein content in different body organs of the fish. The pesticide also caused a significant decrease in the level of activity of LDH in different body tissues of the fish, the effect being more pronounced in the gills, muscle, brain and liver than in kidney and heart. The decrease in protein content and the activity of LDH in fish tissues was more marked at the higher concentration of the pesticide for the longer duration of treatment. The results suggested that carbofuran has an effect at very low concentration (compared to its LC50 value) possibly at the level of protein metabolism, and also inhibits the activity of LDH, the terminal glycolytic enzyme. 3acarbofuran 3atoxicity 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3aprotein content 3aspatial distribution 3aprotein metabolism 3anontarget organisms 3aClarias batrachus 3atoxicology 3aenvironmental exposure 3aanimal organs 3aadverse effects 3atissue distribution 0anontarget effects1 aSharma, Binaya.0 tPesticide science.g1998 Aug., v. 53, no. 4 p.285-290x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02076naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013300127300001800260500001500278520117200293650001501465650002201480650001501502650001501517650002901532650001501561653001201576700002101588773009801609852000901707939003301716946001301749655001201762IND9004659820221118224351.0900921e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900465982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunter, W.J.10aEnhanced nodulation and nitrogen fixation by a revertant of a nodulation-defective Bradyrhizobium japonicum tryptophan auxotroph  ap. 2399-2403.  a2019-12-04  aIn greenhouse studies, the symbiotic properties of a prototrophic revertant (Ta11 NOD+) of a nodulation defective tryptophan auxotroph of Bradyrhizobium japonicum were compared with those of the normally nodulating wild-type strain, B. japonicum I-110 ARS. Strain I-110 ARS was the parent of auxotrophic mutant Ta11. Plants inoculated with TA11 NOD+ contained significantly more nitrogen per plant than did plants inoculated with wild-type bacteria (275.9 +/- 35 versus 184 +/- 18 mg). Also, plants that received the revertant were larger, averaging 8.4 +/- 0.9 g (dry weight) versus 6.4 +/- 0.6 g for those that received the wild-type bacterial strain. Additionally, plants that received the NOD+ strain had 56% more nodules and 41% more nodule mass than did control plants. With both inocula, average nodule size and amount of nitrogen fixed per gram of nodule were about the same. These data indicated that the improvement in nitrogen fixation observed with the TA11 NOD+ resulted from an increase in the overall nodule number. The physiological basis for this increase in nodulation is not known, but enhanced tryptophan catabolism does not appear to be involved. 3ametabolism 3anitrogen fixation 3aauxotrophs 3atryptophan 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3anodulation 0amutants1 aKuykendall, L.D.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1990 Aug., v. 56, no. 8 p.2399-2403x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01319naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245015500128300001800283520045700301650002200758650001100780650001800791650001900809700001700828700001400845700001700859773009800876852000900974939003300983946001301016655001201029IND9004661820221118224325.0900921e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900466182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayashida, S.10aOccurrence of an affinity site apart from the active site on the raw-starch-digesting but non-raw-starch-adsorbable Bacillus subtilis 65 alpha-amylase  ap. 2584-2586.  aalpha-Cyclodextrin specifically inhibited raw starch digestion by Bacillus subtilis 65 alpha-amylase.

The purified enzyme was migrated as a single band on native and SDS-poliacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 65 kDa. Optimum PPO activity as a function of pH and temperature was determined using catechol, 4-methyl catechol and pyrogallol as substrates. The optimum pH and temperatures values of mulberry PPO for the used three substrates ranged between the pH 4.5-8.0 and 20-45 degrees C. At the optimum pH and temperature, the K(M) and V(Max) values of mulberry PPO towards catechol, 4-methyl catechol and pyrogallol were determined by Lineweaver-Burk method. The values V(Max)/K(M) showed that mulberry has the greatest reactivity towards pyrogallol among the substrates used. On the other hand mulberry PPO showed no activity toward the monophenols, p-cresol and L-tyrosine, suggesting the absence of monophenolase (cresolase) activity. Beside the classical PPO inhibitors, for the first time the inhibitory effect of some sulfonamide compounds on the mulberry PPO activities was also tested. Sulfonamide compounds exhibited considerable inhibition on mulberry PPO enzyme. 3atemperature 3apyrogallol 3aprotein isolates 3acatechol oxidase 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asulfonamides 3amulberries 3aMorus alba 3atyrosine 3aenzyme inhibitors 3apH 3aenzyme kinetics 3aaffinity chromatography 3aenzyme substrates 3aenzymatic browning 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3acatecholamines 3acresols 0apurification1 aErzengin, M.1 aSinan, S.1 aOzensoy, O.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 3 p.479-484x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03027naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245011200176300001600288520163700304650001501941650002101956650001201977650001001989650001701999650001702016650001302033650001002046650002702056650001202083650000902095650001902104650002802123650001602151650001902167650001502186650002302201650000702224650001302231653003002244700001402274700001402288700001502302700001802317773007202335852000902407930003302416945002502449946001102474655001202485IND4364401820221118224723.0040913e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436440182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aToldra, M.10aFunctional properties of a spray-dried porcine red blood cell fraction treated by high hydrostatic pressure  ap. 461-468.  aThe aims of this study were to evaluate the functional properties of a spray-dried porcine red blood cell fraction (RBC), and the effects of the prior application of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on RBC protein functionality (solubility, foaming capacity, foam stability, water-holding capacity and texture properties of heat-induced gels) as well as on its microbiological quality and colour. The application of HHP (400 MPa, 15 min, 20 degrees C) and later dehydration allowed a dried product to be obtained with a reduction in the mesophilic bacterial counts of 3.2 logarithmic units. The colours of the pressurized and non-pressurized spray-dried RBC were the same, which indicated that both samples presented the same susceptibility to the hem group oxidation provoked by dehydration. The application of HHP increased the denaturant effects of spray-drying on hemoglobin (Hb), especially at pH 7 (isoelectric point; pI) since, after both processes, a decrease in protein solubility at neutral pH was observed. Spray-dried RBC had a maximum foaming capacity at the pI of Hb. The application of HHP decreased the foaming capacity but did not negatively affect the foam stability. Thermal treatment of RBC solutions led to hard and consistent gels at pH 7 whereas, at acid pH, less consistent, more adhesive and more elastic pastes were formed. The latter had higher water-holding capacities than gels at pH 7, in which, the water was retained by capillarity. Neither springiness and adhesiveness nor water-holding capacities of heat-induced gels or pastes were affected by the application of the HHP treatment to the fresh RBC. 3asolubility 3afoaming capacity 3afoaming 3aswine 3aerythrocytes 3aspray drying 3apressure 3acolor 3awater holding capacity 3atexture 3agels 3aheat treatment 3amicrobiological quality 3aplate count 3afood additives 3ahemoglobin 3apasting properties 3apH 3aadhesion 0ahigh hydrostatic pressure1 aElias, A.1 aPares, D.1 aSaguer, E.1 aCarretero, C.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 3 p.461-468x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02994naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002500193245010100218300001800319506007600337520116700413506003701580650001501617650001501632650001901647650001701666650002201683650002801705650001301733650001601746650001001762650001201772650001901784650001501803650001401818650001201832650001801844650002701862650004601889650004401935650002301979650005302002653002102055653002202076653001402098700002202112700002402134773011302158852000902271856009202280930003302372946001102405655001202416IND4426480220221207113557.0090925e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442648022DNAL7 a197548732pmid7 aPMC28965002pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07303.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutkowski, Joseph M.10aMechanisms of obesity and related pathologies: The macro- and microcirculation of adipose tissue  ap. 5738-5746.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAdipose tissue is an endocrine organ made up of adipocytes, various stromal cells, resident and infiltrating immune cells, and an extensive endothelial network. Adipose secretory products, collectively referred to as adipokines, have been identified as contributors to the negative consequences of adipose tissue expansion that include cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Systemic blood circulation provides transport capabilities for adipokines and fuels for proper adipose tissue function. Adipose tissue microcirculation is heavily impacted by adipose tissue expansion, some adipokines can induce endothelial dysfunction, and angiogenesis is necessary to counter hypoxia arising as a result of tissue expansion. Tumors, such as invasive lesions in the mammary gland, co-opt the adipose tissue microvasculature for local growth and metastatic spread. Lymphatic circulation, an area that has received little metabolic attention, provides an important route for dietary and peripheral lipid transport. We review adipose circulation as a whole and focus on the established and potential interplay between adipose tissue and the microvascular endothelium.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipocytes 3aadipokines 3aadipose tissue 3aangiogenesis 3ablood circulation 3acardiovascular diseases 3adiabetes 3aendothelium 3afuels 3ahypoxia 3amammary glands 3ametastasis 3aneoplasms 3aobesity 3astromal cells 2aAdipokinesxmetabolism 2aAdipose Tissuexblood supplyxmetabolism. 2aMicrocirculationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aModels, Biological 2aObesityxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 0aendothelial cell 0alymphangiogenesis 0alymphatic1 aDavis, Kathryn E.1 aScherer, Philipp E.0 tFEBS journal.g2009 Oct., v. 276, no. 20 p.5738-5746dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07303.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01582naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245007700161300001600238520049700254650001300751650003100764650001900795650001500814650001100829650001300840650002000853650001800873650002700891650001000918650002100928651000900949653002300958700001500981700001400996773007201010852000901082930003301091945002501124946001101149655001201160IND4364397720221118224914.0040913e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436439772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBarros, R.M.12aA kinetic model for hydrolysis of whey protein by cardosin A extracted from Cynara cardunculus  ap. 351-359.  a2019-12-05  aThe enzymatic hydrolysis of the major whey proteins, namely beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) and alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-La), was experimentally studied using whey as substrate; an aspartic protease (cardosin A), previously extracted from the flowers of Cynara cardunculus and purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies, was used for this purpose. Sweet whey was incubated for 24 h at various enzyme:substrate ratios, at controlled pH (5.2 and 6.0) and temperature (55 degrees C); the hydrolyzates were assayed by gel permeation chromatography and electrophoresis. A mechanistic model was proposed for the kinetics, which basically leads to a double-substrate, single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten rate expression containing four adjustable parameters; these parameters were estimated by applying multiresponse, nonlinear regression analysis to the experimental data, so that the model would yield good fits. The best estimates obtained for K(m) were markedly lower for alpha-La than for beta-Lg, so cardosin A shows a higher affinity for alpha-La than for beta-Lg. The experimental results also suggest that beta-Lg is rather resistant to enzyme-mediated hydrolysis under all experimental conditions tested. The highest activity (measured by k(cat)) of cardosin A was recorded toward alpha-La (i.e. 0.013 s(-1)) at pH 5.2. Furthermore, the specificity ratio (k(cat)/K(m)), obtained toward each whey protein, indicated that cardosin A possesses a higher catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of alpha-La than of beta-Lg; the highest value for this ratio was recorded for alpha-La at pH 5.2, and was close to that reported elsewhere for cardosin A acting on caseins and casein-like substrates. 3awhey protein 3achemical concentration 3alactalbumin 3aseparation 3aproteolysis 3aplant extracts 3awhey 3amechanistic models 3alactoglobulins 3apH 3aCynara cardunculus 3aenzyme kinetics 3aenzyme substrates 3atemperature 3aaspartic proteinases 3aprotein hydrolysates 3aenzyme activity 0apurification 0acardosin A 0adairy products1 aMalcata, F.X.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 3 p.351-359x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02074naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245007000143300001600213500001500229520095000244650001601194650001201210650002101222650001001243650001801253650001201271650001901283650001401302650001301316650001901329650002501348650001501373650001901388650001701407650002301424653001401447700001701461773007201478852000901550930003301559945002501592946001101617655001201628IND4364400520221118224740.0040913e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436440052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In addition, the relationship between antioxidant activity, phenolic content and the different degrees of heating of mango seed kernel was investigated. The seeds showed a much higher antioxidant activity and phenolic content than the edible portions. The contribution of all the fruit seed fractions to the total antioxidant activity and phenolic content was always >70%. ABTS cation radical-scavenging and FRAP assays were employed for the determination of antioxidant activity; FCR assay was used to measure the total phenolic content. The AEAC and FRAP of ethanolic extracts of MSKP products increased to a maximum after heating to 160 degrees C. The total phenolic content in extracts of MSKP products increased from 50.3 to 160 mg/g GAE with an increase in heating temperature to 160 degrees C. 3atemperature 3alongans 3anutrient content 3aseeds 3afree radicals 3amangoes 3aplant extracts 3atamarinds 3aavocados 3aheat treatment 3aantioxidant activity 3ajackfruits 3afood additives 3aantioxidants 3aphenolic compounds 0areduction1 aBarlow, P.J.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 3 p.411-417x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02522naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245006600141300001600207520123700223650002001460650001001480650001101490650002101501650001301522650002601535650001601561650002701577650002701604650002101631650001601652650002101668650001701689650002701706650002701733650001301760651001601773653001601789700001701805700001601822700002401838700001601862773007201878852000901950930003301959945002501992946001102017655001202028IND4364401020221118224700.0040913e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436440102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aNaczk, M.10aCompositional characteristics of green crab (Carcinus maenas)  ap. 429-434.  aThe invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenus) was harvested at four sites in Nova Scotia. Crabs were individually weighed and measured for carapace width. A composite of claw and leg meats was sampled from raw green crabs and the meat was subjected to proximate (moisture, protein [N x 6.25], and total lipids), carotenoids, fatty acid distribution, and amino acids composition analyses. In addition, the shell discards were analyzed for their contents of chitin, total lipids, total nitrogen, and total carotenoids. The total protein (N x 6.25) content, lipids, and carotenoids in crab meat, on a dry weight basis (db), were 80.6-83.5, 3.6-4.8%, and 5.1-19.2 mg%, respectively. The shell discards, db, contained 12.6-14.5% of chitin, 2.6-3.11% of total nitrogen, 0.37-0.65% of total lipids, and 4.4-9.3 mg% of total carotenoids. The saturated and n - 3 fatty acids accounted for 19-20.7% and 37.4-40% of total fatty acids, respectively. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were dominated by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA: 20 : 5n - 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: 22 : 6n - 3). The ratio of EPA:DHA varied from 1.6 to 2.8. Green crab meat was well balanced in its composition of essential amino acids, except for tryptophan. 3aCarcinus maenas 3acrabs 3achitin 3ameat composition 3araw meat 3aproximate composition 3acarotenoids 3afatty acid composition 3aamino acid composition 3anitrogen content 3aexoskeleton 3ainvasive species 3ameat quality 3ageographical variation 3afood processing wastes 3aseafoods 3aNova Scotia 0acrab shells1 aWilliams, J.1 aBrennan, K.1 aLiyanapathirana, C.1 aShahidi, F.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 3 p.429-434x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02489naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001700156245009900173300001800272520100800290650001201298650003001310650001101340650001001351650001001361650002301371650002301394650001201417650003201429650002601461650002601487650001101513650002901524650004201553650002201595650002501617650002301642650002401665653001301689653001401702653001801716700001501734773007601749852000901825856007801834930003301912945001301945946001301958655001201971IND2050190020221118224658.0960305e199512  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205019002DNAL7 a88255942pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07420292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarasawa, Y.10aEffects of cecal ligation and colostomy on motility of the rectum, ileum, and cecum in turkeys  ap. 2029-2034.  aMotilities of the rectum, ileum, and ceca were examined in surgically prepared turkeys by using strain gauge transducers implanted on these sites after cecal ligation or colostomy. All birds were provided ad libitum access to feed and water throughout the study. Cecal ligation increased the frequency of small anti-peristaltic contractions in the proximal (P < .01) and distal (P < .05) rectum and the frequency of defecations (P < .05) compared with intact controls. Cecal ligation decreased the frequency of single contractions in the proximal ileum (P < .05) and that of all contractions in the distal ileum (P < .05), and ligation (P < .01) and colostomy (P < .05) increased the frequency of single contractions in the distal site. However, major and minor cecal contractions were not affected by colostomy in the proximal and distal cecum. The results suggest that the effects on contractile activities of the hindgut must be considered when interpreting responses to cecal ligation and colostomy. 3aturkeys 3agastrointestinal motility 3arectum 3aileum 3acecum 3aad libitum feeding 3amuscle contraction 2aAnimals 2aCecumxphysiologyxsurgery. 2aColostomyxveterinary 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFermentationxphysiology 2aGastrointestinal Motilityxphysiology 2aIleumxphysiology 2aLigationxveterinary 2aRectumxphysiology 2aTurkeysxphysiology 0aligature 0acolostomy 0astrain gauges1 aDuke, G.E.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.2029-2034x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07420293Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02254naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001900138245005200157300001800209520125300227650001501480650002801495650002301523650001201546650001301558650001501571650001301586700002001599700002101619773014301640852000901783856007801792939003301870946001301903655001201916IND4461418820221118224944.0110812e20110915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446141882DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.223002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanales, Manel10aWater absorption in polyaniline emeraldine base  ap. 1322-1331.  aAtomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the water absorption behavior of polyaniline emeraldine base. Results derived from simulations, which were performed considering polymeric systems with different concentrations of water (3%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 50%, and 100% w/w), have been compared with experimental evidences obtained for both powder and films. Calculation of the Hildebrand solubility parameters explains not only the insolubility of polyaniline in water but also the requirements, in terms of intermolecular interactions, needed by solvents to be compatibles with this polymer. The maximum content of absorbed water predicted for hygroscopic polyaniline is 15% w/w. The effects of the absorbed water in both the organization and conformation of the polymer chains have been examined at the microscopic level by analyzing the microstructures derived from simulations, while the role of the moisture in the morphology of powder and film samples has been investigated using atomic force microscopy. The overall of the results provides a complete and understandable view of the polyaniline·water interactions, and explains the influence of the water molecules in the structural properties of the polymer. 3aabsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3amolecular dynamics 3aphysics 3apolymers 3asolubility 3asolvents1 aAradilla, David1 aAlemán, Carlos.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2011 Sept. 15, v. 49, no. 18 p.1322-1331dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.223003Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110812  aOther US 7aarticle04586naa a2200961 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245007700172300001800249500001500267520189200282650001302174650004702187650000802234650002302242650002502265650002102290650002502311650002002336650001202356650001802368650002302386650002302409650001902432650002702451650001102478650002002489650000902509650003702518650002802555650003002583650004702613653001902660653001902679653001902698653001902717653001902736653001902755653001902774653001902793653001902812653002802831653002002859653001902879653001902898653001902917653001902936653001902955653003002974653001903004653001903023653001903042653001903061653001903080653001903099653001903118653001903137653001903156653001903175653001903194653001903213653001903232653001903251653001903270700001403289700001803303700001503321700001803336700002103354700001503375773007603390852000903466856007803475930003303553945001303586946001303599655001203612IND2049909220221118224957.0960216e199511  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204990922DNAL7 a86146942pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07418552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, H.H.10aDevelopment of a genetic map of the chicken with markers of high utility  ap. 1855-1874.  a2019-12-04  aMicrosatellites are tandem duplications with a simple motif of one to six bases as the repeat unit. Microsatellites provide an excellent opportunity for developing genetic markers of high utility because the number of repeats is highly polymorphic, and the assay to score microsatellite polymorphisms is quick and reliable because the procedure is based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We have identified 404 microsatellite-containing clones of which 219 were suitable as microsatellite markers. Primers for 151 of these microsatellites were developed and used to detect polymorphisms in DNA samples extracted from the parents of two reference populations and three resource populations. Sixty, 39, 46, 49, and 61% of the microsatellites exhibited length polymorphisms in the East Lansing reference population, the Compton reference population, resource population No. 1 (developed to identify resistance genes to Marek's disease), resource population No. 2 (developed to identify genes involved in abdominal fat), and resource population No. 3 (developed to identify genes involved in production traits), respectively. The 91 microsatellites that were polymorphic in the East Lansing reference population were genotyped and 86 genetic markers were eventually mapped. In addition, 11 new random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and 24 new markers based on the chicken CR1 element were mapped. The addition of these markers increases the total number of markers on the East Lansing genetic map to 273, of which 243 markers are resolved into 32 linkage groups. The map coverage within linkage groups is 1,402 cM with an average spacing of 6.7 cM between loci. The utility of the genetic map is greatly enhanced by adding 86 microsatellite markers. Based on our current map, approximately 2,550 cM of the chicken genome is within 20 cM of at least one microsatellite marker. 3achickens 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aDNA 3achromosome mapping 3anucleotide sequences 3aline differences 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChickensxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDNAxchemistry 2aDNA Primersxchemistry 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkage 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 0agenbank/g01551 0agenbank/g01572 0agenbank/g01567 0agenbank/g01558 0agenbank/g01569 0agenbank/g01564 0agenbank/g01574 0agenbank/g01571 0agenbank/g01563 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/g01575+ 0agenbank/g01547 0agenbank/g01555 0agenbank/g01562 0agenbank/g01557 0agenbank/g01560 0apolymerase chain reaction 0agenbank/g01554 0agenbank/g01573 0agenbank/g01556 0agenbank/g01561 0agenbank/g01550 0agenbank/g01548 0agenbank/g01559 0agenbank/g01549 0agenbank/g01553 0agenbank/g01565 0agenbank/g01568 0agenbank/g01566 0agenbank/g01552 0agenbank/g01546 0agenbank/g015701 aLevin, I.1 aVallejo, R.L.1 aKhatib, H.1 aDodgson, J.B.1 aCrittenden, L.B.1 aHillel, J.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.1855-1874x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07418553Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02330naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245011200175300001600287520117100303650002301474650001501497650001101512650001901523650001801542650001301560650001201573650001801585650001301603650001401616650002001630700002101650700001701671773011101688852000901799856009201808939003301900946001101933655001201944IND4461415820221118224956.0110812e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446141582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02341.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJantzer, Katharina10aPhenotyping in the archaea: optimization of growth parameters and analysis of mutants of Haloferax volcanii  ap. 123-130.  aA method to grow the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii in microtiter plates has been optimized and now allows the parallel generation of very reproducible growth curves. The doubling time in a synthetic medium with glucose is around 6 h. The method was used to optimize glucose and casamino acid concentrations, to clarify carbon source usage and to analyze vitamin dependence. The characterization of osmotolerance revealed that after a lag phase of 24 h, H. volcanii is able to grow at salt concentrations as low as 0.7 M NaCl, much lower than the 1.4 M NaCl described as the lowest concentration until now. The application of oxidative stresses showed that H. volcanii exhibits a reaction to paraquat that is delayed by about 10 h. Surprisingly, only one of two amino acid auxotrophic mutants could be fully supplemented by the addition of the respective amino acid. Analysis of eight sRNA gene deletion mutants exemplified that the method can be applied for bona fide phenotyping of mutant collections. This method for the parallel analysis of many cultures contributes towards making H. volcanii an archaeal model species for functional genomic approaches. 3aHaloferax volcanii 3aauxotrophs 3acarbon 3acasamino acids 3agene deletion 3agenomics 3aglucose 3aosmotolerance 3aparaquat 3aphenotype 3asodium chloride1 aZerulla, Karolin1 aSoppa, Jörg0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2011 Sept., v. 322, no. 2 p.123-130dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02341.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110812  aNon-US 7aarticle03805naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245007200174300001800246520204400264650002102308650001102329650001902340650001902359650001602378650002002394650001802414650001402432650001102446650001202457650001902469650002402488650001202512650004302524650004802567650006902615650000902684650001902693650001102712650003202723650005602755650004502811650004502856653002802901700001502929700001802944700001602962700001502978773007602993852000903069856007803078930003303156945001303189946001303202655001203215IND2050187920221118224820.0960305e199512  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205018792DNAL7 a88255862pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07419612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayyari, G.R.14aThe effect of dietary copper sulfate on infectious proventriculitis  ap. 1961-1969.  aOral inoculation of day-old broiler chicks with a crude homogenate of affected proventricular tissue, or the same homogenate filtered through a .2 micrometer filter caused proventricular lesions similar to those responsible for carcass contamination of broilers at processing. Dietary copper sulfate (CUS) has also been shown to produce similar lesions. In this study, we investigated the interaction between crude proventriculus homogenate or filtered proventriculus homogenate and 1 g/kg CUS added to a standard chicken diet. Cobb X Cobb female broiler chicks were distributed into six groups with four replicate battery pens per group. Birds were fed either a standard broiler starter diet or the same diet with 1 g/kg CUS. Each dietary treatment was inoculated per os with 1 mL of either sterile saline, unfiltered homogenate, or filtered homogenate. Both crude and filtered homogenates had a much stronger affect on proventriculus score than did Cu by itself, resulting in no interaction between either homogenate or filtrate and CUS. There was a significant and possibly antagonistic interaction on proventriculus relative weights in the CUS by filtrate group during Week 1 and a synergistic interaction in the CUS by homogenate group during Week 4. Body weights were decreased in birds fed homogenate or CUS, but not in birds fed filtrate. There was a protective effect shown by filtrate on body weight of birds fed both filtrate and CUS only during Week 1. There was a synergistic decrease in body weight of birds fed homogenate and CUS during Week 2. Overall feed conversion efficiency was significantly decreased in the homogenate treatment (P = .04) and decreased in the birds fed CUS (P = .1). There was a (4.2 vs 2.3) (P = .1) decrease in feed conversion efficiency in birds fed both homogenate and CUS. Natural exposure to low levels of the infectious agent present in the homogenates may interact with excess dietary CUS, resulting in increased proventriculus size and decrease in body weight and feed conversion efficiency. 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3aproventriculus 3acopper sulfate 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3afilterability 3asynergism 3aweight 3agizzard 3ahistopathology 3ainfectious diseases 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCopper Sulfatexadministration & dosagexanalysisxpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aDrug Synergism 2aFemale 2aPoultry Diseasesxpathology 2aProventriculusxchemistryxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aStomach Diseasesxpathologyxveterinary. 2aTissue Extractsxanalysisxpharmacology. 0aexperimental infections1 aHuff, W.E.1 aBeasley, J.N.1 aBalog, J.M.1 aRath, N.C.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Dec., v. 74, no. 12 p.1961-1969x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07419613Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02846naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245006600174300001600240520101500256650000901271650002201280650001201302650001901314650001301333650002301346650001301369650001601382650003501398650002001433650001801453650001201471650002601483650004601509650002501555650001101580650002501591650004901616650002801665650003201693650004901725650002201774650005101796650001601847650001701863653001601880653001201896653001401908700001801922700001601940700001801956700001501974773007301989852000902062856007802071930003302149945001302182946001302195655001202208IND2053159920221118224420.0960923e199607  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205315992DNAL7 a89661802pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07509102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, T.10aMesotocin binding to receptors in hen kidney plasma membranes  ap. 910-914.  aRadioligand assays were performed to demonstrate the presence of a receptor for mesotocin (MT) in the membrane fractions of the kidney of the hen.

Isolated spermiophages were suspended in Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender (BPSE) and added to semen with low spermiophage numbers to give approximate spermiophage concentrations of: 2 X 10(5)/mL (medium) and 10(6) thigh). Semen with no added spermiophages was the control. Samples were diluted to 1:1 with BPSE, and for each spermiophage level (treatment), semen aliquots were either immediately inseminated or stored 6 h at 4 C with agitation (150 rpm) before insemination. Hens were inseminated weekly, and fertility, embryonic mortality, and hatchability of eggs were determined for a 10-wk period. The experiment was performed twice. In Trial 1, there were no differences in fertility between treatments except that fertility for control stored semen was lower (P less than or equal to 0.05) than that for fresh semen (89.27 vs 95.97, respectively; SEM = 2.2). Neither hatchability nor embryonic mortality was affected by spermiophage level in Trial 1. Spermiophages did not affect fertility in Trial 2; however, hatchability for unstored treatments with added spermiophages was significantly lower than for the control. For stored semen, hatchability was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater for treatments with added spermiophages than for the control. Differences in embryonic mortality in Trial 2 did not relate to adding spermiophages to the semen. No clearly defined detrimental effect of seminal spermiophages was shown in the present experiments. 3aturkeys 3asemen 3amale fertility 3aembryonic mortality 3aegg hatchability 3aphagocytes 3astorage quality 2aAnimals 2aCentrifugation, Density Gradientxveterinary 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Developmentxphysiology 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aFetal Deathxphysiopathology. 2aMacrophagesxcytologyxphysiology. 2aMale 2aSemenxcytologyxphysiology. 2aSperm Motilityxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxcytology 2aTime Factors 2aTurkeysxembryologyxphysiology.1 aThurston, R.J.1 aScott, T.R.1 aKorn, N.0 tPoultry science.g1996 July, v. 75, no. 7 p.943-948x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07509433Available from publisher's Web site  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03411naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001600178245008000194300001600274500001500290520198800305650002202293650001602315650001602331650002102347650001602368650001402384650002302398650001702421650002102438650001502459650001402474650001002488650001402498650003602512650002002548650002402568650002102592651001002613653001602623700001502639700001502654700001602669700002202685773007202707852000902779930003302788945002502821946001102846655001202857IND4370399220221118224533.0050521e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437039922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLopez, S.J.12aA reliable technique to identify superior quality clones from tea germplasm  ap. 771-778.  a2019-12-05  aVariations in the substrate level and enzyme activity of prominent south Indian tea germplasm were studied. The content of polyphenols, catechins (substrates) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) showed variation, which influenced the final black tea quality. The enzyme PPO occurs in tea shoots and catalyzes the reactions between catechins to form theaflavins in the presence of oxygen. The catechins mainly epicatechin (EC), epigallo catechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallo catechin (EGC) get mixed with PPO during the oxidation process to form quality constituents like theaflavins (TF), thearubigins (TR) and high polymerized substances (HPS). Theaflavins and their fractions such as simple theaflavin, theaflavin monogallate, (TFMG), theaflavin digallate (TFDG) in black tea are the essential quality constituents that are responsible for the liquor characteristics where as TR and high polymerized substances impart colour to the liquor. As oxidation of macerated leaves proceed through different stages of tea manufacture, a decline in PPO activity, polyphenol and catechin contents were observed. Data revealed that the oxidation reaction was faster during the initial stages of oxidation. During the period, oxygen consumption was higher and declined thereafter. Ratio between the enzyme (PPO) and its substrate (catechins) were used to characterize the quality potential of tea clones. An attempt has also been made to categorize prominent tea clones as high, moderate and average quality clones based on their enzyme substrate ratio. Theaflavin content (oxidation product) of different tea clones suggests that the ratio between PPO and catechins forms an important criterion which determines black tea quality. Results obtained were compared with standard clones of known high quality (CR-6017) and moderate quality (SA-6). The study reveals that the enzyme substrate ratio can be used to identify superior quality clones from the existing tea germplasm. 3aCamellia sinensis 3aepicatechin 3atheaflavins 3acatechol oxidase 3abiopolymers 3aseedlings 3aoxygen consumption 3afood quality 3aepigallocatechin 3amaceration 3ablack tea 3acolor 3aoxidation 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenzyme activity 3agermplasm screening 3acloning (plants) 3aIndia 0apolyphenols1 aThomas, J.1 aPius, P.K.1 aKumar, R.R.1 aMuraleedharan, N.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 Aug., v. 91, no. 4 p.771-778x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20070720b20070802c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02664naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245011700148300001600265300003000281500001500311520102100326650001301347650002801360650001301388650002201401650001101423650002401434650001801458650001501476650001001491650005001501650001001551650000901561650003701570650001801607650001101625650002101636650002401657650001101681650000901692650002201701650003201723650001701755651001501772651001801787653002501805700001701830700001801847700001301865700001501878700001601893773007801909852000901987939003301996945000802029946001302037655001202050991560841800742620221118224538.0880714e198709  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880021082DNAL7 a36849792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega, W.A.10aAssessing knowledge of cardiovascular health-related diet and exercise behaviors in Anglo- and Mexican-Americans  ap. 696-709.  ap. 696-709. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective of this work was to develop scales to measure knowledge of health behaviors related to cardiovascular disease among children and adults and to evaluate the psychometric (reliability scale for assessing knowledge) scale; and to investigate Anglo and Mexican American differences in health behavior knowledge on dietary sodium, dietary fat, and exercise and to identify determinants, such as sex and education, self confidence, and cultural orientation, of such knowledge. Test differences in knowledge by ethnicity and sex indicate strong effects for ethnicity among both adults and children; sex did not appear consistently related to knowledge, except males tend to be more knowledgeable about exercise. Education appeared to be the strongest determinant for Anglo-Americans and cultural orientation strongest for Mexican-American adults. It was concluded that the Health Behavior Knowledge Scales were found to be useful in assessing levels of cardiovascular knowledge in Anglo and Mexican Americans. 3aexercise 3acardiovascular diseases 3achildren 3aMexican Americans 3aadults 3anutrition knowledge 2aAcculturation 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxprevention & control 2aChild 2aDiet 2aEducational Measurementxmethods 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aHealth Education 2aHispanic or Latino. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPhysical Exertion 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSelf Concept 3aCalifornia 0aUnited States 0aHealth and Pathology1 aSallis, J.F.1 aPatterson, T.1 aRupp, J.1 aAtkins, C.1 aNader, P.R.0 tPreventive medicine.g1987 Sept., v. 16, no. 5 p.696-709x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880714c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02676naa a2200697 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001300133245010600146300001600252300002400268520068100292650001500973650002400988650001401012650001001026650001601036650002001052650001001072650002001082650002301102650000801125650001001133650001201143650001801155650002301173650001001196650000901206650002201215650001201237650007101249650008401320650002601404650004301430650002401473650001101497650001101508650000901519650001601528650002301544650008501567650001301652651001201665653002401677700001701701700001701718700001901735700001801754700001501772700001601787700002301803773007701826852000901903939003301912945000801945946001301953655001201966991560839540742620221118224528.0920129e199103  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920001142DNAL7 a16475312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, E.E.12aA community-based feasibility study using wheat bran fiber supplementation to lower colon cancer risk  ap. 213-225.  ap. 213-225. charts.  aMethods.

The objective of this study was to gain insight into the determinants of dietary fat and fiber consumption in American rural energy workers. Main determinants in this study were knowledge, efficacy expectations, and outcome expectations. The determinants will be ordered in a model, assuming that efficacy and outcome expectations predict intention. Methods. The study consisted of a cross-sectional survey. The questionnaires on food behavior and the determinants of fat and fiber consumption were administered to the subjects at the same time. Models of determinants of fat and fiber consumption were derived from the correlation and regression analyses. Results. There were 211 questionnaires analyzed. The scales were shown to be valid and reliable. In the models of determinants of fat and fiber consumption the following determinants were generated: gender, education, knowledge, interest, efficacy expectations, outcome expectations, and intention. In this study efficacy expectations were important to determine fat and fiber consumption. Conclusions. Efficacy expectations can be considered an important variable of an intervention program aiming at the decrease of fat consumption and at the increase of fiber consumption in rural energy workers. 3adietary fat 3anutrient intake 3aenergy intake 3arural areas 3aelectric power 3aemployment 3anutrition knowledge 3amodels 3aprediction 3adietary surveys 3adietary fiber 3ainterest (finance) 3aattitudes and opinions 3anatural gas 2aAdult 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Fats 2aDietary Fiber 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aMale 2aModels, Psychological 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRegression Analysis 2aRural Health 2aWorkplace 3aTexas 3aLouisiana 0aLouisiana 0aTexas 0abeliefs 0aefficacy 0awillingness 0aintention1 aEriksen, M.P.1 aAdriaanse, H.P.1 aNijhuis, F.J.N.1 aAaron, J.C.0 tPreventive medicine.g1996 , v. 25, no. 2 p.212-217x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02661naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001700156245008800173300001800261500001500279520104700294650001601341650002501357650001601382650001301398650001001411650002101421650002201442650001201464650002101476650006501497650005001562650002301612650005001635650002301685650000901708650002301717650002401740653002201764653002001786653003301806653002401839700001801863700001601881773007601897852000901973856007801982930003302060945001302093946001302106655001202119IND2048893020221118224157.0951121e199510  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204889302DNAL7 a85597372pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07417122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiegel, H.S.10aAtherosclerosis in Japanese quail males selected for high or low plasma cholesterol  ap. 1712-1716.  a2019-12-04  aThree lines of Japanese quail males, unselected controls (CL), high response (HL), and low response (LL) lines, selected for plasma total cholesterol for 18 generations, were fed all-plant source, nonatherogenic diets to which 0 or .5% cholesterol were added from 6 to 18 wk of age. Atherosclerotic scores (AS) of aorta of HL birds fed cholesterol were significantly higher than those of LL birds fed cholesterol. Scores of LL fed cholesterol were not higher than LL not fed cholesterol. Fatty infiltration of muscularis and foam cell disruption of elastic fibers were observed in HL males fed cholesterol. In a second experiment, males of the three lines were fed from 6 to 14 wk of age four plant source diets to which were added: 1) 10% glucose monohydrate (cerelose); 2) 10% cerelose + .1% cholesterol; 3) 4% corn oil; or 4) 4% coconut oil. All diets were calculated to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Overall, AS of HL and CL males were significantly higher than LL males, but there were no effects of diet for the 56-d feeding period. 3acoconut oil 3ahypercholesterolemia 3acholesterol 3acorn oil 3aaorta 3aline differences 3aCoturnix japonica 2aAnimals 2aAortaxpathology 2aArteriosclerosisxetiologyxgeneticsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aBird Diseasesxetiologyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aCoturnixxgenetics 2aMale 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSpecies Specificity 0aatherogenic diets 0aJapanese quails 0aexperimental atherosclerosis 0adietary cholesterol1 aHammand, S.M.1 aMarks, H.L.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Oct., v. 74, no. 10 p.1712-1716x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07417123Available from publisher's Web site  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03604naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245009600172300001800268500001500286520198500301650001402286650002002300650002302320650001602343650001802359650003502377650002002412650001402432650001602446650002202462650002102484650002302505650001502528650001602543650001202559650002602571650003602597650002102633650002002654650001302674650001702687650002302704650001702727653002002744653002002764653002002784773007602804852000902880856007802889930003302967945001303000946001303013655001203026IND2049907120221118224151.0960216e199511  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204990712DNAL7 a86146822pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07417302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarks, H.L.10aHeterosis and overdominance following long-term selection for body weight in Japanese quail  ap. 1730-1744.  a2019-12-04  aAlthough nonadditive genetic variation is more important in crosses among laying stocks than among meat stocks, development of special sire and dam lines to control the release of primary lines results in broilers being the product of three- or four-way crosses. Therefore, nonadditive genetic effects are important in meat stocks because of opportunities to combine stocks that complement each other. Four experiments were conducted to investigate heterosis and overdominance arising from crossing Japanese quail lines originating from the same base population and selected long-term (> 85 generations) for high 4-wk BW under different selection environments. The different selection environments were established by feeding different levels of CP (28 and 20%) and different levels of thiouracil (0 and .2%). Estimates of heterosis were high for hatch of total eggs (>25%) and liveability (12 to 47%), and low for hatch weight (2 to 4%). Overdominance estimates followed similar patterns but were of lower magnitude. Percentage heterosis estimates for BW were high at 1 wk (20 to 30%) and declined linearly to 5 to 10% at 4 wk when quail were fed 28 and 24% CP diets. Contrariwise, when fed low-CP (20%) diets, heterosis values were low initially and remained stable or increased across age. Data obtained from measuring feed intake and feed efficiency indicated that heterosis for BW was closely related to changes in feed intake. Heterosis values for feed intake closely followed those for BW, including the decline across age. Conversely, heterosis appeared to be absent for feed efficiency, except at 1 wk. Similar to heterosis estimates, overdominance estimates were high initially and declined across age and were more clearly demonstrated under the 24 and 28% diets. It was concluded that considerable heterosis is present for BW in Japanese quail following the crossing of lines selected long-term for high BW, but that it is dependent on both environment (diet) and age. 3aheterosis 3adietary protein 3aselection response 3abody weight 3aoverdominance 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3afeed conversion 3amortality 3afeed intake 3aCoturnix japonica 3aegg hatchability 3aselection criteria 3athiouracil 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aCoturnixxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aGenes, Dominant 2aGenotype 2aHybrid Vigor 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTime Factors 0ahatching weight 0aage differences 0aJapanese quails0 tPoultry science.g1995 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.1730-1744x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07417303Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02933naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002500128245007900153300001600232520168300248650002001931650001501951650002401966650005101990650001002041650001502051650001702066650001802083650001502101650002702116650001102143650001002154650001902164650001102183650000902194650001702203650002602220650001502246700001402261700001802275700001702293773007302310852000902383930003302392945001302425946001302438655001202451IND2056184220221118224346.0970327e199609  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205618422DNAL7 a88883162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeumark-Sztainer, D.10aCorrelates of inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption among adolescents  ap. 497-505.  aThe present study aims to determine the prevalence of inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption among adolescents and to determine sociodemographic, personal, psychosocial, and behavioral correlates of inadequate consumption. Data presented in this study were taken from the Minnesota Adolescent Health Survey, a classroom-administered questionnaire, which was completed by 36,284 adolescents in grades 7-12. Chi-square analyses and multivariate logistic regressions controlling for socioeconomic status, ethnicity, age, gender, and BMI were done. Inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables was common among the study population. Less than daily consumption of fruits and vegetables was reported by approximately 40% of adolescents from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Ethnic differences in eating patterns were also apparent in that American Indians were at highest risk for inadequate fruit consumption and African Americans were at greatest risk for inadequate vegetable consumption. Psychosocial correlates of inadequate intake included low family connectedness, weight dissatisfaction, and poor academic achievement. Frequent dieting was associated with inadequate fruit consumption but not with vegetable consumption. Health-compromising behaviors such as binge eating, substance abuse, and past suicide attempts were correlated with inadequate intake. The results stress the need for intervention programs aimed at increased consumption of fruits and vegetables among adolescents. While programs need to reach all adolescents, approaches need to be suitable to those at highest risk for inadequate consumption, in particular those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. 3ahuman nutrition 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behavior 2aAdolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aChild 2aDemography 2aDiet Surveys 2aEnergy Intake 2aEthnicity. 2aFamily Characteristics 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSocial Class 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aVegetables1 aStory, M.1 aResnick, M.D.1 aBlum, R.W.M.0 tPreventive medicine.g1996 , v. 25, no. 5 p.497-505x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdIH1  aOther US 7aarticle02865naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001400156245010900170300001800279500001500297520116700312650001301479650001001492650002701502650001201529650001001541650001601551650002201567650001101589650002001600650001201620650002401632650001301656650004401669650002001713650002401733650000901757650003501766650001501801650006401816650002701880651001001907653002701917700001601944700001301960700001501973700001701988700001402005700002202019773007602041852000902117856007802126930003302204945001302237946001302250655001202263IND2049907920221118223955.0960216e199511  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204990792DNAL7 a86146872pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07417862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Z.R.10aEimeria tenella infection induces recrudescence of previous Salmonella enteritidis infection in chickens  ap. 1786-1792.  a2019-12-04  aFour experiments were conducted to examine the effect of Eimeria tenella infection on the recrudescence of Salmonella enteritidis in previously infected chickens. Significant recrudescence of cecal colonization in the birds challenged with E. tenella was observed at 3 wk after S. enteritidis infection in Experiment 1, at 3 and 4 wk in Experiment 2, and at 3, 4, and 5 wk in Experiments 3 and 4. The recrudescence was indicated by .81 to 6.31 logs increase in cecal S. enteritidis counts and by higher percentages of ceca that were culture-positive. The possible prolonged cecal S. enteritidis shedding from chickens infected with coccidia into the environment might be important for the perpetuation of S. enteritidis infectious cycle. Except for Experiment 1, in which a significant higher culture-positive rate of the liver was detected in the coccidia-infected group, no significant difference of culture-positive rate of liver and spleen between the treatments was observed. The recrudescence of previous S. enteritidis infection caused by E. tenella infection was obviously related to the initial S. enteritidis dose size and time of exposure to coccidia. 3achickens 3aliver 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3arelapse 3acecum 3aplate count 3afoodborne illness 3aspleen 3aEimeria tenella 2aAnimals 2aCecumxmicrobiology 2aChickens 2aCoccidiosisxcomplicationsxveterinary. 2aEimeria tenella 2aLiverxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aRecurrence 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxcomplicationsxmicrobiology. 2aSalmonella enteritidis 3aJapan 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aArakawa, A.1 aBaba, E.1 aFukata, T.1 aMiyamoto, T.1 aSasai, K.1 aWithanage, G.S.K.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.1786-1792x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07417863Available from publisher's Web site  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02095naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245013900141300001600280520100100296650002301297650002501320650001801345650001601363650001301379650002201392650001201414650001701426650001201443650001001455650002501465650002101490650002001511700001601531773007201547852000901619930003301628945002501661946001101686655001201697IND4364373020221118223942.0040911e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436437302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Broccoli florets and stem were cooked by conventional boiling or by microwave over up to 300 s. Total phenolics were retained by up to 28.1-28.4% in the cooked florets and 55.6-57.8% in the cooked stems, and ascorbic acid by 34.1-34.4% and 29.1-29.5%, respectively. Total carotenoids were retained better compared to total phenolics and ascorbic acid. Total antioxidant activity was retained at 34.7-35.0% in the cooked florets and 34.6-34.7% in the cooked stems and phenolic antioxidant activity was retained at 37.4% and 64.7%, respectively. The results showed that antioxidant components and antioxidant activity in broccoli were lost heavily during the cooking. These losses need to be taken into account when calculating the dietary intake of these compounds from the cooked broccoli. 3aphenolic compounds 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acarotenoids 3abroccoli 3amicrowave cooking 3aboiling 3aantioxidants 3aflorets 3astems 3afood nutrient losses 3afood composition 3anutrient intake1 aHamauzu, Y.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 4 p.503-509x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02369naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245006800160300001600228520107900244650000901323650001901332650002101351650002001372650002401392650002601416650000701442650001601449650001601465650001801481650001701499650001401516650002401530650002401554650001001578650002501588651001301613653001201626700001701638700002101655700002201676700001501698773007201713852000901785930003301794945002501827946001101852655001201863IND4364373320221118223908.0040911e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436437332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Commercial Som-fug contained 11.4-16.2% protein, 1.13-1.56% lipid, 69.66-77.08% moisture, 2.45-3.60% ash and 3.37-4.90% salt. The pH values ranged from 4.56 to 4.60 and total acidity varied from 1.42% to 2.35%. Lactic acid was the major organic acid in all samples, but citric acid, succinic acid and pyruvic acid were found only in some brands. Differences in the trichloroacetic acid soluble peptides and lipid oxidation, among all samples, were observed. The proteolysis of myosin heavy chain was observed on SDS-PAGE analysis. Additionally, the formation of biogenic amines, including tryptamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine and tyramine, was observed in commercial Som-fug, but beta-phenylethylamine was not detectable in any samples. Different Som-fug samples showed different acceptabilities, especially for taste and appearance. Therefore, raw materials, ingredients and process should be factors for determining the characteristics of Som-fug products. 3afish 3afermented fish 3afood composition 3abiogenic amines 3aconsumer acceptance 3aproximate composition 3apH 3alactic acid 3acitric acid 3asuccinic acid 3apyruvic acid 3alipolysis 3aprotein degradation 3amyosin heavy chains 3ataste 3aappearance (quality) 3aThailand 0aSom-fug1 aBenjakul, S.1 aVisessanguan, W.1 aKijrongrojana, K.1 aTanaka, M.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 4 p.527-535x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02229naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245014600145300001600291500001500307520097600322650002101298650001801319650002501337650002201362650001401384650003701398650002101435650001801456650002701474650001701501650001801518653001401536700001601550700001801566700001701584700001501601700001701616773007201633852000901705930003301714945002501747946001101772655001201783IND4364373920221118223909.0040911e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436437392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTrouillas, P.12aA theoretical study of the conformational behavior and electronic structure of taxifolin correlated with the free radical-scavenging activity  ap. 571-582.  a2019-12-05  aBased on the most stable conformations of taxifolin, its electronic structure was calculated using AM1 and RHF/6-31G* treatments. BDE of the OH groups was calculated and this confirms the predominant H-transfer capacity of the 3'-OH and 4'-OH groups, compared to the 3-OH group and the OH groups of the A-ring. HOMO, characteristic of the electron-transfer capacity, is delocalized in the B-ring but, compared to quercetin, pi-electron delocalization does not occur to the 2,3-bond and the 4-keto group, which confirms the minor role of the 3-OH group in taxifolin. Also the singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of the 3-OH radical are localized on the O-atom, whereas SOMO of the 3'-OH and the 4'-OH radicals are delocalized. This is in agreement with high BDE for the first one and low BDE for the latter two. All calculations are in agreement with the structure-activity relationship established for taxifolin in the literature concerning its antioxidant activity. 3amolecular models 3afree radicals 3aspatial distribution 3aelectron transfer 3aquercetin 3astructure-activity relationships 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydroxylation 3amolecular conformation 3aantioxidants 3astereoisomers 0aflavonols1 aFagnere, C.1 aLazzaroni, R.1 aCalliste, C.1 aMarfak, A.1 aDuroux, J.L.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Dec., v. 88, no. 4 p.571-582x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/12/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02149naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245005300159300001600212520099300228650002501221650001701246650001801263650001401281650001401295650001901309650002401328650001301352650001201365650001201377650001301389650002201402650002501424650001701449650002501466700001701491700001601508700001701524773007201541852000901613930003301622945002501655946001101680655001201691IND4364174820221118223936.0040830e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436417482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPinelo, M.10aSolvent effect on quercetin antioxidant capacity  ap. 201-207.  aIn this work, a study of the evolution of antioxidant activity during quercetin degradation under different solvent and temperature conditions is undertaken. In particular, quercetin solutions in ethanol, methanol or water-ethanol mixture were stored at 22, 37 and 60 degrees C, and analysed for antiradical activity by the DPPH assay. An initial increase and a following decrease in antiradical activity were observed for quercetin solutions in ethanol and methanol. Maximum antioxidant activity was higher and occurs in a shorter time as storage temperature was increased or solvent polarity was decreased. By contrast, a progressive decrease in antioxidant activity was observed in quercetin hydro-alcoholic solutions. Differences in antioxidant activity evolution were attributed to the development of selected reaction pathways: polymerisation was the prevalent oxidative reaction pool in ethanol or methanol solutions, whilst oxidative cleavage was favoured in hydro-alcoholic ones. 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3afree radicals 3aquercetin 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3astorage temperature 3asolvents 3aphenols 3aethanol 3amethanol 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical degradation 3astorage time 3afood nutrient losses1 aManzocco, L.1 aNunez, M.J.1 aNicoli, M.C.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Nov., v. 88, no. 2 p.201-207x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050717b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/11/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02149naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245011400158300001600272500001500288520081500303650002101118650002201139650002201161650001601183650001201199650001301211650002701224650001201251650002201263650001701285650002001302650001001322650001101332650002401343650001601367653001801383700002201401700001801423700001401441700001901455700001901474773007201493852000901565930003301574945002501607946001101632655001201643IND4364175320221118223924.0040830e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436417532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

From the experiments performed at 30 degrees C with synthetic liquid media containing single sugars, the one containing fructose (pH 5.5 and 5 g/l initial kefir concentration), gave the largest biomass production (20.75 g) in a 24-h experiment. When mixtures of sugars where used, the one containing glucose and sucrose at a fixed-ratio of 1:3, was found to be the most effective, yielding 27.25 g of kefir biomass. Kinetics of sugar bioconversions were also studied. The obtained results are important for the prediction of effective, low-cost utilization of various food-grade wastes for the production of kefir biomass and its possible use as a novel baking starter. 3astarter cultures 3aenzyme substrates 3abiotransformation 3anovel foods 3aglucose 3afructose 3afood processing wastes 3asucrose 3awaste utilization 3acell culture 3aenzyme kinetics 3akefir 3abaking 3aproduct development 3alactic acid 0acarbohydrates1 aIconomopoulou, M.1 aBekatorou, A.1 aNigam, P.1 aKontominas, M.1 aKoutinas, A.A.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Nov., v. 88, no. 2 p.237-242x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050717b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/11/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02218naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001900161245014200180300001600322520099600338650000901334650001701343650001601360650002301376650002701399650001501426650001201441650001801453650002701471650002101498650001801519650002801537650003201565700001801597700001901615773007201634852000901706930003301715945002501748946001101773655001201784IND4364210020221118223919.0040831e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436421002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Corn malt was added at concentrations of 4%, 8% or 12% to corn flour. The mixtures were incubated with shaking for 2 h. Phytic acid and in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) were assayed for all treatments, while amino acid composition was assayed for the 12% mixture. The results revealed that phytate content was significantly reduced in both cooked and uncooked mixtures. The 12%, 6 day-old malt reduced the phytate content by 71% and 42% for uncooked and cooked mixture, respectively. The IVPD was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) improved as a result of malt pretreatment, while cooking significantly reduced IVPD. Amino acid content of cooked and uncooked mixture depended on the malt age. The rate of reduction of phytate content and the rate of increment in IVPD increased with age and concentration of the malt. 3amalt 3apretreatment 3aphytic acid 3adigestible protein 3ain vitro digestibility 3acorn flour 3acooking 3ablended foods 3aamino acid composition 3anutrient content 3afood analysis 3aantinutritional factors 3adetoxification (processing)1 aBabiker, E.E.1 aEl Tinay, A.H.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Nov., v. 88, no. 2 p.261-265x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20050717b20050802c00000000  aINDd1CTe2004/11/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03807naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010200180300001600282500002400298520172400322650001602046650001202062650002002074650002202094650001402116650000902130650002702139650002502166650001302191650001202204650001302216650002102229650002302250650001902273650002002292650002202312650002702334650001402361650002802375650004002403651001002443651001002453700001802463700002002481700001602501700001602517700001502533700001602548700001902564700001802583700001302601700001502614700001202629700001902641700002902660700001202689700001602701700001602717700001702733700001402750700001802764700001402782700001602796700001402812700001802826700001602844773010802860852000902968856004802977655001203025IND4410468620221118224308.0080919e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441046862DNAL7 a185875572pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-008-0825-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yinghui10aGenetic structure and diversity of cultivated soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) landraces in China  ap. 857-871.  aIncludes references  aThe Chinese genebank contains 23,587 soybean landraces collected from 29 provinces. In this study, a representative collection of 1,863 landraces were assessed for genetic diversity and genetic differentiation in order to provide useful information for effective management and utilization. A total of 1,160 SSR alleles at 59 SSR loci were detected including 97 unique and 485 low-frequency alleles, which indicated great richness and uniqueness of genetic variation in this core collection. Seven clusters were inferred by STRUCTURE analysis, which is in good agreement with a neighbor-joining tree. The cluster subdivision was also supported by highly significant pairwise F st values and was generally in accordance with differences in planting area and sowing season. The cluster HSuM, which contains accessions collected from the region between 32.0 and 40.5°N, 105.4 and 122.2°E along the central and downstream parts of the Yellow River, was the most genetically diverse of the seven clusters. This provides the first molecular evidence for the hypotheses that the origin of cultivated soybean is the Yellow River region. A high proportion (95.1%) of pairs of alleles from different loci was in LD in the complete dataset. This was mostly due to overall population structure, since the number of locus pairs in LD was reduced sharply within each of the clusters compared to the complete dataset. This shows that population structure needs to be accounted for in association studies conducted within this collection. The low value of LD within the clusters can be seen as evidence that much of the recombination events in the past have been maintained in soybean, fixed in homozygous self-fertilizing landraces. 3aGlycine max 3aalleles 3adata collection 3agenetic variation 3alandraces 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3asoybeans 2aAlleles 2aBreeding 2aCluster Analysis 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenetic Variation 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aPhylogeny 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSoybeansxclassificationxgenetics. 3aChina 0aChina1 aGuan, Rongxia1 aLiu, Zhangxiong1 aMa, Yansong1 aWang, Lixia1 aLi, Linhai1 aLin, Fanyun1 aLuan, Weijiang1 aChen, Pengyin1 aYan, Zhe1 aGuan, Yuan1 aZhu, Li1 aNing, Xuecheng1 aSmulders, Marinus.

Objective: We prospectively evaluated the association between intakes of alpha-linolenic (ALA; 18:3n-3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA; 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic (DHA; 22:6n-3), linoleic (LA; 18:2n-6), and arachidonic (AA; 20:4n-6) acids and prostate cancer risk. Design: A cohort of 47 866 US men aged 40-75 y with no cancer history in 1986 was followed for 14 y. Results: During follow-up, 2965 new cases of total prostate cancer were ascertained, 448 of which were advanced prostate cancer. ALA intake was unrelated to the risk of total prostate cancer. In contrast, the multivariate relative risks (RRs) of advanced prostate cancer from comparisons of extreme quintiles of ALA from nonanimal sources and ALA from meat and dairy sources were 2.02 (95% CI: 1.35, 3.03) and 1.53 (0.88, 2.66), respectively. EPA and DHA intakes were related to lower prostate cancer risk. The multivariate RRs of total and advanced prostate cancer from comparisons of extreme quintiles of the combination of EPA and DHA were 0.89 (0.77, 1.04) and 0.74 (0.49, 1.08), respectively. LA and AA intakes were unrelated to the risk of prostate cancer. The multivariate RR of advanced prostate cancer from a comparison of extreme quintiles of the ratio of LA to ALA was 0.62 (0.45, 0.86). Conclusions: Increased dietary intakes of ALA may increase the risk of advanced prostate cancer. In contrast, EPA and DHA intakes may reduce the risk of total and advanced prostate cancer. 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3ahumans 3ameat 3amen 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aprostatic neoplasms 3arelative risk 2aAdult 2aAged 2aCohort Studies 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDocosahexaenoic Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acids, Omega-3xadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acids, Omega-6xadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 3aUnited States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.1 aStampfer, M.J.1 aMichaud, D.S.1 aAugustsson, K.1 aColditz, G.C.1 aWillett, W.C.1 aGiovannucci, E.L.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 July, v. 80, no. 1 p.204-216dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001600181245013300197300001800330500002400348506007600372520164700448506003702095650002602132650001902158650001102177650001402188650001302202650001002215650000902225650002702234650003702261700001802298700001802316700001702334700001902351700001902370700002102389700002402410700002102434700002402455773013602479852000902615856008002624655001202704IND4414498320221207112736.0090105e20081101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441449832DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00985-082doi7 aPMC25766962pmcid7 a187910272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaing, Chad10aRapid Determination of Escherichia coli O157:H7 Lineage Types and Molecular Subtypes by Using Comparative Genomic Fingerprinting  ap. 6606-6615.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this study, variably absent or present (VAP) regions discovered through comparative genomics experiments were targeted for the development of a rapid, PCR-based method to subtype and fingerprint Escherichia coli O157:H7. Forty-four VAP loci were analyzed for discriminatory power among 79 E. coli O157:H7 strains of 13 phage types (PT). Twenty-three loci were found to maximize resolution among strains, generating 54 separate fingerprints, each of which contained strains of unique PT. Strains from the three previously identified major E. coli O157:H7 lineages, LSPA6-LI, LSPA6-LI/II, and LSPA6-LII, formed distinct branches on a dendrogram obtained by hierarchical clustering of comparative genomic fingerprinting (CGF) data. By contrast, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing generated 52 XbaI digestion profiles that were not unique to PT and did not cluster according to O157:H7 lineage. Our analysis identified a subpopulation comprised of 25 strains from a closed herd of cattle, all of which were of PT87 and formed a cluster distinct from all other E. coli O157:H7 strains examined. CGF found five related but unique fingerprints among the highly clonal herd strains, with two dominant subtypes characterized by a shift from the presence of locus fprn33 to its absence. CGF had equal resolution to PFGE typing but with greater specificity, generating fingerprints that were unique among phenotypically related E. coli O157:H7 lineages and PT. As a comparative genomics typing method that is amenable for use in high-throughput platforms, CGF may be a valuable tool in outbreak investigations and strain characterization.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3abacteriophages 3acattle 3adigestion 3agenomics 3aherds 3aloci 3aoutbreak investigation 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis1 aPegg, Crystal1 aYawney, Davis1 aZiebell, Kim1 aSteele, Marina1 aJohnson, Roger1 aThomas, James E.1 aTaboada, Eduardo N.1 aZhang, Yongxiang1 aGannon, Victor P.J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Nov. 1, v. 74, no. 21 p.6606-6615dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00985-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01743naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245004500130300001600175300003000191500020100221500001500422520063900437650002301076650001901099650002601118650001901144650002101163650001401184653002301198653003201221773007701253852000901330939003301339945000801372946001301380655001201393991560833040742620221118224317.0880428e198707  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880004182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDupont, J.10aEssential fatty acids and prostaglandins  ap. 485-492.  ap. 485-492. ill., charts.  aPresented at the "Workshop on new developments on dietary fat and fiber in carcinogenesis (optimal types and amounts of fat or fiber)," American Health Foundation, March 25-26, 1986, New York, NY.  a2019-12-05  aA technical review summarizes and discusses experimental data and recommendations concerning dietary intakes of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostaglandin biosynthesis.

However, this method is a poor simulation of the natural process of S. typhimurium infection in the field, making the practical application of results obtained under such conditions tenuous. This experiment was designed to evaluate the use of horizontal transmission for the challenge/infection of chickens with S. typhimurium with the expectation that it may more closely resemble the natural situation and, therefore, the in-field physiological response of chickens. Further, the experiment allowed for comparison of both the kinetics and magnitude of the mucosal immune response following each mode of challenge by exposing the chickens to challenge by placing them on litter with S. typhimurium-infected seeder birds. Overall, birds challenged via seeded litter exhibited a slower rate of infection and a more gradual increase in serum antibody production compared with birds receiving a single oral inoculum. 3achickens 3asimulation models 3adisease course 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3adisease transmission 3aimmune response 3ainfection 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aCecumxmicrobiology 2aChickens 2aCloacaxmicrobiology 2aDisease Transmission, Infectious 2aHousing, Animal 2aImmunity, Mucosalximmunology 2aImmunoglobulin Axblood 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aLiverxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesximmunologyxtransmission. 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalximmunologyxtransmission. 2aSalmonella typhimuriumximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aSpleenxmicrobiology 0aexperimental infection 0asimulation 0aimmunology 0aSalmonella typhimurium1 aBryden, W.L.1 aHusband, A.J.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 2 p.257-264x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02824naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001400168245009000182300001700272500002400289500001500313520131300328650001901641650002401660650002401684650002501708650001601733650002601749650002001775650001501795650003001810650001901840650002001859650001601879650001801895650001901913650001801932653003001950700001301980700001701993700001602010773011202026852000902138856009002147930003302237945002502270946001102295655001202306IND4385060620221118224220.0061109e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438506062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2006.03.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aX1001 aMarra, F.10aRadio-frequency heating of foodstuff: Solution and validation of a mathematical model  ap. 998-1006.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRadio-frequency (RF) heating is based on the interaction between the electric field produced by the electrodes of a capacitor and the dipoles and ionic-charges contained within a food product. In this paper, the temperature profiles and, particularly, the non-uniformity of temperature distribution occurring during RF heating of cylindrical meat batters, were analysed by mathematical modelling of both electromagnetic and thermal phenomena. Meat batters were chosen as sample food, with dielectric and physical property data available as a function of temperature. Temperature profiles were experimentally measured along the sample axes, for RF output powers of 100, 200, 300 and 400 W, while electromagnetic and heat equations were simultaneously solved by means of the finite element software FEMLAB. The goodness of fit of the model was evaluated by comparing numerical results with measured temperature profiles. Results showed different heating rates within the samples and, therefore, an uneven temperature distribution. The closer the temperature measurement point was to the bottom of the sample, the higher was the heating velocity. Unevenness of temperature distribution was emphasised by the applied RF output power: the higher the applied power the more uneven was the temperature distribution. 3aelectric field 3amathematical models 3athermal diffusivity 3athermal conductivity 3aradio waves 3adielectric properties 3aair temperature 3aelectrodes 3aheat transfer coefficient 3ameat emulsions 3afood processing 3aevaporation 3aspecific heat 3aheat treatment 3aheat transfer 0aelectromagnetic radiation1 aLyng, J.1 aRomano, Ṿ.1 aMcKenna, B.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Apr., v. 79, no. 3 p.998-1006dElsevier Science Pub.

We compared the responses of mature ramets of different size growing in different environments. Finally, we tested whether the response of young ramets to the severing depends on the density of surrounding vegetation. Severing decreased biomass and number of rhizomes of young ramets but did not affect their competitive tolerance. It decreased survival of mature ramets (probably due to traumata caused by cutting attached rhizomes) but did not influence total biomass of survived ramets. The response of total biomass of mature ramets to severing changed with size of the ramets. Further, biomass allocation to rhizomes changed differently after ramet severing in the two environments. The results suggest that field grown young ramets of Calamagrostis benefit from physiological integration. In contrast, mature ramets seem to be independent units according to the resource economy. Ecological benefits of integration depended on size of ramet clumps: ramets in clump had larger survival probability than control ramets. They also depended on environmental conditions: severing increased formation of new rhizomes at a sand dune subsrate, but it had a negative effect on plants in the forest experimental site. This intra-specific variation should be taken into account when trying to explain ecological patterns of integration benefits of clonal plants. 3aCalamagrostis epigejos 3avegetation 3aplant density 3arhizomes 3anutrient transport 3aplant growth 3aclones 3aCzech Republic1 aKoubek, T.1 aMunzbergova, Z.1 aHerben, T.0 tFlora.g2006, v. 201, no. 6 p.461-467dG.

Primers were based in the E element and the 3' terminus of the long terminal repeat of proviral ALV-J. PCR products were amplified from genomic DNA extracted from chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) infected with either strain HPRS-103, the prototype of ALV-J, or field isolates of ALV-J obtained from broiler breeder flocks in the United States that exhibited myeloid leukosis. The newly developed PCR detected ALV-J in DNA prepared from CEF inoculated with ALV-J but not from CEF inoculated with subgroup A, B, C, D, or E. The PCR also detected ALV-J in DNA prepared from blood, combs, and toes obtained from chickens experimentally infected with ALV-J and in DNA obtained from peripheral blood monocytes from naturally infected broiler breeder chickens. The PCR described here offers a specific and sensitive alternative to conventional virus isolation tests for ALV-J. 3abroiler chickens 3adisease diagnosis 3achicks 3aembryo (animal) 3adetection 3astrain differences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3agenes 3afibroblasts 3aavian leukosis 3ablood 3anucleotide sequences 2aAnimals 2aAvian Leukosisxdiagnosis 2aAvian Leukosis Virusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBase Sequence 2aCells, Culturedxmicrobiology 2aChick Embryo 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aDNA, Viralxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSequence Analysisxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0aexperimental infections 0aavian oncovirus 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/z463901 aWilliams, S.M.1 aFadly, A.M.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 2 p.375-380x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02025naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245006400145300001600209500002400225500001500249520037600264650003000640650001900670650001200689650002700701650002400728650001500752650002900767650001400796650002400810650001200834650001800846650003300864650003200897650002800929650002800957650001400985650002700999650005301026650002701079650004801106650001201154651001101166651002601177653005701203653001301260700002001273700001801293773006801311852000901379930003301388945001301421946001301434655001201447IND2197337420221118223944.0990303e199804  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219733742DNAL7 a96453332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeatch, J.K.10aSerologic incidence of some diseases in Kansas wild turkeys  ap. 393-396.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aWild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo, n = 1164) were tested for Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma meleagridis, Mycoplasma synoviae, and Salmonella pullorum from 1990 to 1997.

This study focused on behavioral or environmental factors that might also explain some of the variation in levels of this cardiovascular disease risk factor. The study considers the 644 women twins (597 whites, 47 blacks; ages 30-91 years) who participated in the second examination of the Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study. Cross-sectional associations of behaviors and environmental factors with Lp(a) concentration were studied before and after removing genetic influences on Lp(a) levels. Lp(a) levels were substantially higher among blacks than whites (P < 0.0001). The distribution of apo(a) size phenotypes also differed between blacks and whites, but this variation did not explain the difference in Lp(a) levels. A positive association of Lp(a) concentration with age was noted among blacks (P = 0.06) but not among whites (P = 0.86). No evidence was found for associations of Lp(a) with menopausal status, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, total or heavy recreational physical activity, 11-year weight gain, use of several antihypertensive medications, or diabetes status in either race. Among postmenopausal women, however, estrogen replacement therapy was associated with lower Lp(a) levels among whites (7.9 vs 9.9 mg/dl, P = 0.05). Removing genetic variation in Lp(a) concentration by matching 171 monozygotic (MZ) twins to their genetically identical co-twins did not alter these findings. The plasma concentration of Lp(a), unlike other lipoprotein risk factors for heart disease, has few behavioral or environmental correlates, at least among white women. Neither behavioral or environmental factors nor variation in the apo(a) size phenotype appeared to explain the higher mean Lp(a) levels among black compared with white women; further study seems warranted in larger samples of black women. 3adiabetes 3ablood lipids 3aantihypertensive agents 3awomen 3abody weight 3alipoproteins 3aphysical activity 3aalcoholic beverages 3asmoking (habit) 3aenvironmental factors 3aWhites 3ahuman behavior 3atwins 3ablood plasma 3aBlacks 2aAdult 2aBlack Peoplexgenetics. 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxprevention & control. 2aDiseases in Twinsxprevention & control 2aFemale 2aHealth Behavior 2aHumans 2aLipoprotein(a)xblood 2aMiddle Aged 2aRegression Analysis 0agenetic factors 0adrugs 0anationalities and ethnic groups1 aAustin, M.A.1 aSandholzer, C.1 aQuesenberry, C.P.

Compression tests were carried out at 1 mm min-1 load velocity to determine mechanical properties (deformation, bioyield point force, deformation energy and Poisson's ratio). Impact tests were conducted using a pendulum with 50 cm arm length to determine the absorbed energy, bruise volume and bruise susceptibility. Impact tests were carried out at two positions of the tomato, namely impact from the under side and cheek side at four drop heights (20, 30, 40 and 50 cm) to determine different impact energy levels. In addition, dimensional properties such as length, width and mass were also measured. More deformation occurred in the tomato if force was applied to the cheek side, compared with deformation in the flower-stalk side. Average deformation energy was found to be 148.5 Nmm when compression was applied to the flower-stalk side and 98.33 Nmm when applied to the cheek side. Mean Poisson's ratio was calculated as 0.388. The maximum absorbed energy was found to be 611 Nmm for the cheek side at 50 cm drop height while the minimum value was determined as 209.8 Nmm for the underside at a drop height of 20 cm. 3atomatoes 3aharvesting equipment 3afood quality 3abruising (plant) 3amechanical properties 3aheight 3aequipment design 3afruit drop 3amechanical harvesting 0adeformation energy 0abruise volume 0aimpact direction 0adrop heights 0abruise susceptibility 0abioyield force point 0apostharvest injuries 0aPoisson's ratio1 aPolat, Refik1 aAtay, Umran0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2008 June, v. 91, no. 2 p.180-186x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/05/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02747naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001600195245012000211300001700331500002400348520129100372650001601663650001501679650001301694650001901707650002301726650001701749650001001766650002501776650001401801650002501815650002401840653002601864653002701890653002501917700001501942700002601957700001801983773008902001852000902090856007302099930003302172945002502205946001102230655001202241IND4385037020221118224013.0061107e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438503702DNAL7 a220634212pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ402 0aQ5021 aSeyfert, M.10aEfficacy of lactic acid salts and sodium acetate on ground beef colour stability and metmyoglobin-reducing activity  ap.  134-142.  aIncludes references  aThis study examined two concentrations (0.6 and 1.0 mol) of three lactic acid salts (calcium lactate, CaL; potassium lactate, KL; and sodium lactate, NaL), with and without 0.01 mol sodium acetate (n = 3 replications), for effects on ground beef colour stability and metmyoglobin-reducing activity (MRA). Ground beef with CaL was least colour stable (P < 0.05). Increasing CaL and NaL concentration decreased (P < 0.05) colour stability. Ground beef with acetate only was most colour stable (P < 0.05), but it did not result in more MRA (P > 0.05) than control ground beef. Including both lactate and acetate was not as effective (P > 0.05) in increasing colour stability as acetate alone. In general, both KL levels were equal (P > 0.05) to the lower NaL concentration, and all three were superior in colour stability (P < 0.05) to CaL and the higher NaL concentration. More MRA was generated by including lactates (P < 0.05); KL and NaL had more MRA than CaL (P < 0.05). However, these increases in MRA did not result in improved colour stability. Overall, adding KL to ground beef would not increase ground beef colour stability over adding nothing, but CaL and high levels of NaL would decrease colour stability. Using 0.01 mol sodium acetate maximized ground beef colour stability. 3aground beef 3amarinating 3alactates 3asodium acetate 3asalt concentration 3abeef quality 3acolor 3aappearance (quality) 3amyoglobin 3aantioxidant activity 3aoxidative stability 0acalcium lactate (CaL) 0apotassium lactate (KL) 0asodium lactate (NaL)1 aHunt, M.C.1 aLundesjo Ahnstrom, M.1 aJohnson, D.E.0 tMeat science.g2007 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p. 134-142dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.06.0223electronic resource  a20070130b20070202c00000000  aINDdPNNe2007/01/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02490naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008100130300001400211520123900225650001101464650002201475650002401497650001201521650002201533650001001555650000901565650001401574650001101588650001401599650001401613650001301627650002001640650001501660650001401675650001001689650001401699650003701713650001701750650000901767700001901776773008901795852000901884856008301893939003301976946001102009655001202020IND4482867920221118224119.0140708e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448286792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qiang-Sheng10aMycorrhizal influence on nutrient uptake of citrus exposed to drought stress  ap. 25-32.  aThe study evaluated the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on growth and nutrient uptake of trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) exposed to drought stress. The experiment was carried out using a randomized block design with six replications. The factors studied included application and nonapplication of Glomus versiforme and two levels of drought stress (stress and without stress). Drought stress significantly reduced AM colonization. Mycorrhizal seedlings exhibited greater growth characteristics (fresh and dry weights and leaf area) compared with non-AM seedlings under drought stress and non-drought stress conditions. Concentrations of P, K and Ca in the leaves and concentrations of P, Ca and Fe in the roots were higher in AM than in non-AM seedlings subjected to either non-drought stress or drought stress conditions. AM colonization also increased leaf concentrations of Fe and Zn and root concentrations of K and Mg in seedlings under stress conditions. Mycorrhizal effect responses to N, P, K, Ca, Fe, Mn and Zn were higher under stress than under non-stress conditions. The improved nutrient uptake in colonized seedlings demonstrates the potential of AM symbiosis to enhance drought resistance in citrus. 3aCitrus 3aGlomus versiforme 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3acalcium 3adrought tolerance 3afungi 3airon 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aroots 3aseedlings 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater stress 3azinc1 aZou, Ying-Ning0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2009 Mar., v. 92, no. 1 p.25-32x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/PAS3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140708  aNon-US 7aarticle02531naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001900144245009900163300001400262500001500276520117500291650001601466650002501482650001101507650001001518650001901528650002401547650001101571650002201582650001701604650001301621650002801634650001101662650002301673650002401696650003501720653001901755700001801774700001701792700001501809700001701824700001701841773008901858852000901947930003301956945002501989946001102014655001202025IND4412313620221118224126.0081106e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441231362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In the process using SC CO2 extraction in a Supercritical Fluid Extraction System (SFE), the temperature of extraction was varied from 35-50 0C, while the pressure applied was 9.1-11.1 MPa. The flow rate of CO2 to the reactor was maintained at 0.5 m3 h-1. Steam distillation was conducted using a standard bench scale setup. The extracts from both methods were analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the variations of the composition were reported. The study showed that better oil quality in terms of composition was produced from the air dried raw materials than from direct heat drying. The essential oil extracted from air dried lemongrass leaves by SFE process contained 94.4% citral, 1.14% myrcene and 0.5% limonene, showing a composition similar to the reference standard. In contrast, the oil from the air dried lemongrass stems fell short in terms of purity. SFE was found to be a superior process than steam distillation, producing better quality essential oil containing 90% Citral. 3atemperature 3achemical composition 3adrying 3astems 3aessential oils 3aCymbopogon citratus 3acitral 3amass spectrometry 3adistillation 3asteaming 3ahigh pressure treatment 3ayields 3agas chromatography 3aessential oil crops 3asupercritical fluid extraction 0aheat treatment1 aMaridable, J.1 aGaspillo, P.1 aHasika, M.1 aMalaluan, R.1 aKawasaki, J.0 tPhilippine agricultural scientist.g2008 Mar., v. 91, no. 1 p.36-41x1655-97117nnas  aDNAL  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03409naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001700166245007400183300001600257500010000273500002400373500001500397520175100412650002302163650002902186650004102215650002902256650002502285650002002310650001902330650001802349650001102367650001602378650002202394653001302416653002402429653002202453653001402475700001502489700001702504700001502521700001902536700002102555700001502576773011402591852000902705856007202714930003302786945002502819946001102844655001202855IND4385045520221118223906.0061108e20060515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438504552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aCoombs, D.K.10aCytokine responses to EHV-1 infection in immune and non-immune ponies  ap. 109-116.  aIn the special issue: Equine Herpesvirus-1 / edited by D.P.

Repeated infection with EHV-1 leads to protective immunity against clinical respiratory disease, and a study was conducted to measure the regulatory cytokine response (IFN-γ and IL-4) in repeatedly infected immune ponies compared to non-immune ponies. Two groups of four ponies were established. Group 1 ponies had previously been infected on two occasions, and most recently 7 months before this study. Group 2 ponies had no history no vaccination or challenge infection prior to this study. Both groups were subjected to an intranasal challenge infection with EHV-1, and blood samples were collected pre-infection, and at 7 and 21 days post-infection for preparation of PBMCs. At each time point, the in vitro responses of PBMCs to stimulation with EHV-1 were measured, including IFN-γ and IL-4 mRNA production, and lymphoproliferation. Group 1 ponies showed no signs of clinical disease or viral shedding after challenge infection. Group 2 ponies experienced a biphasic pyrexia, mucopurulent nasal discharge, and nasal shedding of virus after infection. Group 1 ponies had an immune response characterized both before and subsequent to challenge infection by an IFN-γ response to EHV-1 in the absence of an IL-4 response, and demonstrated increased EHV-1-specific lymphoproliferation post-infection. Group 2 ponies had limited cytokine or lymphoproliferative responses to EHV-1 pre-challenge, and demonstrated increases in both IFN-γ and IL-4 responses post-challenge, but without any lymphoproliferative response. Protective immunity to EHV-1 infection was therefore characterized by a polarized IFN-γ dependent immunoregulatory cytokine response. 3avertebrate viruses 3aEquid alphaherpesvirus 1 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3alymphocyte proliferation 3adisease transmission 3aimmune response 3ahorse diseases 3ainterleukin-4 3ahorses 3ainterferons 3adisease incidence 0aimmunity 0aEquid herpesvirus 1 0apathogen shedding 0acytokines1 aPatton, T.1 aKohler, A.K.1 aSoboll, G.1 aBreathnach, C.1 aTownsend, H.G.G.1 aLunn, D.P.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2006 May 15, v. 111, no. 1-2 p.109-116dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.01.0133electronic resource  a20070125b20070202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/12/01  aNon-US 7aarticle01257naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002200117245001800139300001200157500001500169520048800184650001400672650001000686650001900696650001200715650001800727653001100745653001800756653001800774653002000792773006900812852000900881939003300890945000800923655001200931991560825280742620221118223847.0780201e197708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794435712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowen, William H.10aDental caries  ap. 1-2.  a2019-12-06  aFluoride and carbohydrates in the form of sugar are the major nutrients which influence the development of dental caries.

When a habit of frequent nocturnal bottle or breast feeding is maintained beyond a year of age, the potential for gross dental decay in very young children is established. Bovine milk, milk formulas and human breast milk have all been implicated in the condition of "nursing bottle caries" because of their lactose content. Additional sweetners in the nursing bottle, the use of fruit juices or the use of honey dipped pacifiers can also cause "nursing bottle caries." This can be prevented through a timely educational program to new parents. Prevention is particularly applicable in young children since a healthy oral condition promotes good nutrition, a healthy state and normal growth. 3ainfants 3abottle feeding 3adental caries 3abreast milk 3alactose 3amilk 0apreventive dentistry 0aNursing bottle caries0 pContemporary Nutrg1978 May, v. 3, no. 5 p.1-2x0198-00097nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19781101c00000000  aFNC 7aarticle01216naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099100002900117245002400146300001200170520061100182650001400793650001300807650001100820650001200831773006900843852000900912939003300921945000800954655001200962991560824550742620221118224014.0770901e197704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7794427952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheologides, Athanasios.10aCancer and anorexia  ap. 1-2.  aProfound anorexia leading to malnutrition is a common and disturbing manifestation of cancer and has a poorly understood pathogenesis.

Specificity to GPV was confirmed by Southern hybridization. With restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR products, two isolates differed from the other 15 isolates by the absence of restriction sites for HincII and Bg/II and the presence of EcoRI site. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR products from the different groups revealed that one group is GPV and the other group is Muscovy duck parvovirus (MDPV).

It was shown that batter and biscuit properties were influenced by the conditions of aeration. The major changes mostly took place in the first 20 min of aeration. The main trends for batter properties were that OR and bubble number increased with duration, whereas flow index first increased and then decreased with duration. OR and consistency index were lower at 1000 rpm. The main trends for biscuit properties were that for a 1-min duration central height of biscuits was high, and work and crumb density were low. As duration increased, central height of biscuits decreased, work slightly increased and crumb density increased. Concerning the effect of rotation speed, it was shown that work, maximum force and crumb density had higher values at 1000 rpm than at other rotation speeds. The positive linear relations between crumb density and maximum force or work confirmed that the densification of the crumb led to a stronger mechanical resistance of the biscuit. As regards the relations between the properties of the batter and the biscuits, CCA (canonical correlation analysis) results showed significant links between batter and biscuit texture and between the set of sensory indicators and batter properties. However, no significant link was found between batter and biscuit aeration. Finally, significant relations between NADH spectra and textural properties and between NADH spectra and crumb density were shown using CCA and PLSR (partial least squares regression). 3awater content 3acakes 3adesserts 3abiscuits 3abatters 3aaeration 3abaking quality 3arheological properties 3abubbles 3aparticle size 3atexture 3adimensions 3adensity 3awater activity 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3atryptophan 3amechanical properties 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3asensory evaluation 3adiameter1 aAllais, I.1 aTrystram, G.1 aGros, J.B.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Apr., v. 79, no. 3 p.1020-1032dElsevier Science Pub.

In this study, a non-destructive, image-based method was evaluated for predicting mechanical properties of fried, breaded chicken nuggets. The textural parameters of interest, namely maximum load, energy to break point, and toughness of fried chicken nuggets were measured. Values of the parameters changed over frying time. Images of the chicken nuggets were collected at different frying stages and five image texture indices were extracted using co-occurrence matrix. A multiple-layer feed-forward neural network was established to predict the three mechanical parameters. The correlation coefficients of the predicted results with those from mechanical tests were above 0.84. 3afried foods 3aimage analysis 3ashear strength 3atexture 3acoated foods 3achicken meat 3ahardness 3ameat cuts 3ashear stress 3adeep fat frying 3acooking quality 3aprediction 3anondestructive methods 0amechanical properties1 aWang, N.1 aNgadi, M.O.1 aKazemi, S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Apr., v. 79, no. 3 p.1065-1070dElsevier Science Pub.

Here, we focused on the N-glycans of amyloid precursor protein whose cleaved fragment, β-amyloid, is thought to cause much of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously determined the N-glycan structures of normal and mutant amyloid precursor proteins (the Swedish type and the London type). In comparison with normal amyloid precursor protein, mutant amyloid precursor proteins had higher contents of bisecting GlcNAc residues. Because N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III) is the glycosyltransferase responsible for synthesizing a bisecting GlcNAc residue, the current report measured GnT-III mRNA expression levels in the brains of AD patients. Interestingly, GnT-III mRNA expression was increased in AD brains. Furthermore, β-amyloid treatment increased GnT-III mRNA expression in Neuro2a mouse neuroblastoma cells. We then examined the influence of bisecting GlcNAc on the production of β-amyloid. Both β-amyloid 40 and β-amyloid 42 were significantly decreased in GnT-III-transfected cells. When secretase activities were analyzed in GnT-III transfectant cells, α-secretase activity was increased. Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of GnT-III in AD brains may represent an adaptive response to protect them from additional β-amyloid production. 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3abrain 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosyltransferases 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amutants 3apatients 3apolysaccharides 3aprotective effect1 aManya, Hiroshi1 aSakurai, Yōko.1 aWojczyk, Boguslaw S.1 aKozutsumi, Yasunori1 aSaito, Yuko1 aTaniguchi, Naoyuki1 aMurayama, Shigeo1 aSpitalnik, Steven L.1 aEndō, Tamao.0 tGlycobiology.g2010 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.99-106x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp1523Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02246naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001700177245011300194300001800307500002400325500001500349520080900364650001301173650002401186650001301210650002401223650000901247650001901256650001301275650001301288650001801301650001201319650002501331653002401356653001101380653001801391700001501409700001701424700001801441773011301459852000901572856009001581930003301671945002501704946001101729655001201740IND4385061720221118224052.0061109e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438506172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2006.01.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ500 0aX1001 aGonzalez, C.10aEnthalpies of mixing and heat capacities of mixtures containing acetates and ketones with corn oil at 25 °C  ap. 1104-1109.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study concerns the determination of molar enthalpies of mixing for mixtures composed by acetates (ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate and isobutyl acetate) and ketones (2-butanone, 3-pentanone and 4-methyl-2-pentanone) + corn oil at 25 °C and atmospheric conditions. In the design of heat transfer and process equipment employed in the oils and seed processing industry, the knowledge of enthalpy of the organic solvent-oil mixtures is a determinant factor. All the binaries show the same trend, a decrease of temperature is observed when the mixture is carried out. An effect endothermic takes place as consequence of the new reorganization of molecules. The aim of this study was therefore to calculate the heat capacities at constant pressure for the studied systems. 3aenthalpy 3amathematical models 3aacetates 3aambient temperature 3acorn 3aesterification 3acorn oil 3amixtures 3aheat transfer 3aketones 3aatmospheric pressure 0aphysical properties 0aesters 0aheat capicity1 aResa, J.M.1 aConcha, R.G.1 aGoenaga, J.M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Apr., v. 79, no. 3 p.1104-1109dElsevier Science Pub.

Desorption isotherms were determined at 5, 20 and 50C over a relative humidity range of 10-95%. The Guggenheim, Anderson and de Boer models were found to be suitable for description of the sorption data. The samples reached equilibrium moisture of 0.10 ± 0.01 g water/g dry matter. Fick's second law model was used to calculate the effective diffusivity (6.25-24.32 x 10⁻¹⁰ m²/s). In addition, experimental data were fitted by means of seven mathematical models. The kinetic parameters and the diffusion coefficient were temperature-dependent and were evaluated by an Arrhenius-type equation. The modified Page model obtained the best-fit quality on experimental data according to statistical tests applied. The main utility of this study is the application of both different empirical models and the diffusional model in tropical fruits' dehydration, which can be considered a basis for a very accurate estimation of drying time and the optimization of the same process. Two newly mathematical models are proposed in this study, through which a good fit on the data of experimental moisture content was achieved. The study of drying of papaya cultivated in Chile engages a great technological interest, because this product is widely used in the development of different products such as candying, canning, juice, syrup and marmalade. In addition, papayas cultivated in Chile, along with other tropical fruits cultivated in Brazil, Colombia and the Caribbean, have become especially important in the exportations of these countries. The major markets for these products include the U.S.A., the European Community and Asia. 3acanning 3adesorption 3adiffusivity 3adrying 3aequations 3ajuices 3amarkets 3amarmalades 3amathematical models 3apapayas 3aproduct development 3arelative humidity 3asyrups 3atemperature 3awater content 3aAsia 3aBrazil 3aChile 3aColombia1 aBETORET, N.1 aVEGA-GALVÉZ, A.1 aLARA-ARAVENA, E.0 tJournal of food process engineering.g2009 Oct., v. 32, no. 5 p.645-663dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4530.2007.00236.x 7aarticle02455naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011900145300001600264500002400280500001500304520061700319650002300936650001200959650003600971650000801007650001401015650002601029650001001055650001401065650001201079650003401091650007001125650007401195650003601269650003501305650000901340650006001349650002101409650002601430651002901456651002901485653001401514653001901528653001301547653001201560653002101572653001401593700001301607700001501620700001901635700001901654700002001673773006801693852000901761930003301770945001301803946001301816655001201829IND2196035320221118223811.0981216e199801  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219603532DNAL7 a95331062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoepke, D.C.10aIsolation and identification of Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale from commercial turkey flocks in the upper midwest  ap. 219-222.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aIncreased death loss was seen in a flock of 22-wk-old tom turkeys.

Further investigation by tracheal swab culture of 261 flocks between 5 and 7 wk of age resulted in detection of O. rhinotracheale in 43% of the flocks. 3atemporal variation 3aturkeys 3aOrnithobacterium rhinotracheale 3aage 3apneumonia 3atrachea (vertebrates) 3alungs 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aGram-Negative Bacterial Infectionsxdiagnosisxmortalityxveterinary. 2aLiverxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aLungxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aMale 2aPneumonia, Bacterialxdiagnosisxmortalityxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseases 2aTurkeysxmicrobiology 3aMidwestern United States 0aMidwestern United States 0aoutbreaks 0aidentification 0asymptoms 0alesions 0aclinical aspects 0aisolation1 aBack, A.1 aShaw, D.P.1 aNagaraja, K.V.1 aSprenger, S.J.1 aHalvorson, D.A.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 1 p.219-222x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02483naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245005000145300001600195500002400211500001500235520086700250650004201117650002501159650001101184650001701195650001801212650001201230650002201242650001601264650001901280650001901299650001201318650005401330650001201384650002201396650001301418650001801431650001301449650001301462650003401475650001101509650003801520650001601558650002201574651001001596653001301606653002101619653002001640700001501660700001501675700001301690700001801703773006801721852000901789930003301798945001301831946001301844655001201857IND2196034820221118224126.0981216e199801  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219603482DNAL7 a95331042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, K.10aSystemic amyloidosis in laying Japanese quail  ap. 209-214.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aSystemic amyloidosis was seen in laying Japanese quail in a flock of a farm rearing 95,000 birds.

Most hypotheses for translocation success are elaborate, hierarchical, and untested combinations of socio-ecological predictors. Empirical support for those tested is vulnerable to spurious single-predictor relationships and does not account for the hierarchy amongst predictors and non-independence amongst individuals or cohorts. Testing hypotheses as a priori multi-level models promotes stronger inference. 2. We apply a 25-year (1981-2005) data base including 89 reintroduction and 102 restocking events that released 682 black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis into 81 reserves to test 24 hypotheses for translocation success, defined as survival to 1 year post-release. We made information-theoretic comparisons of hypotheses represented as hierarchical models incorporating random effects for reserve and release cohort predictors of death. 3. Mortality rates after restocking were higher than for reintroductions (13·4 cf. 7·9%, respectively) due largely to intraspecific fighting. No predictors strongly influenced reintroduction success, although cohorts consisting entirely of adult males were 8·2% of individuals but contributed 21·9% of deaths, and reserves with lowest carrying capacities (i.e. <0·1 rhino km⁻²) had a 16·3% mortality rate. Most models for restocking success were not supported. Only those including age class received substantial support. Age was the only predictor to strongly influence death rates. Predictors previously thought influential, like population density, reserve area and quality, and cohort size, were not supported. 4. Synthesis and applications. Simple rules succeeded where complex ecological and demographic hypotheses failed to predict survival after translocation of critically endangered black rhinoceros. Results support bold attempts by managers at translocations towards species recovery in most ways that they have historically occurred. Groups of rhinoceros of different size and composition can be successfully moved over large distances between different ecological contexts. Also, the release of cohorts into reserves that are relatively small, poorer habitat or already stocked need not be avoided so long as calves and all-male cohorts are not reintroduced, and only adults used for restocking. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of information-theoretic comparisons of a priori hierarchical models to test hypotheses for conservation management. We caution against interpreting simple correlations or regression amongst a large number of nested ecological and demographic variables. 3aDiceros bicornis 3afighting behavior 3amales 3amodels 3aguidelines 3acase studies 3amortality 3apopulation density 3adeath 3acalves 3ahabitats 3adatabases 3aadults 0afighting (behavior)1 aAdcock, Keryn1 adu Preez, Pierre1 aSwaisgood, Ron R.1 aLaw, Peter R.1 aKnight, Michael H.1 aGedir, Jay V.1 aKerley, Graham I.H.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2011 Apr., v. 48, no. 2 p.493-502dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.01960.x 7aarticle03088naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245006600149300001600215500002400231520123300255650001301488650002601501650001401527650001801541650001001559650001001569650001101579650001301590650001001603650001001613650001001623650002201633650002201655650001501677650001601692650001201708650003301720650003801753650003301791650003601824650004401860650001601904650003301920650003801953650005001991650001002041650003302051650001702084650003702101650003402138650001702172653001902189653001702208700001702225700001602242700002002258773006802278852000902346930003302355945001302388946001302401655001202414IND2180750520221118224058.0981030e199710  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218075052DNAL7 a94549372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorter, R.E.

Three trials were conducted in which ligated intestinal segments of anesthetized 8-wk-old chickens were injected with 0.2-, 0.5-, 2-, 6-, 10-, or 20-mu diameter fluoresceinated latex microspheres. Microspheres were counted in brush border, epithelium, and lamina propria of each intestinal segment, liver, and spleen. After 1 hr, the 0.2-, 0.5-, and 2-mu microspheres were oriented along the brush border of epithelial cells and microsphere uptake into the epithelium and lamina propria was observed in the duodenum, ileum, cecum, cecal tonsil, and colon. Uptake of microspheres of 6, 10, and 20 mu diameter into epithelium and lamina propria was not observed in any intestinal segment. Also, no microspheres of any diameter were observed in sections of liver and spleen to suggest that there was no appreciable entry of microspheres into the bloodstream within 1 hr after administration. The results indicated that uptake of microspheres by the chicken intestine is a size-dependent process with microspheres less than or equal to 2 mu being taken up to an equal extent by most segments of intestine. 3achickens 3aintestinal absorption 3aparticles 3aparticle size 3alatex 3aliver 3aspleen 3aduodenum 3aileum 3acecum 3acolon 3ablood circulation 3aintestinal mucosa 3amicrovilli 3afluorescein 2aAnimals 2aCecumxcytologyxphysiology. 2aChickensxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aColonxcytologyxphysiology. 2aDuodenumxcytologyxphysiology. 2aEpithelial Cellsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aFluorescein 2aIleumxcytologyxphysiology. 2aIntestinal Absorptionxphysiology 2aIntestinesxcytologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aLatex 2aLiverxcytologyxphysiology. 2aMicrospheres 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 2aSpleenxcytologyxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 0alamina propria 0acecal tonsil1 aSuckow, M.A.1 aMacri, N.P.1 aBowersock, T.L.0 tAvian diseases.g1997 , v. 41, no. 4 p.981-987x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle01567naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245006100146300001800207500002400225500001500249520032700264650002100591650001000612650002900622650001100651650001100662650001700673650001200690650002500702650002800727650006400755650003700819650001400856650003800870651001300908653001500921700001800936700001700954773007000971852000901041930003301050945001301083946001301096655001201109IND2180751020221118224035.0981030e199710  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218075102DNAL7 a94549412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapman, H.D.10aBroiler chicken with a duplicated lower intestinal tract  ap. 1003-1005.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aA case is described of a duplicated lower intestinal tract in a broiler chicken.

Also noted histologically in this region were epidermal hyperplasia and ballooned epidermal cells containing intracytoplasmic inclusions indicative of fowl pox-virus. 3achickens 3anecrosis 3aflocks 3aEchidnophaga gallinacea 3ainflammation 3aFowlpox virus 3acase studies 3aviruses 3amortality 3aincidence 3ahistopathology 2aAnimals 2aChickensxparasitology 2aEctoparasitic Infestationsxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aFowlpoxxcomplicationsxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmortality. 2aSiphonaptera 2aSkinxpathology 3aCalifornia 0aCaliforniaxepidemiology. 0askin 0asymptoms 0alesions1 aBickford, A.A.1 aCooper, G.L.1 aCharlton, B.R.0 tAvian diseases.g1997 , v. 41, no. 4 p.1006-1009x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03677naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245014100145300001400286500002400300500001500324520155000339650002501889650001801914650002201932650002001954650002601974650001902000650003802019650001502057650001402072650001402086650001002100650001202110650002902122650001802151650001002169650001402179650001302193650001902206650003802225650004502263650003802308650003402346650005402380650000902434650001802443650003102461650002502492650003702517650003102554650001502585650001702600650001202617650003602629653001502665653001602680653001002696653001502706653001502721653002702736700001502763700001902778773006602797852000902863930003302872945001302905946001302918655001202931IND2196028420221118223956.0981216e199801  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219602842DNAL7 a95330782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafer, A.L.10aDevelopment and validation of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of type A influenza antibodies in avian sera  ap. 28-34.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aSerologic screening of avian sera for group-specific antibodies to type A influenza is currently accomplished by using the avian influenza (AI) agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA) was developed using a baculovirus vector, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, expressing the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 influenza virus. The recombinant NP was obtained by inoculation of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells or Trichoplusia ni insect larvae with the recombinant baculovirus. A hybridoma cell line producing monoclonal antibody against influenza virus A nucleoprotein was used to generate mouse ascitic fluid for the CELISA. The nucleoprotein and the monoclonal antibody were used without further purification in a CELISA for detection of avian-origin serum antibodies to type A influenza. The AI AGID and CELISA tests were compared for sensitivity and specificity using 1651 experimental and reference antisera. Samples discrepant in AGID and CELISA test results were further evaluated by the AI indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), hemagglutination-inhibition (HI), and neuraminidase-inhibition (NI) tests. The results demonstrated a high degree of correlation between the AGID and CELISA test results, with the IFA, HI, and NI tests offering additional support of CELISA test specificity. The CELISA is a rapid, economical, sensitive, and specific serodiagnostic method for screening large numbers of avian sera for antibodies to avian influenza virus. 3arecombinant antigens 3aserodiagnosis 3aInfluenza A virus 3agene expression 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aviral proteins 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3acell lines 3ascreening 3adetection 3abirds 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aBaculoviridae 2aBirds 2aCell Line 2aChickens 2aEggsxvirology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aHemagglutination Inhibition Tests 2aInfluenza A virusximmunology 2aInfluenza in Birdsxbloodxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aMice 2aNeuraminidase 2aNucleoproteinsximmunology 2aRNA-Binding Proteins 2aRecombinant Proteinsximmunology 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpodoptera 2aTransfection 2aTurkeys 2aViral Core Proteinsximmunology 0aevaluation 0acomparisons 0aserum 0aantibodies 0aimmunology 0aimmunologic techniques1 aKatz, J.B.1 aEernisse, K.A.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 1 p.28-34x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02920naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001300166245007500179300001600254500002400270500001500294520124400309650002101553650002701574650002201601650002201623650002801645650005201673650002101725650001501746650002501761650001701786650001401803650001001817653004701827653002801874653002501902653003701927653001801964700001401982700001201996700001402008700001402022700001102036700001302047700001702060773011502077852000902192856007202201930003302273945002502306946001102331655001202342IND4385083220221118224106.0061111e20061115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438508322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.06.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL800 0aL2001 aQiao, S.10aCloning and characterization of porcine Fc gamma receptor II (FcγRII)  ap. 178-184.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aReceptors for the Fc region (FcγRs) of IgG play a crucial role in the immune system and host protection against infection. In the present study, we describe the cloning, sequencing and characterization of porcine FcγRII. By screening a translated EST database with the protein sequence of the human FcγRII (CD32) we identified a putative porcine homologue. Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we isolated the full-length cDNA encoding porcine FcγRII from peripheral blood leucocyte RNA. The porcine FcγRII cDNA was 1488 bp long, encoding a 297 amino acid trans-membrane glycoprotein composed of two immunoglobulin-like extracelluar domains, a trans-membrane region and a cytoplasmic tail with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM). The predicted amino acid sequence was found to be 67% and 52% identitical with human and mouse FcγRIIB. RT-PCR indicated porcine FcγRII transcripts expressed in liver, alveolar, mesenteric lymph node and PBLs. COS-7 cells transfected with the pig FcγRII cDNA were able to bind chicken erythrocytes sensitized with porcine IgG. Identification of porcine FcγRII will aid in the understanding IgG-FcγR interactions, and may help in developing new immunization protocols. 3aimmunoglobulin G 3atransmembrane proteins 3aamino acid motifs 3acomplementary DNA 3aexpressed sequence tags 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3abinding proteins 3aleukocytes 3aamino acid sequences 3aerythrocytes 3areceptors 3aswine 0arapid amplification of cDNA ends technique 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0aimmune system1 aZhang, G.1 aXia, C.1 aZhang, H.1 aZhang, Y.1 aXi, J.1 aSong, H.1 aLi, Xunjing.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2006 Nov. 15, v. 114, no. 1-2 p.178-184dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2006.06.0123electronic resource  a20070308b20070402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/02/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03172naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012700145300001600272500002400288500001500312520135000327650001101677650001101688650001401699650001701713650002001730650001401750650001301764650001101777650002101788650001601809650002601825650001901851650001501870650001901885650002501904650001201929650005701941650007501998650006302073650005602136650003502192650002102227650002302248650003402271650001702305653001502322653001102337653001302348653001502361653001402376700002002390773006802410852000902478930003302487945001302520946001302533655001202546IND2196031320221118224318.0981216e199801  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219603132DNAL7 a95330912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardue, S.L.10aImprovement of poult performance following Bordetella avium challenge by administration of a novel oxy-halogen formulation  ap. 140-145.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aThe ability of a novel oxy-halogen formulation (OHF) to alter the development of bordetellosis (turkey coryza) in large white turkey poults was assessed. Bordetella avium (BA)-infected (1-day-of-age) and noninfected control poults received 0, 0.008%, or 0.016% of an OHF continuously in the drinking water. At 4, 7, 10, 14, and 17 days of age, reisolation of BA from infected poults was attempted. Infected poults receiving 0.016% OHF exhibited significantly lower cumulative BA reisolation rates (90%) when compared with infected poults receiving 0 (96.7%) or 0.008% OHF (100%). At 7, 14, and 17 days of age, infected poults in the OHF-treated groups were significantly heavier than those BA-challenged poults receiving control water. Feed utilization was significantly improved from hatch to 7 days of age in BA-infected poults receiving OHF when compared with infected poults receiving control water. Clinical symptoms were severe only in untreated, infected poults and were mild or absent in all others. Damage to the tracheal epithelium, as measured by scanning electron microscopy, paralleled the clinical signs. Tracheal epithelial damage was virtually eliminated by OHF administration in infected poults. These results suggest that OHF treatment ameliorates many of the symptoms frequently associated with bordetellosis in young turkeys. 3aweight 3apoults 3ainfection 3adrug therapy 3afeed conversion 3amorbidity 3ahalogens 3adosage 3aBordetella avium 3afeed intake 3atrachea (vertebrates) 3adrinking water 3aepithelium 3adisease course 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aBordetellaxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aBordetella Infectionsxdrug therapyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aEpithelial Cellsxdrug effectsxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aHalogensxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPoultry Diseases 2aTracheaxpathology 2aTurkeysxgrowth & development 2aWater Supply 0aefficiency 0agrowth 0asymptoms 0aprevention 0aisolation1 aLuginbuhl, G.H.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 1 p.140-145x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle03872naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010700145300001400252500002400266500001500290520195800305650001302263650001402276650001802290650002502308650001502333650001302348650001602361650002002377650003802397650001902435650003602454650003002490650001402520650001202534650002902546650004702575650003802622650001402660650001302674650002302687650003802710650001102748650002002759650004502779650005402824650000902878650002802887650003002915650005202945650001502997650001703012653001303029653001503042700001903057773006603076852000903142930003303151945001303184946001303197655001203210IND2196030120221118224354.0981216e199801  pau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219603012DNAL7 a95330842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDybing, J.K.10aAntigenic and immunogenic properties of baculovirus-expressed infectious bursal disease viral proteins  ap. 80-91.  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aGenomic segment A of the variant Md infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) was amplified by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and expressed in the baculovirus expression system. Three different baculovirus recombinants expressing the genes encoding VP2, VP2/VP4, and the complete polyprotein (VP2/VP4/VP3) were prepared. The three antigens were used in separate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and each detected antibodies against the variant IBDV strains Md, Del-A, Del-E, and GLS and the classic IBDV strain D78 throughout a 14-wk period following vaccination. Eight-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were inoculated subcutaneously using the VP2/VP4 or VP2/VP4/VP3 baculovirus recombinant or wild-type baculovirus-infected insect cell lysates. Virus-neutralizing antibodies were detected in the VP2/VP4 and VP2/VP4/VP3 baculovirus-inoculated birds at 13 days postinoculation (PI) and at 43 days PI when titrated against Md IBDV. No virus-neutralizing antibody titer was observed in the negative controls or wild-type baculovirus-inoculated birds. One-week-old SPF chickens were inoculated with the VP2, VP2/VP4/VP3 baculovirus recombinants or wild-type baculovirus-infected insect cell lysates. The birds were boosted 2 wk later and challenged at 4 wk of age with 0.5 ml/bird classic STC IBDV (10(2) median embryo infective dose [EID50]/ml) or variant Md IBDV (10(5) EID50/ml) via the oral/nasal route. The VP2 and VP2/VP4/VP3 baculovirus-inoculated birds were partially protected against challenge with the classic STC IBDV. The birds were protected against clinical disease and death but not bursal damage, whereas the wild-type baculovirus-inoculated birds exhibited clinical signs of disease, 13% mortality, and bursal damage. When challenged with the variant Md IBDV, neither the VP2, VP2/VP4/VP3 baculovirus recombinants nor the wild-type baculovirus elicited protection against bursal damage and atrophy. 3achickens 3amorbidity 3aBaculoviridae 3arecombinant proteins 3aantibodies 3avaccines 3avaccination 3agene expression 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aviral proteins 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3ainfectious bursal disease 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aAntigens, Viralxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aCapsidxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aCell Line 2aChickens 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aGenetic Vectors 2aInfluenza A virusxgeneticsximmunology. 2aInfluenza in Birdsxbloodxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aMale 2aNucleopolyhedroviruses. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aSpodoptera 2aTransfection 0asymptoms 0aimmunology1 aJackwood, D.J.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 1 p.80-91x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02895naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177072000900186100001400195245011100209300001600320500002400336520128300360650001801643650000901661650001201670650002001682650000901702650002001711650001301731650001701744650001801761650002101779650001701800650001901817650000701836650002701843650001701870650001001887650001101897650001301908650001201921650001401933650002301947700001501970700001501985700001402000773011102014852000902125856009002134930003302224945002502257946001102282655001202293IND4385058420221118224330.0061109e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438505842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2006.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ402 0aQ502 0aQ112 0aQ3021 aTan, F.J.10aEffect of replacing pork backfat with yams (Dioscorea alata) on quality characteristics of Chinese sausage  ap. 858-863.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the qualities of Chinese sausages where part of the fat was substituted with yams (Dioscorea alata) during manufacturing and then the sausages were stored at 4 °C. Four treatments of Chinese sausages were manufactured by replacing pork backfat with 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% yams. After manufacturing, sausages were vacuum-packaged and stored at 4 °C for 21 days. The results showed that the moisture contents of the products significantly (P < 0.05) increased when more yams were added, while the crude fat content significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. The yam-added samples had higher water holding capacity and water activity than the control but no significant (P > 0.05) difference in pH values were observed. Samples with more yams added had lower TBA, L* and a* color values and higher VBN values. The products with 5% yams added had no significant (P > 0.05) difference in color, flavor, hardness, juiciness, and overall acceptability when comparing with the control. Based on the results of overall acceptability, it can be concluded that yams can be used as a fat replacer in the manufacture of Chinese sausages up to a level of 5%. Such a replacement results in the production of Chinese sausages with about 22% less fat content. 3awater content 3apork 3abackfat 3afat substitutes 3ayams 3aDioscorea alata 3asausages 3afood storage 3arefrigeration 3avacuum packaging 3astorage time 3awater activity 3apH 3awater holding capacity 3ameat quality 3acolor 3aflavor 3ahardness 3atexture 3ajuiciness 3afood acceptability1 aLiao, F.Y.1 aJhan, Y.J.1 aLiu, D.C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Apr., v. 79, no. 3 p.858-863dElsevier Science Pub.

This sensor system is based on a low-cost image sensor and a low-cost programmable microcontroller. We have demonstrated that an unsupervised image-processing algorithm can generate reliable results by capturing just one image of the axi-symmetric object from a fixed projection. The volume and surface area are computed by approximating the object as a sum of elementary right conical frustums. The analytical and experimental results suggest that this automated sensor system is potentially a good alternative to manual measurements for axi-symmetric agricultural products, with an overall cost of under US$50. 3aautomatic detection 3aimage analysis 3afood surfaces 3avolume 3alimes 3asurface area 3acosts and returns 3abiosensors 3atamarinds 3aeggs 3aalgorithms 3alemons 0aagricultural products 0afruits (food)1 aNguang, S.K.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Apr., v. 79, no. 3 p.870-877dElsevier Science Pub.

In 1994, the ts-11 strain was introduced on the farm; each new placement flock was vaccinated by eyedrop with ts-11 for one production cycle, and then all subsequent placement flocks were left unvaccinated. Birds were monitored by culture and serology before and after vaccination. MG isolates were characterized by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). MG was isolated from ts-11-vaccinated flocks up to 100 wk of age; all such isolates tested by RAPD were ts-11 type. After ts-11 vaccination was discontinued, no MG was detected in nonvaccinated birds. After the last vaccinated flock was marketed, no MG was detected on the farm. These results indicate a potential use for ts-11 in an MG eradication program. 3ahens 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3adisease control 3alive vaccines 3astrain differences 3avaccination 3aimmunology 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBacterial Vaccines 2aChickens 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Directxveterinary 2aImmunization Schedule 2aMycoplasmaxgeneticsximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aPoultry Diseasesxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Techniquexveterinary 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxmicrobiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aVaccinationxveterinary 0aidentification1 aKleven, S.H.0 tAvian diseases.g1998 , v. 42, no. 2 p.404-407x0005-20867nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdCLD  aOther US 7aarticle02040naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011000166300001800276520087000294650002701164650001501191650001901206650001101225650002001236650001701256650000901273650001301282650000701295650001301302650001501315650001901330650002701349700002201376773010601398852000901504856008501513930003301598946001101631655001201642IND4429322720221118223934.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442932272DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1379-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Dhruv K. 10aSynthesis of a New Cu(II)-Ion Imprinted Polymer for Solid Phase Extraction and Preconcentration of Cu(II)  ap. 1539-1545.  aA new Cu(II)-ion imprinted polymer (IIP) has been synthesized by copolymerizing salicylic acid and formaldehyde as a monomer and crosslinker, respectively in the presence of Cu(II)-4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol complex. The imprinted Cu(II) ions were completely removed by leaching the IIP with 0.05 M EDTA. The maximum adsorption capacity for Cu(II) ions was 310 μg g⁻¹ at pH 6. The IIP was repeatedly used in adsorption-desorption experiments for seven times with recoveries ~95%. The relative selectivity factor (α r) values of Cu(II)/Zn(II), Cu(II)/Cd(II), Cu(II)/Ni(II) and Cu(II)/Co(II) are 3.17, 2.90, 2.47 and 3.37, respectively. The detection limit corresponding to three times the standard deviation of the blank was found to be 3.0 μg L⁻¹. The developed IIP has also been tested for preconcentration and recovery of Cu(II) ions from water samples. 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aadsorption 3achromatography 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aformaldehyde 3aions 3aleaching 3apH 3apolymers 3aresorcinol 3asalicylic acid 3asolid phase extraction1 aMishra, Shraddha 0 tChromatographia.g2009 Dec., v. 70, no. 11-12 p.1539-1545dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-009-1379-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01783naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009400162300001800256520076800274650001701042650003401059650001101093650001101104650001501115650002501130650001601155700001201171700001801183773010601201852000901307856008501316930003301401946001101434655001201445IND4429322820221118224037.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442932282DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1343-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Xueling 10aChemometric Approach for Simultaneous Optimization of Resolution and Analysis Time in CCC  ap. 1547-1552.  aThe chemometric approach combining Box-Behnken response surface model and Derringer's desirability function was applied for simultaneous optimization of resolution and analysis time in countercurrent chromatography (CCC). The mergence of the two parameters was accomplished using the Derringer's desirability function with subsequent optimization by a Box-Behnken response surface design. The developed model was checked by statistical analysis. By implementing the optimal flow rate, rotation speed and temperature predicted by the validated model, enhanced resolution between two similar analytes (phenol and resorcinol) was achieved in a reasonable time. The analyses and results obtained in this paper will benefit to improve the efficiency of CCC separation. 3achemometrics 3acountercurrent chromatography 3amodels 3aphenol 3aresorcinol 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature1 aLi, Ye 1 aYuan, Qipeng 0 tChromatographia.g2009 Dec., v. 70, no. 11-12 p.1547-1552dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-009-1343-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03080naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245006000150300001400210300002200224500001500246520134800261650002001609650000801629650001701637650003501654650002101689650002301710650001601733650001901749650003401768650001901802650001001821650005601831650002301887650002801910650001701938650006101955650001802016650001102034650004502045650000902090650001602099650002802115650001002143650002302153653002602176653001702202653002202219700001802241700001902259700001802278700002002296773007502316852000902391939003302400945000802433946001302441655001202454991560814040742620221118224110.0910211e199001  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910001542DNAL7 a23205572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHavlik, R.J.10aDietary protein and blood pressure in monozygotic twins  ap. 31-39.  ap. 31-39. charts.  a2019-12-05  aCross-sectional studies relating blood pressure to dietary intake have shown equivocal results, in part due to the inability to take into account the strong genetic component of blood pressure. Intervention studies, using the same subject as his own control, often encounter additional problems when subjects are asked to adhere to an alternate diet. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study of middle-aged men provided information concerning the possible relationship of food-frequency-estimated nutrient intake to blood pressure while controlling for genetic effects in a free-living group of subjects. Using differences in monozygotic twins, a direct association of dietary protein intake and diastolic blood pressure was identified and persisted after adjustment for known covariates of blood pressure. Adjusting for known covariates and holding total calories constant, a 9-g difference in daily protein intake was directly associated with a 1 mm Hg difference in diastolic blood pressure. For protein intake as a percentage of total calories, a 2.18% difference was directly associated with a 1 mm Hg difference in diastolic blood pressure. The co-twin-control method provides a powerful design to address the interrelationships between nutrients and blood pressure in an observational as well as an experimental setting. 3adietary protein 3amen 3ablood lipids 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3atriacylglycerols 3amiddle-aged adults 3acholesterol 3aprotein intake 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ablood pressure 2aAdult 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aEnergy Intake 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxbloodxetiologyxgenetics. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aTriglyceridesxanalysis 2aTwins 2aTwins, Monozygotic 0adiet study techniques 0adiet history 0amonozygotic twins1 aFabsitz, R.R.1 aKalousdian, S.1 aBorhani, N.O.1 aChristian, J.C.0 tPreventive medicine.g1990 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.31-39x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03781naa a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245007600148300001600224300002400240520183800264650002802102650001102130650001602141650001602157650001902173650002302192650001602215650002202231650001202253650001302265650002002278650002302298650002302321650000902344650001002353650002002363650002302383650002002406650000902426650003102435650001902466650001602485650001602501650003802517650001002555650002102565650002302586650001102609650001102620650001102631650000902642650002102651650001702672650001602689650002302705651002502728651002502753653002002778653001202798700001902810700002002829700001802849700001602867773007702883852000902960939003302969945000803002946001303010655001203023991560813720742620221118224129.0920213e199107  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920002542DNAL7 a18710762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBush, P.J.10aRelationships among Black families' cardiovascular disease risk factors  ap. 447-461.  ap. 447-461. charts.  aBackground. As participants in the District of Columbia Studies of Children's Activity and Nutrition (D.C. SCAN), 262 black mothers and two of each mother's children (3-4 and 8-10 years of age) were measured in their homes for selected cardiovascular disease risk factors: serum total cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, height and weight for body mass index, fitness (sum of pulses), activity, and triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Results. For each measure, mothers in the highest quartile were more likely to have children who were also in the highest quartile, and mothers in the lowest quartile were more likely to have children who were in the lowest quartile. For the physiological measures, (with the exception of systolic blood pressure), correlations tended to be stronger between the siblings than between the younger child and the mother, and older siblings' physiological measures contributed to the prediction of younger siblings' physiological measures after controlling for mothers' physiological measures. Relationships between family cardiovascular disease risk factor history and children's serum total cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels tended to be gender related; i.e., family cardiovascular disease risk factors on the mother's side were more likely to be related to levels among the female but not the male children and vice versa. When personal characteristics were controlled for, the family's cardiovascular disease history was related more strongly to the younger than to the older sibling's systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. Conclusions. Results tend to substantiate the importance of screening and counseling other family members, especially a child of the same gender as the parent with a cardiovascular disease or an elevated risk factor level. 3acardiovascular diseases 3aBlacks 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3ablood pressure 3afamilial incidence 3abody weight 3aphysical activity 3amothers 3asiblings 3aschool children 3apreschool children 3agender differences 3aboys 3agirls 3adietary surveys 3askinfold thickness 3abody mass index 3arisk 2aBlack or African American. 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Height 2aBody Weight 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiology 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCholesterolxblood 2aFamily 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPhysical Fitness 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 2aSkinfold Thickness 3aDistrict of Columbia 0aDistrict of Columbia 0aage differences 0afitness1 aIannotti, R.J.1 aZuckerman, A.E.1 aO'Brien, R.W.1 aSmith, S.A.0 tPreventive medicine.g1991 July, v. 20, no. 4 p.447-461x0091-74357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02096naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245008400155300001600239300002400255520078700279650000901066650002901075650001601104650002501120650002101145650002801166650001001194650005801204650000901262650001101271650000901282650001601291650003201307650001201339651001101351653002501362711012301387773007701510852000901587939003301596945000801629946001301637655001201650991560813640742620221118224113.0840229e198301  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840040502DNAL7 a68443022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHjermann, Ingvar.12aA Randomized primary preventive trial in coronary heart disease: The Oslo Study  ap. 181-184.  ap. 181-184. charts.  aA 5-year randomized study in Oslo, Norway of 1232 healthy normotensive, high-risk coronary males (ages 40-50) assessed whether dietary reduction of elevated blood lipids and cessation of smoking could reduce initial attacks of coronary heart disease. Mean serum cholesterol was 13% lower, mean fasting triglycerides were reduced 20%, and tobacco consumption declined about 45% in the intervention groups relative to controls. Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction incidence was reduced by 47% by the end of the 5-year study in the intervention group, relative to controls.

The QPO of A. actinomycetemcomitans is the only characterized QPO, but homologues of the qpo gene are widely distributed among many gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophils ducreii, Bacteroides fragilis, and Escherichia coli. One-third of the amino acid sequence of QPO from the N-terminal end is unique, whereas two-thirds of the sequence from the C-terminal end exhibits high homology with the sequence of the diheme bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase. In order to obtain sufficient protein for biophysical studies, the present study aimed to overproduce recombinant QPO (rQPO) from A. actinomycetemcomitans in E. coli. Coexpression of qpo with E. coli cytochrome c maturation (ccm) genes resulted in the expression of an active QPO with a high yield. Using purified rQPO, we determined the midpoint reduction potentials of the three heme molecules. 3aActinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aamino acid sequences 3acytochrome c 3acytochrome-c peroxidase 3aelectron transport chain 3agenes 3aheme 3aperoxidase 3aperoxidation 3asequence homology 0aAggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0arecombinant protein 0aredox property 0aquinol peroxidase1 aYamada, Hiroyuki1 aYamashita, Tetsuo1 aMatsushita, Kazunobu1 aKonishi, Kiyoshi0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2010 Jan., v. 302, no. 1 p.52-57dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01830.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04284naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072000900160072000900169072000900178100001300187245015900200300001800359500002400377500001500401520178200416650002802198650002102226650002102247650001602268650000902284650002302293650002502316650001502341650002802356650002802384650001802412650001802430650001402448650001702462650002102479650001402500650001702514650002702531650001502558650001602573650002302589650001602612650002202628650002002650650001102670650002302681650001502704650001902719650003302738650001202771650002302783650001302806650003802819650001102857650004002868650002602908650002602934650002002960650001702980653002402997653001503021653002503036653002103061700001703082700001903099700001803118773012103136852000903257856008103266930003303347945002503380946001303405655001203418IND4424830220221118224103.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442483022DNAL7 a197007042pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2008-16322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aQ501 0aQ2011 aHiss, S.10aShort communication: Relationship between metabolic status and the milk concentrations of haptoglobin and lactoferrin in dairy cows during early lactation  ap. 4439-4443.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo investigate the relationship between metabolic status and the acute phase proteins haptoglobin (Hp) and lactoferrin (Lf) in milk, the concentrations of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and Hp were determined in blood samples collected weekly from 4 wk prepartum until 12 wk postpartum. Haptoglobin and Lf were determined in weekly milk samples. The cows (n = 49) were retrospectively classified according to NEFA and BHBA concentrations using different time intervals and threshold values for NEFA and BHBA, respectively. For BHBA, 4 threshold concentrations, (0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.6 mM) were evaluated either at the first week before calving, at wk 1 or 2 postpartum, or when considering the means of wk 2 and 3 postpartum. For NEFA, the tested thresholds were 0.5 and 0.6 mM at wk 1 prepartum, wk 1 or 2 postpartum, or the means of wk 1 and 2 postpartum. All variables showed changes during the interval of observation. Comparing the time course of the acute phase proteins in the subgroups classified according to BHBA or NEFA, consistently greater concentrations of Hp in serum and milk and of Lf in milk were observed in those animals with BHBA concentrations above 1.6 mM during the last week before calving (n = 3/47) than in those with BHBA concentrations below this threshold. For NEFA, analogous differences for Hp in both serum and milk (0.52 ± 0.07 and 18.1 ± 4.6 for NEFA >0.6 mM vs. 0.36 ± 0.04 mg/mL and 8.46 ± 1.63 μg/mL for NEFA <0.6 mM, respectively) and for Lf in milk (130 ± 8.5 vs. 89.2 ± 7.1 μg/mL, respectively) were detected when a threshold of 0.6 mM at wk 2 postpartum was used. Our results indicated that cows having BHBA and NEFA serum concentrations above these thresholds at defined times could be identified. 3aMycoplasma californicum 3aMycoplasma bovis 3afree fatty acids 3asuspensions 3amilk 3aanalytical methods 3aacute phase proteins 3adairy cows 3ainterspecific variation 3abacterial contamination 3afood analysis 3aketone bodies 3abulk milk 3amilk quality 3aprepartum period 3adetection 3ahaptoglobins 3achemical concentration 3ametabolism 3ablood serum 3astrain differences 3alactoferrin 3apostpartum period 3aearly lactation 3amixing 3afood contamination 3amilk tanks 3acentrifugation 2a3-Hydroxybutyric Acidxblood 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDairying 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aHaptoglobinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aLactationxphysiology 2aLactoferrinxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aTime Factors 0aspecies differences 0aMycoplasma 0abeta-hydroxybutyrate 0amilk composition1 aWeinkauf, C.1 aHachenberg, S.1 aSauerwein, H.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.4439-4443dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-16323Available from publisher's Web site  a20100114b20100205c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/10/27  aOther US 7aarticle02902naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245011600172300001600288520130200304650001301606650001301619650001601632650002301648650000901671650001701680650002301697650001601720650002001736650001301756650001801769650001901787650001201806650003901818650003601857650004601893650001301939650004301952650001101995650001802006650001102024650000902035650002302044650001602067650001702083653001702100773007302117852000902190856007802199930003302277945001302310946001302323655001202336IND2046605820221118224213.0950628e199504  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204660582DNAL7 a77922292pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07405932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarks, H.L.10aSelection for high eight-week body weight in normal and dwarf chickens under high-protein and high-energy diets  ap. 593-600.  aA study was conducted to examine genetic parameters associated with selection for high 8-wk BW in normal and dwarf Athens Canadian randombreds under two nutritional environments (high protein and high energy) and to determine the influence of the selection diet on subsequent water to feed ratios and abdominal fat levels. High-protein lines (HP) received a diet containing 25% CP and 3,100 kcal ME/kg, whereas high-energy lines (HE) received a 22% CP diet containing 3,200 kcal ME/kg. Body weights, selection gains, selection differentials, and heritabilities were similar for normal HP and HE lines. There was evidence, however, that the realized heritability was greater in the HE than the HP dwarf line. Similar selection differentials indicate that this difference was apparently due to the expression of greater genetic variation in the HE dwarf line. Water intake, feed intake, water to feed ratio, and abdominal fat data for the four lines under "selection" and "reciprocal" environments differed between experiments. In Experiment 1, when fed the HE diet, normal birds selected under the HP environment had higher (P < .05) water to feed ratios and lower abdominal fat levels than contemporaries selected under the HE diet. However, these differences were not significant in Experiment 2. 3adwarfing 3achickens 3abody weight 3aselection criteria 3adiet 3aheritability 3astrain differences 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3agenotype 3aabdominal fat 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aChickensxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDrinking 2aDwarfismxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aMale 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSex Factors 2aTime Factors 0awater intake0 tPoultry science.g1995 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.593-600x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07405933Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02509naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001700156245009600173300001600269500001500285520104400300650001501344650001501359650002701374650001801401650001701419650001301436650001701449650001201466650002701478650003201505650001101537650003101548650003101579650006401610651001901674653001901693653001201712653002701724653002001751700001301771773007301784852000901857856007801866930003301944945001301977946001301990655001202003IND2046615520221118224158.0950628e199504  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204661552DNAL7 a77922352pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07406382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, R.H.10aObservations on disinfection regimens used on Salmonella enteritidis infected poultry units  ap. 638-647.  a2019-12-04  aStudies carried out at the laboratory and in the field identified many potential problems during disinfection of poultry units naturally contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis. There appeared to be variations in the efficiency of commonly used disinfectants within a disinfectant group when used in a contaminated house. It was possible for Salmonella and other coliforms to be amplified during the pressure washing or steam cleaning process. If an effective terminal disinfectant was not used after this, then high levels of Salmonella were likely to persist. The efficiency of the disinfection regimen was not directly dependent on the standard of physical cleaning if this was carried out to a reasonable standard, as a high level of elimination of Salmonella could be achieved even in the presence of substantial quantities of residual organic matter. Disinfection regimens involving formaldehyde, either as part of a terminal compound disinfectant spray or as a final fogging agent, were found to be the most effective in the field. 3afumigation 3asanitizing 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3aspraying 3aformaldehyde 2aAnimals 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFormaldehydexpharmacology 2aHousing, Animalxstandards 2aSalmonella enteritidisxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 3aUnited Kingdom 0acoliform count 0afogging 0aSalmonella enteritidis 0achicken housing1 aWray, C.0 tPoultry science.g1995 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.638-647x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07406383Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03217naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163072001700180100001700197245011500214300001600329500001500345520150600360650002101866650001301887650001401900650001501914650001501929650002601944650001901970650002101989650002702010650001902037650001902056650002602075650002002101650002502121650002602146650001202172650002202184650001302206650001402219650001902233651001902252653002202271700001602293700001402309700001402323700001802337773009602355852000902451856008602460930003302546945002502579946001102604655001202615IND4400160020221118224331.0080118e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440016002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2007.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

(Czech Republic): Residual effect of long-term fertilization after 62 years  ap. 337-342.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the study was to investigate how plant species' composition, soil parameters and nutrient concentrations in plant biomass differ between fertilized and control plots 62 years after the last fertilizer application on a sub-alpine grassland. A piece of land called the Grass Garden (GG), fertilized with wood ash and manure for at least 200 years, was rediscovered in the Giant Mts. (Krkonoše, Karkonosze) in 2006. The last fertilization was applied in 1944. The central part of GG (treatment A), the edge of GG (treatment B) and never-fertilized control plots outside of GG (treatment C) were distinguished. Sixty-two years after the last fertilization Nardus stricta was dominant in treatment C and Deschampsia cespitosa and Avenella flexuosa in treatments A and B. The predominance of these grasses was first described in 1786 and repeatedly during the 19th and 20th centuries and indicated the long-term stability of plant species' composition in the sub-alpine grassland. In the case of GG, long-term fertilization has had a long-term “stable after-effect” upon differences in plant species' composition. Ca concentration in the soil was more than two times higher in treatments A and B than in the control, indicating that it was very difficult to deplete applied Ca even on extreme podzol soils and under the climatic conditions of the sub-alpine vegetation belt. In above-ground plant biomass, Mg and P concentrations and N:P ratio were still significantly affected by treatment. 3anutrient content 3awood ash 3amountains 3aphosphorus 3agrasslands 3along term experiments 3aanimal manures 3aresidual effects 3afertilizer application 3asoil chemistry 3asoil fertility 3aDeschampsia cespitosa 3aplant nutrition 3aDeschampsia flexuosa 3abotanical composition 3acalcium 3aplant communities 3anitrogen 3amagnesium 3aNardus stricta 3aCzech Republic 0aspecies diversity1 aHejcman, M.1 aPavlu, V.1 aVacek, S.1 aPodrazsky, V.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 Feb., v. 123, no. 4 p.337-342x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2007.07.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01554naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245003500134300001400169520079700183650002200980650002601002653001901028653001001047653002001057653002001077653003201097773006001129852000901189939003301198945000801231946001301239655001201252991560811290742620221118224423.0810409s1980    xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI810008172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevey, Gail A.10aNutrition for the golden years  ap. 18-19.  aAging causes physiological changes in body systems, changes in body composition, metabolic slow-down and a decrease in physical activity.

  1 aVesace, V.L.10aAppraisal of random and systematic land cover transitions for regional water balance and revegetation strategies  ap. 328-336.  a2019-12-06  aThis study describes the use of landscape transition analysis as a means for effective basin management. Land cover transitions from 1995 to 2002 were analyzed using a cross-tabulation matrix for an important economic zone in south-west Victoria, Australia. Specifically, the matrix was used to determine whether the transitions were random or systematic. Random landscape transitions occur when a land cover replaces other land covers in proportion to their availability. Systematic landscape transitions occur when there are deviations from random patterns, and land use types 'target' other land use types for replacement. The analysis was conducted with 11 land cover categories and showed that dryland pastures have been systematically losing area to dryland crops and blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations. Dryland crops have systematically expanded in the north-east of the catchment, an area where increasing in-stream salinization has occurred concurrently with this transition. The systematic expansion of the blue gum plantations has been predominantly in the south-west of the catchment and has the potential to reduce stream flows and groundwater recharge in an already water-stressed region, as blue gums use more water than the dryland pastures they are replacing. All other transitions were largely random. These findings have implications for land use planning in the study area for regional water balance and revegetation strategies. Landscape transition analysis is a cost-effective means of contributing to the management of water resources at a regional scale, and is highly recommended for future basin planning. 3atemporal variation 3aagroecosystems 3astream flow 3agroundwater recharge 3asoil salinization 3apastures 3awatershed management 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3adryland farming 3awater stress 3aland restoration 3aspatial variation 3aforest plantations 3aland use 3acrops 3aVictoria (Australia) 0alandscape transition analysis 0avegetation1 aIerodiaconou, D.1 aSagnitti, F.1 aHamilton, A.J.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2008 Feb., v. 123, no. 4 p.328-336x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2007.07.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03613naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245014000171300001600311500001500327520171500342650002102057650001002078650001702088650002202105650002302127650002102150650002402171650001602195650001702211650002302228650001102251650002002262650001702282650001602299650001202315650004302327650001102370650002602381650004502407650000902452650001602461650001602477650002402493650002102517653003102538653001702569653001602586653001402602653002002616700001702636700001702653700001802670700001902688700001402707773007202721852000902793856007802802930003302880945001302913946001302926655001202939IND2052633620221118223920.0960815e199605  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205263362DNAL7 a87229072pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07505952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhn, E.R.14aThe use of intermittent lighting in broiler raising. 2. Effects on the somatotrophic and thyroid axes and on plasma testosterone levels  ap. 595-600.  a2019-12-04  aMale and female broiler chicks were raised separately in nearly continuous lighting [23 h light (L):1 h dark (D), CL] and consumed feed ad libitum. At 7 d of age, the intermittent lighting schedule (1L:3D, IL) was imposed on half of the chicks, whereas the other chicks remained under CL. In addition to performance characteristics, several parameters of the somatotrophic and thyrotrophic axes were studied together with plasma concentrations of testosterone. Males had a higher growth rate than females regardless of the imposed lighting schedule and this pronounced growth difference is reflected by higher plasma concentrations of growth hormone (GH), and a better GH receptor occupancy. Differences in growth rate between sexes could not be attributed to differences in circulating 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) levels or to hepatic deiodination activities. However, from 3 wk of age onwards, males had significantly higher plasma testosterone levels than females. Plasma GH and T3 levels decreased whereas plasma insulin-like growth factor-I and thyroxine levels increased with age in all experimental groups. The age-related decline in plasma GH levels were less pronounced for males than for females. No major changes in other hormonal parameters or deiodination activities could be observed as a result of imposing IL, except for the higher plasma GH levels of IL chickens, and for plasma testosterone concentrations in IL males at Day 41, which were twice the levels found in their CL counterparts. These results therefore suggest that the somatotrophic axis as well as circulating testosterone levels mediate the sex-related differences in growth rate and the compensatory growth as present in males. 3abroiler chickens 3aliver 3asomatotropin 3ahormone receptors 3agender differences 3atriiodothyronine 3acompensatory growth 3aphotoperiod 3ablood plasma 3aad libitum feeding 3achicks 3aenzyme activity 3atestosterone 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aChickensxbloodxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aMale 2aPhotoperiod 2aSex Factors 2aTestosteronexblood 2aThyroxinexblood 0ainsulin-like growth factor 0adeiodination 0agrowth rate 0athyroxine 0aage differences1 aDarras, V.M.1 aGysemans, C.1 aDecuypere, E.1 aBerghman, L.R.1 aBuyse, J.0 tPoultry science.g1996 May, v. 75, no. 5 p.595-600x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07505953Available from publisher's Web site  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03843naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245014300171300001600314520222700330650002102557650001102578650002302589650001902612650001002631650001102641650002102652650001602673650001802689650002202707650001602729650001602745650001602761650001802777650001202795650001602807650001302823650001102836650002102847650002102868650003302889650004302922650000902965650001502974650001702989653002003006653002103026773007203047852000903119856007803128930003303206945001303239946001303252655001203265IND2052639620221118223911.0960816e199605  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205263962DNAL7 a87229122pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07506322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartov, I.10aInterrelationship between the effects of dietary factors and feed withdrawal on the content and composition of liver fat in broiler chicks  ap. 632-641.  aFour experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of the composition and pelleting of diets fed to broiler chicks up to marketing age on changes in their liver size and the content and composition of liver fat due to feed withdrawal (FW) during 0, 10, and 24 h. Birds not exposed to FW that were fed diets with high energy to protein ratio (E:P) and diets in pelleted form--diets that increase fattening--had significantly (P < 0.05) higher liver fat content than those fed diets with the recommended E:P and in mash form, respectively. Those fed pellets also had higher liver weight. Dietary energy level did not affect these variables. Feed withdrawal for 10 or 24 h decreased, at times significantly, liver weight and its fat content, irrespective of the diets fed previously. The values observed after FW were not affected by the dietary factors evaluated. The composition of liver fatty acid in chicks not exposed to FW was markedly affected by increases in dietary energy (soybean oil) level and E:P. The main effects of the former were increased levels of stearic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids and a decreased level of oleic acid; those of the latter were an increased level of oleic and decreased levels of stearic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids. Irrespective of the diets used, FW increased the concentrations of stearic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids, and decreased those of palmitic and oleic acids. This effect on arachidonic acid was consistently significant, whereas the effects on the other fatty acids were significant in two out of three experiments. Due to these effects of FW, part of the differences in the composition of liver fatty acids caused by dietary factors observed in fed chicks, completely disappeared after FW. The length of FW (10 vs 24 h) did not affect liver size or fat content, but the concentrations of oleic and arachidonic acids in liver fat were significantly higher in birds exposed to 24 h of FW. It was concluded that the composition and form of the diets markedly affect liver weight and the content and composition of its fat in birds not exposed to FW. The effects of the dietary factors on liver size and its fat content completely disappear after 24 h of FW. 3abroiler chickens 3achicks 3arestricted feeding 3apelleted feeds 3aliver 3aweight 3afeed formulation 3abody weight 3aenergy intake 3awater deprivation 3afatty acids 3alipogenesis 3afatty liver 3aabdominal fat 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickens 2aFemale 2aFood Deprivation 2aFood, Formulated 2aLipidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aLiverxanatomy & histologyxchemistry. 2aMale 2aOrgan Size 2aTime Factors 0anutritive ratio 0afat mobilization0 tPoultry science.g1996 May, v. 75, no. 5 p.632-641x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07506323Available from publisher's Web site  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03337naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001900156245014300175300001600318520144500334650002101779650001501800650001501815650001601830650002001846650001001866650001701876650002101893650002101914650001201935650002301947650005401970650001202024650003002036650003102066650005502097650001302152650001902165650002002184650000902204650003502213650004902248650002802297650004302325650004702368653002902415653001302444653001302457653001202470700002202482773007302504852000902577856007802586930003302664945001302697946001302710655001202723IND2051488120221118223944.0960531e199601  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205148812DNAL7 a86501002pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07501112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, R.D.10aAdditive effects of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol and phytase on phytate phosphorus utilization and related parameters in broiler chickens  ap. 111-119.  aTwo experiments were conducted to compare the effects of supplementation with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] and a commercial phytase on P utilization by broiler males. Experiment 1 was conducted with three levels of total dietary P (0.45, 0.55, and 0.65%) in corn-soybean meal diets supplemented with 5 microgram/kg of 1,25-(OH)2D3, 600 units/kg of phytase, or the combination of these supplements in a factorial arrangement from 0 to 21 d in battery brooders. A second experiment was conducted with a similar design except that it was carried out in floor pens for a period of 35 d. In Experiment 1, maximal BW was obtained at 0.65% P in chicks receiving the basal diet, 0.55% P in chicks receiving phytase or 1,25-(OH)2D3, and 0.45% P in chicks fed both supplements. Bone ash for chicks receiving the basal, phytase, 1,25-(OH)2D3, and combination treatments at 0.45% total dietary P were 26.6, 34.9, 35.1, and 38.8%. There were significant interactions between phytase and 1,25(OH)2D3 for BW, bone ash, and incidence of rickets. Similar results were noticed in Experiment 2, with the exception that 1,25-(OH)2D3 had little influence on BW from 0 to 3 wk, likely due to slightly higher dietary P. From 3 to 5 wk, BW and bone ash were increased by each supplement and further increased by their combination. These interactions suggest different mechanisms of action for these supplements in influencing phytate P utilization. 3abroiler chickens 3acalcitriol 3aphosphorus 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3atibia 3ablood plasma 3adietary minerals 3afeed supplements 3aexcreta 3anutrient retention 2a6-Phytasexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aCalcitriolxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aChickens 2aDrug Synergism 2aFood, Fortified 2aMale 2aPhosphorusxbloodxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aPhytic Acidxmetabolism 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & control 2aRicketsxprevention & controlxveterinary. 0ahypophosphatemic rickets 0aphytates 0abone ash 0aphytase1 aEdwards, H.M.

We found a significant difference in the RI and PI in nonneoplastic vs. neoplastic medial iliac and mesenteric lymph nodes. Values higher than 0.67 for the RI and 1.02 for the PI in medial iliac lymph nodes and higher than 0.76 for the RI and 1.23 for the PI in mesenteric lymph nodes had a high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating benign from neoplastic lymph nodes. 3adogs 3aabdomen 3alymph nodes 3aneoplasms 3adisease diagnosis 3adiagnostic techniques 2aAbdomen 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aLymph Nodesxphysiologyxphysiopathologyxultrasonography. 2aLymphatic Metastasisxultrasonography. 2aMale 2aUltrasonography, Doppler, Pulsedxveterinary 0aabdominal lymph nodes 0aresistive index 0apulsatility index1 aGomez-Ochoa, P.1 aDe Blas, I.1 aGascon, M.1 aAcena, C.1 aCorda, A.1 aSosa, I.1 aGregori, T.1 aCouto, G.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2009 , v. 50, no. 5 p.525-529dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01580.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2009.01580.x  a20091021b20091106c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/10/04  aOther US 7aarticle02959naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245011600174300001600290500001500306520157800321650001901899650001801918650001801936650001301954650001801967650001901985650002202004650001202026650002502038650001102063650002602074650002702100650000902127650001702136653001702153653002202170653002002192700001602212700001802228773007302246852000902319856007802328930003302406945001302439946001302452655001202465IND2051488720221118224138.0960531e199601  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205148872DNAL7 a86501042pmid7 a10.3382/ps.07501352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReddish, J.M.10aAnalysis of poultry fertility data. 3. Analysis of the duration of fertility in naturally mating Japanese quail  ap. 135-139.  a2019-12-04  aThe purpose of the present study was to test the appropriateness of iterative least squares regression for the evaluation of fertility data in naturally mating quail. In each of four trials, 20 male and 200 female randombred Japanese quail were housed in stacked breeder cages. Paired females were exposed to their assigned male for a single 48-h period. Eggs were collected for 2 wk following removal of the male, incubated, and fertility determined by visual inspection at egg breakout. In Trials 1 and 3, sexually experienced males were placed with experienced and inexperienced females, respectively. In Trials 2 and 4, inexperienced males were placed with experienced and inexperienced females, respectively. Duration of fertility, by male, was analyzed by iterative least squares, using the model y(x) = gamma/(1 + e beta(tau - x)) Overall fertility was analyzed with a log odds model following transformation to logits. Iterative least squares provided estimates of fertility duration of 3.75 to 9.18 d, with significant (P < 0.05) differences in the duration of fertility observed between individual males as well as between the trials. Differences (P < 0.05) in overall fertility (17.7 to 58.3%) were also observed, with inexperienced males paired with experienced females exhibiting the lowest overall means. Taken together, these results suggest that iterative least squares may be used to evaluate fertility in naturally mating populations and that reproductive experience can have a profound effect on the interpretation of fertility in naturally mating quail. 3anatural mating 3aleast squares 3aegg fertility 3aduration 3adata analysis 3amale fertility 3aCoturnix japonica 2aAnimals 2aCoturnixxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFertilityxphysiology 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMale 2aTime Factors 0areproduction 0asexual experience 0aJapanese quails1 aKirby, J.D.1 aAnthony, N.B.0 tPoultry science.g1996 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.135-139x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.07501353Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03461naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002500189245008500214300001600299500002400315520140500339650001901744650000901763650001401772650001501786650001401801650002201815650001501837650001101852650002601863650002001889650001301909650001101922650001801933650002001951650007201971650001202043650007102055650001902126650000902145650002202154650001102176650002702187650003202214650003602246650003402282653002702316653003502343653001602378700002702394700002202421700002902443700002402472773012102496852000902617856009202626930003302718945002502751946001102776655001202787IND4424792720221118224147.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442479272DNAL7 a195583702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00471.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8001 aMatsubara, Lídia M.10aEffect of lidocaine on the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane in dogs  ap. 407-413.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate the effects of a low-dose constant rate infusion (LCRI; 50 μg kg⁻¹ minute⁻¹) and high-dose CRI (HCRI; 200 μg kg⁻¹ minute⁻¹) lidocaine on arterial blood pressure and on the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of sevoflurane (Sevo), in dogs. Prospective, randomized experimental design. Eight healthy adult spayed female dogs, weighing 16.0 ± 2.1 kg. Each dog was anesthetized with sevoflurane in oxygen and mechanically ventilated, on three separate occasions 7 days apart. Following a 40-minute equilibration period, a 0.1-mL kg⁻¹ saline loading dose or lidocaine (2 mg kg⁻¹ intravenously) was administered over 3 minutes, followed by saline CRI or lidocaine LCRI or HCRI. The sevoflurane MAC was determined using a tail clamp. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure and plasma concentration of lidocaine were measured. All values are expressed as mean ± SD. The MAC of Sevo was 2.30 ± 0.19%. The LCRI reduced MAC by 15% to 1.95 ± 0.23% and HCRI by 37% to 1.45 ± 0.21%. Diastolic and mean pressure increased with HCRI. Lidocaine plasma concentration was 0.84 ± 0.18 for LCRI and 1.89 ± 0.37 μg mL⁻¹ for HCRI. Seventy-five percent of HCRI dogs vomited during recovery. Lidocaine infusions dose dependently decreased the MAC of Sevo, did not induce clinically significant changes in HR or arterial blood pressure, but vomiting was common during recovery in HCRI. 3ablood pressure 3adogs 3alidocaine 3aanesthesia 3aanalgesia 3apulmonary alveoli 3aheart rate 3aoxygen 3aintravenous injection 3ablood chemistry 3avomiting 3adosage 3adose response 3aadverse effects 2aAnesthetics, Inhalationxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Arrhythmia Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aBlood Pressure 2aDogs 2aDrug Interactions 2aFemale 2aInfusions, Intravenous 2aLidocainexpharmacokinetics 2aMethyl Ethersxpharmacokinetics 2aPulmonary Alveolixmetabolism 0aconstant rate infusion 0aminimum alveolar concentration 0asevoflurane1 aOliva, Valéria N.L S.1 aGabas, Daniela T.1 aOliveira, Guillermo C.V.1 aCassetari, Maria L.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2009 Sept., v. 36, no. 5 p.407-413dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00471.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03357naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001900193245009500212300001800307520151100325650001301836650001701849650003401866650001201900650003201912650004701944650002501991650003402016650002202050650003402072650003002106650003602136650004702172650003002219650000902249650002702258650002902285650004502314650000902359650002502368653001802393653002002411653001402431653003502445653001802480700002102498773012502519852000902644856009202653930003302745946001302778655001202791IND4429198920221118224251.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442919892DNAL7 a197997102pmid7 aPMC27967092pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06416.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Diana J.10aRegulation of striatal nitric oxide synthesis by local dopamine and glutamate interactions  ap. 1457-1465.  aNitric oxide (NO) is a key neuromodulator of corticostriatal synaptic transmission. We have shown previously that dopamine (DA) D1/5 receptor stimulation facilitates neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) activity in the intact striatum. To study the impact of local manipulations of D1/5 and glutamatergic NMDA receptors on striatal nNOS activity, we combined the techniques of in vivo amperometry and reverse microdialysis. Striatal NO efflux was monitored proximal to the microdialysis probe in urethane-anesthetized rats during local infusion of vehicle or drug. NO efflux elicited by systemic administration of SKF-81297 was blocked following intrastriatal infusion of: (i) the D1/5 receptor antagonist SCH-23390, (ii) the nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole, (iii) the non-specific ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid, and (iv) the selective NMDA receptor antagonist 3-phosphonopropyl-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid. Glycine co-perfusion did not affect SKF-81297-induced NO efflux. Furthermore, intrastriatal infusion of SKF-81297 potentiated NO efflux evoked during electrical stimulation of the motor cortex. The facilitatory effects of cortical stimulation and SKF-81297 were both blocked by intrastriatal infusion of SCH-23390, indicating that striatal D1/5 receptor activation is necessary for the activation of nNOS by corticostriatal afferents. These studies demonstrate for the first time that reciprocal DA-glutamate interactions play a critical role in stimulating striatal nNOS activity. 3adopamine 3anitric oxide 2aAfferent Pathwaysxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCerebral Cortexxphysiology 2aCorpus Striatumxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDopaminexmetabolism 2aDopamine Agentsxpharmacology 2aDrug Interactions 2aElectric Stimulationxmethods 2aElectrochemistryxmethods 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aExcitatory Amino Acid Agentsxpharmacology 2aGlutamic Acidxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMicrodialysisxmethods 2aNitric Oxidexmetabolism 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type Ixmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0aD1/5 receptor 0adorsal striatum 0aglutamate 0aneuronal nitric oxide synthase 0aNMDA receptor1 aWest, Anthony R.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2009 Dec., v. 111, no. 6 p.1457-1465dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06416.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02762naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100001900179245009300198300001600291500002400307500001500331520112000346650001701466650001701483650002701500650002301527650001401550650001601564650002501580650001001605650002001615650002501635650002601660650002601686650002201712651000901734653001401743653001901757653001601776653001501792653002501807653002901832653002801861700002501889773011201914852000902026856009202035930003302127945002502160946001102185655001202196IND4424791120221118224246.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442479112DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1445-6664.2009.00343.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF600 0aF2001 aAoki, Daisuke.10aOryza sh4 gene homologue represents homoeologous genomic copies in polyploid Echinochloa  ap. 225-233.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe coding region sequence of the Oryza sh4 gene homologue in Echinochloa was analyzed in relation to the shattering nature of spikelets and the phylogeny of homologue copies in the Asian annual polyploidy Echinochloa. The Sh4 homoeologue copies were detected in Echinochloa oryzicola, Echinochloa crus-galli, Echinochloa stagnina, Echinochloa colona, and Echinochloa crus-pavonis. Amino acid sequence differences did not lead to a functional change in the sh4 gene between the shattering and non-shattering types in E. crus-galli, E. oryzicola, and E. colona. A phylogenetic analysis of the homoeologous copy sequences indicated a genomic relationship between the Asian Echinochloa species and supported that the allohexaploid E. crus-galli shares two genomes with its parental donor, E. oryzicola. The Asian perennial tetraploid species, E. stagnina, shares one genome with E. oryzicola and possesses an unknown genome. Echinochloa crus-pavonis, from the New World, shows a close affinity of two genomes with E. crus-galli and E. oryzicola. Echinochloa colona showed distant affinities in all homoeologous copies. 3aweed biology 3agenetic code 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aEchinochloa colona 3aphylogeny 3atetraploidy 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3aseed shattering 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic relationships 3aEchinochloa oryzoides 3asequence homology 3aAsia 0aNew World 0aallohexaploidy 0aEchinochloa 0apolyploidy 0aEchinochloa stagnina 0aEchinochloa crus-pavonis 0amolecular sequence data1 aYamaguchi, Hirofumi.0 tWeed biology and management.g2009 Sept., v. 9, no. 3 p.225-233dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1444-61627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-6664.2009.00343.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/10/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02861naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001800174245008000192300001600272500002400288500001500312520107900327650002601406650002001432650001901452650002101471650002701492650001901519650002801538650001101566650005801577650001201635650004401647650005101691650002001742650003301762650001101795650001101806650002201817653001701839653002401856653001501880653001801895700001701913700001401930700001801944700001701962700001801979700001501997773008702012852000902099856007002108930003302178945002502211946001102236655001202247IND4385084520221118224145.0061111e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438508452DNAL7 a159082452pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aClercq, D. de10aIntravenous amiodarone treatment in horses with chronic atrial fibrillation  ap. 129-134.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSix horses without underlying cardiac disease were presented because of atrial fibrillation of between 5 and 12 months duration. These horses received an intravenous amiodarone treatment of 5 mg/kg/h for 1 h followed by 0.83 mg/kg/h for 23 h and subsequently 1.9 mg/kg/h for 30 h. During treatment, clinical signs were monitored and a surface ECG and an intra-atrial electrogram were recorded. Infusion was discontinued when sinus rhythm or side effects occurred. Four horses successfully cardioverted, of which one showed symptoms of hind limb weakness and weight shifting. Two horses did not cardiovert and showed similar side effects. In all horses, side effects disappeared within 6 h after termination of treatment. Cardiac side effects, such as pro-arrhythmia, were not seen in any of the horses. Total bilirubin slightly increased in three horses and normalised within four days. It was concluded that amiodarone has the potential to treat naturally occurring chronic atrial fibrillation in horses, although further research is needed to refine the infusion protocol. 3aintravenous injection 3adrug evaluation 3aheart diseases 3achronic diseases 3amyocardial depressants 3ahorse diseases 3across-sectional studies 3ahorses 2aAmiodaronexadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Arrhythmia Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aAtrial Fibrillationxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aChronic Disease 2aHorse Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aHorses 2aSafety 2aTreatment Outcome 0adrug therapy 0aatrial fibrillation 0aamiodarone 0acardioversion1 aLoon, G. van1 aBaert, K.1 aTavernier, R.1 aCroubels, S.1 aBacker, P. de1 aDeprez, P.0 tVeterinary journal.g2006 July, v. 172, no. 1 p.129-134dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.04.0013electronic resource  a20070308b20070402c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/02/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03818naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002000189245008300209300001600292500002400308500001500332520191200347650002802259650001502287650003002302650001602332650001502348650001302363650002402376650001602400650001502416650001502431650001402446650001102460650001602471650001302487650001902500650001002519650003602529650001202565650004602577650004502623650001102668650001002679653002102689653001602710653001902726653001602745653002802761653001402789653001602803700001502819700001902834773012102853852000902974856009202983930003303075945002503108946001103133655001203144IND4424793420221118224245.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442479342DNAL7 a197090502pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00484.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8001 aBass, Louise ME10aComparison of femoral and auricular arterial blood pressure monitoring in pigs  ap. 457-463.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo compare arterial blood pressure measurements obtained from the femoral and auricular arteries in anaesthetized pigs. Prospective experimental study. Fifteen female Large White pigs were used weighing 21.3 ± 2.3 kg. The pigs were anaesthetized with tiletamine/zolazepam and xylazine administered intramuscularly, and anaesthesia maintained with isoflurane delivered in oxygen/nitrogen. Arterial oxygen partial pressures were maintained between 11.3 and 13.3 kPa and PaCO₂ between 4.6 and 6.0 kPa. Monitoring included electrocardiogram, capnography and invasive blood pressure. The auricular and femoral arteries were catheterized for continuous systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurements. Measurements were recorded every 15 minutes. Statistical analysis involved a Bland-Altman plot analysis. The mean difference ± confidence intervals between the femoral and the auricular arterial diastolic, systolic and mean blood pressure measurements during hypotension were 2 ± 7, 2 ± 5 and 2 ± 5 mmHg respectively. In conditions of normotension mean difference ± confidence intervals, of femoral and auricular arterial blood pressure measurements of diastolic, systolic and mean blood pressure were 4 ± 5, 3 ± 7 and 4 ± 4 mmHg respectively. In conditions of increased arterial blood pressure, mean difference ± confidence intervals, of femoral and auricular arterial blood pressure measurements of diastolic, systolic and mean blood pressure were 4 ± 5, 3 ± 8 and 4 ± 4 mmHg respectively. Auricular artery catheterization is easier and quicker to perform. Pressure measurements from the auricular artery compared well with the femoral artery. We found that auricular arterial blood pressures were similar to femoral arterial values under the conditions of this experiment. We did not test extremes of blood pressure or significant alterations in body temperature. 3aintramuscular injection 3aanesthesia 3aintranasal administration 3ablood gases 3amonitoring 3aaccuracy 3aelectrocardiography 3ameasurement 3atiletamine 3aisoflurane 3acatheters 3aoxygen 3ahypotension 3aarteries 3ablood pressure 3aswine 2aAnesthesia, Generalxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBlood Pressure Determinationxveterinary 2aFemale 2aSwine 0aauricular artery 0amethodology 0afemoral artery 0acapnography 0aarterial blood pressure 0azolazepam 0aanesthetics1 aYu, Dao-Yi1 aCullen, Len K.0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2009 Sept., v. 36, no. 5 p.457-463dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00484.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03892naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001600193245011700209300001600326520148300342650001401825650001501839650002901854650001701883650001201900650005401912650006401966650003302030650004202063650004102105650003102146650003002177650003102207650005902238650004702297650004802344650004602392650005902438650005402497650001102551650002002562650001102582650003302593650003502626650003802661650000902699650000902708650002302717650001902740650003502759653002402794700001502818700001502833700001802848700001602866700001702882700001602899773013402915852000903049856009203058930003303150946001103183655001203194IND4429192820221118224339.0091127e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442919282DNAL7 a198430882pmid7 aPMC28027002pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04035.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanda, N.K.10aComplement activation pathways in murine immune complex-induced arthritis and in C3a and C5a generation in vitro  ap. 100-108.  aThe alternative pathway (AP) of complement alone is capable of mediating immune complex-induced arthritis in the collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model in mice. Whether the classical pathway (CP) or lectin pathway (LP) alone can mediate CAIA is not known. Using mice genetically deficient in different complement components, our results reported herein establish that the CP and LP alone are each incapable of mediating CAIA. A lower level or absence of C3 and/or C5 activation by the CP may be possible explanations for the importance of the AP in CAIA and in many murine models of disease. In addition, other investigators have reported that CP C5 convertase activity is absent in mouse sera. To address these questions, we employed an in vitro system of adherent immunoglobulin (Ig)G-induced complement activation using plates coated with murine anti-collagen monoclonal antibody (mAb). These experiments used complement-deficient mouse sera and wild-type mouse or normal human sera under conditions inactivating either the CP (Ca⁺⁺ deficiency) or the AP (mAb inhibitory to factor B). Robust generation of both C3a and C5a by either the AP or CP alone were observed with both mouse and human sera, although there were some small differences between the species of sera. We conclude that neither the CP nor LP alone is capable of mediating CAIA in vivo and that mouse sera exhibits a high level of IgG-induced C5a generation in vitro through either the CP or AP. 3aarthritis 3acomplement 3aantigen-antibody complex 3ainflammation 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aArthritis, Experimentalximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCollagen Type IIximmunology 2aComplement C1qxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aComplement C3xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aComplement C3axmetabolism 2aComplement C4xmetabolism 2aComplement C5axmetabolism 2aComplement Factor Bxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aComplement Factor Dxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aComplement Pathway, Alternativeximmunology 2aComplement Pathway, Classicalximmunology 2aComplement Pathway, Mannose-Binding Lectinximmunology 2aComplement System Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aFootxpathology 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gximmunology 2aJointsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aSerumximmunologyxmetabolism. 0aalternative pathway1 aLevitt, B.1 aWood, A.K.1 aTakahashi, K.1 aStahl, G.L.1 aHolers, V.M.1 aArend, W.P.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2010 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.100-108dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04035.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03618naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100001900193245012100212300001400333520123400347650002101581650001401602650001401616650001501630650001001645650002301655650001101678650002201689650002601711650004001737650002901777650004301806650002001849650003101869650001101900650004401911650003301955650003101988650003102019650003002050650002802080650003802108650005302146650003802199650003502237650001402272650004302286650003902329650003902368650001602407653002102423653001502444653001502459653001002474653001402484653000802498700001902506700001502525700001402540700001802554700002302572773013202595852000902727856009202736930003302828946001102861655001202872IND4429193320221118224201.0091127e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442919332DNAL7 a198607442pmid7 aPMC28026952pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04042.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrescott, S.L.10aAllergic women show reduced T helper type 1 alloresponses to fetal human leucocyte antigen mismatch during pregnancy  ap. 65-72.  aLow-level alloreactivity between mother and fetus may provide stimulation for fetal T helper type 1 (Th1) cell immune maturation. This study explored the effects of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch on materno-fetal interactions detected as cytokine responses and lymphoproliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions, and whether this was altered in allergic women (n = 62) who have a Th2 propensity compared with non-allergic women (n = 65). HLA-DRβ1 mismatch was associated with significantly increased Th1 interferon (IFN)-γ, Th2 interleukin (IL)-13 and lymphoproliferative responses by both mothers and fetuses. Allergic women showed significantly lower IFN-γ Th1 production in response to HLA-DRβ1 mismatch. The infants of these women also showed significantly lower IL-10 and lower IFN-γ production relative to IL-13. Both HLA-DRβ1 mismatch and maternal allergy had significant independent effects on maternal IFN-γ Th1 responses. Maternal allergy modifies HLA-mediated alloreactivity between the mother and the fetus, reducing Th1 activation. This may affect the cytokine milieu at the materno-fetal interface and could be implicated in the attenuated Th1 responses observed commonly in infants of atopic mothers. 3ahypersensitivity 3acytokines 3apregnancy 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCell Proliferation 2aFemale 2aFetusximmunology 2aGravidityximmunology 2aHLA Antigensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHLA-C Antigensxgenetics 2aHLA-DR Antigensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHLA-DRB1 Chains 2aHistocompatibility Testing 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivityxgeneticsximmunology. 2aInterferon-gammaxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-10xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-13xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-6xmetabolism 2aIsoantigensximmunology 2aKiller Cells, Naturalximmunology 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aLymphocyte Activationximmunology 2aLymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed 2aPregnancy 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aTh1 Cellsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aTh2 Cellsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aYoung Adult 0aallergic disease 0acord blood 0aHLA typing 0aHLA-C 0aHLA-DRβ1 0aMLR1 aBreckler, L.A.1 aWitt, C.S.1 aSmith, L.1 aDunstan, J.A.1 aChristiansen, F.T.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2010 Jan., v. 159, no. 1 p.65-72dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2009.04042.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01675naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245011600143300001600259500001500275520064100290650002000931650002000951650003100971650002401002650002101026653003301047653001901080653001901099700001801118700001701136773008201153852000901235930003301244945002501277946001101302655001201313IND4377760820221118223936.0060209e20051110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437776082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We review examples, primarily from our own research, showing how all 3 questions can be addressed using science. For example, we review work showing 1) how common diseases such as lameness can be better identified and prevented through improvements in the ways cows are housed and managed, 2) how pain caused by dehorning of dairy calves can be reduced, and 3) how environmental conditions affect cow preferences for indoor housing versus pasture. Disagreements about animal welfare can occur when different measures are used. For example, management systems that favor production may restrict natural behavior or can even lead to higher rates of disease. The best approaches are those that address all 3 types of concerns, for example, feeding systems for calves that allow expression of key behaviors (i.e., sucking on a teat), that avoid negative affect (i.e., hunger), and that allow for improved functioning (i.e., higher rates of body weight gain, and ultimately higher milk production). 3ahunger 3adairy cows 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal injuries 3apain 3aanimal well-being 3acalf feeding 3aanimal health 3alameness 3aenvironmental factors 3amilk production 3aliveweight gain 3asuckling 3acattle housing 3aanimal diseases 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDairyingxethics 0aliterature reviews 0adairy cattle 0aanimal production 0aanimal husbandry 0aanimal performance 0aanimal welfare1 aRushen, J.1 ade Passillé, A.M.1 aWeary, D.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2009 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.4101-4111dAmerican Dairy Science Associationx0022-03027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-23263Available from publisher's Web site  a20091114b20091204c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/10/27  aOther US 7aarticle04207naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100002400189245012500213300001600338500002400354520199400378650001402372650001402386650000902400650002102409650001302430650001502443650002002458650002102478650001102499650002602510650001802536650001502554650001402569650001302583650001902596650002302615650001302638650002002651650006302671650001202734650003302746650002302779650000902802650003702811650002902848650005402877650000902931650004402940653001802984653002703002653001303029653002803042700002103070700002103091700002303112700002003135700002703155773012103182852000903303856009203312930003303404945002503437946001103462655001203473IND4424794020221118223855.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442479402DNAL7 a197090552pmid7 a10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00480.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL8001 aMacDougall, Lori M.10aAntinociceptive, cardiopulmonary, and sedative effects of five intravenous infusion rates of lidocaine in conscious dogs  ap. 512-522.  aIncludes references  aTo observe antinociceptive, cardiopulmonary and sedative effects of five different 12-hour lidocaine infusions in conscious dogs, and measure plasma lidocaine concentrations. Two-part randomized, prospective, blinded, cross-over experimental study. Six neutered male, crossbred dogs approximately 1-2 years of age and weighing 29.1 ± 4.0 kg. Dogs received lidocaine [2 mg kg⁻¹, intravenous (IV)] or equivalent volume of 0.9% saline followed by infusion of either lidocaine at 10 (L10), 25 (L25), 50 (L50), 75 (L75), or 100 (L100) μg kg⁻¹ minute⁻¹, or equivalent rate of saline (Control). The study was conducted in two parts comparing L10, L25 and L50 to control, and then L75 and L100 to another control. Heart and respiratory rates, and indirect arterial blood pressure were measured for 12 hours; before (baseline), during and after infusion. Sedation was scored using descriptive categories, and nociceptive threshold determined using electrical cutaneous stimulation. Plasma lidocaine concentrations were measured using ELISA. Nonparametric and parametric tests for repeated measures were used and p < 0.05. Nociceptive thresholds were not different from the saline control treatment at any time. Respiratory rate decreased 2-12 hours in treatments L25, L75 and L100. Blood pressure increased after 4 hours in treatment L100 compared to baseline. Sedation scores increased compared to baseline (L10: 30 minutes-8 hours; L25: 30 minutes-2 hours, 8 hours; L50: 30 minutes, 8 hours, 12 hours; L75: 4-12 hours; L100: 15 minutes, 8-12 hours), and to Control. Treatment L75 had higher plasma lidocaine concentrations than L10; and L100 had higher concentrations than L10 and L25. Occasional vomiting was observed in dogs receiving lidocaine when plasma lidocaine concentrations exceeded 4 μg mL⁻¹. High lidocaine infusion rates did not have antinociceptive effects compared with saline and were associated with mild-moderate sedation and some signs of toxicity in awake dogs. 3aanalgesia 3alidocaine 3adogs 3aanalgesic effect 3asedation 3aanalgesics 3ablood chemistry 3apharmacokinetics 3adosage 3aintravenous injection 3adose response 3aheart rate 3abreathing 3aarteries 3ablood pressure 3atemporal variation 3avomiting 3aadverse effects 2aAnesthetics, Localxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDogs 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aLidocainexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aMale 2aPainxprevention & controlxveterinary. 0aconscious dog 0aconstant rate infusion 0ainfusion 0acardiopulmonary effects1 aHethey, James A.1 aLivingston, Alex1 aClark, Christopher1 aShmon, Cindy L.1 aDuke-Novakovski, Tanya0 tVeterinary anaesthesia and analgesia.g2009 Sept., v. 36, no. 5 p.512-522dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2009.00480.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091020b20091106c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/10/01  aNon-US 7aarticle01591naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001200127245007000139300001600209520062400225650001800849650001300867650002300880650001800903650002300921650004400944650002100988653002501009700001001034700001201044700001301056773008201069852000901151930003301160945002501193946001101218655001201229IND4376605120221118224142.0051209e20050829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The products were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Evidences of grafting were obtained by IR from the appearance of CO bands absorbance and the reducing of relative intensity of OH, with respect to cotton.

For white light emission, doping of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) emitters in a host matrix is commonly practised. However, finding RGB emitters of similar stability with homogenous doping is challenging. Furthermore, such devices suffer from color purity in the long run. Small organic light emitters, capable of colour tuning and having a broad emission spectrum are in high demand as they provide colour stability, reproducibility, a simple device geometry and high efficiency. Recently, it has been shown that the efficiency of OLEDs can be enhanced by employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Here, we designed and synthesised a xanthone–carbazole based D-A-D material (Xan-Cbz) for TADF properties. Blue TADF emission, in neat thin films, at 470 nm was observed and further investigated by studying delayed fluorescence and lifetime measurements. In addition, a blend of Xan-Cbz with NPD shows exciplex emission at 525 nm in thin film. OLEDs based on Xan-Cbz were fabricated using several device configurations. OLEDs having the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/NPD/Xan-Cbz/Bphen/LiF-Al showed a luminance of 1.96 × 10⁴ Cd m⁻² (at a current density of 50 mA cm⁻²) and VON at ∼6 V. Electroluminescence showed the features of both neat emission (470 nm) of Xan-Cbz and its exciplex (525 nm) with NPD. Further, colour tuning was observed as a function of applied voltage and the ratio of light intensity (I₅₂₅/I₄₇₀) of neat and exciplex emission was found to decrease with increasing voltage. Greenish-blue emission (CIE coordinates: 0.202, 0.382) from Xan-Cbz OLEDs was obtained. Xan-Cbz showed its neat emission (at 470 nm) in ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CBP/Xan-Cbz/Bphen/LiF-Al and pure exciplex emission (at 525 nm) in ITO/PEDOT:PSS/NPD:Xan-Cbz/Bphen/LiF-Al device configurations. Thus in this article we showed blue TADF emission, exciplex emission and voltage dependent color tuning in OLEDs based on a small organic emitter.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3afilms (materials) 3afluorescence 3ageometry 3alight intensity 3awhite light1 aAwasthi, Ankur A.1 aBhui, Prabhjyot1 aParab, Pradnya1 aMuneer, Mohammad1 aBose, Sangita1 aAgarwal, N.q(Neeraj),0 tRSC advances.g2019 Dec. 04, v. 9, no. 69 p.40248-40254dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra08227a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245013000158300001800288520147100306592002801777650001801805650002901823650002801852650001601880650001901896650001801915650001001933650001301943650001601956650001401972650001701986650001502003700001302018700001702031700001802048700001502066700001302081700001302094700001902107700001502126773012102141856007402262852000902336655001202345IND60641440220221120041320.0190505e20170112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064144022DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26062d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Weizong10aControlled release of vancomycin from 3D porous graphene-based composites for dual-purpose treatment of infected bone defects  ap. 2753-2765.  aInfected bone defects (IBD) are a challenging problem in orthopedic practice. Biomaterials have attracted attention as a novel approach to overcome this challenge instead of using conventional strategies. Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon allotrope, has been shown to possess multiple advantages, such as osteogenesis-promoting activity, a large surface area for drug delivery, and antibacterial activities. However, these attractive merits have not been entirely explored or introduced for the management of IBD. Herein, a novel approach using a vancomycin-laden, self-assembled, graphene-based material against IBD was developed, and the approach uses a single-stage bone graft instead of multiple procedures. Owing to the π–π bonding with graphene, vancomycin can be promptly delivered in the initial stage, followed by a sustained release, which ensures the rapid elimination of an infection and provides a durable pathogen revival inhibition via the inherent antibacterial activity of graphene. Moreover, the 3D porous structure incorporated with nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) provided a biomimetic microenvironment favored by cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. Further evaluation of this system in an IBD animal model demonstrated prompt control of infection and promotion of bone regeneration. These results revealed the potential of this approach to be an effectual solution for IBD treatment and a new area of graphene application in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomimetics 3abone formation 3acell adhesion 3adrugs 3agraphene 3aorthopedics 3apathogens 3asurface area 3avancomycin1 aNie, Wei1 aZhou, Qirong1 aZhou, Xiaojun1 aCao, Liehu1 aJi, Fang1 aCui, Jin1 aHe, Chuanglong1 aSu, Jiacan0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 12, v. 7, no. 5 p.2753-2765dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26062d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012300165300001600288520117000304592002801474650001201502650000901514650001101523650001101534650001201545650001501557650001901572650003301591650001901624650002701643651001401670653001201684653001601696653003301712653001501745653002601760700001601786700001501802700001601817700001501833773012901848856008501977852000902062655001202071IND50087722020221118234916.0200514e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008772202DNAL7 a10.1080/03014223.2012.6724362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitra, R.,12aA benign approach to the preparation of freshwater bryozoan statoblasts for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging  ap. 154-159.  aSeveral different species of freshwater Bryozoa, belonging to the genera Plumatella, Rumarcanella and Fredericella, were detected within the Northern Mallee Pipeline (NMP) system in Victoria, Australia, that required definitive identification. These organisms produce asexual buds called statoblasts, with valves composed of sclerotised chitin that bear minute micro-ornamentations of considerable taxonomical significance. Imaging and analysis of these distinctive micro-ornamentations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is often employed for species identification. Meticulous preparation of statoblast samples is therefore required that necessitates the removal of adhering debris, dehydration and drying—whilst mitigating specimen damage and distortion. This technical note describes an approach whereby each of these three steps have been individually designed to be as benign as possible, using mild detergent/sonication to remove debris, a gradual and gentle dehydration procedure using ethanol, and critical point drying. For the overall process, these methods are chosen to optimise control and to minimise the use of harsh and hazardous chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryozoa 3abuds 3achitin 3adrying 3aethanol 3afreshwater 3aimage analysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asclerotization 3aspecies identification 3aAustralia 0aBryozoa 0astatoblasts 0ascanning electron microscopy 0asonication 0acritical point drying1 aCrawford, S1 aBarton, AF1 aBriggs, S.,1 aOrbell, JD0 tNew Zealand journal of zoology.g2013 June 1, v. 40, no. 2 p.154-159dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:12299x1175-88217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03014223.2012.6724363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01554naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011500169300001800284520054600302592002800848650001900876650001900895650002500914650001400939650001300953650001100966700001800977700001800995700002101013773009901034856008601133852000901219655001201228IND60579674720221120125556.0170829e20170829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057967472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b020342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazra, Somasri10aMemory of Electric Field in Laponite and How It Affects Crack Formation: Modeling through Generalized Calculus  ap. 8468-8475.  aDesiccation crack formation is affected by the presence of electric fields. We show here that the field effect not only is at work while the power supply is on but also leaves a memory even after switching off. The time required for the first appearance of cracks is shown to depend on the voltage of the field as well as the time duration of exposure. We model the system as a leaky capacitor described by a fractional order derivative in the constitutive equation. This gives a good fit to experimental data and explains the memory effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectric power 3aelectrical equipment 3aequations 3alaponite 3amodels1 aDutta, Tapati1 aDas, Shantanu1 aTarafdar, Sujata0 tLangmuir.g2017 Aug. 29, v. 33, no. 34 p.8468-8475dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b020343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013900154300001800293520149300311592002801804650001901832650001401851650002101865650001501886650001401901650002201915650001101937650001901948650001901967650001701986700001502003700001402018700001602032700001602048773014202064856007402206852000902280655001202289IND60632267720221122042155.0190314e20190312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063226772DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta00580c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jun10aDesigned synthesis of a p-Ag₂S/n-PDI self-assembled supramolecular heterojunction for enhanced full-spectrum photocatalytic activity  ap. 6482-6490.  aHerein, an efficient full-spectrum responsive p-Ag₂S/n-PDI (perylenediimide) heterojunction was successfully constructed. The self-assembled PDI nanostructure was formed via hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking. Ag₂S quantum dots were tightly loaded onto the surface of PDI nanofibers via a two-step electrostatic process. When the mass ratio of Ag₂S to PDI was 1 : 0.6, the p-Ag₂S/n-PDI heterojunction showed optimum photocatalytic properties. The full-spectrum photocatalytic activity of p-Ag₂S/n-PDI was found to be 5.13 and 1.79 times higher than pure PDI for phenol degradation and O₂ evolution, respectively. The results showed that Ag₂S quantum dots promoted the well-organized π–π stacking degree of the self-assembled PDI, which was helpful for the migration of photo-generated electrons along the quasi-one-dimensional π–π stacking of PDI. Simultaneously, Ag₂S quantum dots were found to enhance the light absorption of Ag₂S/PDI. More interestingly, the p-Ag₂S/n-PDI heterojunction exhibited excellent photoelectric properties, indicating more effective separation of carriers, which arose as a result of the built-in electric field between the Ag₂S and PDI. Besides this, the p-Ag₂S/n-PDI heterojunction produces more active species than pure PDI, resulting in a much stronger oxidation ability. This work details some interesting ideas for designing efficient heterojunction photocatalysts that have a supramolecular organic nanostructure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectrons 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananofibers 3aoxidation 3aoxygen production 3aphenol 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aquantum dots1 aMiao, Hong1 aLi, Wenlu1 aLi, Huiquan1 aZhu, Yongfa0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Mar. 12, v. 7, no. 11 p.6482-6490dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00580c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006900147245019100216300001600407520159300423592002802016650002402044650001602068650002402084650001402108650001302122650001102135650001202146650001502158650001202173650001302185650001402198650001102212650002002223650001302243650001802256650001202274650001102286650000902297650001102306650001702317651001302334651002902347651000902376651003702385651002202422651001002444651001202454651002602466651001102492653002402503653000802527653001902535653001202554653001902566653001702585700001802602700001902620700002502639700002202664700002302686700002002709700001802729700002502747773013902772856008102911852000902992655001203001IND60685660620221117062013.0200305e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566062DNAL7 a10.1017/S00074853190006582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoumtsop, Armand R.

However, data on its ecology are lacking. Here we provide an updated estimate of its distribution with the aim of facilitating the sustainable control of its populations. Surveys conducted in nine countries encompassing 13 ecological regions around the Congo basin showed that African root and tuber scale was present in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Uganda. It was not found on the sites surveyed in Chad and Nigeria. The pest occurred in the forest and the forest-savannah mosaic as well as in the savannah where it was never recorded before. However, prevalence was higher in the forest (43.1%) where cassava was the most infested crop, compared to the savannah (9.2%) where aroids (cocoyam and taro) were the most infested crops. In the forest habitat, the pest was prevalent in all but two ecological regions: the Congolian swamp forests and the Southern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic. In the savannah habitat, it was restricted to the moist savannah highlands and absent from dry savannahs. The scale was not observed below 277 m asl. Where present, the scale was frequently (87.1% of the sites) attended by the ant Anoplolepis tenella. High densities (>1000 scales per plant) were recorded along the Cameroon–Gabon border. Good regulatory measures within and between countries are required to control the exchange of plant materials and limit its spread. The study provides information for niche modeling and risk mapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrotropical region 3aAnoplolepis 3aColocasia esculenta 3aHemiptera 3aaltitude 3abasins 3acassava 3aecoregions 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ahighlands 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3asavannas 3ascale insects 3asurveys 3aswamps 3ataro 3atubers 3azoogeography 3aCameroon 3aCentral African Republic 3aChad 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 3aEquatorial Guinea 3aGabon 3aNigeria 3aRepublic of the Congo 3aUganda 0aAnoplolepis tenella 0aant 0aCentral Africa 0acocoyam 0aniche modeling 0ascale insect1 aHanna, Rachid1 aTindo, Maurice1 aTata-Hangy, Willy K.1 aFotso, Apollin K.1 aFiaboe, Komi K.

Restricted-item or multi-item testmeals in the design of preload appetite studies  ap. 1076-1082.  aThe aims of the study were to determine whether restricted single-item or multi-item testmeals are better able to detect prior changes in hunger and fullness when assessing ad libitum eating behaviour. Thirty male participants were given a low- (LE, 0.5MJ) or high-energy (HE, 4.0MJ) breakfast preload designed to induce or suppress hunger, followed 3h later by a restricted-item (RI) or multi-item (MI) testmeal. The RI testmeal comprised pasta+meat sauce, whilst the MI testmeal comprised pasta+meat sauce plus bread, chicken, ham, cheese, salad, cake and fruit. The four conditions were (i) LE/RI; (ii) LE/MI; (iii) HE/RI; (iv) HE/MI. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to rate appetite sensations and EI was measured at the lunch testmeal. As expected, increasing the energy content of the preload significantly altered VAS ratings and decreased EI at the testmeal. Following both LE and HE breakfasts, EI was lower at the RI (LE=4566kJ, HE=3583kJ) compared with the MI (LE=6142kJ, HE=5149kJ) testmeal. However, the compensatory decrease in EI in response to the HE breakfast was not significantly greater at the RI testmeal (RI: −983kJ, 28.1% compensation; MI: −993kJ, 28.4% compensation). In preload studies measuring EI, increasing the variety of an ad lib testmeal may not decrease the sensitivity to detect changes in hunger and fullness.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreads 3abreakfast 3acakes 3acheeses 3achickens 3aeating habits 3aenergy content 3afruits 3aham 3ahunger 3alunch 3asalads 3asauces 3asensation1 aXin, Liping1 aMcGill, Anne-Thea1 aBudgett, Stephanie C.1 aStrik, Caroline M.1 aPoppitt, Sally D.0 tAppetite.g2012 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.1076-1082dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011900172300001600291500001900307520103600326536017101362592002801533596001901561596001401580650002501594650000901619650001701628650002001645650003801665650002601703650000901729650000901738650001701747653001301764653001601777653002001793653002401813653001901837653002701856700001201883700001401895700001601909773012801925856008502053852000902138655001202147IND60720214320221120174217.0201210e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072021432DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2020.17401802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChennault, Anna,10aImmunoassay of cooked wild rat meat by ELISA with a highly specific antibody targeting rat heat-resistant proteins  ap. 533-544.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe 2019 new coronavirus epidemic potentially induced by wild animals has drawn tremendous attention. Wild animal meat contamination and adulteration have become increasingly serious, particularly for highly cooked wild animal meats that are difficult to be detected. In this study, a highly specific polyclonal antibody targeting the cooked rat proteins was developed. The corresponding sandwich ELISA (swELISA) was developed and found highly sensitive and specific for cooked rat meat, while there are no cross-reactions to the cooked chicken, pork and beef meats. The limit of detection (LOD) is determined to be as low as 0.01 ug/L based OD values. The coefficient variation (CV) is 5% and 8% for intra and inter assays, respectively. The recovery efficiencies are between 90% and 110%. The sandwich ELISA can detect both raw and cooked rat meat and is also suitable for Swab test of rat contamination. The results indicated a highly reliable and robust ELISA-based assay for cooked rat meat identification and contamination.  aThis work was supported by Guangdong Science and Technology Minister Foundation [grant number 2017A010105015]; The Foshan University Startup [grant number CGG040903].  aPublisher supplied data  a2017A010105015  aCGG040903 3aadulterated products 3abeef 3acooked foods 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apork 3arats 3awild animals 0aCOVID-19 0awild animal 0acooked rat meat 0apolyclonal antibody 0asandwich ELISA 0aheat-resistant protein1 aRan, Di1 aZeng, Lin1 aXin, Meiguo0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 31, no. 1 p.533-544dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45182x1465-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2020.17401803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245012400209520109500333592002801428650001801456650001401474650001201488650001401500650002201514650001401536650000901550650001501559650001901574650001401593650000901607650001201616650001301628650001401641650001501655650001601670650001301686650002901699653000801728653000801736653001001744653001001754653001001764653000801774653000801782653000801790653000801798653000801806653000801814653001101822653001901833653002201852653002001874653001101894653002301905653002001928700002501948700002701973700002002000700001902020700006102039700002502100700002202125700002002147700002502167700002102192700002202213700005702235773009902292856008702391852000902478655001202487IND60717103620221119233010.0220103e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071710362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1285332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPilolli, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6789-147210aDiscovery based high resolution MS/MS analysis for selection of allergen markers in chocolate and broth powder matrices  aPeptide marker identification is an important step in development of a mass spectrometry method for multiple allergen detection, since specificity, robustness and sensitivity of the overall analytical method will depend on the reliability of the proteotypic peptides. As part of the development of a multi-analyte reference method, discovery analysis of two incurred food matrices has been undertaken to select the most reliable peptide markers. Six allergenic ingredients (milk, egg, peanut, soybean, hazelnut, and almond) were incurred into either chocolate or broth powder matrix. Different conditions of protein extraction and purification were tested and the tryptic peptide pools were analysed by untargeted high resolution tandem mass spectrometry and the resulting fragmentation spectra were processed via a commercial software for sequence identification. The analysis performed on incurred foods provides both a prototype effective and straightforward sample preparation protocol and delivers reliable peptides to be included in a standardized selected reaction monitoring method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3aallergens 3aalmonds 3achocolate 3acomputer software 3adetection 3aeggs 3aextraction 3afood chemistry 3ahazelnuts 3amilk 3apeanuts 3apeptides 3aprotocols 3aprototypes 3areliability 3asoybeans 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aAGC 0aDIA 0aHR-MS 0aLR-MS 0aMS/MS 0aMSX 0aNCE 0aPSM 0aSEC 0aSPE 0aSRM 0aThRAll 0aFood allergens 0aMass spectrometry 0aPeptide markers 0aThRAll 0aDiscovery analysis 0aIncurred matrix1 aVan Poucke, Christof1 aDe Angelis, Elisabetta1 aNitride, Chiara1 ade Loose, Marc1 aGillard, Nathalie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0465-67151 aHuet, Anne-Catherine1 aTranquet, Olivier1 aLarré, Colette1 aAdel-Patient, Karine1 aBernard, Hervé,1 aMills, E.N.

PDT comprises a central 4,10-bis(hexyloxy)-6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydropyreno[1,2-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene (DDT) donor unit and two flanked 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile acceptor units, while PDT-T has an extra thiophene bridge unit between the central donor unit and the acceptor unit. The introduction of a thiophene bridge unit can markedly broaden the absorption of acceptors and enhance the film absorption coefficient. The optical bandgaps of PDT and PDT-T are 1.59 and 1.44 eV, respectively. The photovoltaic performance of these two acceptors was investigated using PBDB-T as the electron donor. Wide photo-current responses extending to 800 nm for PDT based devices and to 900 nm for PDT-T based ones were observed. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.07% for PBDB-T:PDT based cells was obtained with a Vₒc of 0.96 V, Jₛc of 13.48 mA cm⁻² and FF of 54.0%, while the as-cast devices based on PBDB-T:PDT-T gave rise to a PCE of 11.02% with a Vₒc of 0.88 V, Jₛc of 18.88 mA cm⁻² and FF of 66.3%. These results highlight that DDT is a promising building block for constructing highly efficient fused ring acceptors and π-bridging can further boost the photovoltaic performance of the devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aelectric current 3asolar cells 3athiophene1 aLu, Hao1 aJia, Qing-Qing1 aFeng, Shiyu1 aLi, Cuihong1 aLi, Hai-Bei1 aBo, Zhishan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Mar. 12, v. 7, no. 11 p.5943-5948dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00614a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012900154300001800283520152600301592002801827650003401855650002201889650001501911650003001926650001101956650000901967650001601976650001001992650001502002650001102017650002202028650001902050650001902069650002902088700001602117700001602133700001702149700001502166700001402181700001402195700001302209773012202222856007402344852000902418655001202427IND60641440520221120054707.0190505e20170117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064144052DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra26072a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Ying10aEnhanced photocatalytic oxygen evolution over Mo-doped Ca₂NiWO₆ perovskite photocatalyst under visible light irradiation  ap. 5821-5826.  aA series of Mo-doped Ca₂NiWO₆ (Ca₂NiW₁₋ₓMoₓO₆, x = 0–0.05) samples were synthesized by a solid-state reaction. The physical and optical properties of these photocatalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption fine structure, UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra, and the band structure along with density of states were calculated by the plane-wave-based density functional theory. The photocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution from water was evaluated under visible light irradiation. The Mo doping significantly increased the photocatalytic activity of Ca₂NiWO₆. The optimal Ca₂NiW₀.₉₇Mo₀.₀₃O₆ showed an oxygen evolution rate approximately 2 times higher than that of the pure Ca₂NiWO₆. The characterization results indicated that the Mo-doped Ca₂NiWO₆ maintained the double perovskite structure. The Mo⁶⁺ ions were substituted into the W⁶⁺ sites in the lattice, causing a certain amount of lattice distortion and promoting the formation of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the Mo doping introduced impurity energy levels into the band structure of Ca₂NiWO₆. Consequently, the conduction band changed from discrete to continuous and the bottom of the conduction band was shifted to more positive potential, compared to that of pure Ca₂NiWO₆, leading to a lower band gap and higher absorbance in the wider visible light region. These characteristics are responsible for the high photocatalytic activity of the oxygen evolution reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorbance 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aions 3airradiation 3alight 3amolybdenum 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3areflectance spectroscopy1 aXue, Jiawei1 aZhu, Xiaodi1 aDaniel, Jose1 aGao, Xiang1 aSun, Song1 aGao, Chen1 aBao, Jun0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 17, v. 7, no. 10 p.5821-5826dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra26072a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013200168300001800300520140300318592002801721650001801749650001301767650002101780650001101801650002301812650001601835700002101851700002401872700002101896773009901917856008602016852000902102655001202111IND60579674920171221000000.0170829e20170829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057967492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b021132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWłoch, Jerzy10aNanoscale Insight into the Mechanism of a Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite Edge Surface Wetting by “Interferencing” Water  ap. 8562-8573.  aThe new molecular dynamics simulation results showing the influence of the edge carbon surface atoms on the wettability of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface with water nanodroplets are reported. The conditions for the occurrence of the Wenzel effect are discussed, and the Cassie-to-Wenzel transition (CTWT) mechanism in the nanoscale is explored. This transition is detected by the application of a new procedure showing that the CTWT point shifts toward larger values of carbon–oxygen potential well depth with the decrease in the HOPG side angle. It is concluded that the Wenzel effect significantly contributes to the contact angles (CAs) measured for the HOPG surfaces. The Wenzel effect is also very important for the “HOPG” structures possessing the disturbed C–C interlayer distance, and its influence on the water nanodroplet CAs is strongly pronounced. The structure of water confined inside slits and on a HOPG surface is studied using the analysis of the density profiles, the number of hydrogen bonds, and, modified for the purpose of this study, structure factor. The detailed analysis of all parameters describing confined water leads to the conclusion about the presence of characteristic interference patterns revealed as a result of long-term simulation. A simple model describing this effect is proposed as the starting point for further considerations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3awettability1 aTerzyk, Artur P.1 aWiśniewski, Marek,1 aKowalczyk, Piotr0 tLangmuir.g2017 Aug. 29, v. 33, no. 34 p.8562-8573dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b021133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002200170245006400192300001600256520157800272592002801850650001401878650001001892650001501902650002301917650002601940650001201966650001301978650003701991650001002028650002402038650002102062653002002083653002202103653002702125653002902152700002502181773010502206856008502311852000902396655001202405IND60113324620221119163115.0160903e20130930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011332462DNAL7 a237928812pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKocifaj, Miroslav10aSkyglow effects in UV and visible spectra: Radiative fluxes  ap. 300-307.  aSeveral studies have tried to understand the mechanisms and effects of radiative transfer under different night-sky conditions. However, most of these studies are limited to the various effects of visible spectra. Nevertheless, the invisible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum can pose a more profound threat to nature. One visible threat is from what is popularly termed skyglow. Such skyglow is caused by injudiciously situated or designed artificial night lighting systems which degrade desired sky viewing. Therefore, since lamp emissions are not limited to visible electromagnetic spectra, it is necessary to consider the complete spectrum of such lamps in order to understand the physical behaviour of diffuse radiation at terrain level.In this paper, the downward diffuse radiative flux is computed in a two-stream approximation and obtained ultraviolet spectral radiative fluxes are inter-related with luminous fluxes. Such a method then permits an estimate of ultraviolet radiation if the traditionally measured illuminance on a horizontal plane is available.The utility of such a comparison of two spectral bands is shown, using the different lamp types employed in street lighting. The data demonstrate that it is insufficient to specify lamp type and its visible flux production independently of each other. Also the UV emissions have to be treated by modellers and environmental scientists because some light sources can be fairly important pollutants in the near ultraviolet. Such light sources can affect both the living organisms and ambient environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3alamps 3apollutants 3aradiative transfer 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAnimals 2aDarkness 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysis 2aLight 2aModels, Theoretical 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aLight pollution 0aOptical thickness 0aPublic lighting system 0aTwo stream approximation1 aSolano Lamphar, H.A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Sept. 30, v. 127 p.300-307dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03804naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245015900171300001800330500002000348520219000368592002802558650002702586650002402613650002902637650001302666650001702679650002902696650001702725650000902742650001802751650002102769650001702790650002102807650001102828650003002839650002502869650002002894650001402914650001502928650004402943700002402987700002003011700002003031700002103051700001803072773010803090856007903198852000903277655001203286IND60587207920221121122817.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058720792DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.139732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGálvez Ranilla, Lena10aPhenolic Composition and Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Activity of Free and Bound Phenolic Fractions from a Peruvian Purple Corn (Zea mays L.) Accession  ap. 2968-2976.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBeneficial effects on overall gut health by phenolic bioactives‐rich foods are potentially due to their modulation of probiotic gut bacteria and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Based on this rationale, the effect of the free and bound phenolic fractions from a Peruvian purple corn accession AREQ‐084 on probiotic lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum and the gastric cancer‐related pathogen Helicobacter pylori was evaluated. The free and bound phenolic composition was also determined by ultra‐performance liquid chromatography. Anthocyanins were the major phenolic compounds (310.04 mg cyanidin‐3‐glucoside equivalents/100 g dry weight, DW) in the free phenolic fraction along with hydroxycinnamic acids such as p‐coumaric acid derivatives, followed by caffeic and ferulic acid derivatives. The bound phenolic form had only hydroxycinnamic acids such as ferulic acid, p‐coumaric acid, and a ferulic acid derivative with ferulic acid being the major phenolic compound (156.30 mg/100 g DW). These phenolic compounds were compatible with beneficial probiotic lactic acid bacteria such as L. helveticus and B. longum as these bacteria were not inhibited by the free and bound phenolic fractions at 10 to 50 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL of sample doses, respectively. However, the pathogenic H. pylori was also not inhibited by both purple corn phenolic forms at same above sample doses. This study provides the preliminary base for the characterization of phenolic compounds of Peruvian purple corn biodiversity and its potential health benefits relevant to improving human gut health. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study provides insights that Peruvian purple corn accession AREQ‐084 can be targeted as a potential source of health‐relevant phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins along with hydroxycinnamic acids linked to its dietary fiber fraction. Additionally, these phenolic fractions did not affect the gut health associated beneficial bacteria nor the pathogenic H. pylori. Purple corn can be targeted for design of probiotic functional foods integrated with their anthocyanin linked‐coloring properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium longum 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aZea mays 3aanthocyanins 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiodiversity 3acorn 3adietary fiber 3adigestive system 3aferulic acid 3afunctional foods 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alactic acid bacteria 3ap-coumaric acid 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aChristopher, Ashish1 aSarkar, Dipayan1 aShetty, Kalidas1 aChirinos, Rosana1 aCampos, David0 tJournal of food science.g2017 Dec., v. 82, no. 12 p.2968-2976dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.139733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01397naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009700160300001600257520028200273592002800555650001300583650002000596650002300616650002300639650001800662650002000680650001000700650002000710650001500730700001700745700001600762700001700778700001400795773013100809856007400940852000901014655001201023IND60660753520221118191952.0190827e20141211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066075352DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07533a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Huanxiang12aA glucose-powered antimicrobial system using organic–inorganic assembled network materials  ap. 722-724.  aA new glucose-driven photodynamic antimicrobial system was developed to efficiently kill bacteria and fungi, taking advantage of organic–inorganic network materials encapsulating glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abioluminescence 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aencapsulation 3aenergy transfer 3afungi 3aglucose oxidase 3aperoxidase1 aBai, Haotian1 aLiu, Libing1 aLv, Fengting1 aWang, Shu0 tChemical communications.g2014 Dec. 11, v. 51, no. 4 p.722-724dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc07533a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009700165300001600262520131900278592002801597650003301625650002501658650002001683650001201703650001001715650002601725650003101751650001301782650001901795650000701814650001301821650001901834650002101853650002301874650001401897650001001911650000901921650001101930650001101941650001601952650001001968651000901978700002201987700002202009773012502031856008102156852000902237655001202246IND60440813820170825000000.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044081382DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-015-0158-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmini, Vajihe10aInterspecific variations in seed germination and seedling emergence of three Setaria species  ap. 539-545.  aSetaria glauca (L.) Beauv., Setaria verticillata (L.) P. Beauv., and Setaria viridis (L.) P. Beauv. are summer annuals and problematic weeds of many annual and perennial summer crops and orchards in the north of Iran. There is no information about interspecific variations in responses to environmental factors. In this study, interspecific variations of the Setaria in response to temperature in light/dark and complete darkness regimes, pH, salt and osmotic stress, and seed sowing depth in the laboratory and greenhouse experiments were investigated. The optimum temperature of S. viridis and S. verticillata seed germination was 25/15 °C in light/dark regime, while germination of S. glauca at 20 °C was the maximum in both light/dark and complete darkness regimes. The maximum germination of the Setaria occurred at pH 7 (41–48 %) and no seed germinated at pH 11. S. verticillata and S. viridis were moderately tolerant to salt and osmotic stress, but S. glauca was more tolerant to higher levels of stress. The maximum seedling emergence occurred when the seeds were planted on the soil surface (88–94 %) and decreased as sowing depth increased. Seedling emergence of S. verticillata and S. viridis reached zero at depths of 6 cm, while 12.11 % of S. glauca seedlings emerged at a depth of 8 cm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSetaria pumila subsp. pumila 3aSetaria verticillata 3aSetaria viridis 3aannuals 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aorchards 3aosmotic stress 3apH 3aplanting 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil 3asowing 3asummer 3atemperature 3aweeds 3aIran1 aZaefarian, Faezeh1 aRezvani, Mohammad0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2015 Sept., v. 38, no. 3 p.539-545dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-015-0158-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245018100170300001600351500001500367520126900382592002801651650001301679650003701692650002101729650001201750650000901762650002701771650002001798650001801818650001801836650001401854650001901868650001801887653000901905653002001914653001901934653001201953653002501965653001101990700001902001700005502020773010002075856008502175852000902260655001202269IND60546551120221123035224.0160903e20150211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054655112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.09.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Eun-jung,10aAbiotic reductive extraction of arsenic from contaminated soils enhanced by complexation: Arsenic extraction by reducing agents and combination of reducing and chelating agents  ap. 454-461.  a2019-12-06  aAbiotic reductive extraction of arsenic from contaminated soils was studied with various reducing agents and combinations of reducing and chelating agents in order to remediate arsenic-contaminated soils. Oxalate and ascorbic acid were effective to extract arsenic from soil in which arsenic was associated with amorphous iron oxides, but they were not effective to extract arsenic from soils in which arsenic was bound to crystalline oxides or those in which arsenic was mainly present as a scorodite phase. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study showed that iron oxides present in soils were transformed to Fe(II,III) or Fe(II) oxide forms such as magnetite (Fe3O4, FeIIFe2IIIO4) by reduction with dithionite. Thus, arsenic extraction by dithionite was not effective due to the re-adsorption of arsenic to the newly formed iron oxide phase. Combination of chelating agents with reducing agents greatly improved arsenic extraction from soil samples. About 90% of the total arsenic could be extracted from all soil samples by using a combination of dithionite and EDTA. Chelating agents form strong complexation with iron, which can prevent precipitation of a new iron oxide phase and also enhance iron oxide dissolution via a non-reductive dissolution pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aoxalates 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3achelating agents 3aarsenic 3airon 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3areducing agents 3aferrous oxide 3asoil sampling 3amagnetite 3apolluted soils 3aascorbic acid 0aSoil 0aChelating agent 0aReducing agent 0aArsenic 0aReductive extraction 0aoxides1 aLee, Jae-Cheol1 aBaek, Kitae1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7976-64840 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2015 Feb. 11, v. 283 p.454-461dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.09.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002600170245013700196300001600333520158700349592002801936650002001964650001901984650002302003650002902026650002602055650002402081650002202105650001602127650001502143650002402158650001102182650002602193650001502219650001602234650001902250650002202269650002202291650001202313650002502325650001102350650001302361650002002374650003802394650002502432651001502457651001502472653002302487653001402510653002502524653002902549653001502578700002002593700001902613700001802632773010502650856008502755852000902840655001202849IND60113324720221119162935.0160903e20130930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011332472DNAL7 a238074342pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, Robert B.10aUsing choice experiments to understand household tradeoffs regarding pineapple production and environmental management in Costa Rica  ap. 308-316.  aChoices among environmental management alternatives involve tradeoffs where, for example, the benefits of environmental protection may be offset by economic costs or welfare losses to individual agents. Understanding individual or household-level preferences regarding these tradeoffs is not always straightforward, and it often requires an analysis of choices under alternative scenarios. A household survey was used to gather data for a choice experiment, where respondents were asked to choose among pairs of alternative management scenarios about pineapple production in Costa Rica. The experimental design consisted of six attributes that varied on between two and five attribute levels, and the experiment and accompanying survey were administered orally in Spanish. The results show that respondents are willing to make tradeoffs with respect to the management attributes in order to see an overall improvement in environmental quality. Respondents were willing to accept a moderate level of pesticide application, presumably in exchange for paying a lower cost or seeing a gain in another area, such as monitoring or soil conservation. Buffer zones were significant only in the case of large farms. The results have implications for policy decisions that aim to reflect public attitudes, particularly the aspects of pineapple production that matter most to people living near pineapple plantations. The study also highlights the effectiveness of the choice experiment approach in examining household preferences about environmental management in a rural development context.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3aeconomic costs 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental protection 3aenvironmental quality 3aexperimental design 3aissues and policy 3alarge farms 3amonitoring 3aoral administration 3apeople 3apesticide application 3apineapples 3aplantations 3apublic opinion 3arural development 3asoil conservation 3asurveys 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aAnanas 2aAttitude 2aChoice Behavior 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Policy 3aCosta Rica 0aCosta Rica 0aChoice experiments 0aTradeoffs 0aPineapple production 0aEnvironmental management 0aCosta Rica1 aKellon, Delanie1 aLeon, Ramon G.1 aArvai, Joseph0 tJournal of environmental management.g2013 Sept. 30, v. 127 p.308-316dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012300168300001600291520133300307592002801640650001301668650001001681650002201691650001801713650003101731650001101762650003701773650002601810650000901836700002201845700002301867773010201890856004801992852000902040655001202049IND50063140220221121072544.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006314022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-012-0498-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeronovski, Nika14aThe influence of surface-treated nano-TiO₂ (rutile) incorporation in water-based acrylic coatings on wood protection  ap. 317-328.  aThe aim of this research was to synthesize surface-treated nano-titanium dioxide (TiO₂) particles and incorporate them into water-based acrylic systems, which could offer long-term protection for UV-sensible wood substrates. To suppress the photocatalytic activity, the surface of TiO₂ nanoparticles in rutile crystal structure was coated with amorphous silica (SiO₂) layer. The amounts of SiO₂ were 5 and 10 wt%, respectively. Formation of SiO₂ layer on TiO₂ surface was analyzed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. SiO₂ layer thickness increases as a function of precursor loading. In addition, the influence of SiO₂ loading on rutile UV-protective properties was determined. Transparent UV-protective coatings were developed by incorporating surface-treated nano-TiO₂ into water-based acrylic stain. The particle size distribution was determined using dynamic light-scattering measurements, which indicate that the suspension of surface-treated rutile is stable against agglomeration. Furthermore, the color change and ability of protection against UV light of coatings after nanoparticles incorporation were determined. TiO₂, surface treated with 10 wt% of SiO₂, yielded coatings of higher transparency; however, TiO₂, surface treated with 5 wt% of SiO₂, improved UV protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acolor 3acrystal structure 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size distribution 3asilica 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation 3awood1 aVerhovšek, Dejan1 aGodnjavec, Jerneja0 tWood science and technology.g2013 Mar., v. 47, no. 2 p.317-328dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-012-0498-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017800165300001600343520163700359592002801996650002302024650004902047650001602096650002002112650001902132650002802151650001202179650001602191650001602207650002302223650001502246650001402261650001202275650001802287650001702305650002002322650001002342651001002352653003802362653001402400653002602414700001902440700001602459700001402475700001902489700001902508700005702527773012702584856008102711852000902792655001202801IND60685660920221117062343.0200305e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068566092DNAL7 a10.1017/S13689800190025682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Mian-Li10aAdherence to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is associated with lower presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in middle-aged and elderly adults  ap. 674-682.  aPrevious studies have shown that the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet might contribute to managing risk factors of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but evidence is limited. We examined the association of DASH diet score (DASH-DS) with NAFLD, as well as the intermediary effects of serum retinol-binding protein-4 (RBP4), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), serum TAG, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and BMI. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a population-based cohort study. Dietary data and lifestyle factors were assessed by face-to-face interviews and the DASH-DS was then calculated. We assessed serum RBP4, hs-CRP and TAG and calculated HOMA-IR. The presence and degree of NAFLD were determined by abdominal sonography. Guangzhou, China. Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study participants, aged 40–75 years at baseline (n 3051). After adjusting for potential covariates, we found an inverse association between DASH-DS and the presence of NAFLD (Pₜᵣₑₙd = 0·009). The OR (95 % CI) of NAFLD for quintiles 2–5 were 0·78 (0·62, 0·98), 0·74 (0·59, 0·94), 0·69 (0·55, 0·86) and 0·77 (0·61, 0·97), respectively. Path analyses indicated that a higher DASH-DS was associated with lower serum RBP4, hs-CRP, TAG, HOMA-IR and BMI, which were positively associated with the degree of NAFLD. Adherence to the DASH diet was independently associated with a marked lower prevalence of NAFLD in Chinese adults, especially in women and those without abdominal obesity, and might be mediated by reducing RBP4, hs-CRP, TAG, HOMA-IR and BMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acohort studies 3across-sectional studies 3aelderly 3afatty liver 3ahomeostasis 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterviews 3alifestyle 3aobesity 3apath analysis 3arisk factors 3aultrasonography 3awomen 3aChina 0aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease 0aNutrition 0aCross-sectional study1 aLin, Jie-Sheng1 aLi, Yi-Hong1 aLiu, Meng1 aDeng, Yun-Yang1 aWang, Chang-Yi1 aChen, Yu-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1658-55280 tPublic health nutrition.g2020 Mar., v. 23, no. 4 p.674-682dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190025683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03223naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012800157300002000285500001900305520181000324592002802134650002502162650001902187650001002206650002302216650002302239650001102262650001302273650002002286650001102306650001402317650001602331650001102347650001402358700001302372700002102385700001602406700001402422700001602436700001902452700001402471700001602485700002102501773012402522856007402646852000902720655001202729IND60678889720221119224306.0191218e20191213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067888972DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra08336g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zeqing10aHuman periodontal ligament stem cells on calcium phosphate scaffold delivering platelet lysate to enhance bone regeneration  ap. 41161-41172.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHuman periodontal ligament stem cells (hPDLSCs) are promising for tissue engineering applications but have received relatively little attention. Human platelet lysate (HPL) contains a cocktail of growth factors. To date, there has been no report on hPDLSC seeding on scaffolds loaded with HPL. The objectives of this study were to develop a calcium phosphate cement (CPC)–chitosan scaffold loaded with HPL and investigate their effects on hPDLSC viability, osteogenic differentiation and bone mineral synthesis for the first time. hPDLSCs were harvested from extracted human teeth. Scaffolds were formed by mixing CPC powder with a chitosan solution containing HPL. Four groups were tested: CPC–chitosan + 0% HPL (control); CPC–chitosan + 2.66% HPL; CPC–chitosan + 5.31% HPL; CPC–chitosan + 10.63% HPL. Scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining, CCK-8, qRT-PCR, alkaline phosphatase and bone minerals assay were applied for hPDLSCs on scaffolds. hPDLSCs attached well on CPC–chitosan scaffold. Adding 10.63% HPL into CPC increased cell proliferation and viability (p < 0.05). ALP gene expression of CPC–chitosan + 10.63% HPL was 7-fold that of 0% HPL at 14 days. Runx2, OSX and Coll1 of CPC–chitosan + 10.63% HPL was 2–3 folds those at 0% HPL (p < 0.05). ALP activity of CPC–chitosan + 10.63% HPL was 2-fold that at 0% HPL (p < 0.05). Bone minerals synthesized by hPDLSCs for CPC–chitosan + 10.63% HPL was 3-fold that at 0% HPL (p < 0.05). This study showed that CPC–chitosan scaffold was a promising carrier for HPL delivery, and HPL in CPC exerted excellent promoting effects on hPDLSCs for bone tissue engineering for the first time. The novel hPDLSC–CPC–chitosan–HPL construct has great potential for orthopedic, dental and maxillofacial regenerative applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone formation 3abones 3acalcium phosphates 3acell proliferation 3acement 3achitosan 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aligaments 3aorthopedics 3asowing 3aviability1 aLiu, Jin1 aWeir, Michael D.1 aZhang, Ning1 aZhang, Li1 aXie, Xianju1 aZhang, Charles1 aZhang, Ke1 aBai, Yuxing1 aXu, Hockin H.

Cross-sectional study. Mothers completed questionnaires over the telephone and child anthropometry was measured objectively using standardized procedures; BMI Z-scores (BMIZ) were calculated based on the age- and sex-specific WHO growth standards and reference data. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the original seven-factor CFQ model, as well as a modified nine-factor model. Cronbach’s α was calculated to examine the internal consistency of each factor; Spearman correlation was used to examine 2-week retest reliability. Factor–factor and factor–child BMIZ correlations were examined. Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A total of 209 mothers and children were recruited from eight different pre-schools. Both the original seven-factor and modified nine-factor CFQ-A exhibited good fit (root-mean-square-error of approximation < 0·05). Six out of nine factors had excellent internal consistency and all factors showed excellent 2-week test–retest reliability. There were significant correlations between child BMIZ and five out of the nine factors; Perceived Child Weight, Perceived Parent Weight, Restriction and Monitoring were each positively correlated with child BMIZ, while Concern about Child’s Diet was negatively correlated with child BMIZ. The study provided evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the original seven-factor and modified nine-factor CFQ-A. Future studies are needed to further establish the psychometric properties of the CFQ-A in addition to other feeding assessment tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3abody mass index 3achild nutrition 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3afactor analysis 3amonitoring 3amothers 3aquestionnaires 3atelephones 3aSaudi Arabia 0aValidation 0aMaternal feeding 0aPre-schoolers 0aBMI Z-score0 tPublic health nutrition.g2020 Mar., v. 23, no. 4 p.599-608dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800190025813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007100173300001400244520141600258592002801674650001801702650001401720650001701734650001201751650001601763650001501779650001501794650001501809650001601824650001501840650001801855651001401873651001801887651001501905653002001920653001801940653001801958653001501976653001701991653002502008700002402033700002702057700002202084773010202106856008502208852000902293655001202302IND60591499020221120051631.0190411e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059149902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2018.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoisnoir, Aurélie10aDepth distribution of benthic dinoflagellates in the Caribbean Sea  ap. 74-83.  aMonitoring of benthic dinoflagellates is usually conducted between sub-surface and 5 m depth, where these organisms are supposed to be in highest abundances. However, only few studies have focused on the small-scale depth distribution of benthic dinoflagellates. In the present study, abundances of dinoflagellates were evaluated on an invasive macrophyte Halophila stipulacea in two coastal sites in Guadeloupe (Caribbean Sea) along a depth gradient from sub-surface to 3 m at Gosier and until 20 m at Rivière Sens during the tropical wet and dry seasons. Species of genus Ostreopsis and Prorocentrum were the most abundant. Depth did not influence total dinoflagellate abundance but several genera showed particular depth-distribution preferences. The highest abundances of Ostreopsis and Gambierdiscus species were estimated preferentially in surface waters, whereas Coolia spp. were found in the same proportions but in deeper waters. Halophila stipulacea biomass was positively correlated with Ostreopsis spp. abundance. Our study suggests that sampling of benthic dinoflagellates should be conducted at different water depths taking into account the presence of the macroalgal substrate as well. In the Caribbean area, special attention should be addressed to the presence of H. stipulacea which tends to homogenize the marine landscape and represents a substrate for hosting dinoflagellate growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambierdiscus 3aHalophila 3aProrocentrum 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3adry season 3alandscapes 3amacroalgae 3amacrophytes 3amonitoring 3asurface water 3aCaribbean 3aCaribbean Sea 3aGuadeloupe 0aDinoflagellates 0aCaribbean Sea 0aGambierdiscus 0aOstreopsis 0aProrocentrum 0aHalophila stipulacea1 aPascal, Pierre-Yves1 aCordonnier, Sébastien1 aLemée, Rodolophe0 tJournal of sea research.g2018 May, v. 135 p.74-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2018.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245013500167300001600302500001900318520093600337536009801273592002801371596003501399650001301434650002001447650001701467650003401484650001201518650001901530650002601549650001701575650002601592650001801618650001501636653001601651653002801667653002401695700001701719700001701736700001601753700001601769773012801785856008501913852000901998655001202007IND60720214720221120174245.0201210e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072021472DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2020.17451572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yuan10aRapid and sensitive detection of ochratoxin A in rice flour using a fluorescent microsphere immunochromatographic test strip assay  ap. 563-574.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, a high sensitivity and specificity monoclonal antibody (mAb) was developed based on the hydroxy and carboxy-termini of ochratoxin A (OTA). A fluorescent microsphere immunochromatographic test strip (FM-ICTS) was assembled for the rapid detection the OTA in rice flour. Some relevant parameters were optimized including the best concentration of coating antigen and optimal diluent buffer composition. Under optimal conditions, the strip assay had a visual limit of detection (LOD) of 2 ng/mL and a cut-off value of 16 ng/mL for OTA in rice flour samples. By means of a strip scan reader, we obtained a quantitative measurement for OTA with an LOD of 1.27 ng/mL. No significant difference in the strip test results was seen when compared to an ic-ELISA assay or LC–MS/MS. This also shows, therefore, that the FM-ICTS has potential application for rapid and accurate quantitative detection in the market place.  aThis work is financially supported by National Key R&D Program [grant munber 2017YFC1600602].  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFC1600602a2018YFF0214803 3aantigens 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3amarkets 3amicroparticles 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aochratoxin A 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3arice flour 0afood safety 0afluorescent microsphere 0amonoclonal antibody1 aLiu, Liqiang1 aLiu, Haiying1 aXu, Liguang1 aGuang, Hua,0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 31, no. 1 p.563-574dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45182x1465-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2020.17451573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014300154300002000297520114200317592002801459650002301487650003001510650001101540650001301551650002301564650003401587650001601621700001901637700001301656700001701669700001701686700001501703700001501718700001501733700001501748773012501763856007401888852000901962655001201971IND60617165320221120154215.0181024e20180912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061716532DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra05477k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Yuan10aSelf-assembly of an oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)-based molecule on an HOPG surface: insights from multi-scale simulation and STM observation  ap. 31868-31873.  aTo gain knowledge of the most important weak interactions for supramolecular self-assembly and observe molecular structure for self-assembled architectures, the two-dimensional self-assembly of an oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)-based molecule (AS-OPV) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite has been investigated. Accurate atomic configuration for the AS-OPV self-assembled pattern has been identified by means of multi-scale simulation combined with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. The weak interactions which contribute to the formation of AS-OPV self-assembly are studied by analysis of non-covalent interactions existing in the system and theoretical calculation of their energy values. Investigation of the molecular structure of self-assembly and STM images at a certain temperature range is performed by molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations. This work paves the way to explore the contribution of weak interactions for the self-assembly system, as well as providing a reference to observe the possible self-assembled structure at temperatures not convenient for direct experimental observation.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3atemperature1 aYang, Yingying1 aYao, Man1 aXue, Xiaowan1 aWang, Xudong1 aHuang, Hao1 aChen, Ting1 aWang, Dong1 aWan, Lijun0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 12, v. 8, no. 56 p.31868-31873dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra05477k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015800175300001600333520169500349592002802044650001302072650001402085650002102099650001002120650001702130650001002147650001802157650002002175650001602195650001702211650001102228650001402239650001202253653001202265653001402277653001502291653001702306653002602323653001102349653001102360700001802371700001902389700001702408773009102425856008502516852000902601655001202610IND60551295120221122203927.0161018e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055129512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrivedi, Amit Kumar10aPinealectomy abolishes circadian behavior and interferes with circadian clock gene oscillations in brain and liver but not retina in a migratory songbird  ap. 156-163.  aIn songbirds, the pineal gland is part of the multi-oscillatory circadian timing system, with participating component oscillators in the eyes and hypothalamus. This study investigated the role of the pineal gland in development of the nighttime migratory restlessness (Zugunruhe) and generation of circadian gene oscillations in the retina, brain and liver tissues in migratory redheaded buntings (Emberiza bruniceps). Pinealectomized (pinx) and sham-operated buntings entrained to short days (8h light: 16h darkness, 8L:16D) were sequentially exposed for 10days each to stimulatory long days (13L: 11D) and constant dim light (LLdim; a condition that tested circadian rhythm persistence). Whereas activity-rest pattern was monitored continuously, the mRNA expressions of clock genes (bmal1, clock, npas2, per2, cry1, rorα, reverα) were measured in the retina, hypothalamus, telencephalon, optic tectum and liver tissues at circadian times, CT, 1, 6, 13, 17 and 21 (CT 0, activity onset) on day 11 of the LLdim. The absence of the pineal gland did not affect the development of long-day induced Zugunruhe but caused decay of the circadian rhythm in Zugunruhe as well as the clock gene oscillations in the hypothalamus, but not in the retina. Further, there were variable effects of pinealectomy in the peripheral brain and liver tissue circadian gene oscillations, notably the persistence of per 2 and cry1 (optic tectum), rorα (telencephalon) and npas2 (liver) mRNA oscillations in pinx birds. We suggest the pineal gland dependence of the generation of circadian gene oscillations in the hypothalamus, not retina, and peripheral brain and liver tissues in migratory redheaded buntings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmberiza 3aZugunruhe 3acircadian rhythm 3agenes 3ahypothalamus 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amigratory birds 3apineal body 3apinealectomy 3aretina 3asongbirds 3atissues 0aBunting 0aCircadian 0aClock gene 0aHypothalamus 0aPeripheral oscillator 0aPineal 0aRetina1 aMalik, Shalie1 aRani, Sangeeta1 aKumar, Vinod0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 156 p.156-163dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245008600207300001800293520147900311592002801790650001601818650001201834650001301846650002101859650001801880650001201898650001001910650001201920650001001932650002001942653001901962653001401981653001601995653001802011653001702029700002202046773011302068856008602181852000902267655001202276IND60591233120221120102224.0190410e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059123312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.12.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiz, Edurne1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0862-389X10aTrait anxiety and self-concept among children and adolescents with food neophobia  ap. 1054-1059.  aFood problems in children and adolescents often have a detrimental effect on the emotional and psychological wellbeing of their parents. However, the impact of such problems on the psychological wellbeing of children and adolescents themselves has been less widely studied. The purpose of this study was to determine whether children and adolescents with food neophobia differed in trait anxiety and dimensions of self-concept from their neophilic and their average peers. A community sample of 831 participants (368 males and 463 females) between the ages of 8 and 16 were classified into six groups based on scores obtained on the Spanish Child Food Neophobia Scale (i.e., neophobic, average, and neophilic) and their age (i.e., children vs. adolescents). Compared with their neophilic peers, children with food neophobia showed higher levels of trait anxiety and a poorer social, physical, and academic self-concept. Among adolescents similar results were observed for trait anxiety and physical self-concept, but instead of social and academic self-concept it was family self-concept which distinguished between neophobic and neophilic participants. These results suggest that food neophobia is associated with trait anxiety and with some dimensions of self-concept. This highlights the need to ascertain the threshold between ‘normal’ and ‘problematic’ eating behaviors, since the fact that a behavior is to some extent usual does not imply that it is harmless.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aanxiety 3achildren 3aeating disorders 3aeating habits 3afemales 3amales 3aparents 3apeers 3aself-perception 0aFood neophobia 0aChildhood 0aAdolescence 0aTrait anxiety 0aSelf-concept1 aBalluerka, Nekane0 tFood research international.g2018 Mar., v. 105 p.1054-1059dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245006900167300001600236500001900252520142500271592002801696650001601724650001701740650001401757650001001771650002201781650001301803650002301816650002101839650001301860650001901873653001301892653002701905653001201932653001601944700001401960700002001974700001901994700001802013700001302031700001702044700001902061700001902080700001302099773016502112856008602277852000902363655001202372IND60720396420221122221851.0210124e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072039642DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63231-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHUANG, Cong10aInvasionDB: A genome and gene database of invasive alien species  ap. 191-200.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInvasive alien species (IAS) are species whose introduction to areas outside of their native range cause harm to economics, biodiversity, and the environment. Understanding the genetic basis of invasiveness is critical for preventing invasion by an alien species and managing IAS with eco-friendly control methods. In addition, uncovering the genomic features of IAS is essential for accurately predicting invasiveness. However, even though increasing efforts have been devoted to sequencing the genomes of IAS, there is still not an integrated genome database for the invasive biology community. Here, we first determined a list of invasive plants and animals by mining references and databases. Then, we retrieved the genomic and gene data of these IAS, and constructed a database, InvasionDB. InvasionDB encompasses 131 IAS genomes, 76 annotated IAS assemblies, and links these data to conventional functions such as searching for gene coding sequences and Pfam, KEGG, NR annotations, BLAST server, JBrowse, and downloads services. Next, we analyzed 19 invasiveness-related gene families which confer invasiveness in insects. To study the roles of noncoding RNA in invasiveness, we also annotated 135 494 miRNAs, 89 294 rRNAs, and 2 671 941 tRNAs from these IAS. In summary, InvasionDB is useful for studying the invasiveness at the genomic level, and thus helps to develop novel management strategies to control IAS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3abiodiversity 3aeconomics 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3agenomics 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 0adatabase 0ainvasive alien species 0agenomic 0agene family1 aLANG, Kun1 aQIAN, Wan-qiang1 aWANG, Shu-ping1 aCAO, Xiao-mei1 aHe, Rui,1 aZHAN, An-ran1 aCHEN, Meng-yao1 aYANG, Nian-wan1 aLi, Fei,0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2021 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.191-200dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

In this study, core–shell structured nanofibers containing a water-soluble porogen were fabricated via solution blow spinning, to be used as drug-loaded bioactive tissue scaffolds. Hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and hydrophobic poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) were chosen to produce the core and the shell compartments of the fiber, respectively. In the core, a hydrophilic sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye was loaded as a model drug. In the PCL shell, two kinds of PVP with different molecular weights (40 kDa and 1300 kDa) were added, and the influence of PVP leaching on the SRB release and cell growth was investigated. The monolithic PCL-shelled fibers displayed a sustained SRB release with a weak burst effect. The addition of PVP in the shell induced a phase separation, forming microscale PVP domains. The PVP domain, acting as a porogen, was leached out in the medium and, as a result, the burst release of SRB was promoted. This burst effect was more prominent with the lower molecular weight PVP. The biocompatibility of the core–shell fibers was evaluated with human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) by a cell viability assay and microscopic observation of cell proliferation. The HEK cells on fibers with a PVP/PCL composite shell formed self-assembled spherical clusters, displaying higher cell viability and proliferation than those on the monolithic PCL-shelled fibers that induced HEK cell growth in two-dimensional monolayers. The results demonstrate that the presence of hydrophilic porogens on tissue scaffolds can accelerate drug release and enhance cell proliferation by increasing surface wettability, roughness and porosity. The findings of this study provide a basic insight into the construction of bioactive three-dimensional tissue scaffolds.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acell growth 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3adyes 3ahumans 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3akeratinocytes 3aleaching 3amicroscopy 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3aporosity 3aroughness 3aseparation 3aspinning 3atissue scaffolds 3aviability assays 3awater solubility 3awettability1 aKim, Min-jung,1 aChoi, Kyoungju1 aKim, Jooyoun1 aChoi, Seong-O0 tRSC advances.g2018 Sept. 19, v. 8, no. 57 p.32470-32480dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra05485a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013400172300001600306520110900322592002801431650001501459650001901474650001301493650001501506650002001521650001801541650001501559650003301574650002201607650001301629650001801642650002001660650001501680650001301695653001501708653002401723653004701747653001801794653001201812700002001824773009901844856008501943852000902028655001202037IND60554498720221123043641.0161024e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055449872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrivas, Kamlesh10aIonic liquid matrix-based dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction for enhanced MALDI–MS analysis of phospholipids in soybean  ap. 124-130.  aIonic liquid matrix (ILM) is found to be a very versatile substance for analysis of broad range of organic molecules in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI–MS) due to good solubility for a variety of analytes, formation of homogenous crystals and high vacuum stability of the matrix. In the present work, an ILM, cyno-4-hydroxycinnamic acid-butylamine (CHCAB) was employed in dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (DLLME) as sample probe and matrix for extraction and ionization of phospholipids from food samples (soybean) prior to MALDI–MS analysis. With the employed technique, 8–125 fold improvement in signal intensity and limit of detection were achieved for the analysis of phospholipids. The best extraction efficiency of phospholipids in ILM–DLLME was obtained with 5min extraction time in presence 30mg/mL CHCAB and 1.2% NaCl using chloroform as an extracting solvent and methanol as a dispersing solvent. Further, the developed ILM–DLLME procedure has been successfully applied for the analysis of phospholipids in soybean samples in MALDI–MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3achloroform 3achromatography 3acrystals 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aionic liquids 3aionization 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3aphospholipids 3asodium chloride 3asolubility 3asoybeans 0aMALDI–MS 0aIonic liquid matrix 0aDispersive liquid–liquid microextraction 0aPhospholipids 0aSoybean1 aTapadia, Kavita0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 1001 p.124-130dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245019000158300001800348520069900366592002801065650001701093650001301110650001401123650002301137650002001160650002001180650001301200650001401213650001101227650003401238650001301272700001801285700002001303700001201323773012501335856007401460852000901534655001201543IND60662587220221118033151.0190906e20101103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066258722DNAL7 a10.1039/c0gc00271b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Hongying10aAerobic oxidative desulfurization of benzothiophene, dibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene using an Anderson-type catalyst [(C₁₈H₃₇)₂N(CH₃)₂]₅[IMo₆O₂₄]  ap. 1954-1958.  aBenzothiophene (BT), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) are oxidized to their corresponding sulfones by an Anderson-type catalyst [(C₁₈H₃₇)₂N(CH₃)₂]₅IMo₆O₂₄ using molecular oxygen as the oxidant under mild reaction conditions.

Herein, we describe a combined strategy to enhance charge collection from CdSe/CdSeₓTe₁–ₓ type-II heterojunction nanorods (HNRs) utilized as light harvesters for sensitized solar cells. By integrating morphology- and composition-tuned type-II HNRs into solar cells, factors that yield interfaces favorable both for the electron injection into TiO₂ and hole transfer to electrolyte are examined. Furthermore, it is shown that a more efficient photovoltaic system results from cosensitization with CdS quantum dots (QDs) predeposited on a TiO₂ scaffold, which improves charge collection from HNRs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis suggests that such a synergistically enhanced system benefits from the decreased recombination within HNRs and facilitated charge transport through the cosensitized TiO₂ electrode, even with the activation of a recombination path presumably related to the photogenerated holes in CdS QDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3aphotovoltaic cells 3aquantum dots 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atitanium dioxide 0asensitized solar cells 0ananorods 0atype-II heterojunction 0acharge collection 0aII−VI semiconductors1 aFlanagan, Joseph C.1 aLee, Byungho1 aHwang, Taehyun1 aKim, Jaewook1 aGil, Bumjin1 aShim, Moonsub1 aPark, Byungwoo0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 9, no. 37 p.31931-31939dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b097453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03811naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011100165300001600276500001900292520224900311592002802560650001302588650001502601650002302616650001602639650001802655650001002673650002702683650002302710650001702733650001302750650002502763650001002788650001902798650000902817650001502826650001702841650001802858650001002876650001602886651001002902653001802912653001702930653001202947653002002959700002102979773016503000856008603165961000903251852000903260655001203269IND60720396620221120182528.0210124e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072039662DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63238-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLI, Ji-fu10aNitrogen release and re-adsorption dynamics on crop straw residue during straw decomposition in an Alfisol  ap. 248-259.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReturning crop straw to the field not only improves the nitrogen (N) supplying capacity and N retention of soil but also decreases the amount of rural organic waste and prevents air pollution. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of the N release and re-adsorption dynamics on crop straw residue during straw decomposition in agricultural soil is important, and this understanding can help us strengthen N fertilizer management during the crop growth period. An on-farm incubation experiment was conducted in the Jianghan Plain in Central China under flooded conditions using the nylon mesh bag method. Results showed that the decomposition rate of crop straw was much faster at the beginning of the incubation stage, whereas it was steady during the later stage with no observed differences among the three types of crop straw. After 120 d of incubation, the cumulative decomposition proportion of rice straw, wheat straw and rape straw was 72.9, 56.2, and 66.9%, respectively. The proportion of N that released from the three crop straws was 52.0, 54.4 and 54.9%, respectively. The zeta potentials and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area of the rice, wheat and rape straw residues increased gradually as the decomposition period progressed. The water adsorption capacity of the rice straw was significantly affected during the decomposition period. The saturated water adsorption capacity of rice straw was the highest at 30 d of decomposition (4.17 g g–¹) and then decreased slightly. The saturated water adsorption of wheat and rape straws reached the lowest value at 30 d and then gradually increased and became stable. All the results demonstrated that crop straw and straw residue can re-adsorb NH₄⁺ ions from the surrounding solution. The re-adsorption was affected by the decomposition period and concentration of exogenous NH₄⁺ and was independent of the crop species via the combined efforts of physical and chemical adsorption, ion exchange and water retention on residue surfaces. Future studies will focus on straw returning and N fertilizer application at different levels of moisture content of the soil reduce potential negative effects such as water-logging and excess N caused by the straw substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aadsorption 3aagricultural soils 3aagriculture 3aair pollution 3acrops 3afertilizer application 3aflooded conditions 3aion exchange 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anylon 3aorganic wastes 3arice 3arice straw 3asurface area 3awater content 3awheat 3awheat straw 3aChina 0adecomposition 0anitrogen (N) 0aAlfisol 0astraw substrate1 aZHONG, Fang-fang0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2021 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.248-259dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

To assess long-term exposure to PAHs, we developed a simple and sensitive method for measuring PAHs in hair by online in-tube solid-phase microextraction using a CP-Sil 19CB capillary column as an extraction device, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography using a Zorbax Eclipse PAH column and fluorescence detection. Seventeen PAHs could be analyzed simultaneously, with good linearity from 20 to 1000pg/mL each as determined using stable isotope-labeled PAH internal standards. The detection limits of PAHs were 0.5–20.4pg/mL. PAHs in human hair samples were extracted by ultrasonication in 50mM NaOH in methanol, and successfully analyzed without any interference peaks, with good recovery rates above 70% in spiked hair samples. Using this method, we evaluated the suitability of using hair PAHs as biomarkers for long-term exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3achronic exposure 3acombustion 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3amethanol 3aorganic matter 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apyrolysis 3asodium hydroxide 3asolid phase microextraction 3aultrasonic treatment 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aHair 0aExposure biomarkers 0aIn-tube solid-phase microextraction 0aHigh-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection1 aIshizaki, Atsushi1 aKataoka, Hiroyuki0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 1000 p.187-191dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245020200174506011700376506007600493520180800569592002802377506003702405650002202442650002402464650002402488650001602512650001602528650001002544650000902554650001402563650001702577650002302594650001602617650001202633650001202645650002002657650001702677650002002694653001602714653001702730653001402747653002002761700001902781773010002800856008402900852000902984655001202993IND60783550820221207073601.0220824e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078355082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1012602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerera, G.S.Champika10aReplacement of fishmeal by house cricket (Acheta domesticus) and field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) meals: Effect for growth, pigmentation, and breeding performances of guppy (Poecilia reticulata)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInsect meal is a promising alternative to unsustainable fishmeal. However, limited studies have been focused on identifying the fishmeal replacement potential related to ornamental fish compared with food fish. Therefore, an experiment was conducted using house cricket (Acheta domesticus) and field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) meals to test the growth and pigmentation performances of Guppy (Poecilia reticulata). The protein content of the fish meal in the control diet was replaced by 50%, 75%, and 100% by both cricket meals. One-day-old fry of all the treatments were initially fed by Artemia nauplii for five days; then, the research diets were fed from day six to day thirty thrice a day ad libitum by the respective research diets. The growth performance of all the treatments was significantly similar (p > 0.05) to each other and the control. Therefore, the results confirmed that both insect meals could replace fishmeal by 100% without any adverse effects on the growth of the nursery phase of P. reticulata. Furthermore, sorted and further reared fry were tested for breeding performance, and the results showed that both insect meals did not affect negatively (P > 0.05) the delivered fry number and its weight and length. The total carotenoid concentration and MATLAB analysis of the photographed caudal fins of A. domesticus meal-fed fish showed that all the inclusion levels of the insect meal did not affect (P > 0.05) pigmentation with the control. However, the diet that the field cricket meal included diet-fed fish replaced 100% fishmeal showed statistically higher (P < 0.05) color intensity than the control. Pigmentation is a crucial factor for ornamental fish in marketing. Therefore, the field cricket meal is more suitable than house cricket for P. reticulata feed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAcheta domesticus 3aGryllus bimaculatus 3aPoecilia reticulata 3aaquaculture 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3adiet 3afish meal 3afood animals 3agrowth performance 3ainsect meal 3ainsects 3anauplii 3aornamental fish 3apigmentation 3aprotein content 0aInsect meal 0aCricket meal 0aFish meal 0aOrnamental fish1 aBhujel, Ram C.0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 Aug., v. 25 p.101260-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1012603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014300158300001800301520068900319592002801008650001601036650001701052650002001069650001201089650001301101650001401114650001401128650001301142650001301155700001601168700001601184773012501200856007401325852000901399655001201408IND60662587320221118033048.0190906e20101006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066258732DNAL7 a10.1039/c0gc00274g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Jia-Neng10aWater mediated trapping of active methylene intermediates generated by IBX-induced oxidation of Baylis–Hillman adducts with nucleophiles  ap. 1772-1782.  aWater proved to be an efficient solvent for oxidation of a Baylis–Hillman adduct with IBX.

This strategy offers an alternative way to methylenylation of β-dicarbonyl compounds with formaldehyde for the formation of a methylene intermediate, thus allows the use of some nucleophiles that are chemically unstable to formaldehyde.

However, little research has focused on the dynamic impact of income and income distribution on food demand in rural China. Using China Health and Nutrition Survey data, this study employs a consistent two-step quadratic almost ideal demand system model, with addressed problems of endogeneity of total expenditure and zero shares, to estimate the food demand elasticities among adults in rural areas with regard to the different income strata. The results show that changes in income and income strata have significant effects on food demand in rural areas. Except for grains, all other food groups, including vegetables, oils and fats, animal products, and other foods, have positive income elasticities, and the rise in the income strata will lead to declining income elasticities for grains, vegetables, oils and fats, and animal products. Based on the estimated income elasticities, the food consumption projections indicate that reducing income inequality in rural society can improve the living standard of low-income people in terms of nutrient intakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlmost Ideal Demand System 3aagriculture 3aanimals 3afood consumption 3aincome 3aincome distribution 3alow-income population 3anutrition surveys 3arural society 3asocial inequality 3aChina 0aincome redistribution 0afood demand 0aendogeneity 0acensored demand system 0arural China1 aZHAI, Shi-xian1 aBAI, Jun-fei0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2021 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.330-342dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

This study was conducted to identify the sensory descriptors of marine oils and organize them in a sensory wheel for use as a tool in quality assessment.Samples of marine oils were collected from six of the largest producers of omega-3 products in Norway. The oils were selected to cover as much variation in sensory characteristics as possible, i.e. oils with different fatty acid content originating from different species. Oils were evaluated by six industry expert panels and one trained sensory panel to build up a vocabulary through a series of language sessions. A total of 184 aroma (odor by nose), flavor, taste and mouthfeel descriptors were generated. A sensory wheel based on 60 selected descriptors grouped together in 21 defined categories was created to form a graphical presentation of the sensory vocabulary. A selection of the oil samples was also evaluated by a trained sensory panel using descriptive analysis. Chemical analysis showed a positive correlation between primary and secondary oxidation products and sensory properties such as rancidity, chemical flavor and process flavor and a negative correlation between primary oxidation products and acidic. This research is a first step towards the broader objective of standardizing the sensory terminology related to marine oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical analysis 3afatty acid composition 3aflavor 3amouthfeel 3anose 3aodors 3aoils 3aoxidation 3arancidity 3asensory evaluation 3ataste 3aterminology 3aNorway 0aOmega-3 0aQuality control 0aAroma and flavor descriptors 0aOxidation 0aPCA plot1 aMonteleone, E.1 aHersleth, M.0 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.45-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245013900175300001500314520136200329592002801691650002501719650001701744650002101761650001501782650001801797650002201815650001801837650002601855650001301881650002401894650001601918650001901934650002101953653003001974653002102004653002102025653003902046653002102085653002602106700002502132773011902157856008702276852000902363655001202372IND60603729620221117031937.0180716e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060372962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowakowski, Piotr10aTowards sustainable WEEE collection and transportation methods in circular economy - Comparative study for rural and urban settlements  ap. 93-107.  aA circular economy approach requires methods of resource management that are sustainable and efficient. A crucial process in waste management is collection and transportation of waste. One of the most valuable streams is waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). There is a variety of disposal methods available for residents and a variety of collection methods for companies.The scope of this study includes the application of artificial immune systems in planning routes of vehicles in a mobile program and in placement of containers in stationary collections of WEEE. The intent is to create a level playing field by comparing sustainability of the waste collections and transportation methods in optimal designs.The analysis includes a comparison of the three most common methods of WEEE collection including cost analysis and vehicle emission using case studies for urban and rural areas. The results show the importance of properly planned collection routes. Mobile collection is the most sustainable method of WEEE collection while drop off of waste by residents at municipal collection centers is the worst case due to high emissions and operation costs. The results and the proposed model give an opportunity to evaluate existing WEEE collection methods in urban and rural areas and propose some improvements for waste collecting companies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3acontainers 3acost analysis 3aelectronic wastes 3aimmune system 3aparticulate emissions 3aplanning 3aresource management 3arural areas 3atransportation 3awaste management 0aArtificial immune systems 0aClonal selection 0aCircular economy 0aWEEE collection and transportation 0aEmission factors 0aWaste collection cost1 aMrówczyńska, Bogna0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2018 Aug., v. 135 p.93-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245016400152300002000316520165500336592002801991650002002019650002502039650001702064650001802081650001602099650001602115650001502131650001102146650001502157650002102172650001702193650001302210650002202223650001302245650001302258650001102271650001102282650001502293650001102308651001002319700001802329700001502347700001502362700001502377700001602392700001202408700001502420700001702435773012402452856007402576852000902650655001202659IND60617165820221120154310.0181024e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061716582DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra05504a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Bo10aVariation in the main health-promoting compounds and antioxidant activity of whole and individual edible parts of baby mustard (Brassica juncea var. gemmifera)  ap. 33845-33854.  aDespite being a brassicaceous vegetable that is widely consumed in winter and spring in Southwest China, there is lack of information available on baby mustard. The aim of this study was to determine the contents of soluble proteins, soluble sugars, chlorophylls, carotenoids, ascorbic acid, proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, total phenolics, and glucosinolates, as well as the antioxidant activity of the whole edible parts and seven individual edible parts (swollen stem: petioles, peel, flesh; lateral bud: leaves, petioles, peel, flesh) of baby mustard. The results showed that significant differences in health-promoting compounds and antioxidant activity existed between the different edible parts. The lateral bud of baby mustard possessed greater health-promoting compounds than the swollen stem. In particular, the lateral bud leaves possessed abundant antioxidant compounds and antioxidant activity, indicating that these should be conserved during harvesting due to their potential contribution to human health. Furthermore, aliphatic glucosinolates were predominant, and sinigrin was the most abundant glucosinolate in all the assessed parts of baby mustard, the content of which was 15.81 μmol g⁻¹ dry weight, accounting for more than 87% of the total glucosinolate content. However, the sinigrin content in baby mustard is lower than tuber mustard, which explains the less pungent flavor of baby mustard and its better suitability as a fresh vegetable. In addition, antioxidant activity was highly correlated with total phenolics, whereas gluconasturtiin and soluble sugars were negatively correlated with the majority of antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aflavonoids 3aflavor 3aharvesting 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman health 3apetioles 3aproanthocyanidins 3aproteins 3asinigrin 3aspring 3atubers 3avegetables 3awinter 3aChina1 aTian, Yu-Xiao1 aJiang, Min1 aYuan, Qiao1 aChen, Qing1 aZhang, Yong1 aLuo, Ya1 aZhang, Fen1 aTang, Hao-Ru0 tRSC advances.g2018 Oct. 02, v. 8, no. 59 p.33845-33854dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra05504a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015400168300001200322520136700334592002801701596004601729650001401775650002001789650001701809650002101826650001501847650001801862650004301880650001701923650001101940650001401951650000901965650001401974650001301988700006702001773015102068856008302219852000902302655001202311IND60775904620221120044106.0220826e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077590462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-09943-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemi, Moslem10aAre the tourist beaches safe for swimming? A case study of health risks of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in tourist beaches of Bushehr City  ap. 398.  aThe aims of the present research were to evaluate the health risk of long-term exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concerning the human, ecotoxicological risk for marine biota, and identify their possible sources. Surface sediment bioassay samples were collected from 15 stations of tourist beaches surrounding Bushehr City and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results indicated the concentrations of ∑PAH ranged from 193.5 to 725.5 ng g⁻¹ with mean value of 351.1 ± 155.2 ng g⁻¹, which could be considered as moderate level of pollution. Measured levels of PAH in sediments were compared with sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), indicating low to medium ecotoxicological risk on marine organisms. Moreover, mean ERM quotient (M-ERM-Q) and mean PEL quotient (M-PEL-Q) were implemented, demonstrating potentially biological adverse effects. A preliminary evaluation of human health risk using incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) and toxic equivalent quotient (TEQᶜᵃʳᶜ) indicated that PAH-contaminated sediment in some stations of touristic beaches of Bushehr City would induce potential carcinogenic effects especially for children. Composition and diagnostic analysis indicated that PAHs originated from both pyrogenic and petrogenic, with higher portion of incomplete combustion PAHs.  aPublisher supplied data  a146046cIran's National Elites Foundation 3abioassays 3acarcinogenicity 3acase studies 3achronic exposure 3acombustion 3aecotoxicology 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3apollution 3arisk 3asediments 3atourists1 aKeshavarzifard, Mehrzad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8473-83330 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 June, v. 194, no. 6 p.398-398dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09943-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008900170300001600259500001900275520160100294592002801895650003001923650001601953650001601969650000901985650001201994650001702006650001502023650001602038650001702054650001202071650001602083650001602099650002202115650001802137650002302155650002902178653001002207653001702217653002302234653002102257653001702278700001802295700001902313700001502332700001802347700001802365700001402383700001802397700001602415773016502431856008602596852000902682655001202691IND60720396820221120182618.0210124e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072039682DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63242-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLI, Peng-cheng10aMetabolic responses to combined water deficit and salt stress in maize primary roots  ap. 109-119.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil water deficit and salt stress are major limiting factors of plant growth and agricultural productivity. The primary root is the first organ to perceive the stress signals for drought and salt stress. In this study, maize plant subjected to drought, salt and combined stresses displayed a significantly reduced primary root length relative to the control plants. GC-MS was used to determine changes in the metabolites of the primary root of maize in response to salt, drought and combined stresses. A total of 86 metabolites were measured, including 29 amino acids and amines, 21 organic acids, four fatty acids, six phosphoric acids, 10 sugars, 10 polyols, and six others. Among these, 53 metabolites with a significant change under different stresses were identified in the primary root, and the content of most metabolites showed down-accumulation. A total of four and 18 metabolites showed significant up- and down-accumulation to all three treatments, respectively. The levels of several compatible solutes, including sugars and polyols, were increased to help maintain the osmotic balance. The levels of metabolites involved in the TCA cycle, including citric acid, ketoglutaric acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid, were reduced in the primary root. The contents of metabolites in the shikimate pathway, such as quinic acid and shikimic acid, were significantly decreased. This study reveals the complex metabolic responses of the primary root to combined drought and salt stresses and extends our understanding of the mechanisms involved in root responses to abiotic tolerance in maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3aagriculture 3acitric acid 3acorn 3adrought 3afumaric acid 3amalic acid 3ametabolites 3aplant growth 3apolyols 3aquinic acid 3asalt stress 3ashikimate pathway 3ashikimic acid 3asoil water deficit 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0amaize 0aprimary root 0acombination stress 0ahigh salt stress 0ametabolomics1 aYANG, Xiao-yi1 aWANG, Hou-miao1 aPan, Ting,1 aYANG, Ji-yuan1 aWANG, Yun-yun1 aXu, Yang,1 aYANG, Ze-feng1 aXU, Chen-wu0 tJournal of integrative agriculture.g2021 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.109-119dElsevier B.V.aCAAS.

In the present study, a β-conglycinin concentrate (βCC) obtained by a pH fractionation of soy flour was tested as structuring agent in gluten-free yeast-leavened bread model. A lean formulation with βCC and corn starch was used to produce gluten-free breads with two hydration conditions and three levels of protein (5%, 10% and 15%). Vital gluten was used to compare the functionality of βCC protein and its performance for breadmaking. Breads were characterized in moisture, color, textural parameters and image analysis. βCC presented lower hydration properties and higher emulsifying activity compared to vital gluten. Blends βCC:starch had higher water binding capacity compared to vital gluten blends. The hydration conditions tested affected the moisture, color and cell density of breads. Breads produced with βCC presented higher 2D area and height and presented higher crumb softness and cohesiveness, and did not present significant differences in springiness and resilience compared to vital gluten breads. The image analysis of crumbs showed higher cell density but lower porosity and mean cell areas in βCC breads. Thus, βCC proved to have potential as a structuring agent in gluten-free breads.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-conglycinin 3abreadmaking 3acohesion 3acolor 3acorn starch 3aemulsifying properties 3afractionation 3agluten 3agluten-free bread 3ahardness 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3apH 3aporosity 3aprotein concentrates 3asoy flour 3asoy protein 3aviscoelasticity 3awater binding capacity 0aβ-Conglycinin 0aSoy proteins 0aGluten-free bread 0aCorn starch 0aStructure 0aHydration1 aGarzon, Raquel1 aSerna-Saldivar, Sergio O.1 aRosell, Cristina M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7197-58740 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.64-70dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.12.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012000156520187000276592002802146650005002174650001702224650001302241650001802254650001202272650001102284650001402295650000902309650001902318650001102337650001502348650002602363650001502389651001002404700001902414700001802433700001502451773012002466856007402586852000902660655001202669IND60759393020221121164009.0211209e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075939302DNAL7 a10.3390/w132333752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying 14aThe Application of Low Impact Development Facility Chain on Storm Rainfall Control: A Case Study in Shenzhen, China  aIn recent decades, low impact development (LID) has become an increasingly important concern as a state-of-the-art stormwater management mode to treat urban flood, preferable to conventional urban drainage systems. However, the effects of the combined use of different LID facilities on urban flooding have not been fully investigated under different rainfall characteristics. In this study, a residential, neighborhood-scale catchment in Shenzhen City, southern China was selected as a case study, where the effects of four LID techniques (bio-retention, bio-swale, rain garden and pervious pavement) with different connection patterns (cascaded, semi-cascaded and paralleled) on runoff reduction efficiency were analyzed by the storm water management model (SWMM), promoted by the U.S. EPA. Three kinds of designed storm events with different return periods, durations and time-to-peak ratios were forced to simulate the flood for holistic assessment of the LID connection patterns. The effects were measured by the runoff coefficient of the whole storm–runoff process and the peak runoff volume. The results obtained indicate that the cascaded connect LID chain can more effectively reduce the runoff than that in the paralleled connect LID chain under different storms. The performances of the LID chains in modeling flood process in SWMM indicate that the runoff coefficient and the peak runoff volume increase with the increase in the rain return periods and the decrease in rain duration. Additionally, the move backward of the peak rain intensity to the end of the storm event slightly affects the peak runoff volume obviously while gives slight influence on the total runoff volume. This study provides an insight into the performance of LID chain designs under different rainfall characteristics, which is essential for effective urban flood management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3acase studies 3adrainage 3aflood control 3agardens 3amodels 3apavements 3arain 3arain intensity 3astorms 3astormwater 3astormwater management 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aXu, Hongliang 1 aLiu, Honglei 1 aZhou, Bin 0 tWater.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 13, no. 23dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132333753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245015900212300001400371520121600385592002801601650002601629650002501655650001401680650002101694650001201715650001501727650001001742650002501752650001701777650001101794650003201805650001301837650001401850650001901864650001301883650001301896653001501909653001301924653001701937653001401954653002501968700002201993700002102015700002402036700002702060773010902087856008602196852000902282655001202291IND60591233720221120102105.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059123372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2017.12.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVukovic, Nenad L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4382-974310aCytotoxic, proapoptotic and antioxidative potential of flavonoids isolated from propolis against colon (HCT-116) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines  ap. 71-80.  aIsolated and structurally confirmed, eleven flavonoids from propolis were examined for their cytotoxicity toward human colon cancer and human breast cancer cells. Their effect on induction of apoptosis and their antioxidative activities were also evaluated. Six flavonoids induced cytotoxic effects in both cell lines. Luteolin had a marked effect on both cell lines, especially on HCT-116 cells (IC50 72h, 66.86μM). Also, luteolin was observed to have the highest apoptotic potential after 72h treatment of examined cell lines (27.13% and 37.09%, respectively). Myricetin exhibited selective inhibition of cell growth (IC50 114.75μM) and induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells only. Luteolin and galangin exhibited prooxidative properties 24h after the treatment in HCT-116 cells, while myricetin induced prooxidative effects in MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand, selected flavonoids exhibited antioxidative properties 72h after the treatment, decreasing superoxide anion radical and nitrite levels in both cell lines. Cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects on colon and breast cancer cell lines and the influence on their redox status make tested flavonoids good candidates for developing new anticancer drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3abreasts 3acell lines 3acolon 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aluteolin 3amyricetin 3aneoplasm cells 3anitrites 3apropolis 0aFlavonoids 0aPropolis 0aCytotoxicity 0aApoptosis 0aAntioxidant activity1 aObradovic, Ana D.1 aVukic, Milena D.1 aJovanovic, Danijela1 aDjurdjevic, Predrag M.0 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.71-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.12.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03323naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014200173300001500315520184700330592002802177650001202205650001902217650001602236650001902252650003102271650001002302650001202312650001502324650001402339650001102353650002402364650001102388650001102399650001702410650001802427650001202445650001602457650001502473651001102488653002102499653001202520653001402532653001802546653001902564700002002583773010702603856008602710852000902796655001202805IND60539675220221120071743.0190318e20140314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053967522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Kenneth D.10aSurface water hydrology and geomorphic characterization of a playa lake system: Implications for monitoring the effects of climate change  ap. 92-102.  aPlaya lakes are sensitive recorders of subtle climatic perturbations because these ephemeral water bodies respond to the flux of diffuse and channelized flow from their watersheds as well as from direct precipitation. The Black Rock Playa in northwestern Nevada is one of the largest playas in North America and is noted for its extreme flatness, varying less than one meter across a surface area of 310km2. Geo-referenced Landsat imagery was used to map surface-area fluctuations of ephemeral lakes on the playa from 1972 to 2013 to provide baseline data on surface water hydrology of this system to compare to future hydrologic conditions caused by climate change. The area measurements were transformed into depth and volumetric estimates using results of detailed topographic global positioning system (GPS) surveys and correlated with available surface hydrological and meteorological monitoring data. Playa lakes reach their maximum size (<350km2) in spring, fed by melting snows from high mountains on the periphery of the drainage basin, and usually desiccate by early- to mid-summer. The combination of a shallow groundwater table, sediment deposition, and hydro-aeolian planation probably are largely responsible for the flatness of the playa. When lakes do not form for a period of several years, the clay- and silt-rich playa surface transforms from one that is hard and durable into one that is soft and puffy, probably from upward capillary movement of water and resultant evaporation. Subsequent flooding restores the hard and durable surface. The near-global availability of Landsat imagery for the last 41years should allow the documentation of baseline surface hydrologic characteristics for a large number of widely-distributed playa lake systems that can be used to assess the hydrologic effects of future climate changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aclimate change 3aevaporation 3ageoreferencing 3aglobal positioning systems 3alakes 3amelting 3amonitoring 3amountains 3aplayas 3asediment deposition 3aspring 3asummer 3asurface area 3asurface water 3asurveys 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aNevada 0aBlack Rock Playa 0aLandsat 0aHydrology 0aGeomorphology 0aClimate change1 aSada, Donald W.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Mar. 14, v. 510 p.92-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.12.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03848naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245014600219300001600365520219500381592002802576650001502604650001502619650001102634650001202645650001002657650002002667650001202687650002702699650000902726650002002735650002102755650001702776653002002793653002202813653002002835653001502855653001102870653002302881700001902904700005902923700003002982700006603012700002703078700002303105700001703128773009103145856008503236852000903321655001203330IND60551295820221122030905.0161018e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055129582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Pouchoulen, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7863-588010aAndrogen receptors in Purkinje neurons are modulated by systemic testosterone and sexual training in a region-specific manner in the male rat  ap. 191-198.  aThe androgen receptor (AR) is a widely distributed molecule indicating the spread actions of its ligand steroid, and plays an important role underlying male sexual behavior. Nevertheless, the influence of steroid hormones and their receptors on cerebellar neurons, as foundation of sexual behavior, is largely unknown. We sought to determine the influence of peripheral hormones on the AR expression in Purkinje neurons across cerebellar lobules in the vermis of male rats. First, we found a basal AR expression in Purkinje neurons that was higher in the superficial region than the deep region only in cerebellar lobules 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9. Moreover, only the cerebellar lobule 10 showed a significant difference between the coordinates 0.1, 0.3 and 0.9. Second, males with four sessions of sexual training showed a decreased AR density in cerebellar lobules 7, 8, 9 and 10, but not in lobules 2, 4 or 5 when compared to males with one session of sexual training. However, sexual training did not affect AR expression in Purkinje neurons according to their location in any of the cerebellar lobules studied. Third, castration decreased the AR density in the cerebellar lobules 1, 2, 5 and 9 in the superficial region, while in the deep region all cerebellar lobules, except lobule 6, showed a lower AR density after castration. Finally, testosterone replacement restored AR density to control levels in all cerebellar lobules in the superficial region that were affected by castration. Contrary, in the deep region hormonal replacement failed to restore the AR density to control level in the majority of the cerebellar lobules that were affected by castration. Altogether, our findings indicate that Purkinje neurons in the vermis are influenced by systemic testosterone in a region-dependent manner highlighting a link between the cerebellum and gonads in the male rat. The AR function in Purkinje neurons may be related to cerebellar plasticity since both estrogen and progesterone receptors, members of the nuclear receptor family, regulate plasticity processes in Purkinje neurons. We concluded the cerebellum is an important component of the neural circuit for male sexual behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3acastration 3acerebellum 3agonads 3aligands 3amales 3aneural networks 3aneurons 3aprogesterone receptors 3arats 3asexual behavior 3asteroid hormones 3atestosterone 0aPurkinje neuron 0aAndrogen receptor 0aSexual behavior 0aCastration 0aVermis 0aCerebellar lobules1 aToledo, Rebeca1 aGarcia, Luis I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6967-19191 aPerez-Estudillo, Cesar A.1 aCoria-Avila, Genaro A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1663-836X1 aHernandez, Maria Elena1 aCarrillo, Porfirio1 aManzo, Jorge0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 156 p.191-198dElsevier Inc.x0031-93847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2016.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04004naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245013800171300001500309520257400324592002802898650001702926650002502943650001602968650001602984650001403000650001903014650001303033650001603046650001703062650001903079650001503098650001103113650001203124650001203136650000903148650001303157650001903170650001403189650001403203650001403217650002203231651001303253700002303266700002103289700002703310773009203337856004803429852000903477655001203486IND50068501820221122050004.0130814e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006850182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-013-1620-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanawapee, Nantawan10aPhysiological changes during development of rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties differing in salt tolerance under saline field condition  ap. 89-101.  aAims: To investigate the changes in physiological parameters in leaves of field-grown rice genotypes differing in their salt tolerance. Methods: Thirty rice cultivars classified as tolerant (T; 11), moderately tolerant (MT; 5), moderately sensitive (MS; 7) and sensitive (S; 7) based on the previous screening at the seedling stage were established in a greenhouse. Thirty-day-old seedlings were then transplanted to a rice field, situated in a moderately saline area in northeastern Thailand, where EC slowly increased from 2.03 to 6.46 dS m-1 from the transplanting date to harvest. Leaf samples (the third leaves from the top or the flag leaves during the vegetative or the reproductive phase, respectively) were collected, at 1 month intervals, when the plants were 60-, 90-, 120- and 150-day-old corresponding to active tillering, early reproductive, late reproductive and harvest stage, respectively. Leaf samples were analyzed for changes in proline, chlorophyll and malondialdehyde (MDA). The harvested panicles were evaluated for the percentage of filled grain weight and the concentration of Na+ and K+ in the top internode. Results: The patterns of change and the mean concentrations of most physiological parameters in rice leaves during the course of development were strikingly similar for the four classes of salt tolerance. Proline concentration remained relatively constant throughout the development and finally showed a dramatic increase in the flag leaves at harvest. MDA concentration tended to increase with age reaching the maximum in the flag leaves at harvest. The chlorophyll concentration was higher during the vegetative stage than the reproductive stages. At harvest corresponding to the time of maximum salinity, the T group tended to contain higher proline and stayed green longer than the other groups. Moreover, the T group showed higher percentage filled grain weight which was associated with lower Na+/K+ ratio in the top internode. The percentage filled grain weight was negatively correlated with Na+ concentration and Na+/K+ ratio in the top internode and proline concentration in flag leaves, but did not correlate with chlorophyll and MDA in flag leaves. Conclusions: Rice cultivars which are tolerant at the seedling stage also showed higher tolerance in the field condition as shown by higher percentage filled grain weight and lower Na+ uptake to the panicles. Tolerant cultivars tended to accumulate less proline in their leaves similar to that found at the seedling stage. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aasexual reproduction 3achlorophyll 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3afilling period 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3aharvest date 3ainflorescences 3ainternodes 3aleaves 3apaddies 3aproline 3arice 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3atillering 3avegetative growth 3aThailand1 aSanitchon, Jirawat1 aSrihaban, Pranee1 aTheerakulpisut, Piyada0 tPlant and soil.g2013 Sept., v. 370, no. 1-2 p.89-101dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-1620-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013300160300001800293520117600311592002801487650004401515650001601559650001501575650001201590650001901602650001401621650002301635650002001658650001801678650001301696650002701709650001601736700001901752700001901771700001601790773012501806856007401931852000902005655001202014IND60662587720221118033119.0190906e20101006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066258772DNAL7 a10.1039/c0gc00286k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhen-Zhen10aLewis basic ionic liquids-catalyzed synthesis of 5-aryl-2-oxazolidinones from aziridines and CO₂ under solvent-free conditions  ap. 1850-1854.  aA series of easily prepared Lewis basic ionic liquids were developed as recyclable and efficient catalysts for selective synthesis of 5-aryl-2-oxazolidinones from aziridines and CO₂ without utilization of any organic solvent or additive. Notably, high conversion, chemo- and regio-selectivity were attained when 1-butyl-4-aza-1-azaniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bromide ([C₄DABCO]Br) was used as the catalyst. Furthermore, the catalyst could be recycled over four times without appreciable loss of catalytic activity. The effects of the catalyst structure and various reaction parameters on the catalytic performance were investigated in detail. This protocol was found to be applicable to a variety of aziridines producing the corresponding 5-aryl-2-oxazolidinones in good yields and excellent regioselectivities. Therefore, this solvent-free process thus represents an environmentally friendly process for ionic liquid-catalyzed conversion of CO₂ into value-added chemicals. A possible catalytic cycle for CO₂ activation induced by nucleophilic tertiary nitrogen of the ionic liquid was proposed, based on studies using in situ FT-IR spectroscopy under CO₂ pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLewis bases 3aaziridines 3abromine 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agreen chemistry 3aionic liquids 3anitrogen 3asustainable technology 3avalue added1 aHe, Liang-Nian1 aPeng, Shi-Yong1 aLiu, An-Hua0 tGreen chemistry.g2010 Oct. 6, v. 12, no. 10 p.1850-1854dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0gc00286k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001600290520142100306592002801727650001501755650001501770650001401785650001101799650001701810650001001827650001901837650001001856653002501866653004001891653001401931653001501945653002301960653001401983773010801997856008602105852000902191655001202200IND60539675320221120061010.0190318e20140314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053967532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.12.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hai-Tao10aPerformance of multiple fractured horizontal wells in shale gas reservoirs with consideration of multiple mechanisms  ap. 299-312.  aGas flow in shales is believed to result from a combination of several mechanisms, including desorption, diffusion, viscous flow and the effect of stress-sensitivity of reservoir permeability. However, little work has been done in literature to simultaneously incorporate all these mechanisms in well testing models for shale gas reservoirs. This paper presents a new well testing model for multiple fractured horizontal wells (MFHW) in shale gas reservoirs with consideration of desorption, diffusive flow, viscous flow and stress-sensitivity of reservoir permeability. Comparing with current well testing models for MFHW, the model presented here takes into consideration more mechanisms controlling shale gas flow, which is more in line with the actual reservoir situation. Laplace transformation, point source function, perturbation method, numerical discrete method and Gaussian elimination method are employed to solve the well testing model. The pressure transient responses are then inverted into real time space with Stehfest numerical inversion algorithm. Type curves are plotted, and different flow regimes in shale gas reservoirs are identified. The effects of relevant parameters are analyzed as well. The presented model can be used to interpret pressure data more accurately for shale gas reservoirs and provide more accurate dynamic parameters which are important for efficient reservoir development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adesorption 3ahydrology 3amodels 3apermeability 3ashale 3aspace and time 3awells 0aShale gas reservoirs 0aMultiple fractured horizontal wells 0aDiffusion 0aDesorption 0aStress-sensitivity 0aWell test0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Mar. 14, v. 510 p.299-312dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.12.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04063naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013600172506010400308506007600412506011700488520202800605592002802633506003702661650002802698650002502726650001702751650001602768650001602784650001002800650001802810650002402828650001802852650001202870650002302882650001402905650001102919650001002930650002002940650002902960650001702989650002503006650001403031651001403045651002003059653001903079653001503098653002003113653001503133653002003148700002603168700002203194700002103216700001903237773010003256856008403356852000903440655001203449IND60783551420221207073601.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078355142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1012662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernando, Fernando10aDietary supplementation of astaxanthin modulates skin color and liver antioxidant status of giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aGiant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) is an emerging aquaculture species in Southeast Asia and Australia with limited knowledge of its nutrient requirements and effects of supplements on its physiology. The present study investigated the effects of astaxanthin, vitamin E, and combinations on growth performance, body coloration, and the antioxidant status of juvenile giant grouper. Nine isonitrogenous (crude protein = 65 % ± 0.7 %) and isolipidic (crude lipid = 10 % ± 0.3 %) diets were formulated using a 3 × 3 factorial design, including three levels astaxanthin (0, 75, and 150 mg/kg) and vitamin E (0, 250, and 500 mg/kg), respectively. Each of the nine diets was fed to triplicate groups of 15 giant grouper (18.04 ± 0.92 g) for 30 days. Giant grouper fed the different diets exhibited no significant differences (p > 0.05) in specific growth rate (4.87 %/day - 5.21 %/day). However, dietary astaxanthin supplementation significantly enhanced the redness (a*), yellowness (b*b*), chroma, and hue values of the fin, regardless of the dose supplemented. Giant grouper fed astaxanthin at 75 and 150 mg/kg diet were more yellow and had three times higher b* values than fish fed non-supplemented diets. Further, total antioxidant capacity (TAC; mmol Trolox equivalent) in liver tissues was significantly increased in fish fed any of the astaxanthin-supplemented diets (p ≤ 0.05). In contrast, TAC levels were not affected by vitamin E supplementation. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were not significantly (p > 0.05) affected by astaxanthin or vitamin E. Findings from this study will contribute toward a better understanding of the dietary effects of antioxidant and pigment in juvenile giant grouper. We present that dietary treatment can modulate giant grouper pigmentation and may be used in the live fish trade. Further, this study contributes to narrowing the knowledge gap in formulating appropriate diets for giant grouper, which to date is fed diets formulated for other species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEpinephelus lanceolatus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaquaculture 3aastaxanthin 3acolor 3acrude protein 3adietary supplements 3afish industry 3agrouper 3agrowth performance 3ajuveniles 3alipids 3aliver 3amalondialdehyde 3anutritional intervention 3apigmentation 3aspecific growth rate 3avitamin E 3aAustralia 3aSouth East Asia 0aCarophyll pink 0aCarotenoid 0aFeed supplement 0aTocopherol 0aSparing effects1 aCandebat, Caroline L.1 aStrugnell, Jan M.1 aAndreakis, Nikos1 aNankervis, Leo0 tAquaculture reports.g2022 Oct., v. 26 p.101266-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.1012663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013700169300001400306520150400320592002801824650001901852650002501871650001601896650001601912650001901928650001401947650001001961650004101971650001802012650001202030650001002042650001502052650000902067650001502076650001202091650001402103650002402117653006402141653001702205653001402222653001502236700002002251700001202271700001702283773009702300856008502397852000902482655001202491IND60554499220221123020630.0161024e20150915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055449922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xiaolan10aTissue distribution, excretion, and the metabolic pathway of 2,2′,4,4′,5-penta-chlorinated diphenylsulfide (CDPS-99) in ICR mice  ap. 90-97.  aThe tissue distribution, excretion, and metabolic pathway of 2,2′,4,4′,5-penta-chlorinated diphenylsulfide (CDPS-99) in ICR mice were investigated after oral perfusion at 10mg/kg body weight (b.w.). Biological samples were extracted and separated and, for the first time, were determined by a novel, sensitive, and specific GC–MS method under the full scan and selected ion monitoring (SIM) modes. The results showed that the concentrations of CDPS-99 in the liver, kidneys, and serum reached a maximum after a one-day exposure and that the CDPS-99 concentration in the liver was the highest (3.43μg/g). The increase in the concentration of CDPS-99 in muscle, skin, and adipose tissue was slower, and the concentrations of CDPS-99 achieved their highest levels after 3 days of exposure. It was observed that the CDPS-99 concentration in adipose tissue was still very high (0.71μg/g) after 21 days of exposure, which suggested that CDPS-99 was able to accumulate in adipose tissue. In addition, mouse feces accounted for approximately 75% of the total gavage dose, indicating that CDPS-99 was mainly excreted via mouse feces. Metabolism analysis demonstrated that there were three possible metabolic pathways of CDPS-99 in mice: dechlorination reactions with the formation of tetra-CDPS and hydroxylation and oxidation reactions with the formation of OH-CDPS-99 and chlorinated diphenylsulfone. The present study will help to develop a better understanding of mammalian metabolism of CDPS-99.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3abiochemical pathways 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3adechlorination 3aexcretion 3afeces 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydroxylation 3akidneys 3aliver 3ametabolism 3amice 3amonitoring 3amuscles 3aoxidation 3atissue distribution 0a2,2′,4,4′,5-penta-chlorinated diphenylsulfide (CDPS-99) 0aDistribution 0aExcretion 0aMetabolism1 aZhang, Xuesheng1 aQin, Li1 aWang, Zunyao0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Sept. 15, v. 1001 p.90-97dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02001naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015300154300002000307520089100327592002801218650001101246650002101257650002201278650001801300650001401318650001601332700002001348700002001368700002201388700001801410700001501428773012501443856007401568852000901642655001201651IND60617166320221120164119.0181024e20180924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061716632DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra05544k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Na Na10aIn situ approach of cementite nanoparticles encapsulated with nitrogen-doped graphitic shells as anode nanomaterials for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries  ap. 33030-33034.  aNovel Fe₃C nanoparticles encapsulated with nitrogen-doped graphitic shells were synthesized by floating catalytic pyrolysis.

Implications for Brazilian shelf-edge systems  aWestern boundary currents influence the global ocean circulation and climate, whereas it locally reaches out differently to the continental margins. This study investigates the response of the North Brazilian Undercurrent (NBUC) over their interactions with the eastern and northern margins of the northeastern Brazil. The data set comprises regional bathymetry, in situ current measurements, CTD profiling, and simulations of oceanic currents using a regional model (CROCO). The physical analysis focuses on the months of February (austral summer) and August (austral winter). Horizontal and vertical structure of current velocity, temperature and salinity were correlated using maps and bathymetric profiles along the critical pathways of the NBUC. The eastern and northern margins are narrow and retracted with widths up to 40 km and steep upper continental slopes (14°). These margins are separated by the Touros High, which extends eastward up to 80 km offshore, with a shallow shelf (most parts are < 10 m) of approximately 55 km wide. The vertical sections of velocity show the NBUC shifting onto the Touros shelf in August and show that the strong trade winds during the austral winter handle the alongshore current circulation of this region. In the northern margin, the recirculation of the NBUC disturbs the base of the thermocline and part of these current fluxes toward the outer shelf region. The different patterns of the NBUC affect the sedimentary and ecological characteristics of eastern, Touros and northern outer shelves. Besides, the slope and outer shelf morphology might contribute to events of current-driven nutrient-enrichment and mixing processes at the base of the mixed layer. These results support the evidences that the western boundary current interactions by eddies and jets with the margin control the morpho-sedimentary and environmental conditions of the Brazilian outer shelf ecological system corridor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3amarine science 3amodels 3aoceans 3asalinity 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrade 3awinter 3aBrazil 0aWestern boundary currents 0aEddies 0aJets 0aEquatorial margin 0aOuter shelf1 aCintra, Marcio Machado1 aGomes, Moab Praxedes1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0836-10731 aVital, Helenice0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 July, v. 54 p.102486-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2022.1024863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04431naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017100169300001600340520216300356592002802519650004402547650001802591650002502609650002302634650002402657650002002681650001802701650001802719650002602737650002602763650003102789650001602820650000902836650001902845650002102864650003302885650001602918650001202934650001702946653000802963653000702971653001702978653001202995653000903007653000803016653001003024653001003034653001703044653000703061653000803068653001803076653000803094653001003102653000803112653002903120653003003149653002703179653001403206653003203220653002003252700001903272700002603291700002403317700002603341700002503367700003003392700002103422773011103443856008603554852000903640655001203649IND60591234120221120111810.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059123412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuneer, Faraz14aThe impact of newly produced protein and dietary fiber rich fractions of yellow pea (Pisum sativum L.) on the structure and mechanical properties of pasta-like sheets  ap. 607-618.  aTwo fractions from pea (Pisum sativum L.), protein isolate (PPI) and dietary fiber (PF), were newly produced by extraction-fractionation method and characterized in terms of particle size distribution and structural morphology using SEM. The newly produced PPI and PF fractions were processed into pasta-like sheets with varying protein to fiber ratios (100/0, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30 and 50/50, respectively) using high temperature compression molding. We studied protein polymerization, molecular structure and protein-fiber interactions, as well as mechanical performance and cooking characteristics of processed PPI-PF blends. Bi-modal particle size distribution and chemical composition of the PPI and PF fractions influenced significantly the physicochemical properties of the pasta-like sheets. Polymerization was most pronounced for the 100 PPI, 90/10 and 80/20 PPI-PF samples as studied by SE-HPLC, and polymerization decreased with addition of the PF fraction. The mechanical properties, as strength and extensibility, were likewise the highest for the 100 PPI and 90/10 PPI-PF blends, while the E-modulus was similar for all the studied blends (around 38 MPa). The extensibility decreased with the increasing amount of PF in the blend. The highest amounts of β-sheets were found in the pasta-like sheets with high amounts of PPI (100, 90 and 80%), by FT-IR. An increase in PF fraction in the blend, resulted into the high amounts of unordered structures as observed by FT-IR, as well as in an increase in the molecular scattering distances observed by SAXS. The water uptake increased and cooking loss decreased with increased proportions of the PF fraction, and the consistency of 10 min cooked pasta-like sheets were alike al dente texture. The new knowledge obtained in this study on the use of extraction-fractionation method to produce novel PPI and PF fractions for developing innovative high nutritious food can be of a great importance. The obtained knowledge on the pea protein and fiber processing behaviour could greatly contribute to a better control of functional properties of various temperature-processed products from yellow pea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPisum sativum 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3acompression molding 3acooking quality 3adietary fiber 3aextensibility 3afunctional properties 3amechanical properties 3aparticle size distribution 3apea protein 3apeas 3apolymerization 3aprotein isolates 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atexture 3awater uptake 0aPPI 0aPF 0aPPI-PF blend 0aSE-HPLC 0aSAXS 0aSFE 0aH2SO4 0aELISA 0aKI3-solution 0aLS 0aSDS 0a1Ex, 2Ex, 3Ex 0aTFA 0aFT-IR 0aSEM 0aExtraction-fractionation 0aProtein-fiber interaction 0aProtein polymerization 0aStructure 0aHigh temperature processing 0aFunctional food1 aJohansson, Eva1 aHedenqvist, Mikael S.1 aPlivelic, Tomás S.1 aMarkedal, Keld Ejdrup1 aPetersen, Iben Lykke1 aSørensen, Jens Christian1 aKuktaite, Ramune0 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.607-618dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01090naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006800169300001600237520018400253592002800437506003700465650002400502650001100526650001100537650001700548650001700565773012600582856008300708852000900791655001200800IND60774712720221207094900.0220422e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077471272DNAL7 a10.1177/0261192915043005162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandaria, Rehma14aThe ‘Genomic Revolution’ and its Impact on Medical Research  ap.

Remanufacturing is one of the sustainable technologies that provide environmental, economic and social benefits. Remanufacturing is “a comprehensive and rigorous industrial process by which a previously sold, worn, or non-functional product or component is returned to a “like-new” or “better-than-new” condition and warranted in performance level and quality” (RIC, 2013). This research study aims to identify and evaluate external barriers to remanufacturing in Indian electronic waste (e-waste) sector. We applied grey-DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) approach to analyze external barriers to remanufacturing. The results indicate lack of channels to collect used products and customer unwillingness to return the products to be the most prominent barriers. Further, the results also depict uncertainty in quantity and timing of returned products to be the major causal barriers. The findings provide insights and recommendations for policy planners involved in policy making to boost remanufacturing in India. Primarily, government needs to bring awareness to customers regarding benefits of returning the used products and benefits of using remanufactured products through awareness campaigns, so that consumers also take initiative to protect environment. Channels to collects used products from customers also need to be developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumers (people) 3adecision making 3aelectronic wastes 3aindustrialization 3aissues and policy 3asocial benefit 3asustainable technology 3auncertainty 3aIndia 0aSustainability 0aRemanufacturing 0aGrey-DEMATEL 0aBarriers 0aE-waste 0aIndia1 aSrivastava, Rajiv K.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2018 Sept., v. 136 p.79-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009600167300001400263520077300277592002801050650001601078650002101094650002501115650002501140650001001165650001001175650001101185650002101196650001601217650001401233650002601247653000801273653000801281653000901289653001101298653001101309653000801320653000901328653000901337653000901346653001001355653000901365653001101374653002101385653002101406653001601427700001101443700002001454700001501474700001801489700001601507700001901523700001801542773009301560856008301653852000901736655001201745IND60530165120221119143109.0180830e20160801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053016512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2016.04.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhao-Yang10aTranscription factor SGF1 is critical for the neurodevelopment in the silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 70-75.  aFoxA transcription factors play vital roles in regulating the expression of organ-specific genes. BmSGF1, the sole FoxA family member in Bombyx mori, is required for development of the silk gland. However, the function of BmSGF1 in development of the nervous system in the silkworm remains unknown. Here, we show that the amino acids sequence of BmSGF1 is evolutionarily conserved in its middle region from Trichoplax adhaerens to human and diverged from the homologues in most other species in its N-terminal region. BmSGF1 expresses in the nervous system at the embryonic stage. Knockdown of Bmsgf1 by RNA interference (RNAi) results in abnormal development of axons. Therefore, our results demonstrate that BmSGF1 is an indispensable regulator for neurodevelopment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aRNA interference 3aabnormal development 3aamino acid sequences 3aaxons 3agenes 3ahumans 3aneurodevelopment 3asilk glands 3asilkworms 3atranscription factors 0afkh 0aFox 0aFoxa 0aHNF3β 0aBmsgf1 0aHRP 0aFITC 0aRNAi 0aegfp 0adsRNA 0aqPCR 0aBmSGF1 0aNeurodevelopment 0aRNA interference 0aBombyx mori1 aYu, Qi1 aYang, Chun-Hong1 aMeng, Miao1 aRen, Chun-Jiu1 aMu, Zhi-Mei1 aCui, Wei-Zheng1 aLiu, Qing-Xin0 tGene.g2016 Aug. 01, v. 587, no. 1 p.70-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2016.04.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245018200210300001400392506007600406520131500482592002801797506003701825650001501862650001701877650002001894650001001914650001901924650001701943650001901960650001301979650001601992650002102008650001002029650001302039650001102052650001502063650002102078650000902099650001802108653000902126653000902135653000702144653000702151653000802158653000802166653000702174653000902181653000802190653000802198653001302206653002002219653002102239653001502260700001402275700001702289700001602306700001302322773009602335856008502431852000902516655001202525IND60554499420221207081005.0161024e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055449942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0302doi7 aPMC46596462pmcid7 a262956972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Guangyi10aDevelopment and validation of an UPLC-MS/MS method for the quantification of columbin in biological matrices: Applications to absorption, metabolism, and pharmacokinetic studies  ap. 13-18.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study is to develop a sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method to quantify columbin in biological sample. Chromatographic separation was accomplished using Waters UPLC BEH C18 column with acetonitrile and 0.1% of formic acid in water as the mobile phases. The mass analysis was performed on an API 5500 Qtrap mass spectrometer via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with positive scan mood. The one-step protein precipitation by methanol was used to extract the analyte from blood samples. The results showed that the linear response range for columbin was 1.22–2,500nM. The intra and inter day variances were less than 15% and the accuracy was in acceptable range (85–115%). The analysis was done within 3.0min, and only 50μL of blood was needed. The validated method was used to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of columbin in Wistar rats, and its transport characteristics in the Caco-2 cell culture model. The results showed that columbin was poorly bioavailable (2.8% p.o. and 14% i.p.) in rats, but its transport was rapid across the Caco-2 cell monolayers, suggesting that extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver was the likely reason for its poor bioavailability. The results revealed that the validated method can be used for columbin analysis in both bioequivalent buffer and blood.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aacetonitrile 3abioavailability 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acell culture 3achromatography 3aemotions 3aformic acid 3ahuman cell lines 3aliver 3amethanol 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3aspectrometers 0aUPLC 0aI.S. 0aDP 0aCE 0aCXP 0aAUC 0aQC 0aLLOQ 0aMPA 0aMPB 0aColumbin 0aPharmacokinetic 0aCaco-2 transport 0aUPLC-MS/MS1 aGao, Song1 aSun, Rongjin1 aYin, Taijun1 aHu, Ming0 tJournal of Chromatography B.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 1002 p.13-18dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2015.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245009900206300001600305520071200321592002801033650003001061650001701091650001001108650000901118650001701127650002601144650001201170650004401182650001301226650001401239650001301253653000801266653001701274653001201291700006501303700002401368700003901392700002101431700007001452773009301522856008201615852000901697655001201706IND60530797220221119064758.0210124e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053079722DNAL7 a270816732pmid7 aPMC48183502pmcid7 a10.1016/j.dib.2016.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAru, Violetta10aData on the changes of the mussels׳ metabolic profile under different cold storage conditions  ap. 951-957.  aOne of the main problems of seafood marketing is the ease with which fish and shellfish undergo deterioration after death. ¹H NMR spectroscopy and microbiological analysis were applied to get in depth insight into the effects of cold storage (4°C and 0°C) on the spoilage of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis.

It is imperative to exploit new advanced materials featuring abundant binding sites and high affinity to achieve highly efficient and specific capture of phosphate from polluted waters. Herein, water stable Zr-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs, UiO-66) with rational structural design and size modulation have been successfully synthesized based on a simple solvothermal method for effective phosphate remediation. Impressively, the size of the resulting UiO-66 particles can be effectively adjusted by simply altering reaction time and the amount of acetic acid with the purpose of understanding the crucial effect of structural design on the phosphate capture performance. Representatively, UiO-66 particles with small size demonstrates 415 mg/g of phosphate uptake capacity, outperforming most of the previously reported phosphate adsorbents. Meanwhile, the developed absorbents can rapidly reduce highly concentrated phosphate to below the permitted level in drinking water within a few minutes. More significantly, the current absorbents display remarkable phosphate sorption selectivity against the common interfering ions, which can be attributed to strong affinity between Zr–OH groups in UiO-66 and phosphate species. Furthermore, the spent UiO-66 particles can be readily regenerated and reused for multiple sorption–desorption cycles without obvious decrease in removal performance, rendering them promising sustainable materials. Hence, the developed UiO-66 adsorbents hold significant prospects for phosphate sequestration to mitigate the increasingly eutrophic problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aacetic acid 3aadsorbents 3abinding sites 3adrinking water 3aeutrophication 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aions 3aphosphates 3aremediation 3asorption 3asurface water 0aUiO-66 0asize modulation 0aphosphate 0aadsorption 0aselectivity1 aXie, Donghua1 aMa, Yue1 aQin, Wenxiu1 aZhang, Haimin1 aWang, Guozhong1 aZhang, Yunxia1 aZhao, Huijun0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Sept. 20, v. 9, no. 37 p.32151-32160dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b100243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007100167300001400238520238400252592002802636650001102664650001702675650001502692650001502707650002302722650003002745653001802775653001702793653000802810653001502818653001502833653003202848773010602880856008602986852000903072655001203081IND60539675820221120061036.0190318e20140314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053967582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArsoy, Sami10aConstant energy calibration for permittivity based moisture probes  ap. 79-91.  aSoil moisture or soil water content (SWC) is an important variable and its determination with an acceptable accuracy is an essential need for a variety of hydrological disciplines. Among the alternatives, permittivity based probes are gaining popularity and becoming established techniques. However, probes are affected by local soil conditions, requiring soil-specific calibrations for accurate and reliable measurements. Measurement errors associated with these probes can be classified in three groups as primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary errors are mostly associated with the underlying operating principles of a probe. Soil density variation is inherently the major source of secondary error as it can create a measurement error as much as 0.030m3m−3. The error associated with the secondary variables can be reduced by up to 0.015m3m−3 by targeting the half range of the density variations. Currently available techniques do not explicitly quantify/minimize the secondary errors. Tertiary errors arise mostly from user dependent factors associated with probe-soil contact discontinuities and unexpected small scale environmental variations in the vicinity of the measurement point.This study presents a unique approach in considering the natural variations of the dry density by proposing to conduct the soil specific calibrations on repacked samples under constant compaction/compression energy of 350kNm/m3. A simple probe insertion procedure was also employed by using guides and predrilling for probe rods in order to minimize the tertiary variables. A comparative assessment of the proposed calibration approach was conducted, considering a time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and two relatively affordable moisture probes with different operating principles (ThetaProbe ML2x and Wet-2 sensor). The findings of this study showed that accuracy levels of 0.012m3m−3, 0.015m3m−3 and 0.016m3m−3, through Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), were achieved for TDR, ThetaProbe and WET sensor, respectively, for a wide range of soil types including the clays and silts. It is concluded that the proposed constant energy calibration approach help contain the secondary effects due to density variation in a tight range and that the recommended probe installation procedure help minimize the tertiary effects associated with the probe-soil contact discontinuities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3asoil density 3asoil types 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atime domain reflectometry 0aSoil moisture 0aBulk density 0aTDR 0aThetaProbe 0aWET sensor 0aConstant energy calibration0 tJournal of hydrology.g2014 Mar. 14, v. 510 p.79-91dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012600169300001800295520094200313592002801255650001401283650002701297650002301324650001801347650001601365650001801381650002801399650000901427650001801436650001601454650001501470650001301485650001101498653000901509653001801518653001301536653001101549653001501560700002401575700002301599700002201622773010801644856008701752852000901839655001201848IND60570387620221120134210.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057038762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKona, Rajesh10aRegulatory effect of Fe-EDTA on mixotrophic cultivation of Chlorella sp. towards biomass growth and metabolite production  ap. 1227-1234.  aThe study examined the effect of varying concentrations of iron in the form of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid ferric sodium salt (Fe-EDTA) for cultivation of Chlorella sp. under mixotrophic condition to evaluate biomass growth and metabolites production. The experimental data depicted enhanced biomass production along with lipids, carbohydrates and proteins at an optimal iron concentration (8mg/L). Relatively higher biomass production (5.4g/L; 96h) with simultaneous total chlorophyll (5mg/mL (Chl a/b: 3.7/1.3mg/mL)), carbohydrates (105mg/g) and proteins (593mg/g) was observed with 8 mg/L Fe-EDTA. Total and neutral lipid content of 38% and 15.6% was observed under nutrient deprived conditions. The presence of iron showed distinct influence on the saturated fraction of FAME and increment in oleic acid (omega fatty acids; edible oil). Higher concentrations of Fe-EDTA (10/12mg/L) depicted incremental fraction of oleic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3abiomass production 3acarbohydrates 3achlorophyll 3aculture media 3aindustrial applications 3airon 3alipid content 3ametabolites 3aoleic acid 3aproteins 3asodium 0aFAME 0aCarbohydrates 0aProteins 0aLipids 0aEdible oil1 aHemalatha, Manupati1 aVenu Srivastav, K.1 aVenkata Mohan, S.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 244 p.1227-1234dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00886naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245005100163520013600214592002800350650000900378650001000387650001000397700002200407773012000429856007400549852000900623655001200632IND60759393720221121164019.0211209e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075939372DNAL7 a10.3390/w132333822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakhomov, Maksim A.10aGas-Liquid Two-Phase Flow in a Pipe or Channel  aThis Special Issue contributes to highlight and discusses topics related to various aspects of the two-phase gas-liquid flows [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3aflow 3apipes 3awater1 aLobanov, Pavel D.0 tWater.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 13, no. 23dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132333823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245012000171300001600291506002800307520153500335592002801870506003701898650001601935650001201951650001601963650001101979650002201990650001802012650002402030650000902054651001402063653001502077653001202092653000802104653001502112653001702127700001502144700001302159700002002172700002002192700002002212700002302232700001302255700001702268700002502285773010202310856007902412852000902491655001202500IND60775905420221207093616.0220921e20220502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077590542DNAL7 a10.1515/opag-2022-00872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFahmid, Imam Mujahidin10aStudy of the impact of increasing the highest retail price of subsidized fertilizer on rice production in Indonesia  ap. 348-359.  aResource is Open Access  aFertilizer plays an important role in agricultural production, and up to now it has always been subsidized through the selling price mechanism. This study aims to analyze three related areas, namely, the subsidized fertilizer policy dynamics, the development of subsidized fertilizer highest retail price (HRP), and the effects of its subsidy price changes on rice production. The study uses both the primary data from research in West Java in 2020 and the data from 2016 national farmer panel and also the secondary data. The data analysis was carried out quantitatively, namely, multiple regression analysis and qualitative descriptive studies. The results of the analysis show that the profit value of lowland rice farming is Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). 13.89 million/ha/season and Revenue per cost ratio (R/C) is 1.85. The proportion of fertilizer input cost to the total lowland rice farming cost reaches 10.25%. The analysis of the nationwide impacts of the HRP increase of the subsidized fertilizers by IDR. 300/kg shows the result that there would be a decrease in national rice productivity by 0.09 tons/ha, a decrease in national rice production by 0.94 million tons milled dry rice (MDR/GKG), and a decrease in the national rice harvest area equivalent to 186,219 ha. It is suggested that in the future, some efforts and measures are needed to make the use of subsidized fertilizers to be more effective and efficient. In order to maintain national rice production, a program to increase the harvested areas is needed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagriculture 3afarmers 3afertilizers 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amarket prices 3aregression analysis 3arice 3aIndonesia 0afertilizer 0asubsidy 0aHRP 0aproduction 0arice farming1 aJamil, Ali1 aWahyudi,1 aAgustian, Adang1 aHatta, Muhammad1 aAldillah, Rizma1 aYofa, Rangga Ditya1 aSumedi, 1 aSumaryanto, 1 aSusilowati, Sri Hery0 tOpen Agriculture.g2022 May 02, v. 7, no. 1 p.348-359dDe GruyterwJournal:23162x2391-95317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/opag-2022-00873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245014100190300001600331520159300347592002801940650001801968650002001986650001402006650003102020650001502051650001002066650001002076650003802086650002902124650001102153650001102164650002302175650004202198650002402240650002602264650002102290650003002311700002502341700002402366700002202390700002102412700002202433700002702455773008202482856008102564852000902645655001202654IND4449762720221121015155.0141112e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444976272DNAL7 a205798512pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2010.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTentolouris, Nicholas10aMeal-induced thermogenesis and macronutrient oxidation in lean and obese women after consumption of carbohydrate-rich and fat-rich meals  ap. 310-315.  aOBJECTIVE: To examine differences in meal-induced thermogenesis and macronutrient oxidation between lean and obese women after consumption of two different isocaloric meals, one rich in carbohydrate (CHO) and one rich in fat. METHODS: A total of 19 lean and 22 obese women were studied on two occasions, 1 wk apart. In one visit they consumed a CHO-rich meal and in the other visit a fat-rich meal. The two meals were isocaloric and were given in random order. Resting energy expenditure and macronutrient oxidation rates were measured and calculated in the fasting state and every hour for 3 h after meal consumption. RESULTS: Meal-induced thermogenesis was not different between lean and obese subjects after the CHO-rich (P = 0.89) or fat-rich (P = 0.32) meal, but it was significantly higher after the CHO-rich compared with the fat-rich meal in the lean and the obese individuals (P < 0.05). Protein oxidation rate increased slightly but significantly after the test meals in both groups (P < 0.01). Fat oxidation rate decreased after consumption of the CHO-rich meal (P < 0.001), whereas it increased after consumption of the fat-rich meal in both groups (P < 0.01). CHO oxidation rate increased in both groups after consumption of the CHO-rich meal (P < 0.001). Oxidation rates of protein, fat, and CHO during the experiment were not significantly different between lean and obese participants. CONCLUSION: Meal-induced thermogenesis and macronutrient oxidation rates were not significantly different between lean and obese women after consumption of a CHO-rich or a fat-rich meal.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbohydrates 3aheat production 3aoxidation 3aresting energy expenditure 3atest meals 3awomen 2aAdult 2aDietary Carbohydratesxmetabolism 2aDietary Fatsxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aObesityxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aProtein Carbonylation 2aReference Values 2aThermogenesisxphysiology1 aAlexiadou, Kleopatra1 aKokkinos, Alexander1 aKoukou, Eustathia1 aPerrea, Despoina1 aKyriaki, Despoina1 aKatsilambros, Nicholas0 tNutrition.g2011 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.310-315dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2010.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245009900201300001100300520213000311592002802441596005702469596004402526596008302570596007502653650001802728650001602746650001402762650000902776650001002785650001102795650002002806650002602826650000902852651001302861700003302874700002102907700001802928700002002946700002102966700002402987773013103011856008303142852000903225655001203234IND60722877220221120030211.0220306e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072287722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-020-02511-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wuyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3174-649210aMineral availability in soil and fodders affecting blood profiles in Nili-Ravi dairy buffaloes  ap. 98.  aA mineral assessment study for dairy buffaloes, Nili-Ravi breed, was carried out seasonally at silvopasture farm at Sargodha, Pakistan. Sampling for soil, forage, and buffalo serum was done seasonally for a period of 1 year for mineral (P, Mg, Na, K, Ca) evaluation. In the study, experiments on forages showed significant differences in mean concentrations of Mg and P with changing seasons, whereas the values for Ca, Mg, Na, and K did not vary significantly. Three groups of buffaloes were checked for mineral concentration in blood serum, viz., calves, lactating and non-lactating. Ca mean concentration varied significantly for non-lactating buffaloes and calves between two seasons. Na mean level showed a significant difference for two sampling seasons among calves and lactating buffaloes. Mean level for Mg only differed significantly in serum of non-lactating buffaloes between the two seasons. Mean levels for Ca and P in soil and forage remained higher than the optimal level, whereas soil Na was below the critical level. K concentrations in soil and blood serum were above the critical level, while Mg levels remained below the optimal range in soil, forage, and blood serum. K concentration in forage remained below the optimal level. All buffalo categories displayed lower levels of Ca and P in serum. Na concentration in forage and serum exceeded the critical level. Furthermore, Ca yielded significant and positive correlation between soil and serum level, whereas K had significant but negative correlation for soil-forage and forage-serum. Overall, it was determined that P deficiency existed among buffaloes, which could be improved via supplementation. Similarly, K deficiency and Mg deficiency were exhibited for forage and soil respectively which could be countered through addition of fertilizers rich for these minerals. In brief, the mineral utilization of buffaloes is affected by reduced availability of essential nutrients and may result in lower productivity. It is suggested to add mineral supplementation in addition to natural diet of buffaloes to enhance the productivity of these animals.  aPublisher supplied data  a2484/13cThe Higher Education Commission of Pakistan  aXDHX201725cFuyang Municipal Government  aKJ2019ZD36cAnhui Provincial Educational Commission Natural Science Foundation  a201806a02020028cAnhui Provincial Scientific and Technological Project 3aanimal health 3ablood serum 3abuffaloes 3adiet 3afarms 3aforage 3amineral content 3asilvopastoral systems 3asoil 3aPakistan1 aK̲h̲ān̲, Ẓafar Iqbāl,1 aMehmood, Naunain1 aFardous, Asia1 aGondal, Sumaira1 aKafīl, Aḥmad,1 aNoorka, Ijaz Rasool0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 Mar., v. 53, no. 1 p.98-98dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-020-02511-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245013400203300001300337520080100350592002801151650001701179650001401196650001401210650001501224650002301239650001901262650001101281650001001292650000701302650001701309650001501326650001401341650001301355650001501368650001801383651001801401651001101419653001501430653001701445653001801462700006001480773014201540856008001682852000901762655001201771IND60775905520221119204519.0220502e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077590552DNAL7 a10.2478/trser-2022-00012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Vartika1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0448-086010aPalynological Analysis of Surface Sediments in a High Arctic Pond, Revealing Desmids as Indicators of Wetlands and Climate Change  ap. 1-16.  aThis is a first attempt to study the palynological remains from the surface sediments of a pond near the Kongsfjorden coast in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway.

We estimated the effects of the water level fluctuation range on the temporal dissimilarity of the macroinvertebrate community by sampling benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages monthly in 2017 and bimonthly in 2018. Then, we applied a boosted regression trees (BRT) model to quantitatively analyzing the relationship between macroinvertebrate abundance and microhabitat factors in different seasons. To distinguish differences in water level fluctuations at the sample site scale, we proposed a variable, namely, the percentage of water level fluctuation range (PWLFR). The results were as follows. (1) An increased water level fluctuation range would lead to more temporally heterogeneous macroinvertebrate communities. Temporal dissimilarity of macroinvertebrates increased linearly in response to increasing water level fluctuation range. (2) Species abundance presented seasonal characteristics, and the dominant factors affecting species abundance varied with the seasons. PWLFR was the dominant variable explaining macroinvertebrate abundance in summer. Macroinvertebrate abundance showed positive effects with increasing PWLFR. (3) The interaction between chlorophyll a and PWLFR in summer promoted an increase in macroinvertebrate abundance. These findings may provide a basis for the formulation of effective ecological water replenishment management decisions aimed at maintaining the stability of shallow lake ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3afreshwater 3amacroinvertebrates 3amicrohabitats 3amodels 3aspecies abundance 3asummer1 aSun, Tao 1 aWang, Xuan 1 aLiu, Dan 1 aZhang, Yunlong 1 aYang, Zhifeng 0 tWater.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 13, no. 23dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132333803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024004200133040001800175100001500193245016100208300001600369506007600385506003100461520155200492592002802044596008302072506003702155650001202192650001402204650001302218650001602231650002102247650001702268650001802285650002102303650001802324650001102342650002202353650002402375650000702399650001202406650001302418650001202431650001402443653001402457653001902471653001302490653002302503653002102526700001702547700001702564700001802581700001802599700001102617700006802628773011102696856008602807856004502893961000902938852000902947655001202956IND60591234620221215143610.0190516e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059123462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0382doi7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0382chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Fang10aControlled-release of antacids from biopolymer microgels under simulated gastric conditions: Impact of bead dimensions, pore size, and alginate/pectin ratio  ap. 745-751.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe highly acidic nature of the gastric fluids inside the human stomach can cause have health problems in certain individuals e.g., acid reflux and ulcers. Antacid-loaded biopolymer microgels can be used to control the acidity of the gastric fluids, which may be useful for developing functional foods to treat these problems. In this study, the impact of biopolymer microgel dimensions and composition on the dissolution rate of encapsulated antacid was determined under simulated gastric conditions. The microgels were formed by injecting antacid (magnesium hydroxide) and biopolymers (alginate or alginate/pectin) into a calcium chloride solution to promote cross-linking. Microgels of varying dimensions were formed using either a hand-held syringe or a vibrating nozzle encapsulation device with different nozzle sizes. The rate of antacid dissolution was measured using an automatic titration device (pH stat) that added HCl solution into the simulated gastric fluids to maintain a constant pH of 2.5. The antacid dissolution rate decreased with increasing microgel diameter (300 to 1660 μm) and decreasing pore size (0.8 to 2.0% alginate). The slowest dissolution rate was observed in microgels containing 80% alginate and 20% pectin, which may have been due to the impact of biopolymer composition on bead dimensions and pore size. The results of this study may be useful for the design of biopolymer microgels that can control the release of antacids in the stomach, thereby leading to better control over the pH of the gastric fluids.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacidity 3aalginates 3aantacids 3abiopolymers 3acalcium chloride 3acrosslinking 3aencapsulation 3afunctional foods 3agastric juice 3ahumans 3ahydrochloric acid 3amagnesium hydroxide 3apH 3apectins 3aporosity 3astomach 3atitration 0aMicrogels 0aAlginate beads 0aAntacids 0aControlled release 0aGastrointestinal1 aZhang, Zipei1 aDeng, Zeyuan1 aZhang, Ruojie1 aFan, Guangqin1 aMa, Da1 aMcClements, David Julian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9016-12910 tFood research international.g2018 Apr., v. 106 p.745-751dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.01.0383Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5912346  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02877naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001400170245006600184300001400250520118000264592002801444650000801472650001301480650001101493650001401504650000901518650000901527650001001536650001501546650001601561650001201577650003501589650004601624650003101670650001101701650003501712650001901747650002001766650002201786650002101808650002501829650003701854650002001891650002001911650001001931650002901941651001201970651001001982651001201992700001702004700001702021700001302038700001602051773010202067856008502169852000902254655001202263IND60113321920221119163337.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011332192DNAL7 a221975322pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosma, C.10aIndicators of the Fukushima radioactive release in NW Romania  ap. 94-99.  aAs a result of the Fukushima nuclear release, ¹³¹I was found in different environmental media (rainwater, sheep and cow milk, herbage, sheep meat and thyroid tissue) in north-west Romania. On April 4, 2011 a maximum value of 1.40 ± 0.21 Bq/L in ¹³¹I activity was found in rainwater obtained from the Arad region. The obtained value corresponded with the maximum of ¹³¹I concentration in air, as measured by Toma et al. (2011) for the Piteşti area. One day later, sheep milk from the Cluj area was found to contain a maximum activity of 9.22 ± 0.95 Bq/L. A value of 0.85 ± 0.07 μSv was calculated as the total monthly effective dose received by the population as a result of the ingestion of sheep milk and sheep meat contaminated with ¹³¹I. Only rainwater samples contained ¹³⁴Cs and ¹³⁷Cs at levels close to minimum detectable activity. Since the determined values could be influenced by Chernobyl ¹³⁷Cs, the ¹³⁷Cs concentrations are subject to uncertainty.

In this work, ZrMn₂ nanoparticles were successfully prepared by a facile wet-chemical method and then introduced to MgH₂via ball milling to fabricate MgH₂–ZrMn₂ composites. Remarkable improvements to the de/rehydrogenation properties were achieved with the addition of ZrMn₂ nanoparticles. The MgH₂ + 10 wt% nano-ZrMn₂ composite started to release hydrogen at 181.9 °C, which was about 160 °C lower compared with that of additive-free MgH₂. At 300 °C, the MgH₂+ 10 wt% nano-ZrMn₂ composite desorbed 6.7 wt% hydrogen in 5 min. More importantly, the dehydrogenated MgH₂ + 10 wt% nano-ZrMn₂ sample absorbed hydrogen even at room temperature under 3 MPa hydrogen pressure, and approximately 5.3 wt% hydrogen was taken up within 10 min at 100 °C. Moreover, compared with additive-free MgH₂, the dehydrogenation and rehydrogenation activation energies of the MgH₂ + 10 wt% nano-ZrMn₂ composites were significantly reduced to 82.2 ± 2.7 kJ mol⁻¹ and 22.1 ± 2.7 kJ mol ⁻¹, respectively. TEM analysis demonstrated the uniform distribution of ZrMn₂ nanoparticles in the MgH₂ matrix. Further, density functional theory calculations revealed that the presence of ZrMn₂ facilitated the breaking of the Mg–H bond, which provided a good explanation for the reduced de/rehydrogenation temperatures of the ZrMn₂ modified MgH₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalloys 3aambient temperature 3achemical bonding 3adehydrogenation 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen 3amilling 3ananoparticles 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aCai, Zeliang1 aYao, Zhendong1 aJi, Liang1 aSun, Ze1 aYan, Nianhua1 aZhang, Beiyu1 aXiao, Beibei1 aDu, Jun1 aZhu, Xinqiao1 aChen, Lixin0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Mar. 5, v. 7, no. 10 p.5626-5634dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00120d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245010600151300001800257520108900275592002801364650001101392650001001403650002201413650002001435650000901455650001401464650002201478650001601500650001201516650002201528650002601550700002001576700001701596700001801613700001701631700001301648700001501661700001301676700001901689773012101708856007401829852000901903655001201912IND60641437120221120141638.0190505e20170104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064143712DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra25915d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Fu10aColor tunable emission and energy transfer in LaSi₃N₅:Ce³⁺,Tb³⁺ phosphors for UV white LEDs  ap. 1075-1081.  aA series of new blue-green emitting LaSi₃N₅:Ce³⁺,Tb³⁺ phosphors were obtained through a high temperature solid-state method. The crystal structure, photoluminescence properties and energy transfer from Ce³⁺ to Tb³⁺ were investigated. The doped ions Ce³⁺ and Tb³⁺ were confirmed to occupy the same crystallographic sites as La³⁺ using a Rietveld structure refinement method. The emission spectra of these phosphors was composed of a blue emission band attributed to the d–f transition of Ce³⁺, together with several sharp lines ascribed to the emission of Tb³⁺ under UV light excitation. Thus a color tunable emission from blue to green was obtained via controlling the doping concentration of Tb³⁺. In addition, the mechanism of energy transfer, efficiency of energy transfer, chromaticity coordinates and thermal stability of these phosphors were investigated. The results indicated that the Ce³⁺,Tb³⁺ co-activated LaSi₃N₅ phosphors with color-tunable blue-green emission and high quantum efficiency may have potential for UV white LEDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acerium 3acolor 3acrystal structure 3aenergy transfer 3aions 3alanthanum 3aphotoluminescence 3atemperature 3aterbium 3athermal stability 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhuang, Weidong1 aLiu, Ronghui1 aLiu, Yuanhong1 aZhong, Jiyou1 aGao, Pin1 aZhang, Xia1 aGao, Wei1 aShao, Lengleng0 tRSC advances.g2017 Jan. 04, v. 7, no. 2 p.1075-1081dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra25915d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008800178300001600266520156500282592002801847650002701875650001401902650001501916650001401931650000901945650001701954650001201971650001601983650001001999650001502009650001702024651001102041700003202052700002902084700004502113700002402158773012402182856008102306852000902387655001202396IND60440810920170825000000.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044081092DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-014-0111-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silveira, Talita Iatski10aFunctional leaf traits of 57 woody species of the Araucaria Forest, Southern Brazil  ap. 357-366.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the leaf morphology of 57 tree species to determine if there is a dominant leaf pattern in a remnant of the Araucaria Forest, Curitiba, PR, Brazil that can be used as ecological indicator of this forest. We also determined the quantitative morphological and anatomical traits of all species, distributed in 4 different strata, to identify a dominant leaf type of each stratum, regarding light exposure. Thirty mature leaves were collected for each species and were classified morphologically. Leaf area and size, dry mass, specific leaf area, stomata density, total thickness of leaf blade, epidermis, palisade, and spongy parenchyma thickness were also analyzed. Leaves with entire margin, acuminate apex, and microphyllous were predominant among the studied species. All of them presented hypostomatic leaves, except Araucaria angustifolia. All 57 species presented thin leaves and high specific leaf area, indicating mesophyll, characteristic of rain forests as observed in studies in similar dense forests. Low light intensity, in understory species, appears to be determinant of leaf morphology and anatomy differences, associated to high rainfall and relatively low temperature of the study area, both being the characteristics of this Atlantic Forest formation. Considering the results, no specific leaf pattern for the Araucaria Forest was found. Only the lowest stratum showed more differences comparing with the others, and no specific leaf trait could be correlated to light exposure in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraucaria angustifolia 3aleaf area 3aleaf blade 3amesophyll 3arain 3arain forests 3astomata 3atemperature 3atrees 3aunderstory 3awoody plants 3aBrazil1 aBoeger, Maria Regina Torres1 aMaranho, Leila Terezinha1 ade Melo, João Carlos Ferreira, Jr.cJr.1 aSoffiatti, Patricia0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2015 June, v. 38, no. 2 p.357-366dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-014-0111-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006900152245010300221300001600324520128800340592002801628650002601656650001801682650002901700650002301729650002201752650001101774650001401785650001001799650002001809650001901829650001701848653002301865653002501888653003001913653002601943653003101969653004402000700006102044700002402105700002402129773010402153856008702257852000902344655001202353IND60591496120221120204109.0190326e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059149612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSulbaek Andersen, Mads P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7976-585212aA three-dimensional model of the atmospheric chemistry of E and Z-CF3CH=CHCl (HCFO-1233(zd) (E/Z))  ap. 250-259.  aUsing a 3-dimensional global atmospheric chemistry and transport model we investigated the atmospheric degradation of HCFO-1233zd(E), E-CF3CH=CHCl, a commercially important, new hydrofluorocarbon replacement compound. Atmospheric degradation of E-CF3CH=CHCl is initiated by reaction with OH radicals, which leads to several chemical oxidation products. Dissemination of these oxidation products to the environment is of concern due to the possible formation of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as a degradation product. The model indicates that the average global yield of TFA from atmospheric processing of E-CF3CH=CHCl is approximately 2%. The annually averaged atmospheric lifetime of E-CF3CH=CHCl was found to be approximately 36 days (12 days for Z-CF3CH=CHCl). As E-CF3CH=CHCl is short lived, by far the majority of its Cl atoms will be released and deposited in the lower atmosphere, and the impact on stratospheric ozone is insignificant. An Ozone Depletion Potential of 0.00030 was determined. The Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential was evaluated and a value of 3.6 determined. Finally, we derive a Global Warming Potential for E-CF3CH=CHCl for a 100 year time horizon of <5. For comparison, data for the stereoismeric analogue, Z-CF3CH=CHCl, was also obtained from the model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3afree radicals 3aglobal warming potential 3ahydrofluorocarbons 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aozone 3aozone depletion 3aphotochemistry 3astratosphere 0aHalogenated olefin 0aTrifluoroacetic acid 0aGlobal warming potentials 0aAtmospheric lifetimes 0aOzone depletion potentials 0aPhotochemical ozone creation potentials1 aSchmidt, Johan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7297-38511 aVolkova, Aleksandra1 aWuebbles, Donald J.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 Apr., v. 179 p.250-259dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245010200205300001600307520165900323592002801982650001702010650002002027650002402047650002602071650002702097650001202124650002202136650001802158650001902176650002302195650002002218650001702238650001102255650002002266650001602286651001602302651001602318700002302334700002102357700002602378773013502404856008202539852000902621655001202630IND60590152820221121024210.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059015282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-017-1212-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConedera, Marco1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3980-214210aDrivers of broadleaved evergreen species spread into deciduous forests in the southern Swiss Alps  ap. 425-436.  aThe spread of non-native species into natural communities is a noticeable phenomenon linked to global change. Drivers of such invasions, however, may differ according to specific regional environments. Here, we aim at disentangling the role of selected climate and non-climate drivers on the spread of native (Hedera helix and Ilex aquifolium) and non-native (Prunus laurocerasus and Trachycarpus fortunei) evergreen species in mature deciduous forests in southern Switzerland. Covers of target evergreens were determined using 200 quadratic plots of 100 m², distributed on a regular grid of 100 × 100 m and spanning a steep climatic gradient ranging from −0.4 to 3.0 °C in the average temperature of the coldest month. Species covers were used as response variables to be related to climate, stand structure, disturbances, propagule pressure and geomorphology proxies by performing tobit regressions. Propagule pressure resulted to be the main driver of occurrence for three considered species, while meso-climate and stand structure played only a secondary role. In contrast, the presence of native I. aquifolium was mostly correlated with the temperature of the coldest month, though with an overall low impact on cover. Our study demonstrates different drivers of invasion for native and non-native species with similar life history traits. In particular, differences emerge from ecological requirements (niche) and propagule pressure. The ongoing spread of evergreen broadleaved species at the regional scale demonstrates how evergreens invade a largely empty ecological niche, mainly issued by land-use change rather than climate warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHedera helix 3aIlex aquifolium 3aPrunus laurocerasus 3aTrachycarpus fortunei 3abroadleaved evergreens 3aclimate 3adeciduous forests 3ageomorphology 3aglobal warming 3aintroduced species 3aland use change 3alife history 3aniches 3astand structure 3atemperature 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aWohlgemuth, Thomas1 aTanadini, Matteo1 aPezzatti, GianniBoris0 tRegional environmental change.g2018 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.425-436dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1212-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013200155300001800287520144100305592002801746650000901774650001901783650001701802650001901819650001801838650001501856650001401871650001701885650002101902700001401923773014201937856007402079852000902153655001202162IND60632265120221119122126.0190314e20190312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063226512DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta00137a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Ruiyi10aHigh-performance graphene oxide nanofiltration membrane with continuous nanochannels prepared by the in situ oxidation of MXene  ap. 6475-6481.  aSeparation membrane with laminar structure, assembled by two-dimensional materials, has been widely explored to achieve precise molecular separation and high water permeability in the field of water purification. Herein, a novel GO-based nanofiltration membrane intercalated with TiO₂ nanoparticles was fabricated by the in situ oxidation of MXene nanosheets. The formation of TiO₂ nanocrystals, derived from the oxidation of MXene, created additional channels for water permeation. Particularly, the consecutively distributed TiO₂ nanocrystals acted as intercalators owing to their laminar structure and created continuous nanochannels within GO membrane for water transport, which shows great advantages over the membrane prepared using traditional methods. Water permeability of the obtained membrane reached 89.6 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹, which is 7.3 times that of pristine GO membrane and 2.4 times that of GO/TiO₂ membrane fabricated using traditional methods. The rejection rate for four different organic dyes is above 97%. The highly improved water permeability with no obvious sacrifice of rejection rate was attributed to the presence of continuous nanochannels obtained via the in situ oxidation of MXene without destroying the intrinsic stacking structure of GO sheets. This study offers a novel strategy to fabricate continuous nanochannels within the separation membrane with a two-dimensional laminar structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3adyes 3agraphene oxide 3ananocrystals 3ananofiltration 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3apermeability 3atitanium dioxide1 aWu, Peiyi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Mar. 12, v. 7, no. 11 p.6475-6481dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00137a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01455naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016600154300002000320520033400340592002800674650001400702650003600716650002300752650002900775650001400804650001200818700001900830700001300849700001900862700001700881773013600898856007401034852000901108655001201117IND60660750820221118192023.0190827e20141111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066075082DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc07440h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yinuo10aPalladium-catalyzed oxidative C–H bond acylation of N-nitrosoanilines with toluene derivatives: a traceless approach to synthesize N-alkyl-2-aminobenzophenones  ap. 15352-15354.  aA palladium-catalyzed cascade cross-coupling of N-nitroso-anilines and toluene derivatives for the direct synthesis of N-alkyl-2-aminobenzophenones is described.

Targeting inactive (vs active) kinase conformations offers advantages in achieving selectivity because of their more diversified structures. Discovery of inactive conformation-selective inhibitors, however, has been hampered partly by the lack of general assay methods. Herein, we show that such inhibitors can be discovered by utilizing kinase cascade assays. This type of assay is initiated with the target kinase in its unphosphorylated, inactive conformation, which is activated during the assay. Inactive conformation-selective inhibitors stabilize the inactive kinase, block activation, and yield reduced kinase activity. We investigate the properties of the assay by mathematical modeling, as well as by proof-of-concept experiments using the BRAF-MEK1 cascade. This study demonstrates effective identification of inactive conformation-selective inhibitors by cascade assays, reveals key factors that impact results, and provides guidelines for successful cascade assay development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemistry 3adrugs 3aguidelines 3ahumans 3amathematical models1 aKrosky, Daniel1 aAhn, Kay0 tBiochemistry.g2017 Aug. 29, v. 56, no. 34 p.4449-4456dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.7b005213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012500154300001800279520132700297592002801624650001101652650001801663650001401681650001301695650001501708650001701723650001001740650001901750650001201769650001101781650001301792650001701805700002001822700001701842700001401859700001601873700001801889773014201907856007402049852000902123655001202132IND60632265220221119121807.0190314e20190312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063226522DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta00143c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Wei10aDepressing the irreversible reactions on a three-dimensional interface towards a high-areal capacity lithium metal anode  ap. 6267-6274.  aConstruction of 3D electrode structures has emerged as an effective way to stabilize Li metal anodes. However, a 3D porous structure with relatively large surface area will enlarge the contact area between the electrolyte and Li, resulting in a low coulombic efficiency and capacity decay due to electrolyte decomposition at the 3D interface, especially under high areal capacity conditions. Herein, an ultrathin and conformal lithium-ion conductive coating, composed of a PEO/LiTFSI-based solid polymer electrolyte with graphene oxide as a functional filler to enhance the ionic conductivity, is proposed as a protective layer to address the abovementioned issues for 3D Li metal anodes. This coating layer can be applied to various 3D current collectors, such as Ni foam and carbon fiber cloth, and is effective in suppressing electrolyte decomposition and guiding uniform deposition of Li beneath it. As a result, the irreversible capacity loss of the protected 3D Li anode reduces to one-sixth that of the uncoated anode, and an average coulombic efficiency of 98.9% and stable cycling for over 800 h can be achieved at the high areal capacity of 10 mA h cm⁻². This study establishes a general approach of surface modification to depress the irreversible reactions on the surface of practical 3D metallic Li anodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon fibers 3achemistry 3acoatings 3acollectors 3aelectrolytes 3afoams 3agraphene oxide 3alithium 3anickel 3apolymers 3asurface area1 aLiang, Shanshan1 aZhou, Xufeng1 aZhao, Fei1 aZhu, Wenhua1 aLiu, Zhaoping0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Mar. 12, v. 7, no. 11 p.6267-6274dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00143c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002800188245008700216300001800303520092700321592002801248650001201276650002001288650001501308650001701323650000901340650002201349650001701371650002601388700002001414700002101434700002301455700002401478700002301502773009801525856008101623990002301704852000901727655001201736IND60091459620221116232911.0141103e20131203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009145962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2013.10.0292doi7 aPMC38530862pmcid7 a243140812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishnakumar, Shyam S.10aConformational Dynamics of Calcium-Triggered Activation of Fusion by Synaptotagmin  ap. 2507-2516.  aSynaptotagmin triggers rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles in response to Calcium (Ca²⁺) ions. Here, we use a novel Nanodisc-based system, designed to be a soluble mimetic of the clamped synaptic vesicle-bilayer junction, combined with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy to monitor the structural relationships among SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor), Synaptotagmin C2 domains, and the lipid bilayer in real time during the Ca²⁺-activation process. We report that Synaptotagmin remains rigidly fixed on the partially assembled SNARE complex with no detectable internal rearrangement of its C2 domains, even as it rapidly inserts into the bilayer. We hypothesize that this straightforward, one-step physical mechanism could explain how this Ca²⁺- sensor rapidly activates neurotransmitter release from the clamped state.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aenergy transfer 3aexocytosis 3afluorescence 3aions 3aneurotransmitters 3aspectroscopy 3asynaptic transmission1 aKümmel, Daniel1 aJones, Sunny J.1 aRadoff, Daniel T.1 aReinisch, Karin M.1 aRothman, James E.,0 tBiophysical journal.g2013 Dec. 3, v. 105, no. 11 p.2507-2516dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2013.10.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016000160300001800320520159100338592002801929650001201957650002801969650002201997650002202019650001702041650001402058650002002072650001602092650001202108650001702120650001802137650001902155650001402174650001702188650001202205650001302217700001902230700001702249700001602266700001802282700001702300700001402317700001302331700001402344700001802358773014002376856007402516852000902590655001202599IND60685658820221117180458.0200305e20200304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068565882DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00049c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Zhongxiong10aDual-self-recognizing, stimulus-responsive and carrier-free methotrexate–mannose conjugate nanoparticles with highly synergistic chemotherapeutic effects  ap. 1922-1934.  aCarrier-free nanoparticles (NPs) via chemotherapeutic drug–drug conjugate assembly are a promising alternative for tumor chemotherapy. However, these NPs are still hindered via their nonspecific internalization into certain healthy cells and tissues. Herein, dual-acting methotrexate (MTX) and mannose (MAN) were conjugated via a hydrolyzable ester bond to synthesize a MTX–MAN conjugate as one molecule, which could be directly self-assembled into stimulus-responsive carrier-free NPs (MTX–MAN NPs) in aqueous solution. Such carrier-free MTX–MAN NPs with an accurate drug to sugar ratio could achieve on-demand drug release by dual stimuli of lysosomal acidity and esterase. Besides, MTX–MAN NPs could be dual-recognized by tumor cells in vitro and specifically by tumors in vivo. Moreover, the large proportion of MAN located on the NPs’ surface could exert a shielding effect to avoid phagocytosis of macrophages, leading to long blood circulation. Therefore, the MTX–MAN NPs sharply reduced the drug dosage and decreased the toxicity to normal cells and tissues. Further in vitro and in vivo studies consistently confirmed that the MTX–MAN NPs exhibited superior tumor accumulation and highly synergistic chemotherapeutic effects. Furthermore, we found for the first time that MAN could enhance the antitumor activity of MTX. Considering that bi-functional MTX and MAN are approved via the FDA, and MAN is highly biosafe, the dual-self-recognizing, stimulus-responsive, and carrier-free MTX–MAN NPs might be a simple, selective, and safe chemotherapeutic strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aantineoplastic activity 3aaqueous solutions 3ablood circulation 3adrug therapy 3aesterases 3ain vivo studies 3amacrophages 3amannose 3amethotrexate 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphagocytosis 3atissues 3atoxicity1 aWang, Yinqiang1 aXiang, Sijin1 aZuo, Wenbao1 aHuang, Doudou1 aJiang, Beili1 aSun, Heng1 aYin, Wen1 aXie, Liya1 aHou, Zhenqing0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Mar. 4, v. 8, no. 9 p.1922-1934dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00049c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245013600165300001600301500001900317520104000336536035701376592002801733596001801761596001801779596001201797596001501809650002101824650002101845650001601866650002601882650001501908650001701923650002001940650001001960650001701970650001801987650001802005650001202023650001602035650001602051650002102067650001102088650001702099650002002116653002702136653001302163653002802176653002302204653001202227653001802239700001502257700001402272700001602286700001802302700001802320700001702338700001502355773012802370856008502498852000902583655001202592IND60720211520221122080502.0201210e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072021152DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2019.17057662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu10aPeptides derived from fermented soybean meal suppresses intestinal inflammation and enhances epithelial barrier function in piglets  ap. 120-135.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was to investigate the effects of peptides derived from fermented soybean meal (FSP) on intestinal inflammation and epithelial barrier function of the piglets. Compared to fed soybean meal, piglets fed with fermented soybean meal (FSBM) exhibit lower serum levels of IL-6, IL-1β and D-lactate, and reduced ileum macrophage infiltration. Besides, the FSBM up-regulated (p < 0.05) expression of mucins and tight junction (TJ) proteins in the jejunum and ileum of piglets. The FSP were prepared with alkali extraction and a 3-kDa molecular weight cut-off membrane system. In vitro, FSP reducing the mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8 and attenuated Escherichia coli K88-induced inflammation in the intestinal porcine epithelial cells-J2 (IPEC-J2). Furthermore, FSP increased (p < 0.05) the expression of TJ proteins and transepithelial electrical resistance in IPEC-J2 cells. These results suggest that FSP could improve small intestinal health by enhancing epithelial barrier function and suppressing inflammation.  aThis work was supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 518000-X91604]; Earmarked fund for China Agriculture Research System [grant number CARS-35]; Zhejiang province Postdoctoral Science Foundation [grant number 518000-X81601]; Key Agriculture Program of Zhejiang Major Science and Technology Projects [grant number 2015C02022].  aPublisher supplied data  a518000-X81601  a518000-X91604  aCARS-35  a2015C02022 3aEscherichia coli 3aalkali treatment 3ablood serum 3aelectrical resistance 3aepithelium 3afermentation 3agene expression 3aileum 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3ajejunum 3alactic acid 3amacrophages 3amolecular weight 3amucins 3asoybean meal 3atight junctions 0aFermented soybean meal 0apeptides 0aintestinal inflammation 0aepithelial barrier 0apiglets 0aIPEC-J2 cells1 aChen, Shan1 aZong, Xin1 aWang, Cheng1 aShi, Changyou1 aWang, Fengqin1 aWang, Yizhen1 aLu, Zeqing0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 31, no. 1 p.120-135dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45182x1465-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2019.17057663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011400157300002000271500001900291520112200310592002801432650001101460650002001471650001901491650002701510650001301537650003701550700001601587700001301603700001301616700001401629773012401643856007401767852000901841655001201850IND60678886520221119224700.0191218e20191212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067888652DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07703k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xingxing10aStructure–property relationship of polycarbonate/polypropylene alloys prepared via eccentric rotor extruder  ap. 41248-41255.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, PC/PP alloys were respectively prepared by eccentric rotor extruder (ERE) and twin screw extruder (TSE). By analyzing the mechanical properties, morphology, rheological behavior and thermal properties of PC/PP alloys, the effects of processing methods on the two-phase structure and properties of PC/PP alloys were studied. The results showed that the size of the dispersed phase of PC/PP alloys was smaller and its distribution was more uniform under the elongational flow field provided by ERE. Compared to the typical sea-island phase structure provided by the shear flow field, the morphology of the alloys showed a “sea-island-fiber” phase structure under the elongational flow field. Compared to the TSE, the notched lzod impact strength of the PC/PP alloy prepared by ERE increased by 31.0%. ERE played a stronger effect on the dispersion and distribution of PC/PP alloys, which was also confirmed in the results of dynamic rheology analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The blending method dominated by the elongational flow field could prepare PC/PP alloys with better properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aimpact strength 3apolypropylenes 3arheological properties 3arheology 3astructure-activity relationships1 aHe, Jingwei1 aLiu, Yao1 aSu, Long1 aLiu, Fang0 tRSC advances.g2019 Dec. 12, v. 9, no. 70 p.41248-41255dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07703k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009800171300001600269520160200285592002801887650001501915650001901930650001101949650002101960650000901981650001001990650001202000650001202012650001302024650001702037650002202054650002302076650002002099650001502119651001502134653001002149653003202159653003402191653001202225653002402237700002102261700002102282700002102303700002002324700002002344773011902364856008402483852000902567655001202576IND60544999620221119032144.0170719e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054499962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.09.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoyer, Aurélien10aSeasonal changes in stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of bat guano (Guadeloupe)  ap. 524-532.  aStable isotope compositions of fossil bat guano have recently been developed as a proxy for reconstructing terrestrial paleoenvironments. However, our understanding of exactly how accurately these isotope compositions reflect seasonal variations remains limited. Here, we present a study of modern guano of phytophagous bats collected monthly over a one-year period at two roosting sites in Guadeloupe. The aim is to assess the degree to which seasonal climate and environmental variations are reflected in carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions from bat guano, as well as to evaluate the potential use of guano from phytophagous bats as a paleoenvironmental record. Our results show that stable isotope compositions vary locally, suggesting that guano of phytophagous bats accurately records local environmental conditions. Additionally, stable isotope compositions reflect seasonal variations influencing bat diet that lead to modifications of up to 2‰ of the carbon isotope compositions from feces. However, these variations are not correlated solely with climate variables as there is no straightforward relationship between climate, vegetation and bat diet over a one-year period. Moreover, these seasonal variations drive one of the bat colonies to occasionally consume insects, which can be traced as a seasonal shift in %N (up to 4.5%) and carbon isotope compositions (up to 5.6‰). Seasonal changes in isotope compositions are still lower than expected variations from fossil feces, confirming the potential use of feces from phytophagous bats as a reliable paleoenvironmental proxy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aanimal manures 3acarbon 3aclimatic factors 3adiet 3afeces 3afossils 3ainsects 3anitrogen 3apaleoecology 3aroosting behavior 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3avegetation 3aGuadeloupe 0aGuano 0aCarbon isotope compositions 0aNitrogen isotope compositions 0aClimate 0aSeasonal variations1 aQueffelec, Alain1 aCharlier, Karine1 aPuech, Elysandre1 aMalaizé, Bruno1 aLenoble, Arnaud0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 440 p.524-532dElsevier B.V.x0031-01827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2015.09.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012700175300001600302520152900318592002801847650002101875650002101896650001401917650001001931650001501941650001301956650002601969650002001995650001002015700002202025773013702047856008202184852000902266655001202275IND60590153220221121060154.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059015322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10142-017-0579-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSriroopreddy, Ramireddy10aIntegrative network-based approach identifies central genetic and transcriptomic elements in triple-negative breast cancer  ap. 113-124.  aTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has gained considerable attention as it oversteps about 15% of the deaths caused by breast cancer in women and is well known for its aggressive impact, high proliferation rate, intensity of tumor, and metastasis. In this study, we have given a new insight into TNBC, by introducing an integrative network methodology to understand the complexity of the candidate genes in TNBC. In the course of this analysis, the central network was constructed by refining the candidate genes present in the various databases. Eventually, the hub genes SRC, EGFR, JUN, CTNNB1, and MYC were derived using distinct topological parameters such as degree, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and clustering coefficient, which implicated a central role in TNBC. Furthermore, the identified hub genes were validated by utilizing molecular complex detection cluster analysis. A regulatory network was constructed to locate the transcriptional factors regulating these hub genes via MatInspector. Interestingly, we characterized that ZF02, MZF1, and PLAG are the common transcription factors which activate the hub genes. Moreover, a functional enrichment pathway was obtained from ClueGo, which depicted that all the hub genes have a significant role in toxicity-associated pathways as well as physiochemical featured pathways. In a nutshell, these prioritized genes could be the way out to uncover the molecular and therapeutic targets, leading to the development of personalized medicine for TNBC.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acluster analysis 3adatabases 3agenes 3ametastasis 3atopology 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics 3awomen1 aSudandiradoss, C.0 tFunctional & integrative genomics.g2018 Mar., v. 18, no. 2 p.113-124dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl61464x1438-793X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10142-017-0579-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04191naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245013200218500001900350520176500369592002802134650002102162650001202183650001602195650001102211650001302222650001902235650001902254650000902273650002502282650001302307650002502320653000602345653000702351653000902358653000702367653002902374653004002403653001802443653003302461700002702494700002402521700002902545700002402574700002302598700002702621700005902648700006602707700006702773700002302840700002402863700002202887700002502909700002802934700002502962700002002987700001503007700005903022700002403081700002303105700002503128700001703153700002703170700003203197773010903229856008603338961001203424852000903436655001203445IND60717101620221120173335.0210121e20210205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071710162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1098342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPessoa, Cláudia Campos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8559-307610aCalcium biofortification of Rocha pears, tissues accumulation and physicochemical implications in fresh and heat-treated fruits  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLow dietary intake of Ca in humans has been epidemiologically linked to various diseases, which can have serious health consequences over time. Accordingly, the development of an agronomic itinerary for Ca biofortification of Rocha pears and the assessment of physicochemical deviations prompted this study. Two orchards with contrasting soil and water characteristics were selected, characterized through orthophotomaping and, during fruits development, leaves were sprayed twice with Ca(NO₃)₂ (0.1, 0.3 and 0.6 kg ha⁻¹) or CaCl₂ (0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 kg ha⁻¹), followed by pulverization only with CaCl₂ (first once with 4 kg ha⁻¹ and then four times with 8 kg ha⁻¹). During fruits development net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rates, instantaneous and water use efficiency, only showed minor deviations, which indicated that the threshold of toxicity was not surpassed. Calcium contents varied during fruits development and at harvesting the average biofortification index varied between 47 %–63 % and 24 %–59 % in each of the orchards. Besides, the equatorial region of the fruits showed for all treatments (substantially in Ca treated samples) higher Ca contents in the epidermal and in the central regions. Fresh and heat-treated fruits (in a thermomix at 90 °C, during 10 min) biofortified with Ca only revealed minor differences and the sensory acceptability did not vary markedly. It is concluded that, although prevailing a heterogeneous distribution of Ca in fruit tissues, high indexes of biofortification in Rocha pears can be prompt in the orchards, without substantial physicochemical changes. Accordingly, agronomic biofortification with Ca can be used as a strategy for benefiting consumer’s health.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofortification 3acalcium 3afood intake 3afruits 3agrinding 3aheat treatment 3aphotosynthesis 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3atoxicity 3awater use efficiency 0aE 0ags 0aiWUE 0aPn 0aCalcium biofortification 0aCalcium accumulation in Rocha pears 0aFruit quality 0aPyrus communis L. var.

Overall, the adaptive immune response to PRRS virus (PRRSV) is weak, which results in delayed elimination of virus from the host and inferior vaccine protection. PRRSV has been shown to induce a meager alpha interferon (IFN-α) response, and we hypothesized that elevated IFN-α levels early in infection would shorten the induction time and increase elements of the adaptive immune response. To test this, we measured both antibody and cell-mediated immunity in pigs after the administration of a nonreplicating human adenovirus type 5 vector expressing porcine IFN-α (Ad5–pIFN-α) at the time of PRRSV infection and compared the results to those for pigs infected with PRRSV alone. Viremia was delayed, and there was a decrease in viral load in the sera of pigs administered the Ad5–pIFN-α. Although seroconversion was slightly delayed in pigs receiving Ad5–pIFN-α, probably due to the early reduction in viral replication, little difference in the overall or neutralizing antibody response was seen. However, there was an increase in the number of virus-specific IFN-γ-secreting cells detected in the pigs receiving Ad5–pIFN-α, as well as an altered cytokine profile in the lung at 14 days postinfection, indicating that the presence of IFN-α at the time of infection can alter innate and adaptive immune responses to PRRSV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aneutralization 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aantibodies 3ahosts 3acell-mediated immunity 3avaccines 3aviremia 3aHuman mastadenovirus C 3aviruses 3aseroconversion 3aimmune response 3alungs 3avirus replication 3ainterferons 3aswine 2aAdaptive Immunity 2aAdenoviruses, Humanxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aGene Expression 2aGenetic Vectors 2aImmunity, Innate 2aInterferon-alphaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aLeukocytes, Mononuclearximmunology 2aPorcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndromeximmunologyxvirology. 2aPorcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virusximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSwine 2aViral Load 2aViremia 0aHuman adenovirus C1 aLoving, Crystal L.1 aNelson, Eric A.1 aMiller, Laura C.1 aNicholson, Tracy L.1 aRegister, Karen B.1 aGrubman, Marvin J.1 aBrough, Douglas E.1 aKehrli, Marcus E., Jr.cJr.0 tClinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology.g2012 Apr., v. 19, no. 4 p.508-514dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:J000001301x1098-65887nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/544993Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/CVI.05490-11  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/114484_113989_Reprint_273511_Brockmeier_Clin_Vaccine_Immunol_2012_19_508.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011800160300001600278520151700294592002801811650002301839650001501862650001301877650001001890650001901900650002101919650001101940650001001951650001101961700001701972700001801989700001702007700001302024700001802037700001802055773012402073856008102197852000902278655001202287IND60440811520170825000000.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044081152DNAL7 a10.1007/s40415-014-0125-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Feng10aLatex dilution reaction during the tapping flow course of Hevea brasiliensis and the effect of Ethrel stimulation  ap. 211-221.  aThe latex dilution reaction during the tapping flow course has been well documented and associated with the facilitation of tapping latex flow. However, its underlying mechanism has not experimentally examined. The latex total solid content, osmotic potential and phloem turgor pressure change during the tapping flow course were simultaneously measured to investigate the cause of water movement during the tapping flow course. It was found that there are three different stages for the laticifer water equilibrium during the tapping flow course. The tapping-induced rapid turgor pressure drop is the cause of the first stage water influx into laticifers, while osmoregulation prevails during water exchange in the second and third stages of tapping flow. Meanwhile, aquaporin expressions were, for the first time, investigated during the tapping flow course. The rapid transcript up-regulation of HbPIP1, HbPIP2;1 and HbPIP2;3 contributes to the latex dilution reaction. However, their activity gating cannot be ruled out. Ethrel stimulation can significantly dilute the corresponding latex fractions during the tapping flow course due to its up-regulations of HbPIP1, HbPIP2;1 and HbPIP2;3. Nevertheless, the latex dilution reaction pattern for the Ethrel treated trees did not change, except for a lower degree of dilution compared with the un-treated trees. All these results suggest that both phloem turgor pressure and aquaporins are involved in the latex dilution reaction during the tapping flow course.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aaquaporins 3aethephon 3alatex 3aosmoregulation 3aosmotic pressure 3aphloem 3atrees 3aturgor1 aCai, Xiuqing1 aRookes, James1 aXie, Guishui1 aZou, Zhi1 aCahill, David1 aKong, Lingxue0 tRevista brasileira de botânica.g2015 June, v. 38, no. 2 p.211-221dSpringer International Publishingx0100-84047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40415-014-0125-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245011600179300001800295520181400313592002802127650004402155650002102199650001002220650001302230650001602243650003902259650001702298650001502315650001702330650001902347650002102366650001402387650001802401650002102419650001402440650001302454650001702467650001702484650001802501650001902519650003302538650002102571650003702592650001402629700002002643700002102663700002102684700002702705700001902732700002902751700002402780700003102804773009902835856008602934852000903020655001203029IND60579673120221122091938.0170829e20170829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057967312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.7b007422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandarani-Isfahani, Amir10aElegant pH-Responsive Nanovehicle for Drug Delivery Based on Triazine Dendrimer Modified Magnetic Nanoparticles  ap. 8503-8515.  aOwing to properties of magnetic nanoparticles and elegant three-dimensional macromolecule architectural features, dendrimeric structures have been investigated as nanoscale drug delivery systems. In this work, a novel magnetic nanocarrier, generation two (G2) triazine dendrimer modified Fe₃O₄@SiO₂ magnetic nanoparticles (MNP-G2), was designed, fabricated, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The prepared MNP-G2 nanosystem offers a new formulation that combines the unique properties of MNPs and triazine dendrimer as a biocompatible material for biomedical applications. To demonstrate the potential of MNP-G2, the nanoparticles were loaded with methotrexate (MTX), a proven chemotherapy drug. The MTX-loaded MNP-G2 (MNP-G2/MTX) exhibited a high drug-loading capacity of MTX and the excellent ability for controlled drug release. The cytotoxicity of MNP-G2/MTX using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide based assay and MCF-7, HeLa, and Caov-4 cell lines revealed that MNP-G2/MTX was more active against the tumor cells than the free drug in a mildly acidic environment. The results of hemolysis, hemagglutination, and coagulation assays confirmed the good blood safety of MNP-G2/MTX. Moreover, the cell uptake and intracellular distribution of MNP-G2/MTX were studied by flow cytometry analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This research suggests that MNP-G2/MTX with good biocompatibility and degradability can be selected as an ideal and effective drug carrier in targeted biomedicine studies especially anticancer applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiocompatibility 3ablood 3abromides 3acoagulation 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3adendrimers 3adrug therapy 3aflow cytometry 3ahemagglutination 3ahemolysis 3aillicit drugs 3alight scattering 3amagnetism 3amedicine 3amethotrexate 3ananocarriers 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atriazines1 aMoghadam, Majid1 aMohammadi, Shima1 aRoyvaran, Maryam1 aMoshtael-Arani, Naimeh1 aRezaei, Saghar1 aTangestaninejad, Shahram1 aMirkhani, Valiollah1 aMohammadpoor-Baltork, Iraj0 tLangmuir.g2017 Aug. 29, v. 33, no. 34 p.8503-8515dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.langmuir.7b007423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001600169245013600185300001600321520166800337592002802005653002502033653001702058653002502075653001602100653002002116700002202136700002002158700002502178700002402203773012702227856011702354852000902471655001202480IND60127904820221120143735.0151114e200010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012790482DNAL7 a10.1290/1071-2690(2000)036<0600:EOCGCO>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Jian,10aEffects of collagen gel configuration on behavior of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro: association with vascular morphogenesis  ap. 600-610.  aThe growth, behavior, and contractile protein expression of rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) grown on, between layers, or within a collagen gel was investigated by confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy and Western analysis. SMC grown on collagen gel behaved similarly to those on conventional culture dishes. However, when a second layer of collagen was overlaid, cells underwent an elongated quiescent phase before onset of proliferation and a more than threefold lower logarithmic growth rate was observed. These cells self-organized into a network with ring-like structures. With increasing culture time, some of the rings developed into funnel-like, incomplete or complete tubular structures. If a tubular template preexisted within the gel, the SMC established a cylinder-shaped tube with several circularly arranged muscular layers (similar to an artery wall). This behavior mimicked endothelial cells during angiogenesis in vitro. A similar phenomenon occurred in cultures in which SMC were randomly mixed in a collagen gel, but here their behavior and morphology varied with their position within the gel. Western blot analysis showed that the SMC differentiation marker, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain-2 (SM-2), rapidly decreased, disappearing by day 10 in SMC grown on collagen, but was still detectable until day 25 in cells cultured between or within the same gel. These findings indicate that like endothelial cells, vascular SMC can display blood vessel formation behavior in vitro when an appropriate three-dimensional matrix environment is provided to keep them in a relatively higher-differentiated and low-proliferative state.  aPublisher supplied data 0aextracellular matrix 0acell culture 0avascular development 0acell growth 0adifferentiation1 aROLFE, BARBARA E.1 aHAYWARD, IAN P.1 aCampbell, Gordon R.,1 aCampbell, Julie H.,0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2000 Oct., v. 36, no. 9 p.600-610dTissue Culture Associationx1543-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1290%2F1071-2690%282000%29036%3C0600%3AEOCGCO%3E2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245017800165300001600343520147700359592002801836650002201864650001901886650001201905650001101917650001401928650001301942650001201955650001401967650002701981650001302008650001802021650001102039650001602050650001802066650000902084650001502093650001002108650001002118650003002128651002102158700001602179700002302195700001702218700001602235700001702251700001902268700002302287700001502310700005602325773013402381856008202515852000902597655001202606IND60590223020221116160903.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059022302DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-017-0587-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalip, Mirlan10aAgro-morphological traits of Cicer reticulatum Ladizinsky in comparison to C. echinospermum P.H.

Recently many new accessions of C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum were collected in east and south-east Anatolia (Turkey) but they have not yet been evaluated for agro-morphological traits. Therefore, the current study investigated agro-morphological traits of new germplasm sources of C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum and evaluated resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses for chickpea improvement. The most attractive agro-morphological traits were canopy width, number of stems and pods per plant and biological yield. The most productive accessions of C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum had 712 and 625 pods per plant, respectively. Two distinct seed, flower and leaf shapes were found in accessions of C. echinospermum. Path analyses indicated that biological yield and harvest index had the most direct influence on seed yield in both species. Factor analyses showed that high seed yield in C. reticulatum depended on high biological yield and number of pods per plant, whereas high seed yield in C. echinospermum depended on harvest index. It was concluded that most accessions of C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum were not only resistant to some biotic and abiotic stresses but also had hidden alleles that could produce transgressive segregation in crosses to cultivated material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer reticulatum 3aabiotic stress 3aalleles 3acanopy 3achickpeas 3acrossing 3aflowers 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3ahabitats 3aharvest index 3aleaves 3aovergrazing 3apath analysis 3apods 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3astems 3atransgressive segregation 3aTurkey (country)1 aAdak, Alper1 aKahraman, Abdullah1 aBerger, Jens1 aSari, Duygu1 aSari, Hatice1 aPenmetsa, R.V.1 avon Wettberg, E.J.1 aCook, D.R.1 aToker, Cengiz1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7042-11320 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2018 Mar., v. 65, no. 3 p.951-962dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-017-0587-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011900155300001800274520153800292592002801830650001101858650001501869650001301884650002201897650002301919650001401942650003401956650002101990650001702011650000902028650001802037650001202055650001202067650002202079700001902101700002002120700001902140700001202159700001502171700001602186700001802202700001502220700001802235773014102253856007402394852000902468655001202477IND60632265920221119121737.0190314e20190305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063226592DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta00204a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peng13aAn intricately designed poly(vinylene carbonate-acrylonitrile) copolymer electrolyte enables 5 V lithium batteries  ap. 5295-5304.  aDespite their attractive properties such as high operating voltages and considerable rate capabilities, the commercialization of LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ cathodes is plagued by rapid capacity fading that stems from the severe parasitic side reactions with conventional liquid carbonate based electrolytes at a high voltage exceeding 4.5 V (vs. Li⁺/Li). In this work, a poly(vinylene carbonate-acrylonitrile) based gel polymer electrolyte (PVN-GPE) is intricately designed by copolymerizing acrylonitrile with vinylene carbonate. The intricately designed PVN-GPE can exhibit superior compatibility with LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄ cathodes, in order to address the above-mentioned severe parasitic side reactions. When evaluating the electrochemical properties of LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄/graphite full cells assembled with the PVN-GPE, an outstanding cycling stability (with a capacity retention of 93.2% after 200 cycles) has been achieved, which is far more superior to that of conventional liquid electrolytes. It is noted that the introduction of vinylene carbonate endows the PVN-GPE with improved interfacial compatibility towards lithium anodes, which can efficiently suppress the formation of lithium dendrites and enables excellent cycling performance (with a capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles) of LiNi₀.₅Mn₁.₅O₄/Li metal batteries. Our work presents an intriguing 5 V class high-voltage polymer electrolyte with superior performance and will boost the development of high-energy-density lithium batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbonates 3acathodes 3acommercialization 3acomposite polymers 3adendrites 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3agels 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3alithium 3alithium batteries1 aChai, Jingchao1 aZhang, Zhonghua1 aZhang, Huanrui1 aMa, Yue1 aXu, Gaojie1 aDu, Huiping1 aLiu, Tianmeng1 aLi, Guicun1 aCui, Guanglei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Mar. 5, v. 7, no. 10 p.5295-5304dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00204a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245014400178300001600322520119100338592002801529650002801557650001201585650001301597650001001610650001401620650002001634650000901654650001601663650001401679650001001693651001101703700002001714700002001734700001901754700002101773773009901794856005501893852000901948655001201957IND4468577420221118225250.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446857742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2011.02456.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza, T.

The RR spectrum presented by cv. Ouro Negro was compared with those of other bean lines harbouring known RR genes when inoculated with nine selected races of Uromyces appendiculatus, the causal agent of bean rust. In addition, all bean lines were screened with molecular markers linked to Ur‐ON in order to identify additional evidence for the presence of alleles for this locus in the screened RR sources. The allelic relationships of Ur‐ON were tested with previously characterized RR genes from lines resistant to at least one race of the pathogen. Allelism tests were also carried out between cv. Ouro Negro and cvs CNC and CSW 643, important RR sources in Brazil harbouring unnamed RR genes. The results showed that the major dominant gene conditioning RR in cv. Ouro Negro is positioned at a locus distinct from those with which it was compared. It is proposed that this gene – or complex gene locus – is unique and be designated Ur‐14.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUromyces appendiculatus 3aalleles 3aallelism 3abeans 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3aloci 3amajor genes 3apathogens 3araces 3aBrazil1 aDessaune, S.

(muntries)  ap. 917-937.  a2019-12-06  aKunzea pomifera F.Muell. (muntries) is a native food crop in Australia that produces spicy apple-flavoured berries. Orchards were established in the 1990s using a variety of wild-collected selections. No published records are currently available of formal plant breeding although the Rivoli Bay selection is the most widely planted. DNA markers are needed to reliably assess genetic diversity and validate plant selections, however genomic resources of K. pomifera are not available. Initially, based on the large MYB gene family, eight MYB gene fragments were amplified and cloned using a degenerate PCR primer strategy. Targeted amplicon sequencing was subsequently used to evaluate diversity of 19 K. pomifera plants and this revealed the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Three genic SSR markers were developed from K. pomifera MYB gene fragments and another three genic SSRs were successfully transferred from K. pulchella (Lindl.) A. S. George. A high transfer rate (75%) was obtained due to selecting SSRs in genic regions (introns or intergenic regions) and using Eucalyptus grandis W.Hill sequences to identify conserved regions. The six SSRs were highly polymorphic with observed heterozygosity (Hₒ) (average Hₒ = 0.63) and polymorphic information content (PIC) (average PIC = 0.54). Using the six genic SSRs, 15 unique genotypes were identified from the K. pomifera collections in two orchards. Importantly, plants in a new diversity panel were genotyped and suspected mis-labeling events confirmed. The genic SSRs and approach developed will benefit marker assisted selection programs by increasing the proportion of genic markers that could be linked to important horticultural traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenetic markers 3aorchards 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amarker-assisted selection 3ahorticulture 3agenotyping 3aEucalyptus grandis 3acase studies 3aintrons 3asmall fruits 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aintergenic DNA 3aKunzea pomifera 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3afood crops 3aplant breeding 3aheterozygosity 3agenomics 3agenetic variation 3aAustralia 0agenes1 aPanakera-Thorpe, LeahC.1 aDelaporte, KateL.1 aCroxford, AdamE.1 aSchultz, CarolynJ.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2018 Mar., v. 65, no. 3 p.917-937dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl49569x0925-98647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-017-0584-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012000169300001200289520145800301592002801759650002101787650002501808650001901833650001401852650001601866650001501882650002301897650001101920650001101931650001901942650001901961650001401980650002101994650004302015650005202058650001202110653002402122653001102146653003202157653001802189653001302207653001402220653001202234700001402246700001502260700001502275700001902290700001402309700001602323700001602339700001402355773012702369856008402496852000902580655001202589IND60591497020221120214435.0180319e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059149702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2018.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Qingling10aLncRNA HOTTIP promotes papillary thyroid carcinoma cell proliferation, invasion and migration by regulating miR-637  ap. 1-9.  aPapillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy. Besides, increasing evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTTIP played a crucial role in cancer pathogenesis. MiR-637-mediated Akt1 was involved in cell growth, invasion and migration in various malignancies. This study was aimed to investigate the potential biological effect and regulatory mechanism of HOTTIP on cell proliferation, invasion and migration in PTC.Expression of HOTTIP, miR-637 and Akt1 were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting in PTC tissues, normal tissues, PTC cells (TPC-1 and HTH83) or non-tumor thyroid cells (Nthy-ori 3-1). Cell proliferation, invasion and migration following HOTTIP knockdown were investigated in PTC cells. The target of HOTTIP was validated by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and pull-down assay. Moreover, a xenograft model was performed.HOTTIP was upregulated in human PTC tissues and PTC cell lines. In addition, HOTTIP knockdown inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro together with in vivo tumorigenesis of PTC cells. Additionally, HOTTIP knockdown downregulated Akt1 expression and suppressed cell proliferation, invasion and migration in PTC cells by regulating miR-637. In contrast, miR-637 inhibitor reversed above-mentioned tendencies caused by HOTTIP knockdown.HOTTIP is a potential oncogene in PTC and may serve as a therapeutic target for malignancies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abioactive properties 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3acell growth 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3ahumans 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3anon-coding RNA 3aoncogenes 3aprecipitin tests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 0aLong non-coding RNA 0aHOTTIP 0aPapillary thyroid carcinoma 0aProliferation 0aInvasion 0aMigration 0amiR-6371 aLiu, Yang1 aFan, Yuxia1 aLiu, Zheng1 aWang, Xiaoming1 aJia, Meng1 aGeng, Zushi1 aZhang, Jing1 aLu, Xiubo0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2018 May, v. 98 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2018.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024003600127040001800163100002000181245009200201300001800293500002000311520182700331592002802158650000902186650001102195650001902206650001702225650001902242650001902261650001302280650001102293650001402304650001402318650001302332650002002345650002302365650001602388700002202404700002102426700002302447773012602470856007902596852000902675655001202684IND60587206320221121192639.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058720632DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.139762doi7 a10.1111/1750-3841.139762chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrelka, John C.10aReverse Stability Kinetics of Meat Pigment Oxidation in Aqueous Extract from Fresh Beef  ap. 2910-2914.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe use of kinetic models is an evolving approach to describing quality changes in foods during processes, including storage. Previous studies indicate that the oxidation rate of myoglobin is accelerated under frozen storage conditions, a phenomenon termed reverse stability. The goal of this study was to develop a model for meat pigment oxidation to incorporate the phenomenon of reverse stability. In this investigation, the model system was an aqueous extract from beef which was stored under a range of temperatures, both unfrozen and frozen. The kinetic analysis showed that in unfrozen solutions, the temperature dependence of oxidation rate followed Arrhenius kinetics. However, under in frozen solutions the rate of oxidation increased with decreasing temperature until reaching a local maximum around −20 °C. The addition of NaCl to the model system increased oxidation rates at all temperatures, even above the initial freezing temperature. This observation suggests that this reaction is dependent on the ionic strength of the solution as well as temperature. The mechanism of this deviant kinetic behavior is not fully understood, but this study shows that the interplay of temperature and composition on the rate of oxidation of meat pigments is complicated and may involve multiple mechanisms. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: A better understanding of the kinetics of quality loss in a meat system allows for a re‐examination of the current recommendations for frozen storage. The deviant kinetic behavior observed in this study indicates that the relationship between quality loss and temperature in a frozen food is not as simple as once thought. Product‐specific recommendations could be implemented in the future that would allow for a decrease in energy consumption without a significant loss of quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3aenergy 3afreezing point 3afrozen foods 3afrozen storage 3aionic strength 3akinetics 3amodels 3amyoglobin 3aoxidation 3apigments 3asodium chloride 3astorage conditions 3atemperature1 aPhinney, David M.1 aWick, Macdonald,1 aHeldman, Dennis R.0 tJournal of food science.g2017 Dec., v. 82, no. 12 p.2910-2914dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl11406x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.139763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011800164300001600282520116600298592002801464650001401492650001301506650001201519650001101531650000901542650001001551650001401561650001601575650000901591651001601600653001001616653001501626653001701641653001401658653001701672653001601689653001501705653001501720653001901735653001401754653001601768700001401784773013001798856008501928852000902013655001202022IND50087719720221118234448.0200514e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008771972DNAL7 a10.1080/03014223.2011.6289972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClark, JM12aA new epizoic laelapid mite from the New Zealand sand scarab Pericoptus truncatus larvae and its isotopic ecology  ap. 187-199.  aA new genus Mumulaelaps (Mesostigmata: Laelapidae: Hypoaspidini) is proposed to hold large, pale, agile, gregarious mites associated with the larvae of the endemic xylophagous sand scarab Pericoptus. Mumulaelaps ammochostos sp. n. is described and illustrated as its type species from P. truncatus (Fabricius) from Southshore, Christchurch, New Zealand. The new genus bears a novel mix of characters shared with Hypoaspis G. Canestrini, 1884 and Coleolaelaps Berlese, 1914 but differs from both by having, in both sexes, stout terminal spines al1 and pl1 on legs II–IV and bearing long or macrosetae of the dorsal series on femora and genua of legs II–IV. Both sexes have leg IV longest and leg II shortest with III never longer than I. The posterior edge of the sternal shield is deeply concave; the post anal seta is longer than the paranals; the hypostomal seta h3 clearly longer than h1 or h2. Stable isotopic (¹³C/¹²C; ¹⁵N/¹⁴N) analysis showed that the new species is not parasitic, but its trophic association with P. truncatus is unclear. It may feed on the hypopodes of Sancassania (=Caloglyphus) or nematodes associated with P. truncatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypoaspis 3aNematoda 3aecology 3alarvae 3alegs 3amites 3anew genus 3anew species 3asand 3aNew Zealand 0aAcari 0aLaelapidae 0aHypoaspidini 0aHypoaspis 0aColeolaelaps 0aMumulaelaps 0aPericoptus 0aparasitism 0astable isotope 0acarbon-13 0anitrogen-151 aHawke, DJ0 tNew Zealand journal of zoology.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 39, no. 3 p.187-199dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:12299x1175-88217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03014223.2011.6289973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245008000208300001600288506007600304520110700380506003701487650001701524650001701541650002801558650001001586650001501596650001101611650001001622650000901632650001901641650001401660650001401674650001101688700001401699700002601713700002001739700002201759700002001781773010301801852000901904856008501913930003301998946001302031655001202044IND4398540120221207133608.0071209e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439854012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-007-9075-82doi7 aPMC26477412pmcid7 a180498362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammond, Shirley 10aChromosome X modulates incidence of testicular germ cell tumors in Ter mice  ap. 832-838.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGerm cell tumor development in humans has been proposed to be part of testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS), which manifests as undescended testes, sterility, hypospadias, and, in extreme cases, as germ cell tumors. Males of the Ter mouse strain show interesting parallels to TDS because they either lack germ cells and are sterile or develop testicular germ cell tumors. We found that these defects in Ter mice are due to mutational inactivation of the Dead-end (Dnd1) gene. Here we report that chromosome X modulates germ cell tumor development in Ter mice. We tested whether the X or the Y chromosome influences tumor incidence. We used chromosome substitution strains to generate two new mouse strains: 129-Ter/Ter that carry either a C57BL/6J (B6)-derived chromosome (Chr) X or Y. We found that Ter/Ter males with B6-Chr X, but not B6-Chr Y, showed a significant shift in propensity from testicular tumor development to sterile testes phenotype. Thus, our studies provide unambiguous evidence that genetic factors from Chr X modulate the incidence of germ cell tumors in mice with inactivated Dnd1.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX chromosome 3aY chromosome 3achromosome substitution 3agenes 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3amales 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphenotype 3atestes1 aZhu, Rui 1 aYoungren, Kirsten K. 1 aLam, Josephine 1 aAnderson, Philip 1 aMatin, Angabin 0 tMammalian genome.g2007 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.832-838dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-007-9075-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01991naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245008700144300001400231500001500245520079800260650001001058650001301068650001801081650001801099650001701117650001601134650001201150650001501162650002501177650002801202650001401230653001701244653001701261653002501278653002001303653001801323653001501341700001801356773007901374852000901453930003301462945002501495946001301520655001201533IND4379559320221120063429.0060412e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437955932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Chairs with 0.125-inch cross pins in 0.723-inch diameter tenons developed over 90 percent of the strength of the chairs with glued tenons, whereas chairs with 0.313-inch diameter pins developed only 80 percent. Thus, results of the tests tend to indicate that chairs constructed with round mortise and tenon joints with small cross pins should provide nearly the strength and durability of comparable chairs constructed with glued joints, and therefore cross-pinning could be considered as an alternative method of joint construction in areas of the world where adhesives are in short supply. 3aPinus 3adiameter 3aQuercus rubra 3ajoints (wood) 3adynamic load 3astatic load 3atesting 3adurability 3astrength (mechanics) 3aLiriodendron tulipifera 3afurniture 0acyclic loads 0aglued joints 0asouthern yellow pine 0awood technology 0across-pinning 0astretchers1 aHaviarowa, E.0 tForest products journal.g2006 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.51-57x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20060925b20061003c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/04/26  aOther US 7aarticle04065naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002200182245012100204300001800325500002400343500001500367506007600382520151800458506003701976650002502013650001102038650001302049650001802062650002602080650000902106650001702115650001002132650001202142650001302154650002102167650002402188650001502212650001402227650001802241650002002259650001602279650001302295650002402308650003902332650003702371650003802408650002802446650004402474650002202518650005102540650003202591650002902623650004202652650002802694650005602722650003102778650002502809650002602834650002102860653001202881700002702893700002102920700002102941700001702962700002102979700001603000700002203016700001603038773011503054852000903169856008103178655001203259IND4451772220221207133619.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445177222DNAL7 a213434232pmid7 aPMC30911062pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.111.1733362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherbak, Nikolai14aThe Pea SAD Short-Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase: Quinone Reduction, Tissue Distribution, and Heterologous Expression  ap. 1839-1850.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe pea (Pisum sativum) tetrameric short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase-like protein (SAD) family consists of at least three highly similar members (SAD-A, -B, and -C). According to mRNA data, environmental stimuli induce SAD expression. The aim of this study was to characterize the SAD proteins by examining their catalytic function, distribution in pea, and induction in different tissues. In enzyme activity assays using a range of potential substrates, the SAD-C enzyme was shown to reduce one- or two-ring-membered quinones lacking long hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails. Immunological assays using a specific antiserum against the protein demonstrated that different tissues and cell types contain small amounts of SAD protein that was predominantly located within epidermal or subepidermal cells and around vascular tissue. Particularly high local concentrations were observed in the protoderm of the seed cotyledonary axis. Two bow-shaped rows of cells in the ovary and the placental surface facing the ovule also exhibited considerable SAD staining. Ultraviolet-B irradiation led to increased staining in epidermal and subepidermal cells of leaves and stems. The different localization patterns of SAD suggest functions both in development and in responses to environmental stimuli. Finally, the pea SAD-C promoter was shown to confer heterologous wound-induced expression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which confirmed that the inducibility of its expression is regulated at the transcriptional level.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aovules 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3aultraviolet radiation 3apeas 3aimmunoassays 3aseeds 3aenzymes 3aquinones 3avascular tissues 3atissue distribution 3astem cells 3aantiserum 3aPisum sativum 3aenzyme activity 3airradiation 3aalcohols 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aFatty Acid Synthasesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNADH, NADPH Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aOvulexmetabolism 2aPeasxenzymologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aPlant Epidermisxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stemsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic. 2aQuinonesxmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aovaries1 aAla-Häivälä, Anneli1 aBrosché, Mikael1 aBöwer, Nathalie1 aStrid, Hilja1 aGittins, John R.1 aGrahn, Elin1 aEriksson, Leif A.1 aStrid, Åke0 tPlant physiology.g2011 Apr., v. 155, no. 4 p.1839-1850dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.1733363Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02850naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001500146245016500161300001800326520148600344650001401830650002301844650001801867650001401885650001701899650002601916650002701942650002701969650005001996650003102046650002402077650005702101700001402158700001502172700001702187700001702204700001802221773008502239852000902324930003302333945002502366946001302391655001202404IND4376021320221120063400.0051114e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437602132DNAL7 a163859902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHasnip, S.10aDetermination of 1,3-dichloropropanol in soy sauce and related products by headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection: interlaboratory study  ap. 1404-1412.  aAn interlaboratory study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a headspace gas chromatography (GC) method for the determination of 1,3-dichloro-propan-2-ol (1,3-DCP) in soy sauce and related products at levels above 5 ng/g. The test portion is mixed with an internal standard (d5-1,3-DCP) and ammonium sulfate in a sealed headspace vial. After achieving equilibrium, the headspace is sampled either by gas-tight syringe or solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed by GC with mass spectrometric detection. 1,3-DCP is detected in the selected-ion mode (monitoring m/z 79 and 81 for 1,3-DCP and m/z 82 for the deuterated internal standard) and quantified by measurement against standards. Test materials comprising soy, dark soy, mushroom soy, and teriyaki sauces, both spiked and naturally contaminated, were sent to 9 laboratories in Europe, Japan, and the United States; of these, 5 used SPME and 4 used syringe headspace analysis. Test portions were spiked at 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 100.0, and 500.0 ng/g. The average recovery for spiked blank samples was 108% (ranging from 96-130%). Based on results for spiked samples (blind pairs at 5, 10, 20, 100, and 500 ng/g) as well as a naturally contaminated sample (split-level pair at 27 and 29 ng/g), the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSD(r)) ranged from 2.9-23.2%. The relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSD(R)) ranged from 20.9-35.3%, and HorRat values of between 1.0 and 1.6 were obtained. 3asoy sauce 3aheadspace analysis 3achlorophenols 3adeuterium 3alaboratories 3acollaborative testing 2aCalibrationxstandards 2aFood Analysisxmethods 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSoy Foodsxanalysis 2aalpha-Chlorohydrinxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis.1 aCrews, C.1 aPotter, N.1 aBrereton, P.1 aDiserens, H.1 aOberson, J.M.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2005 , v. 88, no. 5 p.1404-1412x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20051206b20060102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/11/21  aOther US 7aarticle02533naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001800154245015700172300001500329500002400344520142400368650002501792650002101817650002001838650001201858650001001870650001601880650001501896650001601911650001001927650001201937650001001949700001701959773012901976852000902105856005702114655001202171IND4451803820221120063315.0110401e199601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445180382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1996.tb00768.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerguelen, V.10aIncreased host acceptance in experienced females of the parasitoid Brachymeria intermedia: which types of oviposition behaviour contribute to experience  ap. 95-103.  aIncludes references  aBrachymeria intermedia (Nees) (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae) is a solitary endoparasitoid of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae). The probability that a wasp will parasitise this host is increased if she had a previous oviposition experience. We investigated which types of pre-oviposition and oviposition behaviour induced this change by comparing the acceptance behaviour of wasps with zero to five oviposition experiences as well as wasps with various partial host handling experiences (from no contact with a host to one complete oviposition sequence). The percentage of females accepting the host increased gradually with both the number of previous oviposition experiences and the amount of handling of a single host. Furthermore, the naive females were less likely (44%) to walk to the host than females with a variety of experiences (72-100%). A single antennal contact with the host was sufficient to increase the probability of walking to the host. Additional handling and additional oviposition experiences further elevated the propensity to oviposit. Thus, the modification of the acceptance behaviour through experience was essentially a gradual process in which antennal contact with a pupa was a major element. It is suggested that naive wasps learned the host odour when they first antennated a pupa. As a result, they were attracted to the host odour in subsequent encounters. 3aBrachymeria tibialis 3aLymantria dispar 3aendoparasitoids 3afemales 3aodors 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3aprobability 3apupae 3awalking 3awasps1 aCardé, R.T.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1996 Jan., v. 78, no. 1 p.95-103dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw26097x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1996.tb00768.x 7aarticle02876naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161072001700178072001700195100002100212245016900233300001600402500001500418520110000433650001701533650001701550650003001567650001701597650002601614650001701640650002101657650001201678650002901690650004901719650001601768650003201784650006301816650004701879650003201926653001001958653002101968653003201989700001602021700001502037700001702052700001502069773006602084852000902150856008202159930003302241945002502274946001102299655001202310IND4371723020221120055438.0050624e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437172302DNAL7 a158299852pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68006702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

As megagametophytes matured, the number of nuclei per cell rose, resulting in syncytial storage cells. Studies carried out on trees in France and Canada confirmed that such previously unreported, free nuclear cells were a normal part of late megagametophyte development. Unfertilized megagametophytes showed that some binucleate cells before degeneration resulted in empty seed. Insect parasitism prevented megagametophyte abortion in unfertilized ovules. Oviposition by a torymid chalcid wasp (Megastigmus spermotrophus Wachtl) early in megagametophyte development resulted in normal megagametophyte development. Around the time of plant egg maturation, binucleate and trinucleate cells were observed. As megagametophytes matured, multinucleate mature storage cells rich in proteins, lipids and starch were formed. The insect was able to induce identical nuclear behaviour in infested, unfertilized megagametophytes, as that of uninfested, fertilized megagametophytes. 3ainsect pests 3aforest trees 3aMegastigmus spermotrophus 3aseed anatomy 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3aforest pests 3aseed development 2aAnimals 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aFlowersxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aGermination 2aHistocytochemistryxmethods 2aPseudotsugaxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aSeedsxgrowth & developmentxparasitology. 2aWaspsxgrowth & development 0aseeds 0amegagametophytes 0amultinucleate storage cells1 aRouault, G.1 aWagner, R.1 aChiwocha, S.1 aRoques, A.0 tHeredity.g2005 June, v. 94, no. 6 p.616-622x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68006703Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03022naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001800188245010500206300001800311500002400329500001500353520140900368650002201777650001301799650002301812650001501835650002201850650002301872650002001895650005501915650002801970650004101998650002302039650005302062650002402115653001902139700001402158700001302172700001602185700001802201700001402219773009002233852000902323856009102332930003302423945002502456946001102481655001202492IND4401701420221120043005.0080219e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440170142DNAL7 a179280162pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.08.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS2001 aTatsuzawa, F.10aTriacylated cyanidin 3-(3X-glucosylsambubioside)-5-glucosides from the flowers of Malcolmia maritima  ap. 1029-1036.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThree acylated cyanidin 3-(3x-glucosylsambubioside)-5-glucosides (1-3) and one non-acylated cyanidin 3-(3x-glucosylsambubioside)-5-glucoside (4) were isolated from the purple-violet or violet flowers and purple stems of Malcolmia maritima (L.)

Here, we estimated the heritability of sperm competition success in the promiscuous bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini. Sperm competition success was measured with the sterile male technique as the proportion of eggs fertilised by the second of three males mated with a single female. Sperm competition success responded significantly to selection. The heritability estimated from the response to five generations of selection was 0.13. We also estimated the effect of inbreeding on sperm competition success. Males produced by sib-mating (F=0.25) had a significantly lower sperm competition success than outbred males. The estimated coefficient of inbreeding depression was 0.53. Such high inbreeding depression together with moderately low heritability is consistent with the view that sperm competitive ability is under strong directional selection and strongly influences the reproductive success of males. 3aRhizoglyphus robini 3ainsect pests 3ainbreeding 3aheritability 3asperm competition 3asexual selection 3ainbreeding depression 2aAcaridaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aInbreeding 2aMale 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology1 aKeller, L.1 aRadwan, J.0 tHeredity.g2005 June, v. 94, no. 6 p.577-581x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68006493Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03651naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245011300178300001600291500002400307520182700331650002202158650002802180650001702208650002902225650001602254650001902270650002002289650001802309650001602327650001102343650001802354650001402372650001202386650002302398650001902421650002802440650002402468650001002492650001002502650002202512650001902534650002802553650001702581650005802598700002302656700002302679700001902702700002602721700001902747700002502766700002102791700002502812773011302837852000902950856007802959655001203037IND4448173620221120034238.0110126e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444817362DNAL7 a209526272pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq3002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoulkes, M. John10aRaising yield potential of wheat. III. Optimizing partitioning to grain while maintaining lodging resistance  ap. 469-486.  aIncludes references  aA substantial increase in grain yield potential is required, along with better use of water and fertilizer, to ensure food security and environmental protection in future decades. For improvements in photosynthetic capacity to result in additional wheat yield, extra assimilates must be partitioned to developing spikes and grains and/or potential grain weight increased to accommodate the extra assimilates. At the same time, improvement in dry matter partitioning to spikes should ensure that it does not increase stem or root lodging. It is therefore crucial that improvements in structural and reproductive aspects of growth accompany increases in photosynthesis to enhance the net agronomic benefits of genetic modifications. In this article, six complementary approaches are proposed, namely: (i) optimizing developmental pattern to maximize spike fertility and grain number, (ii) optimizing spike growth to maximize grain number and dry matter harvest index, (iii) improving spike fertility through desensitizing floret abortion to environmental cues, (iv) improving potential grain size and grain filling, and (v) improving lodging resistance. Since many of the traits tackled in these approaches interact strongly, an integrative modelling approach is also proposed, to (vi) identify any trade-offs between key traits, hence to define target ideotypes in quantitative terms. The potential for genetic dissection of key traits via quantitative trait loci analysis is discussed for the efficient deployment of existing variation in breeding programmes. These proposals should maximize returns in food production from investments in increased crop biomass by increasing spike fertility, grain number per unit area and harvest index whilst optimizing the trade-offs with potential grain weight and lodging resistance. 3abreed differences 3adry matter partitioning 3aenergy crops 3aenvironmental protection 3afertilizers 3afilling period 3afood production 3afood security 3agrain yield 3agrains 3aharvest index 3aideotypes 3alodging 3alodging resistance 3aphotosynthesis 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3aroots 3astems 2aBreedingxmethods 2aPhotosynthesis 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aReproduction 2aTriticumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology.1 aSlafer, Gustavo A.1 aDavies, William J.1 aBerry, Pete.M.1 aSylvester-Bradley, R.1 aMartre, Pierre1 aCalderini, Daniel F.1 aGriffiths, Simon1 aReynolds, Matthew P.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 Jan., v. 62, no. 2 p.469-486dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq3003Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03159naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002200178245020200200300001800402500002400420506007600444520110700520506003701627650001901664650001201683650004101695650001801736650003101754650002301785650001501808650002401823650001101847650002401858650000901882650004001891650002401931650002801955650002501983650001102008650004802019650001602067650001002083650002102093650001202114650005102126650004302177700002702220700002502247700001902272700002302291700002102314700002002335773010402355852000902459856007702468655001202545IND4407487120221207131211.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440748712DNAL7 a183981082pmid7 aPMC24536632pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-00552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoes, Stijntje D.10aAssessment of Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity and Cardiac Diastolic Function in Subjects With and Without the Metabolic Syndrome: HDL cholesterol is independently associated with cardiovascular function  ap. 1442-1444.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE:--To evaluate the influence of lipid and glucose metabolism in the metabolic syndrome on aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and left ventricular (LV) diastolic function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Aortic PWV and LV diastolic function were assessed using MRI in 16 subjects with the metabolic syndrome and 16 subjects without the metabolic syndrome matched for age, waist circumference, and blood pressure. The groups were compared using the unpaired t test or Mann-Whitney U test, and linear regression analysis was applied. RESULTS:--Aortic PWV was increased and LV diastolic function was decreased in subjects with compared with those without the metabolic syndrome. HDL cholesterol was independently associated with aortic PWV (R = -0.470, P < 0.01) and LV diastolic function (R = -0.421, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS:--Increased aortic PWV and decreased LV diastolic function is observed in subjects with the metabolic syndrome, regardless of blood pressure. Moreover, HDL cholesterol is independently associated with aortic PWV and LV diastolic function.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood pressure 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alinear models 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolism 3aregression analysis 3at-test 3awaist circumference 2aAged 2aAortaxphysiologyxphysiopathology. 2aBlood Flow Velocity 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aDiastolexphysiology 2aHumans 2aMetabolic Syndromexbloodxphysiopathology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aPulse 2aReference Values 2aSystole 2aVentricular Dysfunction, Leftxphysiopathology 2aVentricular Function, Leftxphysiology1 aAlizadeh Dehnavi, Reza1 aWestenberg, Jos J.M.1 aLamb, Hildo J.1 aMertens, Bart J.A.1 aTamsma, Jouke T.1 ade Roos, Albert0 tDiabetes care.g2008 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.1442-1444dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-00553Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03779naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161072001700178072001700195100001500212245015700227300001600384500001500400520163300415650002702048650001702075650002502092650000902117650001102126650001402137650001602151650002702167650001902194650001002213650001902223650001902242650002202261650002702283650002002310650001202330650001202342650002102354650001102375650001902386650001802405650002202423650002502445650001302470650001402483650003702497650002702534650003602561651001102597651001102608653002002619653001502639653001402654700001602668700001702684700001802701700001602719700002902735700001902764773006602783852000902849856008202858930003302940945002502973946001102998655001203009IND4371723320221117184331.0050624e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437172332DNAL7 a159402742pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68006732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZamoum, T.10aDoes insecticide resistance alone account for the low genetic variability of asexually reproducing populations of the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae?  ap. 630-639.  a2019-12-04  aThe typical life cycle of aphids includes several parthenogenetic generations and a single sexual generation (cyclical parthenogenesis), but some species or populations are totally asexual (obligate parthenogenesis). Genetic variability is generally low in these asexually reproducing populations, that is, few genotypes are spread over large geographic areas. Both genetic drift and natural selection are often invoked to account for this low genetic variability. The peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae, which encompasses both cyclical and obligate parthenogens, has developed several insecticide resistance mechanisms as a consequence of intense insecticide use since the 1950s. We collected asexually reproducing M. persicae from oilseed rape and examined genetic variability at eight microsatellite loci and three insecticide resistance genes to determine whether their genetic structure was driven by drift and/or selection. We identified only 16 multilocus microsatellite genotypes among 255 individuals. One clone, which combined two insecticide resistance mechanisms, was frequently detected in all populations whatever their location over a large geographical area (the northern half of France). These unexpected findings suggest that drift is not the unique cause of this low variability. Instead, the intensification of both insecticide treatments and oilseed rape cultivation may have favored a few genotypes. Thus, we propose that selective pressures resulting from human activities have considerably modified the genetic structure of M. persicae populations in northern France in a relatively short period of time. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ainsect pests 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aloci 3acanola 3aevolution 3ahost plants 3ageographical variation 3aMyzus persicae 3agenes 3agene frequency 3aBrassica napus 3agenetic variation 3ainsecticide resistance 3agenetic markers 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Drift 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aGeography 2aInsecticide Resistancexgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aReproduction, Asexualxgenetics 3aFrance 0aFrance 0amiccroevolution 0aAphidoidea 0aesterases1 aSimon, J.C.1 aCrochard, D.1 aBallanger, Y.1 aLapchin, L.1 aVanlerberghe-Masutti, F.1 aGuillemaud, T.0 tHeredity.g2005 June, v. 94, no. 6 p.630-639x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68006733Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03364naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161100001900178245012600197300001400323500001500337520172900352650002002081650001502101650001502116650002202131650002002153650002502173650001002198650002002208650002802228650002802256650002602284650002302310650003302333650001102366650001302377650001502390650002502405650002102430653001702451653001402468653001402482653001302496700001702509700001802526700001802544773006402562852000902626856008202635930003302717945002502750946001102775655001202786IND4373301520221117180337.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437330152DNAL7 a158299842pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68006762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMcCauley, D.E.10aEvidence for paternal transmission and heteroplasmy in the mitochondrial genome of Silene vulgaris, a gynodioecious plant  ap. 50-58.  a2019-12-04  aGynodioecy refers to the co-occurrence of females and hermaphrodites in the same population. In many gynodioecious plants, sex is determined by an epistatic interaction between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, resulting in intragenomic evolutionary conflict, should the mitochondrial genome be maternally inherited. While maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome is common in angiosperms, few gynodioecious species have been studied. Here, the inheritance of the mitochondrial genes atpA and coxI was studied in 318 Silene vulgaris individuals distributed among 23 crosses. While maternal inheritance was indicated in 96% of the individuals studied, one or more individuals from each of four sib groups displayed a genotype that was identical to the father, or that did not match either parent. Given evidence that inheritance is not strictly maternal, it was hypothesized that some individuals could carry a mixture of maternally and paternally derived copies of the mitochondrial genome, a condition known as heteroplasmy. Since heteroplasmy might be difficult to detect should multiple versions of the mitochondrial genome co-occur in highly unequal copy number, a method was devised to amplify low-copy number forms of atpA differentially. Evidence for heteroplasmy was found in 23 of the 99 individuals studied, including cases in which the otherwise cryptic form of atpA matched the paternal genotype. The distribution of shared nucleotide sequence polymorphism among atpA haplotypes and the results of a population survey of the joint distribution of atpA and coxI haplotypes across individuals supports the hypothesis that heteroplasmy facilitates formation of novel mitochondrial genotypes by recombination. 3amaternal effect 3ahaplotypes 3agynodioecy 3amitochondrial DNA 3apaternal effect 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3aSilene vulgaris 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3agenetic recombination 2aDNA, Mitochondrial 2aDisorders of Sex Development 2aGenome 2aGenotype 2aHaplotypes 2aInheritance Patterns 2aSilenexgenetics 0aheteroplasmy 0aatpA gene 0acoxI gene 0agenotype1 aBailey, M.F.1 aSherman, N.A.1 aDarnell, M.Z.0 tHeredity.g2005 July, v. 95, no. 1 p.50-58x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68006763Available from publisher's Web site  a20070531b20070602c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/08/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02279naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011500144300001600259520084600275650001101121650001201132650000901144650001201153650002201165650002001187650001001207650001201217650001101229650002401240650004901264650003401313650001101347650001501358650001101373650002201384650000901406650000901415650003401424650001201458650002401470653001901494653001501513653001101528700001401539700001501553700001801568773009801586852000901684939003301693946001101726655001201737IND9302829020221117180340.0930510e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930282902DNAL7 a84622812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDietz, E.C.10aInhibition of epoxide hydrolase from human, monkey, bovine, rabbit and murine liver by trans-3-phenylglycidols  ap. 309-314.  a1. trans-3-Phenylglycidols were potent inhibitors of cytosolic epoxide hydrolases in all species tested. 2.

The role of human activities (ie insecticide treatments or water storage practices) and environmental factors (ie rainfall) in shaping mosquito differentiation are discussed. 3aloci 3abiochemical polymorphism 3aisozymes 3aAedes aegypti 3aurban areas 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation structure 2aAedesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aCities 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aHumans 2aIsoenzymesxgenetics 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSevere Denguexprevention & control 3aCambodia 0aCambodia 0aCulicidae1 aChantha, N.1 aReynes, J.M.1 aFailloux, A.B.0 tHeredity.g2005 Aug., v. 95, no. 2 p.144-147x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68006983Available from publisher's Web site  a20050831b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02069naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002000161245004100181300001400222500001500236520091000251650002801161650001201189650002001201650001801221650001701239650002001256650002201276650001201298650002101310650002401331650002201355650002701377651001801404653002901422700001301451773007901464852000901543930003301552945002501585946001301610655001201623IND4379019420221117161132.0060323e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437901942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

They were also asked to rate their educational preferences from a supplied list of topics. An initial survey was mailed out in 2001 and a more intensive follow-up survey was mailed out to 1,055 licensed loggers in 2002. The survey was directed toward owners since West Virginia logging businesses must be licensed by law. In 2002, the total response rate was 10.2 percent with 6.2 percent submitting completed usable surveys. Results indicated that independent loggers of West Virginia averaged 47.8 years old with an average of 17.8 years in the logging business. The firm size was between 1 and 80 employees with an average of 8 employees. A firm of average size harvested 10 tracts with a weekly production of 51.8 thousand board feet (MBF) and a unit cost of $116.6/MBF. 3asilvicultural practices 3alogging 3aindustry trends 3aprofitability 3ajob training 3ahuman resources 3alogging equipment 3asurveys 3acareer education 3asawmilling industry 3atimber production 3aprofessional education 3aWest Virginia 0aforest products industry1 aWang, J.0 tForest products journal.g2006 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.19-24x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle03315naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161100001500178245011300193300001600306520160200322650002101924650001601945650002701961650002801988650004302016650001802059650000902077650001802086650001202104650003002116650001602146650002102162650001802183650001102201650001302212650002602225650004202251650002802293650000902321650001402330700001402344700001502358700001602373700001402389700001402403700001802417700001502435700001302450700001202463773006602475852000902541856008202550930003302632945002502665946001102690655001202701IND4373542620221123040700.0050824e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437354262DNAL7 a159312392pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68007012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHillel, J.10aEvidence for a major gene affecting the transition from normoglycaemia to hyperglycaemia in Psammomys obesus  ap. 158-165.  aWe investigated the mode of inheritance of nutritionally induced diabetes in the desert gerbil Psammomys obesus (sand rat), following transfer from low-energy (LE) to high-energy (HE) diet which induces hyperglycaemia. Psammomys selected for high or low blood glucose level were used as two parental lines. A first backcross generation (BC1) was formed by crossing F1 males with females of the diabetes-prone line. The resulting 232 BC1 progeny were assessed for blood glucose. All progeny were weaned at 3 weeks of age (week 0), and their weekly assessment of blood glucose levels proceeded until week 9 after weaning, with all progeny maintained on HE diet. At weeks 1 to 9 post weaning, a clear bimodal distribution statistically different from unimodal distribution of blood glucose was observed, normoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic at a 1:1 ratio. This ratio is expected at the first backcross generation for traits controlled by a single dominant gene. From week 0 (prior to the transfer to HE diet) till week 8, the hyperglycaemic individuals were significantly heavier (4 -17%) than the normoglycaemic ones. The bimodal blood glucose distribution in BC1 generation, with about equal frequencies in each mode, strongly suggests that a single major gene affects the transition from normo- to hyperglycaemia. The wide range of blood glucose values among the hyperglycaemic individuals (180 to 500 mg/dl) indicates that several genes and environmental factors influence the extent of hyperglycaemia. The diabetes-resistant allele appears to be dominant; the estimate for dominance ratio is 0.97. 3aPsammomys obesus 3amajor genes 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aquantitative trait loci 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3ahyperglycemia 3adiet 3ablood glucose 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Weight 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aGerbillinaexgenetics 2aGlycemic Indexxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHyperglycemiaxgenetics 2aMale 2aPhenotype1 aGefel, D.1 aKalman, R.1 aBen-Ari, G.1 aDavid, L.1 aOrion, O.1 aFeldman, M.W.1 aBar-On, H.1 aBlum, S.1 aRaz, I.0 tHeredity.g2005 Aug., v. 95, no. 2 p.158-165x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68007013Available from publisher's Web site  a20050901b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/08/31  aNon-US 7aarticle04161naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002700178245014600205300001800351500002400369506007600393520186000469506003702329650001502366650001802381650001202399650001702411650001202428650004002440650004302480650001302523650001502536650001702551650001602568650001002584650000902594650001502603650004502618650001902663650004402682650002602726650003702752650003302789650001102822650001102833650003702844650001102881650006702892650007802959650002503037650000903062650003103071650001603102651001803118700001803136700002403154700001603178700002403194700002503218700001803243773010403261852000903365856007703374655001203451IND4407484320221207121504.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440748432DNAL7 a183643922pmid7 aPMC24536492pmcid7 a10.2337/dc07-21372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergenstal, Richard M.10aAdjust to Target in Type 2 Diabetes: Comparison of a simple algorithm with carbohydrate counting for adjustment of mealtime insulin glulisine  ap. 1305-1310.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE:--Carbohydrate counting is an effective approach to mealtime insulin adjustment in type 1 diabetes but has not been rigorously assessed in type 2 diabetes. We sought to compare an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio with a simple algorithm for adjusting the dose of prandial insulin glusiline. RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODS--This 24-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled study compared two algorithms for adjusting mealtime (glulisine) insulin along with a standard algorithm for adjusting background (glargine) insulin in 273 intent-to-treat patients with type 2 diabetes. Glulisine and glargine were adjusted weekly in both groups based on self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) results from the previous week. The simple algorithm group was provided set doses of glulisine to take before each meal. The carbohydrate counting (carb count) group was provided an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio to use for each meal and adjusted their glulisine dose based on the amount of carbohydrate consumed. RESULTS:--A1C levels at week 24 were 6.70% (simple algorithm) and 6.54% (carb count). The respective mean A1C changes from baseline to 24 weeks were -1.46 and -1.59% (P = 0.24). A1C <7.0% was achieved by 73.2% (simple algorithm) and 69.2% (carb count) (P = 0.70) of subjects; respective values for A1C <6.5% were 44.3 and 49.5% (P = 0.28). The total daily dose of insulin was lower, and there was a trend toward less weight gain in carb count group patients. Severe hypoglycemia rates were low and equal in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS:--Weekly basal-bolus insulin adjustments based on premeal and bedtime glucose patterns resulted in significant reductions in A1C. Having two effective approaches to delivering and adjusting rapid-acting mealtime insulin may increase physicians' and patients' willingness to advance therapy to a basal-bolus insulin regimen.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalgorithms 3ablood glucose 3aglucose 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aphysicians 3atherapeutics 3aweight gain 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAlgorithms 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aRacial Groups. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapy 2aDietary Carbohydrates 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aEating 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aInsulinxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxtherapeutic use. 2aInsulin, Long-Acting 2aMale 2aMetforminxtherapeutic use 2aMiddle Aged 0aUnited States1 aJohnson, Mary1 aPowers, Margaret A.1 aWynne, Alan1 aVlajnic, Aleksandra1 aHollander, Priscilla1 aRendell, Marc0 tDiabetes care.g2008 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.1305-1310dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc07-21373Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02437naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245008000160300001600240500001500256520112400271650001601395650002301411650001201434650000901446650001301455650001201468650002301480650003101503650001601534650002001550650001601570650001801586650002101604650001801625650002201643650001201665653002401677653002401701653001701725653001401742700001301756773008201769852000901851930003301860945002501893946001301918655001201931IND4377013020221123024133.0060106e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437701302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Measurements were done by head-space (HS) and gas chromatographic mass spectrometric methods. It was found that pellets, under certain conditions, emit high levels of VOCs, especially volatile aldehydes but that the drying temperatures of sawdust and self-heating of stored pellets affect the composition of the emitted compounds. In pellets with a pungent smell, high levels of hexanal and pentanal together with minor amounts of other aldehydes were detected. A chemical characterization of sawdust and pellets was also done. During storage the amount of lipids was reduced due to oxidation. Spruce sawdust contained considerably lower amounts of fatty and resin acids than pine. Thus pellets made from stored sawdust might generate fewer VOCs than pellets made from fresh sawdust. Pellets made from spruce sawdust emit fewer VOCs than pellets made from pine. It was also concluded that the lipid content of sawdust could be used as a maturation indicator for sawdust. 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography 3astorage 3awood 3afurfural 3asawdust 3adrying temperature 3avolatile organic compounds 3aPicea abies 3awood technology 3aresin acids 3awood shavings 3aPinus sylvestris 3agas emissions 3amass spectrometry 3apellets 0aspontaneous heating 0ahead space analysis 0afuel pellets 0aaldehydes1 aGref, R.0 tForest products journal.g2005 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.132-135x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20060309b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/02/28  aOther US 7aarticle01959naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245009100161300001600252520091300268650003001181650001701211650001301228650001201241650002801253650002701281650001901308651001801327653003901345653002301384700001601407773008201423852000901505930003301514945002501547946001301572655001201585IND4377015220221123024120.0060106e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437701522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The research objectives were to ascertain children's playground equipment manufacturer attitudes and preferences for using treated wood relative to alternative fabrication materials and to gauge their level of awareness regarding treated wood. The sample frame for the study was a census of all 188 U.S. playground equipment manufacturers. Minimization of chemicals and health risks are the most important criteria to respondents when considering the materials they use to manufacture children's playground equipment. Although multiple materials can be used in outdoor playground equipment fabrication, 48 percent of respondents use treated wood, 67 percent use plastic, and 56 percent use steel. 3apreservative treated wood 3ahuman health 3achildren 3asurveys 3aperceptions (cognitive) 3aattitudes and opinions 3ahealth hazards 3aUnited States 0aplayground equipment manufacturers 0atermite resistance1 aShupe, T.F.0 tForest products journal.g2005 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.190-193x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20060309b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/02/28  aOther US 7aarticle02911naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002300168245012700191300001600318500002400334520139500358650001201753650001801765650001201783650002001795650001801815650001001833650002301843650001801866650003001884650002601914650001601940650001201956650002101968650003701989650001102026650003702037650001502074650004402089650002102133650004202154650004302196700002002239773009702259852000902356856005202365655001202417IND4437723620221122235637.0100528e20100715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443772362DNAL7 a204001882pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagnusson, Kerstin14aThe importance of uptake from food for the bioaccumulation of PCB and PBDE in the marine planktonic copepod Acartia clausi  ap. 374-380.  aIncludes references  aThe accumulation of ¹⁴C-labelled PCB 31, PCB 101, PCB 153 and PBDE 99 was investigated at the two lowest trophic levels of the pelagic food web. Accumulation was measured in the small phytoplankter Thalassiosira weissflogii (Coscinodiscophyceae: Thalassiosirales) and in the neritic zooplankter Acartia clausi (Copepoda: Calanoida) exposed to the substance either only via water or through ingestion of contaminated T. weissflogii. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for all four compounds were significantly higher in A. clausi feeding on contaminated phytoplankton than in animals exposed only via water. The logBAF for the PCBs increased linearly with the octanol-water partitioning coefficients (log K OW) in both the algae and the copepods, but with steeper slopes for feeding than non-feeding animals. Reported values for K OW for PBDEs vary by almost an order of magnitude and it was therefore not meaningful to calculate a logBAF−log K OW ratio for PBDE 99. It is clear that the nutritional status of the zooplankton affects the uptake of the compounds and that the bioaccumulation cannot be modelled as a passive partitioning between the organisms and the surrounding water. Small copepods are typical of coastal waters and point sources (both temporal and spatial) may be the rule for HOC releases into the sea. Thus, the pathways shown in this study are important and realistic. 3aAcartia 3aThalassiosira 3aanimals 3abioaccumulation 3acoastal water 3afoods 3anutritional status 3aphytoplankton 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3atrophic relationships 3azooplankton 2aAnimals 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCopepodaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEating 2aEnvironmental Exposurexanalysis 2aFood Chain 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethersxmetabolism 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism1 aTiselius, Peter0 tAquatic toxicology.g2010 July 15, v. 98, no. 4 p.374-380dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.03.009 7aarticle03313naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002300161245011500184300001600299500001500315520185900330650001202189650001502201650002202216650001502238650001402253650001102267650003502278650001702313650002402330650001602354650002402370650002302394650002302417650002502440650002002465651001902485651001502504653002902519653002002548700001802568700001702586700001802603773008202621852000902703930003302712945002502745946001302770655001202783IND4377012620221122235718.0060106e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437701262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A normalized quadratic per-unit-of-capital profit function underlies the analysis. The statistical model consists of a system of four equations: two of which are per-unit-of-capital aggregate output supply equations for lumber and chips, and two are per-unit-of-capital input demand equations for labor and sawlogs. Capital is held fixed in the short run and used to deflate the dependent variables. Constrained nonlinear maximum likelihood estimation is used to derive parameter estimates. Both price and technology/log quality elasticity estimates are also calculated. A principal contribution of this study is the explicit modeling of technological change. Technology is represented by aggregate industry technology variables, and measures of log quality are also explicitly incorporated into the model. Major findings of this analysis include: (1) aggregate Washington sawmill industry response is in the inelastic range with respect to all price and technology/log quality elasticities measures; (2) sawlogs and labor are complements in the production process; (3) chips and lumber are complementary outputs; (4) chip output is more responsive to changes in the technology/log quality variables than price changes; (5) technological advance, in particular the increasing importance of chip recovery technology, has affected labor demand positively; (6) technological change has been output enhancing; and (7) declining wood quality has reduced both the output of lumber products and reduced sawlog demand while increasing the demand for labor needed for product recovery. An important implication of these results is to cast doubt on the contention of some that sawmill jobs have been declining due to mechanization and improved efficiency in Washington state. 3ahistory 3aestimation 3aeconomic analysis 3aemployment 3aequations 3aprices 3aeconomic outlook and situation 3awood quality 3asawmilling industry 3alabor force 3ademand elasticities 3aforestry equipment 3aeconometric models 3atechnological change 3awood processing 3aPacific States 0aWashington 0aforest products industry 0awood technology1 aBlatner, K.A.1 aWeiner, E.J.1 aCarroll, M.S.0 tForest products journal.g2005 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.105-112x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20060228b20060302c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/02/28  aOther US 7aarticle03535naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245016600199300001600365500002400381506007600405520171700481506003702198650001702235650002502252650002602277650001302303650001102316650001102327650002102338650001902359650002202378650000902400650002502409650002602434650001302460650002302473650002502496650006502521650001902586650005202605700002202657700002202679700001902701700002402720700001902744773009902763852000902862856007802871856003202949655001202981IND4387297920221207134721.0070128e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438729792DNAL7 a172045412pmid7 aPMC28029932pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl2532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhsumi, Akihiro12aA Model Explaining Genotypic and Ontogenetic Variation of Leaf Photosynthetic Rate in Rice (Oryza sativa) Based on Leaf Nitrogen Content and Stomatal Conductance  ap. 265-273.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: Identification of physiological traits associated with leaf photosynthetic rate (Pn) is important for improving potential productivity of rice (Oryza sativa). The objectives of this study were to develop a model which can explain genotypic variation and ontogenetic change of Pn in rice under optimal conditions as a function of leaf nitrogen content per unit area (N) and stomatal conductance (gs), and to quantify the effects of interaction between N and gs on the variation of Pn. METHODS: Pn, N and gs were measured at different developmental stages for the topmost fully expanded leaves in ten rice genotypes with diverse backgrounds grown in pots (2002) and in the field (2001 and 2002). A model of Pn that accounts for carboxylation and CO₂ diffusion processes, and assumes that the ratio of internal conductance to gs is constant, was constructed, and its goodness of fit was examined. KEY RESULTS: Considerable genotypic differences in Pn were evident for rice throughout development in both the pot and field experiments. The genotypic variation of Pn was correlated with that of gs at a given stage, and the change of Pn with plant development was closely related to the change of N. The variation of gs among genotypes was independent of that of N. The model explained well the variation in Pn of the ten genotypes grown under different conditions at different developmental stages. CONCLUSIONS: The response of Pn to increased N differs with gs, and the increase in Pn of genotypes with low gs is smaller than that of genotypes with high gs. Therefore, simultaneous improvements of these two traits are essential for an effective breeding of rice genotypes with increased Pn.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3adevelopmental stages 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3aleaves 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant development 3arice 3astomatal conductance 2aElectric Conductivity 2aGenotype 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOryzaxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aHamasaki, Akihiro1 aNakagawa, Hiroshi1 aYoshida, Hiroe1 aShiraiwa, Tatsuhiko1 aHorie, Takeshi0 tAnnals of botany.g2007 Feb., v. 99, no. 2 p.265-273dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcl2533Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle03192naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245008200137300001800219500002800237520200300265650001302268650001902281650001602300650002002316650001602336650002202352650001202374650002302386650001402409650002402423650001502447650003002462650002802492650002102520650001002541700002202551700001802573700002002591700002102611773010402632852000902736946001302745655001202758IND4407486820221122230701.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440748682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutchison, Samantha K.10aRetinol-Binding Protein 4 and Insulin Resistance in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome  ap. 1427-1432.  aPublisher supplied data  aOBJECTIVE:--Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an insulin-resistant state with insulin resistance being an established therapeutic target; however, measurement of insulin resistance remains challenging. We aimed to 1) determine serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) levels (purported to reflect insulin resistance) in women with PCOS and control subjects, 2) examine the relationship of RBP4 to conventional markers of insulin resistance, and 3) examine RBP4 changes with interventions modulating insulin resistance in overweight women with PCOS. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--At baseline, 38 overweight women (BMI >27 kg/m²) with PCOS and 17 weight-matched control subjects were compared. Women with PCOS were then randomly assigned to 6 months of a higher-dose oral contraceptive pill (OCP) (35 μg ethinyl estradiol/2 mg cyproterone acetate) or metformin (1 g b.i.d.). Outcome measures were insulin resistance (total insulin area under the curve) on an oral glucose tolerance test, RBP4, and metabolic/inflammatory markers. RESULTS:--Overweight women with PCOS were more insulin resistant than control subjects, yet RBP4 levels were not different in women with PCOS versus those in control subjects (35.4 ± 4.3 vs. 28.9 ± 3.1 μg/ml, P = 0.36). RBP4 correlated with cholesterol and triglycerides but not with insulin resistance. Metformin improved insulin resistance by 35%, whereas the OCP worsened insulin resistance by 33%. However, RBP4 increased nonsignificantly in both groups (43.7 ± 6.3 vs. 42.6 ± 5.5 μg/ml, P = 0.92). CONCLUSIONS:--Overweight women with PCOS were more insulin resistant than control subjects, but this finding was not reflected by RBP4 levels. RBP4 correlated with lipid levels but not with insulin resistance markers. RBP4 levels did not change when insulin resistance was reduced by metformin or increased by the OCP. These data suggest that RBP4 is not a useful marker of insulin resistance in PCOS but may reflect other metabolic features of this condition. 3aacetates 3aanimal ovaries 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3aglucose tolerance 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3ametformin 3aoral contraceptives 3aoverweight 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3aretinol-binding protein 3atriacylglycerols 3awomen1 aHarrison, Cheryce1 aStepto, Nigel1 aMeyer, Caroline1 aTeede, Helena J.0 tDiabetes care.g2008 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.1427-1432dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02901naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001400161245011400175300001600289520141000305650001001715650001401725650001001739650001601749650002401765650001901789650000901808650001601817650001601833650002401849650001201873650001901885650002501904650001101929650002001940650003101960650002601991650003802017650000902055650001402064650002402078651001102102651001202113653002002125773006602145852000902211856008202220930003302302945001302335946001102348655001202359IND2332172720221122230546.0030424e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233217272DNAL7 a119201372pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68000422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyman, T.14aThe willow bud galler Euura mucronata Hartig (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae): one polyphage or many monophages?  ap. 288-295.  aThe nematine sawfly Euura mucronata Hartig (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) induces galls in the buds of over 30 willow species across the Holarctic region. This extensive host range is surprising, since the other Euura gallers are mostly monophagous; thus, the feeding habit of E. mucronata would represent a switch from monophagy to extreme polyphagy. Previous morphological studies have divided E. mucronata into separate species, but the feeding ranges of these species are unknown, and it is even doubtful whether multiple species really exist. To study whether or not E. mucronata consists of cryptic host-associated sibling species, an allozyme study was conducted using gallers collected from six willow species occurring in northern Fennoscandia. Electrophoretic data from seven variable enzyme loci show that: (1) 'E. mucronata' probably comprises at least three species with restricted host ranges, but the species may not be completely reproductively isolated from each other; (2) the pattern of host use is not explained by the phylogeny of willows; (3) the pattern of host use is not concordant with the overall chemical similarity of the hosts; and (4) simple allopatric speciation does not appear to explain the host associations. Consequently, it is possible that reasons such as differences in host phenology, habitat, or morphology, are responsible for the limits in host use in the group. 3aEuura 3aallozymes 3aSalix 3afood plants 3afeeding preferences 3agene frequency 3aloci 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3aenzyme polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aBacteriophages 2aBiological Evolution 2aFemale 2aGenetic Markers 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aHymenopteraxgenetics 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPhylogeny 2aTreesxparasitology 3aSweden 3aFinland 0asibling species0 tHeredity.g2002 Apr., v. 88, no. 4 p.288-295x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68000423Available from publisher's Web site  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02481naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245017300161300001600334500002400350500001500374520134200389650000901731650002001740650001701760650001101777650001101788650001201799650001901811650001601830650001501846650001601861653001801877700001601895700001501911773011201926852000902038856004802047655001202095IND4380544020221122221251.0060601e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438054402DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-005-3277-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, M.S.10aDevelopment and application of an integrated water balance model to study the sensitivity of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area water availability scenario to climatic changes  ap. 423-445.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study investigates the water availability scenario along Tokyo Metropolitan Area (TMA) under future climatic changes. TMA, which depends largely on the adjacent Tone river for its water supply, suffers from water shortage almost once in 2-3 yr. A methodology was developed considering integrated approach to ascertain probable impact of climatic changes on the overall water availability along the Tone river and its impact on TMA. Historical trend in hydro-climatic characteristics of the Tone River basin was investigated at the first place to assess the changes and interrelationships. A deterministic water balance model was later developed, integrating natural hydrological balance as well as several water uses and river regulation effects. The natural water balance part of the model was tested for some hypothetical climate change scenarios to observe the sensitivity of the Tone river flow to climatic perturbations. For the worst scenario of precipitation and temperature changes, the unregulated Tone river flow was observed to be reduced by around 20-50%, varying over different months. After considering river regulation effects from reservoirs and diversion, the regulated flow was further analyzed based on some risk indices. Drought risk was observed to be increased significantly for the periods between April-July. 3arisk 3abalance studies 3awater supply 3arivers 3amodels 3adrought 3aclimate change 3ariver water 3awatersheds 3atemperature 0awater balance1 aAramaki, T.1 aHanaki, K.0 tWater resources management.g2005 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.423-445dKluwer Academic Publishersx0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-005-3277-1 7aarticle02270naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245019800142300001600340520070700356650001301063650000901076650000901085650000901094650001501103650001401118650001101132650001301143650001701156650001201173650001301185650000901198650003201207650002401239650002901263650001101292650001301303650000901316650002601325650002301351650000901374653001601383653001201399653002401411653002901435700001801464700001301482700001601495700001601511773009901527852000901626930003301635945001301668946001101681655001201692IND2045256520221122221153.0950324e199501  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204525652DNAL7 a78589432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEnoki, Y.10aOxygen affinities (P50) of myoglobins from four vertebrate species (Canis familiaris, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus and Gallus domesticus) as determined by a kinetic and an equilibrium method  ap. 193-199.  aRate constants of the reaction with oxygen of myoglobins from four vertebrate species (Canis familiaris, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus and Gallus domesticus) and the isolated alpha(A) and beta(A) chains of human adult hemoglobin (HbA) were determined by the stopped-flow-spectrophotometric method.

Sulphydryl groups in the Hb chains were ascertained to be completely regenerated. 3achickens 3adogs 3arats 3amice 3ahemoglobin 3amyoglobin 3aoxygen 3akinetics 3adissociation 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDogs 2aElectrophoresis, Starch Gel 2aGlobinsxmetabolism 2aHemoglobin Axmetabolism 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aMice 2aMyoglobinxmetabolism 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aRats 0aequilibrium 0abinding 0aoxygen binding rate 0aoxygen dissociation rate1 aMatsumura, K.1 aOhga, Y.1 aKohzuki, H.1 aHattori, M.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g1995 Jan., v. 110B, no. 1 p.193-199x0305-04917nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02544naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002400179245010800203300001800311506007600329520134900405506003701754650000801791650002901799650001601828650001001844650001201854650002401866650001801890650001101908700002501919773008301944852000902027856007802036939003302114946001102147655001202158IND4459775620221207123920.0110708e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445977562DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkr0902doi7 aPMC31302682pmcid7 a213550392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabiskin, Andrew H.10aEngineering ligand-responsive RNA controllers in yeast through the assembly of RNase III tuning modules  ap. 5299-5311.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe programming of cellular networks to achieve new biological functions depends on the development of genetic tools that link the presence of a molecular signal to gene-regulatory activity. Recently, a set of engineered RNA controllers was described that enabled predictable tuning of gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae through directed cleavage of transcripts by an RNase III enzyme, Rnt1p. Here, we describe a strategy for building a new class of RNA sensing-actuation devices based on direct integration of RNA aptamers into a region of the Rnt1p hairpin that modulates Rnt1p cleavage rates. We demonstrate that ligand binding to the integrated aptamer domain is associated with a structural change sufficient to inhibit Rnt1p processing. Three tuning strategies based on the incorporation of different functional modules into the Rnt1p switch platform were demonstrated to optimize switch dynamics and ligand responsiveness. We further demonstrated that these tuning modules can be implemented combinatorially in a predictable manner to further improve the regulatory response properties of the switch. The modularity and tunability of the Rnt1p switch platform will allow for rapid optimization and tailoring of this gene control device, thus providing a useful tool for the design of complex genetic networks in yeast.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aengineering 3agenes 3aligands 3anucleotide aptamers 3aribonucleases 3ayeasts1 aSmolke, Christina D.0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 July, v. 39, no. 12 p.5299-5311x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr0903Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110708  aNon-US 7aarticle02130naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245011300168300001300281500002400294520115800318650001401476650001601490650001401506650001401520650001801534650001001552650001601562700001901578700001501597700001501612773010101627852000901728856005501737655001201792IND4451193620221122184544.0110322e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445119362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02482.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dong10aGrowth and survival of juvenile lined seahorse, Hippocampus erectus (Perry), at different stocking densities  ap. 9-13.  aIncludes references  aThe lined seahorse, Hippocampus erectus (Perry), is an important species in both medicinal and aquarium trades. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of stocking density (1, 3 and 5 individuals L⁻¹) on the growth performance and survival of the early‐stage juvenile H. erectus. The height (HT), wet weight, weight gain (WG) and specific growth rate (SGR) were affected significantly by the stocking density during the 40‐day study. The HT, WG and SGR of the seahorse at 1 and 3 juveniles L⁻¹ were significantly higher than that at 5 juveniles L⁻¹. The survival of juveniles at the three stocking densities was not significantly different at day 25 (90.3 ± 4.5%, 86.7 ± 4.2% and 86.2 ± 3.8% for 1, 3 and 5 juveniles L⁻¹ respectively), but was significantly different at day 40 (87.8 ± 3.9%, 69.6 ± 4.2% and 52.9 ± 2.8% for 1, 3 and 5 juveniles L⁻¹ respectively). For the early‐stage juvenile H. erectus, we recommend a stocking density of 3 juveniles L⁻¹, but the density should be reduced to 1-2 juveniles L⁻¹ to avoid reduced and variable growth and high mortality after 25 days. 3aaquariums 3ahippocampus 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3astocking rate 3atrade 3aweight gain1 aZhang, Yinghui1 aLin, Junda1 aLin, Qiang0 tAquaculture research.g2010 Dec., v. 42, no. 1 p.9-13dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2010.02482.x 7aarticle01533naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245007700160300001400237500001500251520040300266650001800669650001200687650002100699650001700720650002800737650002500765650001500790650002000805650002000825650002000845650001100865650001400876650002400890653000900914700001800923773007800941852000901019930003301028945002501061946001301086655001201099IND4380445520221122152958.0060525e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438044552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

MDH and MCS individuals were laboratory maintained on their native field soils; CPF worms were exposed to both MDH and MCS soils. Site-specific differences in metal partitioning were found: notably, the putatively metal-adapted populations, MDH and MCS, preferentially partitioned higher proportions of their accumulated tissue metal burdens into insoluble CaPO4-rich organelles compared with naive counterparts, CPF. Thus, it is plausible that efficient metal immobilization is a phenotypic trait characterising metal tolerant ecotypes. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (COII) genotyping revealed that the populations indigenous to mine and reference soils belong to distinct genetic lineages, differentiated by 13%, with 7 haplotypes within the reference site lineage but fewer (3 and 4, respectively) in the lineage common to the two mine sites. Collectively, these observations raise the possibility that site-related genotype differences could influence the toxico-availability of metals and, thus, represent a potential confounding variable in field-based eco-toxicological assessments. 3acalcium phosphates 3aorganelles 3aheavy metals 3alead 3acalcareous soils 3aphosphorus 3asoil pollution 3aphenotype 3ahaplotypes 3auptake mechanisms 3aactive transport 3atemporal variation 3abioaccumulation 3aspatial variation 3aearthworms 3amicrobial genetics 3azinc 3aacid soils 3aecotypes 3amined soils 3agenetic variation 3aLumbricus rubellus 0agenotype 0aadaptation1 aStürzenbaum, Stephen R.1 aKille, Peter1 aMorgan, A.

To this end, we determined the effects of the tree species composition on the biomass and composition of the soil microbial community using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles in the Hainich National Park, a deciduous mixed forest on loess over limestone in Central-Germany. We investigated the effects of the leaf litter composition on the microbial community, hypothesizing that distinctive leaf litter compositions increase signature PLFAs. In addition, we studied the impact of clay content, pH and nutrient status of the soil on the microbial community in different surface soil layers. Consequently, soil was sampled from depths of 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm and 10–20 cm. Plots with highest leaf litter diversity had the largest total amounts of fatty acids, but only PLFA 16:1ω5, which is a common marker for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, was significantly increased. In the uppermost soil layer, the pH explained most of the variance in microbial composition. In the deeper surface soil layers, nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus determined the microbial abundances and composition. Our results suggest that the soil microbial community is mainly indirectly influenced by aboveground diversity. Changes in soil pH or the soil nutrient status that are driven by specific plant traits like leave litter quality drive these indirect changes. Specific direct interactions are most reasonable for mycorrhizal fungi. 3afatty acids 3amycorrhizal fungi 3atemperate forests 3asoil depth 3acarbon 3aforest soils 3aphosphorus 3asoil ecology 3afunctional diversity 3adeciduous forests 3abiomarkers 3adry matter accumulation 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3aphospholipids 3aforest trees 3aspecies diversity 3aclay fraction 3anitrogen 3aforest litter 3aGermany 0asoil microorganisms 0aforest ecology1 aGattinger, Andreas1 aJacob, Mascha1 aThomas, Frank M.1 aGleixner, Gerd0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2010 Sept., v. 42, no. 9 p.1558-1565dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2010.05.0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20101019b20101108c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02919naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008100166300001600247500001500263520147700278650002601755650001101781650001801792650002401810650001101834650001301845650002901858650000901887650001901896650001201915650001101927650001401938650003101952650003201983650001202015653001002027700002202037700002302059700002602082700002002108700001802128700002402146773010302170852000902273856008502282930003302367946001302400655001202413IND4399411020221122085655.0071226e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439941102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-007-9074-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegde, Shailaja 13aAn intronic sequence mutated in flexed-tail mice regulates splicing of Smad5  ap. 852-860.  a2019-12-05  aRecent work has identified a growing body of evidence that subtle changes in noncoding sequences can result in significant pathology. These mutations, which would have been called silent polymorphisms in the past, affect gene transcription and mRNA splicing and lead to drastic changes in gene expression. Previous work from our lab has characterized the murine flexed-tail (f) mutation, which encodes Smad5, a transcription factor that functions downstream of the receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). f/f mice are unable to rapidly respond to acute anemia. Our analysis of these mice led to the development of a new model for stress erythropoiesis, where BMP4 expression in the spleen leads to the Smad5-dependent expansion of a specialized population of stress erythroid progenitors during the recovery from acute anemia. f/f mutant mice exhibit a defect in Smad5 mRNA splicing in the spleen such that the majority of Smad5 transcripts are two misspliced mRNAs. One of these mRNAs encodes a truncated form of Smad5 that inhibits BMP4 signaling when overexpressed. Here we show that a mutation in a poly(T) element in intron 4 causes the splicing defect in f/f mutant mice. This subtle mutation (loss of 1 or 2 Ts in a 16-T element) results in defects in splicing throughout the Smad5 gene. Furthermore, we show that this mutation results in tissue-specific splicing defects, which may explain why f/f mice are viable when Smad5-/- mice are embryonic lethal. 3atranscription factors 3aanemia 3amessenger RNA 3agene overexpression 3amodels 3amutation 3atranscription (genetics) 3amice 3aerythropoiesis 3amutants 3aspleen 3areceptors 3agene expression regulation 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3aintrons 0agenes1 aLenox, Laurie E. 1 aLariviere, Andrew 1 aPorayette, Prashanth 1 aPerry, John M. 1 aYon, Michele 1 aPaulson, Robert F. 0 tMammalian genome.g2007 Dec., v. 18, no. 12 p.852-860dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-007-9074-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20071226b20080102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02684naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245012300199300001800322500002400340506007600364520105300440506003701493650001501530650002801545650001901573650001301592650001001605650001701615650002101632650001401653650000901667650002401676650001101700650001201711650001101723650001701734650001401751650001501765650001301780650001401793700002701807700002001834700002001854700002401874700001701898773013801915852000902053856008002062655001202142IND4410181920221207135050.0080912e20080915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441018192DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01043-082doi7 aPMC25470342pmcid7 a186411672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLakhal, Fatma10aDjlA, a Membrane-Anchored DnaJ-Like Protein, Is Required for Cytotoxicity of Clam Pathogen Vibrio tapetis to Hemocytes  ap. 5750-5758.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDjlA is an inner membrane cochaperone belonging to the DnaJ family, which has been shown to be involved in Legionella sp. pathogenesis. In this study, we explored the role of this protein in the physiology and virulence of Vibrio tapetis, the etiological agent of brown ring disease (BRD) in Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum). Analysis of the djlA locus in V. tapetis revealed a putative organization in an operon with a downstream gene that we designated duf924Vt, which encodes a conserved protein with an unknown function and has homologues in bacteria and eukaryotes. djlA mutants displayed a reduced growth rate and showed an important loss of cytotoxic activity against R. philippinarum hemocytes in vitro, which could be restored by extrachromosomal expression of wild-type djlAVt but not duf924Vt. These results are in keeping with the potential importance of DjlA for bacterial pathogenicity and open new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of action of this protein in the novel V. tapetis-R. philippinarum interaction model.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLegionella 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3aVibrio tapetis 3abacteria 3aclams 3acytotoxicity 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahemocytes 3aloci 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3amutants 3aoperon 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aphysiology 3aproteins 3avirulence1 aBury-Moné, Stéphanie1 aNomane, Yanoura1 aLe Goïc, Nelly1 aPaillard, Christine1 aJacq, Annick0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Sept. 15, v. 74, no. 18 p.5750-5758dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01043-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03163naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002700178245009900205300001800304500002400322506007600346520107900422506003701501650002801538650001701566650002301583650004001606650000801646650004301654650001301697650001701710650002801727650001001755650007901765650002801844650002801872650006001900650007701960650001102037650003702048650001102085650004202096650000902138650001502147650001502162650001702177650002402194650001202218651002702230700002402257700002702281700002002308700001902328773010402347852000902451856007702460655001202537IND4407485920221207135104.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440748592DNAL7 a183754112pmid7 aPMC24536662pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-01942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGouni-Berthold, Ioanna10aSex Disparities in the Treatment and Control of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Type 2 Diabetes  ap. 1389-1391.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE:--To assess whether sex differences exist in the effective control and medication treatment intensity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We performed a cross-sectional analysis including 44,893 patients with type 2 diabetes (51% women). End points included uncontrolled CVD risk factors (LDL cholesterol >=130 mg/dl, systolic blood pressure [SBP] >=140 mmHg, and A1C >=8%) and the intensity of medical management in patients with uncontrolled CVD risk factors. Multiple-adjusted odds ratios were calculated after stratification for the presence of CVD (present in 39% of the patients). RESULTS:--Women with CVD were less likely to have SBP, LDL cholesterol, and A1C controlled and less likely to receive intensive lipid-lowering treatment. Women without CVD were less likely than men to have LDL cholesterol controlled with no differences in SBP or A1C control. CONCLUSIONS:--Women with diabetes and CVD have poorer control of important modifiable risk factors than men and receive less intensified lipid-lowering treatment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acardiovascular diseases 3adrug therapy 3agender differences 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amen 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3arisk factors 3asystolic blood pressure 3awomen 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHypolipidemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aOdds Ratio 2aRegistries 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Characteristics 2aSystole 0aGermanyxepidemiology.1 aBerthold, Heiner K.1 aMantzoros, Christos S.1 aBöhm, Michael.1 aKrone, Wilhelm0 tDiabetes care.g2008 July, v. 31, no. 7 p.1389-1391dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-01943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02083naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245005600161300001400217520105200231650001801283650001401301650001301315650001701328650001701345650000901362650001601371650001101387650002301398650002301421650002701444650001601471650001301487700001501500773007801515852000901593930003301602945002501635946001301660655001201673IND4380447220221122055316.0060525e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438044722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMilota, M.R.10aEmissions from western hemlock lumber during drying  ap. 66-70.  aLarge amounts of western hemlock lumber are dried in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and western Canada, often at a high temperature. Methanol and formaldehyde emissions from western hemlock are not known, making it difficult for mills to comply with permit requirements and clean air laws. Methanol, formaldehyde, and total hydrocarbon emissions were measured during the drying of western hemlock dimension lumber at various temperatures and for wood harvested during different seasons and locations. Methanol emissions ranged from 0.03 to 0.24 pounds per 1,000 board feet (lb/MBF) (0.007 to 0.06 kg/m3). Formaldehyde emissions ranged from 0.001 to 0.004 lb/MBF (0.0003 to 0.001 kg/m3). Total hydrocarbon emissions (as carbon) ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 lb/MBF (0.02 to 0.17 kg/m3). Temperature and initial moisture content are likely factors affecting emissions; however, there was considerable variability that could not be accounted for by only these factors. Seasonal variability and log or lumber storage conditions may cause some of the variability. 3awater content 3aemissions 3amethanol 3aformaldehyde 3ahydrocarbons 3awood 3awood drying 3alumber 3aTsuga heterophylla 3aseasonal variation 3ageographical variation 3atemperature 3asampling1 aMosher, P.0 tForest products journal.g2006 May, v. 56, no. 5 p.66-70x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20070727b20070802c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/06/21  aOther US 7aarticle03850naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001000152245008100162300001800243500002400261520207500285650001202360650001102372650002002383650001202403650001602415650001302431650001902444650001102463650001702474650001802491650001302509650002102522650001902543650001802562650002502580650001502605650002702620650002102647650001902668653002002687653003302707653001602740653001202756653001402768653003402782653002602816653002002842653003302862653001602895653001202911653001402923653003402937653002602971700001902997773010703016852000903123856009203132655001203224IND4407690720221122040045.0080712s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440769072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01625.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXU-RI10aTerrestrial nitrogen cycle simulation with a dynamic global vegetation model  ap. 1745-1764.  aIncludes references  aA global scale Dynamic Nitrogen scheme (DyN) has been developed and incorporated into the Lund-Posdam-Jena (LPJ) dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). The DyN is a comprehensive process-based model of the cycling of N through and within terrestrial ecosystems, with fully interactive coupling to vegetation and C dynamics. The model represents the uptake, allocation and turnover of N in plants, and soil N transformations including mineralization, N₂ fixation, nitrification and denitrification, NH₃ volatilization, N leaching, and N₂, N₂O and NO production and emission. Modelled global patterns of site-scale nitrogen fluxes and reservoirs are highly correlated to observations reported from different biomes. The simulation of site-scale net primary production and soil carbon content was improved relative to the original LPJ, which lacked an interactive N cycle, especially in the temporal and boreal regions. Annual N uptake by global natural vegetation was simulated as 1.084 Pg N yr⁻¹, with lowest values <1 g N m⁻² yr⁻¹ (polar desert) and highest values in the range 24-36.5 g N m⁻² yr⁻¹ (tropical forests). Simulated global patterns of annual N uptake are consistent with previous model results by Melillo et al. The model estimates global total nitrogen storage potentials in vegetation (5.3 Pg N), litter (4.6 Pg N) and soil (>=67 Pg as organic N and 0.94 Pg as inorganic N). Simulated global patterns of soil N storage are consistent with the analysis by Post et al. although total simulated N storage is less. Deserts were simulated to store 460 Tg N (up to 0.262 kg N m⁻²) as NO₃⁻, contributing 80% of the global total NO₃⁻ inventory of 580 Tg N. This model result is in agreement with the findings of a large NO₃⁻ pool beneath deserts. Globally, inorganic soil N is a small reservoir, comprising only 1.6% of the global soil N content to 1.5 m soil depth, but the ratio has a very high spatial variability and in hot desert regions, inorganic NO₃⁻ is estimated to be the dominant form of stored N in the soil. 3aammonia 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3adeserts 3ainventories 3aleaching 3amineralization 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anitrogen cycle 3anitrous oxide 3aprimary productivity 3asoil depth 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atropical forests 3avolatilization 0aannual N uptake 0adynamic global N cycle model 0ainorganic N 0aN cycle 0aN storage 0anitrification-denitrification 0aterrestrial ecosystem 0aannual N uptake 0adynamic global N cycle model 0ainorganic N 0aN cycle 0aN storage 0anitrification-denitrification 0aterrestrial ecosystem1 aPRENTICE, I.C.0 tGlobal change biology.g2008 Aug., v. 14, no. 8 p.1745-1764dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01625.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02060naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161100001500178245007700193300001600270500001500286520062200301650002700923650001700950650001600967650001400983650001700997650001801014650002201032650002001054650001201074650003801086650003701124650002201161650001701183650002701200650001401227651001201241651001801253653001101271700001501282700001901297773006601316852000901382856008201391930003301473945002501506946001101531655001201542IND4369090220221122040028.0050419e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436909022DNAL7 a153296672pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68005662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDamme, J.M.M. van10aMultiple CMS-restorer gene polymorphism in gynodioecious Plantago coronopus  ap. 175-181.  aThe mode of inheritance of the male sterility trait is crucial for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the sexual system gynodioecy, which is the co-occurrence of female and hermaphrodite plants in natural populations. Both cytoplasmic (CMS) and nuclear (restorer) genes are known to be involved. Theoretical models usually assume a limited number of CMS genes with each a single restorer gene, while reality is more complex. In this study, it is shown that in the gynodioecious species Plantago coronopus two new CMS-restorer polymorphisms exist in addition to the two that were already known, which means four CMS-restorer systems at the species level. Furthermore, three CMS types were shown to co-occur within a single population. All new CMS types showed a multilocus system for male fertility restoration, in which both recessive and dominant restorer alleles occur. Our finding of more than two co-occurring CMS-restorer systems each with multiple restorer genes raises the question how this complex of male sterility systems is maintained in natural populations. 3aPlantago coronopus 3agynodioecy 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3agenes 3arestorer lines 3agenetic polymorphism 3agene segregation 3acrossing 3asex ratio 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCytoplasmxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aPlantagoxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSex Factors 2aSex Ratio 0aIreland 0aNetherlands1 aHundscheid, M.P.J.1 aIvanovich, S.

  1 aAkintug, B.12aA Markov switching model for annual hydrologic time series  ap. W09424.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper investigates the properties of Markov switching (MS) models (also known as hidden Markov models) for generating annual time series. This type of model has been used in a number of recent studies in the water resources literature. The model considered here assumes that climate is switching between M states and that the state sequence can be described by a Markov chain. Observations are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution whose parameters depend on the state variable. We present the stochastic properties of this class of models along with procedures for model identification and parameter estimation. Although, at a first glance, MS models appear to be quite different from ARMA models, we show that it is possible to find an ARMA model that has the same autocorrelation function and the same marginal distribution as any given MS model. Hence, despite the difference in model structure, there are strong similarities between MS and ARMA models. MS and ARMA models are applied to the time series of mean annual discharge of the Niagara River. Although it is difficult to draw any general conclusion from a single case study, it appears that MS models (and ARMA models derived from MS models) generally have stronger autocorrelation at higher lags than ARMA models estimated by conventional maximum likelihood. This may be an important property if the purpose of the study is the analysis of multiyear droughts. 3atemporal variation 3amathematical models 3arivers 3aequations 3adrought 3amodel validation 3atime series analysis 3ariver water 3astatistical analysis 3astochastic processes 3aaccuracy 3ahydrologic models 0aMarkov switching models 0ahydrology 0ariver discharge1 aRasmussen, P.F.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Sept., v. 41, no. 9 p.W09424-W09424wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080114b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/18  aOther US 7aarticle02420naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001700136245017900153300001600332500002400348520104500372650002401417650002601441650002101467650002001488650000801508650002601516650001901542650001401561650004101575650001701616650000901633650001101642650002701653650001001680650001301690700001801703700001801721700002001739700001801759773011201777852000901889856007601898655001201974IND4407552820221121234607.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440755282DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.18822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Junheon10aFumigant antifungal activity of plant essential oils and components from West Indian bay (Pimenta racemosa) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) oils against two phytopathogenic fungi  ap. 272-277.  aIncludes references  aCommercial plant essential oils obtained from 26 plant species were tested for their antifungal activity against Phytophthora cactorum and Cryponectria parasitica. Good antifungal activity against P. cactorum was achieved with the essential oil derived from thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and bay (Pimenta racemosa) at 28 x 10⁻³ mg/ml air concentration. Inhibition rates of bay and red thyme were 69.1% and 100%, respectively, at 28 x 10⁻³ mg/ml air concentration. In a test with C. parasitica, the inhibition rates of bay and red thyme oil were 75.2% and 100%, respectively, at 28 x 10⁻³ mg/ml air concentration. The inhibition rate of cade (Juniperus oxycedrus) essential oil was 63.0%, but other oils were <=40%. Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry led to the identification of 17 and 20 compounds, respectively, in the oils of bay and red thyme. The antifungal activity of the identified compounds was tested individually using standard compounds. Phenol and alcohol compounds were generally more toxic than hydrocarbons. 3aJuniperus oxycedrus 3aPhytophthora cactorum 3aPimenta racemosa 3aThymus vulgaris 3aair 3aantifungal properties 3aessential oils 3afumigants 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrocarbons 3aoils 3aphenol 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3athyme 3atoxicity1 aLee, Yeon-Suk1 aLee, Sang-Gil1 aShin, Sang-Chul1 aPark, Il-Kwon0 tFlavour and fragrance journal.g2008 July, v. 23, no. 4 p.272-277dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0882-57347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ffj.18823Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03303naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002200140245012400162300001400286520162800300650002401928650002601952650001401978650001601992650001502008650001802023650001102041650001502052650002102067650002002088650001102108650001802119650001002137650002802147650000902175650001202184650001502196650001402211650002502225650002202250650001002272650000802282650002702290650002102317700002102338700002202359700001902381700002402400700002502424700002402449700003002473773006302503852000902566856008002575939003302655946001302688655001202701IND4436896220160314000000.0100513e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443689622DNAL7 a10.1038/oby.2009.1892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Fernanda10aMaté Tea Inhibits In Vitro Pancreatic Lipase Activity and Has Hypolipidemic Effect on High-fat Diet-induced Obese Mice  ap. 42-47.  aThe inhibitory effects of maté tea (MT), a beverage produced with leaves from Ilex paraguariensis, in vitro lipase activity and on obesity in obese mice models were examined. For the in vitro experiment, porcine and human pancreatic lipase (PL) activities were determined by measuring the rate of release of oleic acid from hydrolysis of olive oil emulsified with taurocholate, phospholipids, gum arabic, or polyvinyl alcohol. For the in vivo experiments, animals were fed with a standard diet (SD, n = 10) or high-fat diet (HFD, n = 30) for 16 weeks. After the first 8 weeks on the HFD, the animals were treated with 1 and 2 g/kg of body weight of MT. The time course of the body weight and obesity-related biochemical parameters were evaluated. The results showed that MT inhibited both porcine and human PL (half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 1.5 mg MT/ml) and induced a strong inhibition of the porcine lipase activity in the hydrolysis of substrate emulsified with taurocholate + phosphatidylcholine (PC) (83 ± 3.8%) or PC alone (62 ± 4.3%). MT suppressed the increases in body weight (P < 0.05) and decreased the serum triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations at both doses (from 190.3 ± 5.7 to 135.0 ± 8.9 mg/dl, from 189.1 ± 7.3 to 129.3 ± 17.6 mg/dl; P < 0.05, respectively) after they had been increased by the HFD. The liver lipid content was also decreased by the diet containing MT (from 132.6 ± 3.9 to 95.6 ± 6.1 mg/g of tissue; P < 0.05). These results suggest that MT could be a potentially therapeutic alternative in the treatment of obesity caused by a HFD. 3aIlex paraguariensis 3aanimal disease models 3abeverages 3ablood serum 3agum arabic 3ahigh fat diet 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro studies 3ain vivo studies 3aleaves 3alipid content 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3amice 3aobesity 3aoleic acid 3aolive oil 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aswine 3atea 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols1 aNoso, Tatiana M.1 aPorto, Viviane B.1 aCuriel, Alline1 aGambero, Alessandra1 aBastos, Deborah H.M.1 aRibeiro, Marcelo L.1 aCarvalho, Patrícia de O.0 tObesity.g2010 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.42-47x1930-73817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.1893Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120607  aOther US 7aarticle02804naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161072001700178072001700195072001700212100002400229245013500253300001600388520127900404650003301683650002401716650001801740650002601758650002401784650001201808650003401820650001401854650001601868650001401884650002401898650001201922650001101934650002401945650001301969650001501982650002001997700001502017700001602032773006602048852000902114856008202123930003302205945002502238946001102263655001202274IND4369089020221121234510.0050419e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436908902DNAL7 a153296622pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68005522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

One commonly used test for nuclear-cytoplasmic coadaptation relies on the breakup of coadapted gene complexes by introgression, potentially resulting in an increased frequency of nuclear alleles in deleterious interaction with an alien cytoplasm. We investigated the phenotypic effect of such genes on female reproduction in outbred and inbred introgressed lines of the haplodiploid mite Tetranychus urticae. Introgression changed female lifetime fecundity and increased male production, in ways suggesting a control of fecundity by nuclear genes. Conversely introgression reduced the fertilization rate, possibly due to sperm-egg incompatibility or maternal effects. The intensity of inbreeding depression expressed as a reduction in fecundity was more severe in introgressed females than in nonintrogressed ones, giving evidence for recessive interacting alleles contributing to residual nucleo-cytoplasmic incompatibility. Overall, our data suggest recessive negative interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes. This study is the first report of a contribution of nuclear polymorphism within a population to deleterious interactions with an alien cytoplasmic genome. 3afertilization (reproduction) 3aTetranychus urticae 3aintrogression 3ainbreeding depression 3ainsect reproduction 3afemales 3anucleocytoplasmic interaction 3afecundity 3aoviposition 3asex ratio 3aembryonic mortality 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aHaploidy 2aInbreeding 2aMitesxgenetics1 aMigeon, A.1 aNavajas, M.0 tHeredity.g2004 Dec., v. 93, no. 6 p.551-558x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68005523Available from publisher's Web site  a20050817b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245013200161300001500293500001500308520166800323650002301991650002502014650002102039650001202060650001502072650002902087650001302116650001602129650002202145650001802167650001802185650002802203651001102231653001602242653001502258700001502273700001602288700001802304773010702322852000902429930003302438945002502471946001302496655001202509IND4376603320221121234622.0051209e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W09501.  a2019-12-05  aVertical water seepage in soils results in convective heat transport that modifies the temperature profiles and their variations with time; consequently, there is a relationship between temperature profile variations with time and the vertical Darcy velocity associated with the seepage. Considering the annual sinusoidal time variation of the temperature at the soil surface, it can be shown that convective heat transport has a significant effect on the amplitude damping with depth and a negligible effect on the phase lag with depth of the temperature time signal. Standard meteorological stations constitute a relatively dense network, and we show that their routinely collected data can be used to determine an average value of the vertical Darcy velocity, u(z), representing the effective annual recharge over long time periods (several years). A new procedure for determining u(z) from these temperature records is presented. First, the layering of the medium is determined by an electrical sounding. Then the thermal properties of each layer are inferred from the phase lag with depth. Finally, u(z) is calculated from the amplitude damping. After having tested this approach with synthetic data, we used the 1984-2001 Abbeville (Somme, France) data to determine the average recharge over six 3-year periods. The results are in good agreement with classical meteorological recharge estimates and show a significant increase in the recharge during the last 3-year period, consistent with the observed phreatic 2001 flood event. Specific temperature measurements at appropriate depths and time steps could drastically improve the sensitivity of the method. 3atemporal variation 3agroundwater recharge 3asoil temperature 3aseepage 3asoil depth 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3avelocity 3amethodology 3aspatial variation 3asoil profiles 3aheat transfer 3asoil thermal properties 3aFrance 0anew methods 0aconvection1 aGuerin, R.1 aTabbagh, A.1 aBendjoudi, H.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Sept., v. 41, no. 9 p.W09501-W09501wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/18  aOther US 7aarticle03441naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245009600183300001800279500009400297520179700391650001902188650001402207650002102221650001802242650001602260650002002276650001702296650002102313650002502334650003002359650003802389650003802427650001802465650001102483650003402494650002502528650006002553653002302613653001902636653002402655700002102679700001802700700001602718773008502734852000902819930003302828945002502861946001302886655001202899IND4368033620221121234605.0050329e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436803362DNAL7 a156754522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKoppelman, S.J.10aDetection of soy proteins in processed foods: literature overview and new experimental work  ap. 1398-1407.  aIn the special section: Methodological aspects of food allergens / edited by K. Williams.  aSeveral tests for the detection of soy proteins in foods have been described in the literature, and some are commercially available. This article gives an overview of these methods and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each individual method. Based on the conclusions of this inventory, an experimental approach was designed to improve the sensitivity of measuring soy protein in processed foods. The aimed sensitivity is 10 ppm (10 microgram soy protein in 1 g solid sample), which is over 100-fold lower than presently available tests. The aimed sensitivity is this low because levels of food allergens at 10 ppm and above may provoke reactions in food allergic persons. Native soybean meal, soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, and textured soy flakes were used as test materials. Several extraction procedures were compared and a new method using high pH was selected. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits and goats, and immunopurified antibodies were used in sandwich and inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Extraction at pH 12 resulted in good yields for all tested samples, both quantitatively (Bradford) and qualitatively by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunopurified rabbit antibodies against this extract used in a competition ELISA format resulted in a sensitive test with a detection limit of 0.02 microgram/mL, corresponding to 0.4 microgram/g (0.4 ppm) in food samples. Cross-reactivity with some main food ingredients was measured and appeared to be negative in all cases. The presently developed test is applicable for soy ingredients and soy-containing foods that are processed in different ways. The limit of quantitation is 1 ppm, which is an enormous improvement over earlier described methods. 3afood allergies 3aallergens 3afood composition 3afood analysis 3asoy protein 3aprocessed foods 3asoybean meal 3aprotein isolates 3aprotein concentrates 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFood Analysis 2aHumans 2aProtease Inhibitorsxanalysis 2aProtein Denaturation 2aSoybean Proteinsxanalysisxclassificationximmunology. 0aliterature reviews 0afood allergens 0atextured soy flakes1 aLakemond, C.M.M.1 aVlooswijk, R.1 aHefle, S.L.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2004 , v. 87, no. 6 p.1398-1407x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20060321b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/13  aOther US 7aarticle03501naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001500163245007400178300001600252520159000268650002101858650002201879650002901901650001601930650002401946650002301970650001901993650001702012650001802029650002602047650002602073650001702099650002602116650001802142650002502160650005802185650005402243650001602297650002302313650004602336650003802382650005002420650002402470650001902494650003102513650003102544700001402575700001902589700001602608700001802624700001802642700001302660700001502673773008302688852000902771930003302780945002502813946001302838655001202851IND4381398420221121224236.0060623e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438139842DNAL7 a167920572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aArranz, I.10aDetermination of aflatoxin B1 in medical herbs: interlaboratory study  ap. 595-605.  aA method was developed for the determination of aflatoxin B1 in medical herbs (senna pods, botanical name Cassia angustifolia; devil's claw, botanical name Harpagophytum procumbens; and ginger roots, botanical name Zingiber officinale). The method, which was tested in a mini-collaborative study by 4 laboratories, is based on an immunoaffinity cleanup followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography separation and fluorescence detection after post-column derivatization. It allows the quantitation of aflatoxin B1 at levels lower than 2 ng/g. A second extractant (acetone-water) was tested and compared to the proposed methanol-water extractant. Several post-column derivatization options (electrochemically generated bromine, photochemical reaction, and chemical bromination) as well as different integration modes (height versus area) were also investigated. No differences were found depending on the choice of derivatization system or the signal integration mode used. The method was tested for 3 different matrixes: senna pods, ginger root, and devil's claw. Performance characteristics were established from the results of the study and resulted in HorRat values ranging from 0.12 to 0.75 with mean recoveries from 78 to 91% for the extraction with methanol-water and HorRat values ranging from 0.10-1.03 with mean recoveries from 98 to 103% for the extraction with acetone-water. As a result, the method, with all tested variations, was found to be fit-for-purpose for the determination of aflatoxin B1 in medical herbs at levels of 1 microgram/kg and above. 3aherbal medicines 3aSenna alexandrina 3aHarpagophytum procumbens 3aginger root 3aZingiber officinale 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3aaflatoxin B1 3amolds (fungi) 3asecondary metabolites 3aquantitative analysis 3alaboratories 3alaboratory techniques 3arapid methods 3acooperative research 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 2aAflatoxin B1xanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aCalibration 2aCassiaxmetabolism 2aChemistry Techniques, Analyticalxmethods 2aChromatography, Affinityxmethods 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aMethanolxchemistry 2aPhotochemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence1 aSizoo, E.1 aEgmond, H. van1 aKroeger, K.1 aLegarda, T.M.1 aBurdaspal, P.1 aReif, K.1 aStroka, J.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2006 , v. 89, no. 3 p.595-605x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20061017b20061102c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/10/17  aOther US 7aarticle03419naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161072001700178100003400195245011400229300001600343520160600359650001001965650001701975650001301992650002002005650001002025650001402035650001402049650002602063650002302089650001702112650002302129650001202152650001802164650002102182650002302203650002502226650002702251650001802278650004802296650003402344650004702378653001802425653001802443653001602461653001902477653002602496700001302522700001802535700001402553773006602567852000902633856008202642930003302724945002502757946001102782655001202793IND4369096420221121224259.0050419e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436909642DNAL7 a152414572pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68004982doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMartínez Fernández, Ángel.10aHeterosis and epistasis for teat number and fluctuating asymmetry in crosses between Jiaxing and Iberian pigs  ap. 222-227.  aIn the framework of Wright's view of evolution, long-separate breeds of domestic animals could establish different adaptive epistatic genetic complexes that could be destroyed in crossbred animals by recombination. The objective of this study was to evaluate heterosis and recombination effects in a crossing experiment involving two distinct European and Asian breeds (Iberian and Jiaxing) in the F1 and two successive backcrosses to the Iberian line. Teat number (TN) was recorded in the right and left sides of piglets and analysed by fitting a mixed linear model including the Dickerson's crossbreeding parameters. TN in pigs is a discontinuous and often canalised trait presenting bilateral symmetry. The minor differences between sides make this trait a good candidate to evaluate fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and developmental instability. For TN, the posterior means and standard deviations (SD) of the heritability and of the relative contribution of common litter environmental effect to variance were 0.248 (0.028) and 0.057 (0.019), respectively. The respective values of the difference between breeds, heterosis and recombination effect were 9.990 (0.411), -0.506 (0.196) and 0.684 (0.232). For FA, the posterior means and SDs of the heritability and of the relative contribution of common litter environmental effect to variance were 0.023 (0.005) and 0.014 (0.005), respectively. Another significant genetic effect was a recombination effect of 0.773 (0.117). These results confirm that the rupture by recombination of coadapted genomes decreases developmental stability in domestic pigs. 3aswine 3aswine breeds 3acrossing 3aanimal breeding 3ateats 3aheterosis 3aepistasis 3agenetic recombination 3aanimal development 3aheritability 3agenetic covariance 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aEpistasis, Genetic 2aGenetics, Population 2aHybrid Vigorxgenetics 2aLinear Models 2aMammary Glands, Animalxanatomy & histology 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSus scrofaxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 0aJiaxing breed 0aIberian breed 0ateat number 0ateat asymmetry 0afluctuating asymmetry1 aToro, M.1 aRodriguez, C.1 aSilio, L.0 tHeredity.g2004 Aug., v. 93, no. 2 p.222-227x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68004983Available from publisher's Web site  a20080626b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03411naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245003300191300001600224520140100240650001701641650001101658650001701669650002101686650001301707650001601720650002501736650002101761650002001782650003601802650001501838650002401853650001201877650004101889650001801930650002801948650003601976650002302012650002102035650002402056650005402080650004302134650002102177650001502198650002302213650003602236650005102272653001702323653002202340653002002362653001602382700002102398700002302419700002102442700003602463773011102499852000902610856008602619930003302705946001102738655001202749IND4391932920221121213010.0070529e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439193292DNAL7 a174316292pmid7 a10.1007/s00294-007-0128-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemaire, Stéphane D. 10aThioredoxins in chloroplasts  ap. 343-365.  aThioredoxins (TRXs) are small disulfide oxidoreductases of ca. 12 kDa found in all free living organisms. In plants, two chloroplastic TRXs, named TRX f and TRX m, were originally identified as light dependent regulators of several carbon metabolism enzymes including Calvin cycle enzymes. The availability of genome sequences revealed an unsuspected multiplicity of TRXs in photosynthetic eukaryotes, including new chloroplastic TRX types. Moreover, proteomic approaches and focused studies allowed identification of 90 potential chloroplastic TRX targets. Lately, recent studies suggest the existence of a complex interplay between TRXs and other redox regulators such as glutaredoxins (GRXs) or glutathione. The latter is involved in a post-translational modification, named glutathionylation that could be controlled by GRXs. Glutathionylation appears to specifically affect the activity of TRX f and other chloroplastic enzymes and could thereby constitute a previously undescribed regulatory mechanism of photosynthetic metabolism under oxidative stress. After summarizing the initial studies on TRX f and TRX m, this review will focus on the most recent developments with special emphasis on the contributions of genomics and proteomics to the field of TRXs. Finally, new emerging interactions with other redox signaling pathways and perspectives for future studies will also be discussed. 3aCalvin cycle 3acarbon 3achloroplasts 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenomics 3aglutathione 3anucleotide sequences 3aoxidative stress 3aoxidoreductases 3apost-translational modification 3aproteomics 3asignal transduction 2aAnimals 2aChloroplastsxchemistryxenzymology. 2aGlutaredoxins 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathways 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Weight 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Isoforms 2aProteomics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aThioredoxinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aGlutaredoxin 0aGlutathionylation 0aRedox signaling 0aThioredoxin1 aMichelet, Laure 1 aZaffagnini, Mirko 1 aMassot, Vincent 1 aIssakidis-Bourguet, Emmanuelle 0 tCurrent genetics.g2007 June, v. 51, no. 6 p.343-365dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0172-80837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-007-0128-z3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070529b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02881naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245007200157300002100229500001500250520159400265650002201859650001701881650001401898650002101912650001301933650002201946650001601968650001001984650002201994653002402016653003202040653002302072653001702095700001602112700001202128700001402140700001402154700001502168700001702183773011902200852000902319930003302328945002502361946001302386655001202399IND4376600720221121213021.0051209e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWu, C.M.10aTraditional analysis of aquifer tests: comparing apples to oranges?  ap. W09402 (12 p.  a2019-12-05  aTraditional analysis of aquifer tests uses the observed drawdown at one well, induced by pumping at another well, for estimating the transmissivity (T) and storage coefficient (S) of an aquifer. The analysis relies on Theis' solution or Jacob's approximate solution, which assumes aquifer homogeneity. Aquifers are inherently heterogeneous at different scales. If the observation well is screened in a low-permeability zone while the pumping well is located in a high-permeability zone, the resulting situation contradicts the homogeneity assumption in the traditional analysis. As a result, what does the traditional interpretation of the aquifer test tell us? Using numerical experiments and a first-order correlation analysis, we investigate this question. Results of the investigation suggest that the effective T and S for an equivalent homogeneous aquifer of Gaussian random T and S fields vary with time as well as the principal directions of the effective T. The effective T and S converge to the geometric and arithmetic means, respectively, at large times. Analysis of the estimated T and S, using drawdown from a single observation well, shows that at early time both estimates vary with time. The estimated S stabilizes rapidly to the value dominated by the storage coefficient heterogeneity in between the pumping and the observation wells. At late time the estimated T approaches but does not equal the effective T. It represents an average value over the cone of depression but influenced by the location, size, and degree of heterogeneity as the cone of depression evolves. 3asimulation models 3apermeability 3aequations 3agroundwater flow 3aaquifers 3aspatial variation 3agroundwater 3awells 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models 0aaquifer storage coefficient 0acone of depression 0ahydrogeology1 aYeh, T.C.J.1 aZhu, J.1 aLee, T.H.1 aHsu, N.S.1 aChen, C.H.1 aSancho, A.F.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Sept., v. 41, no. 9 p.W09402 (12 p-W09402 (12 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/17  aOther US 7aarticle02587naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245008000159300002000239520155300259650003001812650002401842650001601866650002601882650001501908650001501923650001701938650000801955650001701963653002501980700001102005773011702016852000902133930003302142945002502175946001302200655001202213IND4376600820221121212925.0051209e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTuller, M.10aWater films and scaling of soil characteristic curves at low water contents  ap. W09403 (6 p.  aIndividual contributions of capillarity and adsorptive surface forces to the matric potential are seldom differentiated in determination of soil water characteristic (SWC) curves. Typically, capillary forces dominate at the wet end, whereas adsorptive surface forces dominate at the dry end of a SWC where water is held as thin liquid films. The amount of adsorbed soil water is intimately linked to soil specific surface area (SA) and plays an important role in various biological and transport processes in arid environments. Dominated by van der Waals adsorptive forces, surface-water interactions give rise to a nearly universal scaling relationship for SWC curves at low water contents. We demonstrate that scaling measured water content at the dry end by soil specific surface area yields remarkable similarity across a range of soil textures and is in good agreement with theoretical predictions based on van der Waals interactions. These scaling relationships are important for accurate description of SWC curves in dry soils and may provide rapid and reliable estimates of soil specific surface area from SWC measurements for matric potentials below -10 MPa conveniently measured with the chilled-mirror dew point technique. Surface area estimates acquired by fitting the scaling relationship to measured SWC data were in good agreement with SA data measured by standard methods. Preliminary results suggest that the proposed method could provide reliable SA estimates for natural soils with hydratable surface areas smaller than 200 m2/g. 3asoil water characteristic 3amathematical models 3acapillarity 3asoil matric potential 3aadsorption 3asoil water 3asurface area 3adew 3asoil texture 0avan der Waals forces1 aOr, D.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Sept., v. 41, no. 9 p.W09403 (6 p-W09403 (6 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080114b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/17  aOther US 7aarticle02883naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245006900158300001500227520171900242650002501961650001501986650001302001650001302014650001702027650002102044650002002065650001302085650002102098650001802119650001502137650001902152653002402171653002602195653002402221700001702245773010702262852000902369930003302378945002502411946001302436655001202449IND4376601320221121173811.0051209e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To predict the removal of bacteria, the effects of cyclic infiltration and draining events (transient unsaturated flow) were investigated. Using physical micromodels, we visualized the intermittent transport of bacteria and other colloids in unsaturated porous media. Column experiments provided quantitative measurements of the phenomena observed at the pore scale. Tagged Escherichia coli and a conservative tracer (NaI) were introduced in an initial pulse into a 1.5 m sand column. Subsequent hydraulic flushes without tagged bacteria or tracer were repeated every 4 hours for the next 4 days, during which outflow concentrations were monitored. Breakthrough behavior between colloids and dissolved tracer differed significantly, reflecting the differences in transport processes. Advancement of the wetting front remobilized bacteria which were held in thin water films, attached to the air-water interface (AWI), or entrapped in stagnant pore water between gas bubbles. In contrast, the tracer was only remobilized by diffusion from immobile to mobile water. Remobilization led to successive concentration peaks of bacteria and tracer in the effluent but with significant temporal differences. Observations at the pore-scale indicated that the colloids were essentially irreversibly attached to the solid-water interface, which explained to some extent the high removal efficiency of microbes in the porous media. Straining, cluster filtration, cell lysis, protozoa grazing, and bacteriophage parasitism could also contribute to the removal efficiency of bacteria. 3awastewater treatment 3afiltration 3acolloids 3abacteria 3aporous media 3aunsaturated flow 3aphysical models 3aporosity 3aEscherichia coli 3awetting front 3aadsorption 3abacteriophages 0afilter breakthrough 0asolid-water interface 0aair-water interface1 aKeller, A.A.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Sept., v. 41, no. 9 p.W09408-W09408wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080114b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/17  aOther US 7aarticle02315naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001400179245004700193300001800240500002400258500001500282520062500297650002300922650002200945650001000967650002300977650001501000650005301015650002401068650005701092650002701149650005401176650007801230650002401308650005501332653001301387653001701400653001801417700001501435700001501450700001801465700001801483700001301501773009001514852000901604856009101613930003301704945002501737946001101762655001201773IND4401700520221121173745.0080219e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440170052DNAL7 a180612212pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aMisra, L.10aWithanolides from Withania somnifera roots  ap. 1000-1004.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo new and seven known withanolides along with β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol glucoside, stigmasterol glucoside, α + β glucose were isolated from the roots of Withania somnifera.

The majority of the 288 clones sequenced from three different locations at Zodletone Spring belonged to the Stramenopiles, Alveolata, and Fungi, with members of the phylum Cercozoa, order Diplomonadida, and family Jakobidae representing a minor fraction of the clone library. No sequences suggesting the presence of novel kingdom level diversity were detected in any of the three libraries. A large fraction of stramenopile clones encountered were monophyletic with either members of the genus Cafeteria (order Bicosoecida) or members of the order Labyrinthulida (slime nets), both of which have so far been encountered mainly in marine habitats. The majority of the observed fungal clone sequences belonged to the ascomycetous yeasts (order Saccharomycetales), were closely related to yeast genera within the Hymenobasidiomycetes (phylum Basidiomycetes), or formed a novel fungal lineage with several previously published or database-deposited clones. To determine whether the unexpected abundance of fungal sequences in Zodletone Spring clone libraries represents a general pattern in anaerobic habitats, we generated three clone libraries from three different anaerobic settings (anaerobic sewage digester, pond sediment, and hydrocarbon-exposed aquifer sediments) and partially sequenced 210 of these clones. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that clone sequences belonging to the kingdom Fungi represent a significant fraction of all three clone libraries, an observation confirmed by phospholipid fatty acid and ergosterol analysis. Overall, this work reveals an unexpected abundance of Fungi in anaerobic habitats, describes a novel, yet-uncultured group of Fungi that appears to be widespread in anaerobic habitats, and indicates that several of the previously considered marine protists could also occur in nonmarine habitats.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBasidiomycota 3aDiplomonadida 3aSaccharomycetales 3aanaerobic digesters 3aaquifers 3acafeterias 3aclones 3afatty acids 3ahabitats 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aponds 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3asulfides 3ayeasts 2aEcosystem 2aEukaryotic Cellsxclassification 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aFungixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGene Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSulfidesxmetabolism 3aOklahoma 0aOklahoma1 aKrumholz, Lee R.1 aNajar, Fares Z.1 aPeacock, Aaron D.1 aRoe, Bruce A.1 aWhite, David C.1 aElshahed, Mostafa S.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Oct., v. 71, no. 10 p.6175-6184dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.10.6175-6184.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02700naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245007900162300001600241500001500257520162100272650001001893650001901903650002701922650001601949650001501965650002401980650001202004650001102016650001802027650002402045653001802069653002802087700001302115773008202128852000902210930003302219945002502252946001302277655001202290IND4377014820221121131115.0060106e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437701482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aClausen, C.A.10aTest method for assessing resistance of pine lumber and waferboard to mold  ap. 164-166.  a2019-12-05  aMethods are needed to evaluate the ability of framing lumber and composite construction materials to withstand mold growth when they are exposed to rain between manufacture and installation. A laboratory-controlled rain chamber was developed to expose biocide-treated specimens of pine lumber and waferboard to bi-weekly wetting followed by re-inoculation with test fungi. In the rain chamber mold test, an experimental biocide, which contained propiconazole, performed as well as the positive control, which contained iodo carbamate and didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride. However, results from the rain chamber test method did not correlate with results from a standard ASTM laboratory mold test for the experimental biocide. In additional tests of kiln-dried, rewetted, and unseasoned pine, untreated specimens showed heavy mold growth after 7 days regardless of their original moisture content. Results for a matching set of specimens dip-treated in disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) revealed that rewetted and unseasoned specimens supported mold growth equally well after a 4-week incubation in the laboratory mold test, while DOT-treated kiln-dried specimens moderately inhibited mold growth. These specimens likely retained more treatment than did their wet counterparts. Ideally, waferboard and kiln-dried pine should be rewetted to adequately support mold growth in the standard laboratory mold test. The rain chamber mold test provided prolonged conditions of high moisture, even for kiln-dried pine and waferboard specimens, and mimicked exposure of construction materials to moisture during storage. 3aPinus 3awet-dry cycles 3aconstruction materials 3awaferboards 3afungicides 3adisodium octaborate 3atesting 3alumber 3amolds (fungi) 3arainfall simulators 0awood products 0acomposite wood products1 aWest, M.0 tForest products journal.g2005 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.164-166x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20060228b20060302c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/02/28  aOther US 7aarticle03766naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245008900194300001600283500002400299520136500323650001601688650001201704650002101716650002301737650001001760650001501770650001301785650002301798650002501821650001301846650001601859650002201875650001101897650002201908650000901930650001701939650001001956650001201966650003801978650002702016650001402043650001402057650004002071650008302111650004202194650007202236650007302308650009902381650007802480650002102558650002902579650002502608650002702633650001702660650003102677650004502708700002002753700001702773700001402790700002102804700002202825700002102847773010002868852000902968856005502977655001203032IND4460320320221121131039.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446032032DNAL7 a215640992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03742.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZawaski, Christine10aSHORT INTERNODES-like genes regulate shoot growth and xylem proliferation in Populus  ap. 678-691.  aIncludes references  a• Genes controlling plant growth and form are of considerable interest, because they affect survival and productivity traits, and are largely unknown or poorly characterized. The SHORT INTERNODES(SHI) gene is one of a 10-member SHI-RELATED SEQUENCE (SRS) gene family in Arabidopsis that includes important developmental regulators. • Using comparative sequence analysis of the SRS gene families in poplar and Arabidopsis, we identified two poplar proteins that are most similar to SHI and its closely related gene STYLISH1 (STY1). The two poplar genes are very similar in sequence and expression and are therefore probably paralogs with redundant functions. • RNAi suppression of the two Populus genes enhanced shoot and root growth, whereas the overexpression of Arabidopsis SHI in poplar reduced internode and petiole length. The suppression of the two genes increased fiber length and the proportion of xylem tissue, mainly through increased xylem cell proliferation. The transgenic modifications were also associated with significant changes in the concentrations of gibberellins and cytokinin. • We conclude that Populus SHI-RELATED SEQUENCE (SRS) genes play an important role in the regulation of vegetative growth, including wood formation, and thus could be useful tools for the modification of biomass productivity, wood quality or plant form. 3aArabidopsis 3aPopulus 3aRNA interference 3acell proliferation 3agenes 3ainternodes 3apetioles 3aplant architecture 3aplant growth control 3aproteins 3aroot growth 3asequence analysis 3ashoots 3avegetative growth 3awood 3awood quality 3axylem 2aBiomass 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPopulusxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTime Factors 2aWoodxgrowth & development 2aXylemxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aKadmiel, Mahita1 aMa, Cathleen1 aGai, Ying1 aJiang, Xiangning1 aStrauss, Steve H.1 aBusov, Victor B.0 tnew phytologist.g2011 Aug., v. 191, no. 3 p.678-691dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03742.x 7aarticle04799naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001800182245017000200300001800370500002400388500001500412506007600427520185300503506003702356650002502393650001102418650001702429650003002446650001102476650001202487650001502499650002302514650001902537650002102556650002002577650001102597650001502608650001502623650001702638650001602655650001002671650001602681650002302697650004902720650005102769650004602820650003902866650002702905650002602932650002902958650006102987650005003048650006003098650004103158650003503199650003403234650007203268650006003340650003003400650004203430650003103472650002403503650001603527650003503543653001203578700002303590700002103613700002103634700001703655700001703672700001803689773011503707852000903822856008103831856003303912655001203945IND4382792920221207122431.0060813e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438279292DNAL7 a167666722pmid7 aPMC15339572pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.106.0819432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasuor, Hagai10aGlyphosate-Induced Anther Indehiscence in Cotton Is Partially Temperature Dependent and Involves Cytoskeleton and Secondary Wall Modifications and Auxin Accumulation  ap. 1306-1315.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aYield reduction caused by late application of glyphosate to glyphosate-resistant cotton (Gossypium hirsutum; GRC) expressing CP4 5-enol-pyruvylshikmate-3-P synthase under the cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter has been attributed to male sterility. This study was aimed to elucidate the factors and mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. Western and tissue-print blots demonstrated a reduced expression of the transgene in anthers of GRC compared to ovules of the same plants. Glyphosate application to GRC grown at a high temperature regime after the initiation of flower buds caused a complete loss of pollen viability and inhibition of anther dehiscence, while at a moderate temperature regime only 50% of the pollen grains were disrupted and anther dehiscence was normal. Glyphosate-damaged anthers exhibited a change in the deposition of the secondary cell wall thickenings (SWT) in the endothecium cells, from the normal longitudinal orientation to a transverse orientation, and hindered septum disintegration. These changes occurred only at the high temperature regime. The reorientation of SWT in GRC was accompanied by a similar change in microtubule orientation. A similar reorientation of microtubules was also observed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings expressing green fluorescent protein tubulin (tubulin α 6) following glyphosate treatment. Glyphosate treatment induced the accumulation of high levels of indole-3-acetic acid in GRC anthers. Cotton plants treated with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid had male sterile flowers, with SWT abnormalities in the endothecium layer similar to those observed in glyphosate-treated plants. Our data demonstrate that glyphosate inhibits anther dehiscence by inducing changes in the microtubule and cell wall organization in the endothecium cells, which are mediated by auxin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acotton 3amale flowers 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aovules 3atubulin 3acell walls 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abud initiation 3aWestern blotting 3agene expression 3apollen 3adehiscence 3aglyphosate 3amicrotubules 3atemperature 3a2,4-D 3acauliflower 3aindole acetic acid 2a2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acidxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transportxdrug effects 2aCaulimovirusxgenetics 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aCytoskeletonxmetabolism 2aFlowersxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aGossypiumxanatomy & histologyxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxanalysis 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Infertilityxphysiology 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPollenxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxanalysis 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aRhizobiumxgenetics 2aTemperature 2aTubulinxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aanthers1 aAbu-Abied, Mohamad1 aBelausov, Eduard1 aMadmoni, ʻAnat.1 aSadot, Einat1 aRiov, Joseph1 aRubin, Baruch0 tPlant physiology.g2006 Aug., v. 141, no. 4 p.1306-1315dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.106.0819433Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle02958naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001300144245011900157300001600276500001500292520145100307650001601758650002101774650001901795650000901814650002101823650002601844650001601870650002301886650002101909650002501930650001601955650003101971650001902002650001802021651001002039653003502049653002902084653002602113653003102139653002002170653001302190653002002203700001302223700001802236773008202254852000902336930003302345945002502378946001302403655001202416IND4377015920221121105309.0060106e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437701592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWang, Q.10aEffects of a new GUP-B fire retardant on mechanical properties of Korean pine when exposed to elevated temperature  ap. 214-220.  a2019-12-05  aThe bending properties of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) treated with a newly formulated guanylurea phosphate (GUP) fire retardant were evaluated. The chemical processing method used to formulate this fire retardant (called FRW) results in an organic phosphate fire-retardant system with less acidic pH and fewer impurities. The fire-retardant chemical studied consisted of high purity GUP, boric acid (B), and a minor amount of additives. The clear specimens of pine treated with FRW were either air-dried after treatment or kiln-dried at 70 degrees C and were then subjected to various durations of a steady-state exposure at 66 degrees C and 75 percent relative humidity. No significant differences in thermal degradation between the untreated controls and the FRW-treated pine were found regardless of whether it was air-dried or kiln-dried after treatment. However, for other tested fire retardants with much lower pH values, kiln-redrying induced significantly more degradation compared with air-redried material. On exposure to elevated temperature, the strength and stiffness of FRW-treated Korean pine experienced deterioration, but the extent was less than that previously reported for other GUP-B formulations produced using different manufacturing processes. Because of its milder acidity which results from the modified manufacturing process, enhanced stability related to thermal degradation was noted for this enhanced GUP-B (FRW). 3awood drying 3aflame retardants 3awood treatment 3awood 3abending strength 3amodulus of elasticity 3adegradation 3amodulus of rupture 3aPinus koraiensis 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aheat treatment 3awood strength 3aChina 0acoefficient of variation (COV) 0aflame retardant finishes 0amechanical properties 0aguanylurea phosphate (GUP) 0awood technology 0aredrying 0awood processing1 aWang, W.1 aWinandy, J.E.0 tForest products journal.g2005 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.214-220x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20060301b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/01  aOther US 7aarticle02637naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010000166300001600266520129200282650002401574650001601598650001201614650001701626650001001643650001701653650001301670650001101683650001001694650001201704650001301716650003201729650001101761650003101772653002401803653004701827653001901874700001601893700001901909773011301928852000902041856008502050930003302135946001102168655001202179IND4397691520221121105250.0071111e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439769152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00294-007-0158-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRech, Christine 10aDetection of hyphal fusion in filamentous fungi using differently fluorescence-labeled histones  ap. 259-266.  aCell fusion occurs regularly during the vegetative and sexual phases of the life cycle in filamentous fungi. Here, we present a simple and efficient method that can detect even rare hyphal fusion events. Using the homothallic ascomycete Sordaria macrospora as an experimental system, we developed a histone-assisted merged fluorescence (HAMF) assay for the investigation of hyphal fusion between vegetative mycelia. For this purpose, two reporter vectors were constructed encoding the histone proteins HH2B or HH2A fused at their C terminus either with the cyan or yellow fluorescent protein, respectively. The chimeric proteins generate fluorescently labeled nuclei and thus enable the distinction between different strains in a mycelial mixture. For example, hyphae with nuclei that show both cyan as well as yellow fluorescence indicate the formation of a heterokaryon as a result of hyphal fusion. To test the applicability of our HAMF assay, we used two S. macrospora developmental mutants that are supposed to have reduced hyphal fusion rates. The simple and efficient HAMF assay described here could detect even rare fusion events and should be applicable to a broad range of diverse fungal species including those lacking male or female reproductive structures or asexual spores. 3aSordaria macrospora 3acell fusion 3afemales 3afluorescence 3afungi 3aheterokaryon 3ahistones 3ahyphae 3amales 3amutants 3amycelium 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aspores 3ayellow fluorescent protein 0aSordaria macrospora 0aHistone-assisted merged fluorescence assay 0aSterile mutant1 aEngh, Ines 1 aKück, Ulrich 0 tCurrent genetics.g2007 Nov., v. 52, no. 5-6 p.259-266dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0172-80837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-007-0158-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02981naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245012700196300001600323520157000339650001801909650002401927650001901951650001701970650002401987650001902011650002502030650001602055650003102071650002102102650002502123650001402148650002002162650002702182700001902209700001702228700002002245700001602265700001702281700001502298773008202313852000902395930003302404945002502437946001302462655001202475IND4377016220221121105253.0060106e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437701622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFleming, M.R.10aEfficacy of commercial microwave equipment for eradication of pine wood nematodes and cerambycid larvae infesting red pine  ap. 226-232.  aThe feasibility of using commercial 2.45-GHz microwave equipment to kill cerambycid larvae and pine wood nematodes (PWN) [Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner and Buhrer) Nickle] infesting lumber was investigated. Research goals were to test a system of separating green material into moisture content (MC) ranges and to determine the feasibility of using internal wood temperature as the critical lethal treatment parameter. Prior research suggested that MC is a critical factor to consider in scaling up from laboratory-scale experiments with small volume specimens to full-sized lumber using commercial treatment processes. Commercial units used for this study were a chamber design unit for batch irradiation treatment and a continuous conveying tunnel design of microwave equipment fitted with optional air heaters. Because red pine is a preferred host of PWN and has high wood MC, microwave irradiation trials were conducted with red pine directly obtained from freshly sawn logs. The trials conducted using batch irradiation resulted in 100-percent mortality in all treated red pine materials (4- by 4- by 20-in cant samples) infested with PWN or beetle larvae above a measured wood temperature of 62 degrees C, regardless of wood MC. In contrast, treatment of 1-inch-thick boards using continuous feed microwave irradiation achieved 100-percent morality at lower wood temperatures. These results were encouraging and indicate commercial microwave (2.45 GHz) treatment may be a feasible alternative to conventional heat treatment or methyl bromide fumigation. 3awater content 3amicrowave treatment 3aPinus resinosa 3aCerambycidae 3amicrowave radiation 3awood treatment 3ainternal temperature 3alethal dose 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3ainvasive species 3astatistical analysis 3aequations 3acontrol methods 3apest control equipment1 aJanowiak, J.J.1 aKimmel, J.D.1 aHalbrendt, J.M.1 aBauer, L.S.1 aMiller, D.L.1 aHoover, K.0 tForest products journal.g2005 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.226-232x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a20060301b20060402c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/01  aOther US 7aarticle02711naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001500178245006000193300002100253520136100274650001501635650001801650650001901668650001801687650002301705650001501728650002401743650002901767650002001796650001401816650002201830650001101852650002001863650002101883650001701904650002001921653003601941653002601977700001602003773011802019852000902137930003302146945002502179946001302204655001202217IND4376709620221121054018.0051216e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437670962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W07006 (12 p.  aVegetation affects the mean and turbulent flow structure in surface water bodies, thus impacting the local transport processes of contaminants and sediments. The present paper explores the capability of two different mathematical models to predict fully developed one-dimensional open channel flow in the presence of rigid, complex-shaped vegetation with leaves, submerged or emergent. The flow is described by applying two different turbulence closure schemes, both of which are based on the Boussinesq eddy viscosity model: a suitably modified kappa - epsilon model and a two-layer model based on the mixing length approach. To describe the turbulence structure within and above the canopy a turbulent kinetic energy budget equation was added to the two-layer model. The results of the models were compared with experimental data where simple cylinders, plastic plant prototypes, or real plants, all arranged in a scattered pattern, were employed. Since good agreement between the results of the models and measurements was found in comparing velocity and turbulent shear stress, the models could potentially be used to assess vegetative resistance. Significant disagreement was found when comparing measured and computed eddy viscosity distributions, streamwise turbulence intensity, and most of the terms comprising the turbulent kinetic energy budget. 3avegetation 3aoverland flow 3aturbulent flow 3asurface water 3asediment transport 3apollutants 3amathematical models 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3aemergent plants 3aviscosity 3ahydrologic models 3acanopy 3aphysical models 3amodel validation 3ashear stress 3aflow resistance 0aBoussinesq eddy viscosity model 0acontaminant transport1 aBixio, A.C.0 tWater resources research.g2005 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.W07006 (12 p-W07006 (12 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080114b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/19  aOther US 7aarticle03127naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245009400145300001800239520194100257650001302198650002102211650002402232650001702256650001202273650001102285650002702296650001002323650002802333650002002361650003102381650001302412653001602425653001802441700001602459700001802475700001602493700001902509773008502528852000902613930003302622945001302655946001302668655001202681IND2324709620221121054010.0020104e200109  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232470962DNAL7 a116014702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleyn, D.H.10aDetermination of fat in raw and processed milks by the Gerber method: collaborative study  ap. 1499-1508.  aThe Gerber method is used worldwide as a simple and rapid method for determining fat in raw and processed milks. However, the volume of the test portion used in the method has not been internationally agreed upon. A collaborative study was conducted to evaluate performance of the Gerber method using either a weighed test portion (11.13 g) or by a 10.77 mL test portion delivered by pipet. For each method, laboratories received 10 test samples: 5 raw and 5 pasteurized homogenized milks, 2 of which were blind duplicate pairs. Eleven and 10 laboratories participated in the evaluation of aliquot addition by weight and pipet, respectively. Mojonnier ether extraction (Method 989.05) was used as the reference method. Interlaboratory study statistics were similar between methods of test portion addition and between raw and processed materials; therefore, summary interlaboratory study statistics were pooled. The fat content of milk samples ranged from 0.96 to 5.48%. Absolute reproducibility and repeatability were not affected by fat level, and pooled statistical performance (invalid and outlier data removed) was (g fat/100 g milk) s(r) = 0.026, s(R) = 0.047, r = 0.074, and R = 0.132. Relative standard deviations increased with decreasing fat content, and were summarized by fat level: 1-2% fat milk, mean = 1.437, RSD(r) = 1.809%, RSD(R) = 3.271%; 2-6% fat milk, mean = 4.156, RSD(r) = 0.626%, RSD(R) = 1.131%. Compared with ether extraction, test results by the Gerber method were slightly lower (0.02% fat) using a weighed test portion and significantly lower (0.06% fat) using a 10.77 mL volume addition by pipet. A trend toward underestimating fat content at lower fat concentrations (1-2% fat) was observed with the weighed test portion but not when a pipet was used. The Associate Referee recommends that the Gerber method using a weighed test portion be adopted as First Action with applicability limited to whole milk. 3araw milk 3apasteurized milk 3amilk fat percentage 3alaboratories 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDietary Fatsxanalysis 2aEther 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aMilkxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSolvents 0acomparisons 0agerber method1 aLynch, J.M.1 aBarbano, D.M.1 aBloom, M.J.1 aMitchell, M.W.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2001 , v. 84, no. 5 p.1499-1508x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02828naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245017200161300002100333500001500354520175700369650002202126650001402148650001302162650001802175650002902193653002402222700001602246700001802262773011802280852000902398930003302407945002502440946001302465655001202478IND4376682820221121044628.0051212e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437668282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChrist, J.A.10aComparison of two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs): migration and entrapment in a nonuniform permeability field  ap. W01007 (12 p.  a2019-12-05  aThe influence of reduced dimensionality (two-dimensional (2-D) versus 3-D) on predictions of dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) infiltration and entrapment in statistically homogeneous, nonuniform permeability fields was investigated using the University of Texas Chemical Compositional Simulator (UTCHEM), a 3-D numerical multiphase simulator. Hysteretic capillary pressure-saturation and relative permeability relationships implemented in UTCHEM were benchmarked against those of another lab-tested simulator, the Michigan-Vertical and Lateral Organic Redistribution (M-VALOR). Simulation of a tetrachloroethene spill in 16 field-scale aquifer realizations generated DNAPL saturation distributions with approximately equivalent distribution metrics in two and three dimensions, with 2-D simulations generally resulting in slightly higher maximum saturations and increased vertical spreading. Variability in 2-D and 3-D distribution metrics across the set of realizations was shown to be correlated at a significance level of 95-99%. Neither spill volume nor release rate appeared to affect these conclusions. Variability in the permeability field did affect spreading metrics by increasing the horizontal spreading in 3-D more than in 2-D in more heterogeneous media simulations. The assumption of isotropic horizontal spatial statistics resulted, on average, in symmetric 3-D saturation distribution metrics in the horizontal directions. The practical implication of this study is that for statistically homogeneous, nonuniform aquifers, 2-D simulations of saturation distributions are good approximations to those obtained in 3-D. However, additional work will be needed to explore the influence of dimensionality on simulated DNAPL dissolution. 3asimulation models 3aequations 3aaquifers 3amass transfer 3anonaqueous phase liquids 0amathematical models1 aLemke, L.D.1 aAbriola, L.M.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.W01007 (12 p-W01007 (12 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20060707b20060804c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02519naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245015700161300001800318520115300336650001401489650002101503650001901524650002001543650001801563650002101581650001801602650001401620650002001634650004301654650000901697650005201706650002401758650001301782700001701795700001601812700001501828700002101843773017701864856004702041852000902088655001202097IND60579593420221121044738.0170824e20170614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057959342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b012502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xing10aPreparation of T-2-glucoronide with Rat Hepatic Microsomes and Its Use along with T-2 for Activation of the JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway in RAW264.7 Cells  ap. 4811-4818.  aT-2 toxin (T-2), one of the most toxic trichothecene A-type mycotoxins, is biotransformed in animal tissues to modified T-2s (mT-2s) including T-2-glucuronide (T-2-GlcA). In this study, the optimal conditions for T-2-GlcA synthesis were established, and the JAK/STAT pathway in RAW264.7 cells was used to study the toxicity of T-2-GlcA. Because many mT-2 standards are not readily available, optimal conditions for T-2-GlcA synthesis in vitro were established by incubating T-2 with rat liver microsomes, UDPGA, and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 90 min. qRT-PCR and Western blot results showed 21- and 760-fold increases in IL-6 mRNA expression induced by T-2-GlcA and T-2, respectively. Similar differences were observed in JAK3, SOCS2/3, and CIS mRNA expression. T-2-GlcA induced a dose-responsive decrease in STAT1 mRNA expression, whereas the result with T-2 was the opposite. Moreover, the phosphorylation of STAT3 induced by T-2-GlcA was higher than that by T-2, whereas the phosphorylation of STAT1 was to the contrary. Overall, the results show that T-2-GlcA was somewhat toxic, but activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in RAW264.7 was higher by T-2. 3aT-2 toxin 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal tissues 3agene expression 3ainterleukin-6 3aliver microsomes 3amessenger RNA 3aoctoxynol 3aphosphorylation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atoxicity1 aWang, Yaling1 aWang, Yapei1 aSun, Lijun1 aGooneratne, Ravi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 June 14, v. 65, no. 23 p.4811-4818dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b01250  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245024300162300001800405520097700423650002701400650002401427650002301451650001201474650001801486650001501504650001301519650001301532650002501545650002301570650002901593650004401622700002101666700001601687700001601703700001501719700001501734773017701749856004701926852000901973655001201982IND60579593320221121032810.0170824e20170614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057959332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b012092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanbo10aIdentification and Quantification of Acylated Homoserine Lactones in Shewanella baltica, the Specific Spoilage Organism of Pseudosciaena crocea, by Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry  ap. 4804-4810.  aBacteria communicate with one another using chemical signal molecules called autoinducers, and the most prevalent autoinducers used by Gram-negative bacteria are N-acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs). However, AHLs are hardly detected in Shewanella baltica, the specific spoilage organism of Pseudosciaena crocea. In this study, we applied ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry to determine AHLs. This method enabled the quantification of up to 11 AHLs within 5.6 min with excellent sensitivity (ng/mL level) and linearity (r2 > 0.99), which further detected 9 AHLs produced by S. baltica. Furthermore, by using a biofilm formation assay and statistical analysis, the biofilm-inducing activity of AHL in S. baltica was first revealed. Our results elucidated the physiological role of AHL in S. baltica and provided a satisfactory method to detect AHLs and a statistical model to predict food spoilage properties. 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLarimichthys crocea 3aShewanella baltica 3abiofilm 3afood spoilage 3ahomoserine 3alactones 3aspoilage 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aZhang, Xiaojiao,1 aWang, Chong1 aFu, Linglin1 aYi, Yangoa1 aZhang, Yan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 June 14, v. 65, no. 23 p.4804-4810dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b01209  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002700140245012500167300001400292520124000306650001201546650001401558650001101572650001301583650002301596650001201619650001801631650001901649650001001668700001501678700002201693773006301715852000901778856008001787939003301867946001301900655001201913IND4436897520221121032704.0100513e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443689752DNAL7 a10.1038/oby.2009.2042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkkekakis, Panteleimon10aAffective Responses to Increasing Levels of Exercise Intensity in Normal-weight, Overweight, and Obese Middle-aged Women  ap. 79-85.  aAt least 60 min of daily physical activity (PA) are recommended for weight control, a target achieved by only 3% of obese (OB) women. The purposes of this study were to examine (i) the affective responses of normal-weight (NW), overweight (OW), and OB middle-aged sedentary women to exercise of increasing intensity and (ii) the relationship of affective responses to self-efficacy and social physique anxiety. The women participated in a graded treadmill protocol to volitional exhaustion while providing ratings of pleasure–displeasure and perceived activation each minute. The Activation Deactivation Adjective Check List (AD ACL) was also completed before and after exercise. The affective responses of NW and OW women did not differ. However OB women gave lower pleasure ratings during the incremental protocol and reported lower Energy scores immediately after the protocol. Social physique anxiety, but not self-efficacy, was inversely related to pleasure and energy. The lower levels of pleasure and energy experienced by OB than nonobese women could account in part for their dramatically low levels of PA participation. Modifying the cognitive antecedents of social physique anxiety might be a useful intervention strategy. 3aanxiety 3acognition 3aenergy 3aexercise 3amiddle-aged adults 3aobesity 3aself-efficacy 3aweight control 3awomen1 aLind, Erik1 aVazou, Spiridoula0 tObesity.g2010 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.79-85x1930-73817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.2043Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120607  aOther US 7aarticle02242naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245014400179300002100323500001500344520102400359650001401383650001001397650002501407650002101432650002401453650001701477650001801494650002401512651001601536653002101552653001501573700001701588700001701605773011801622852000901740930003301749945002501782946001301807655001201820IND4376682620221121014225.0051212e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437668262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W01005 (11 p.  a2019-12-05  aWhile more than 75,000 dams nationwide have served a multitude of purposes over the past 50 years, current emphasis is being placed on decommissioning those aged infrastructures considered environmentally harmful. Grenada Lake, a relatively large flood control reservoir in Mississippi, is located in a highly erodible region of the United States and is fed by historically unstable stream channels. Through a variety of stratigraphic analyses, postimpoundment sediments are identified in the reservoir, showing that the lake has lost a nominal 3% of its flood storage capacity since its inception in 1954. A simple sediment budget constructed for the Yalobusha River's contribution of channel-derived sediments shows that about 76% of this sediment remains stored upstream, about 16% is stored in the reservoir, and about 8% has exited the lake. Sediment delivery ratios, known to be low for relatively large watersheds, appear to be unaffected by upstream channel instabilities and aggressive channelization projects. 3asediments 3alakes 3aspatial distribution 3adams (hydrology) 3awatershed hydrology 3asoil texture 3awater erosion 3asediment deposition 3aMississippi 0awater management 0areservoirs1 aRhoton, F.E.1 aDunbar, J.A.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.W01005 (11 p-W01005 (11 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20060707b20060804c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/07/07  aOther US 7aarticle02762naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011900168300001800287520147200305650001401777650002001791650002101811650001501832650002601847650002601873650001601899650001101915650002401926650002101950650002001971650002901991650001302020700002202033700002202055700002202077700002002099773017702119856004702296852000902343655001202352IND60579593220221121032755.0170824e20170614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057959322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b006982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroekaert, Nathan10aT-2 Toxin-3α-glucoside in Broiler Chickens: Toxicokinetics, Absolute Oral Bioavailability, and in Vivo Hydrolysis  ap. 4797-4803.  aDue to the lack of information on bioavailability and toxicity of modified mycotoxins, current risk assessment on these modified forms assumes an identical toxicity of the modified form to their respective unmodified counterparts. Crossover animal trials were performed with intravenous and oral administration of T-2 toxin (T-2) and T-2 toxin-3α-glucoside (T2-G) to broiler chickens. Plasma concentrations of T2-G, T-2, and main phase I metabolites were quantified using a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method with a limit of quantitation for all compounds of 0.1 ng/mL. Resulting plasma concentration–time profiles were processed via two-compartmental toxicokinetic models. No T-2 triol and only traces of HT-2 were detected in the plasma samples after both intravenous and oral administration. The results indicate that T-2 has a low absolute oral bioavailability of 2.17 ± 1.80%. For T2-G, an absorbed fraction of the dose and absolute oral bioavailability of 10.4 ± 8.7% and 10.1 ± 8.5% were observed, respectively. This slight difference is caused by a minimal (and neglectable) presystemic hydrolysis of T2-G to T-2, that is, 3.49 ± 1.19%. Although low, the absorbed fraction of T2-G is 5 times higher than that of T-2. These differences in toxicokinetics parameters between T-2 and T2-G clearly indicate the flaw in assuming equal bioavailability and/or toxicity of modified and free mycotoxins in current risk assessments. 3aT-2 toxin 3abioavailability 3abroiler chickens 3ahydrolysis 3aintravenous injection 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3arisk assessment 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity1 aDevreese, Mathias1 aBoevre, Marthe de1 aDe Saeger, Sarah,1 aCroubels, Siska0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 June 14, v. 65, no. 23 p.4797-4803dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals DivisionwJournal:12177x0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.7b00698  aDNAL 7aarticle03885naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168100001600177245017700193300001800370500002400388520186800412650001202280650001302292650001602305650001602321650001102337650002302348650002802371650002502399650001302424650002302437650002002460650003902480650003102519650001002550650003802560650001102598650001102609650004602620650001802666650001502684650000902699650004702708650002302755650001902778650002402797650001602821650003902837651002702876653003302903700001502936773012602951852000903077856008003086930003303166945002503199946001103224655001203235IND4440800920221121003331.0100803e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444080092DNAL7 a200659702pmid7 a10.1038/ijo.2009.2822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aReinehr, T.12aA new link between skeleton, obesity and insulin resistance: relationships between osteocalcin, leptin and insulin resistance in obese children before and after weight loss  ap. 852–858.  aIncludes references  aBackground: The skeleton is regarded recently as an endocrine organ that affects energy metabolism. However, there are very limited data available concerning the relationships between the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin, weight status, adiponectin and leptin in obese humans, especially in children. Methods: We analyzed osteocalcin, adiponectin, leptin and insulin resistance (IR) index homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) in 60 obese and 19 age- and gender-matched normal weight children. Furthermore, these parameters were determined in 60 obese children after participating in an outpatient 1-year lifestyle intervention based on exercise, behavior and nutrition therapy. Results: Sixty obese children had significantly lower osteocalcin levels (26.8±0.8 ng ml−1) than 19 normal weight controls (32.2±2.3 ng ml−1). Boys (29.9±1.1 ng ml−1) showed significantly (P=0.046) higher osteocalcin levels compared with girls (26.4±1.2 ng ml−1). In stepwise multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for age, gender and pubertal stage, osteocalcin was significantly negatively related to leptin and HOMA, but not to adiponectin. Changes of osteocalcin in the course of 1 year correlated significantly negatively with changes of IR index HOMA (r=−0.25), standard deviation score–body mass index (SDS–BMI) (r=−0.33) and leptin (r=−0.50). Substantial weight loss in 29 obese children led to a significant increase in osteocalcin and a significant decrease in leptin and HOMA. In 31 obese children without substantial weight loss, osteocalcin levels did not change significantly in the course of 1 year. Conclusion: Osteocalcin levels were lower in obese children and were related to IR and leptin both in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Therefore, osteocalcin might be a new promising link between obesity and IR. 3aobesity 3achildren 3aweight loss 3aosteocalcin 3aleptin 3ainsulin resistance 3across-sectional studies 3alongitudinal studies 3askeleton 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weightxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBone and Bonesxmetabolism 2aChild 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistancexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLeptinxblood 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aObesityxbloodxgeneticsxphysiopathology. 2aOsteocalcinxblood 2aPubertyxblood 2aRegression Analysis 2aSex Factors 2aWeight Lossxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aGermanyxepidemiology. 0ahomeostasis model assessment1 aRoth, C.L.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2010 May, v. 34, no. 5 p.852–858-852–858dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2009.2823Available from publisher's Web site  a20101019b20101108c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/09/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02873naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161072001700178100001700195245012200212300001600334520101600350650001401366650001701380650001401397650001701411650002001428650002501448650002601473650000901499650002001508650002501528650001601553650001201569650002101581650003201602650003601634650003101670650002501701650001101726650003101737650004501768650000901813650002201822650001901844650001401863650003401877650002301911653002101934700001801955700001801973700001801991773006602009852000902075856008202084930003302166945002502199946001102224655001202235IND4368322420221121003220.0050408e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436832242DNAL7 a152544922pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68005232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In addition, in invertebrates, maternal effects and common environment may change according to a mother's diet. We tested for the changes in quantitative genetic parameters in a half-sib design where mothers were fed diets varying in nutrient content. Surprisingly, we found that not only maternal and common environmental variance changed with experimental diets but also there were significant changes in narrow-sense heritabilities, with corresponding h2 values of 0.61 (high protein), 0.08 (high carbohydrate) and 0.001 (equal carbohydrate:protein). Our results show how an environmentally driven evolutionary process could occur in nature, since the response to selection could change dramatically according to the composition of the diet that females are ingesting. 3aPorcellio 3aheritability 3abody size 3alife history 3amaternal effect 3aphenotypic variation 3anutrient availability 3adiet 3aprotein content 3acarbohydrate content 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aBody Constitutionxgenetics 2aDietary Carbohydratesxanalysis 2aDietary Proteinsxanalysis 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aFood, Formulatedxanalysis 2aIsopodaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMale 2aMaternal Behavior 2aModels, Animal 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSelection, Genetic 0aPorcellio laevis1 aLardies, M.A.1 aNespolo, R.F.1 aBozinovic, F.0 tHeredity.g2004 Nov., v. 93, no. 5 p.455-459x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68005233Available from publisher's Web site  a20080527b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01785naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007300172300001600245500002400261520073500285650002301020650001101043650001901054650001701073650000901090650001901099650001401118650001001132650001401142700002501156700002201181700002301203773013301226852000901359856005501368655001201423IND4413888620221120221621.0081219e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441388862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1476-4431.2008.00368.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeola, Stacy D.10aMedical and surgical management of severe barium aspiration in a dog  ap. 639-645.  aIncludes references  aTo describe the medical and surgical management of a unique case of barium sulfate aspiration pneumonia in a dog.

  1 aDunne, S.13aAn ensemble-based reanalysis approach to land data assimilation  ap. W02013 (18 p.  a2019-12-05  aFuture pathfinder missions such as NASA's Hydrosphere State (Hydros) and ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) will provide satellite-based global observations of surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture. In previous work an ensemble Kalman filter was used to estimate soil moisture, related states, and fluxes by merging noisy low-frequency microwave observations with the forecasts from a conventional yet uncertain land surface model. Kalman filter estimates are only conditioned on observations prior to estimation times. Here it is argued that soil moisture estimation is a reanalysis-type problem as observations beyond the estimation time are useful in the estimation. An ensemble smoother is used in which the state vector and measurement vector are distributed in time and updated as a batch. Its performance in a land data assimilation context is compared to that of the ensemble Kalman filter. Results demonstrate that smoothing yields an improved estimate compared to filtering, reflected in the decreased deviation from truth and the reduction in uncertainty associated with the estimate. Precipitation significantly impacts the performance of the smoother, acting as an information barrier between dry-down events. An adaptive hybrid filter/smoother is presented in which brightness temperature is used to break the study interval into a series of dry-down events. The smoother is used on dry-down events, and the filter is used when precipitation is evident between estimation times. An improved estimate is obtained as all observations in a given dry-down period are used to estimate soil moisture in that period, and backward propagation of information from subsequent precipitation events is avoided. 3amathematical models 3asoil water content 3aequations 3atime series analysis 3aremote sensing 3aalgorithms 3asatellites 0aprecipitation 0adata analysis1 aEntekhabi, D.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Feb., v. 41, no. 2 p.W02013 (18 p-W02013 (18 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20060710b20060804c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/07/10  aOther US 7aarticle03549naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072001700161100002400178245010100202300001400303500001500317520189800332650001202230650001602242650002202258650001402280650001902294650001002313650003202323650002602355650002502381650001202406650002302418650002502441650001902466650001802485650001402503650002702517650001502544650002402559651001602583651001602599653002402615653001702639653002402656700001802680700001802698700001902716773006402735852000902799856008202808930003302890945002502923946001102948655001202959IND4368323320221120221612.0050408e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436832332DNAL7 a151384502pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68004762doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMorgan-Richards, M.10aInterspecific hybridization among Hieracium species in New Zealand: evidence from flow cytometry  ap. 34-42.  a2019-12-04  aHieracium pilosella (Asteraceae) was accidentally introduced to New Zealand about 100 years ago. Since then it has become an aggressive weed, and an unexpected degree of genetic and genome size variation has been detected; features that might result from interspecies hybridization. We investigated the possibility that H. pilosella has hybridized with related taxa. Of the four other subgenus Pilosella species introduced to New Zealand, H. praealtum is the most abundant and, on morphological and distributional evidence, most likely to be the other parent. Flow cytometry was used to estimate relative genome size for 156 Hieracium plants collected from the wild. Plants assigned to either parental or hybrid morphotypes were found to comprise tetraploid and pentaploid individuals using genome size measurements, and this was confirmed with direct mitotic chromosome counts for a subset of plants. The haploid DNA content of H. praealtum was approximately 22% larger than that of H. pilosella. Putative hybrids that were tetraploid had mean genome sizes equivalent to two H. pilosella and two H. praealtum haploid chromosome sets, implying they were hybrids arising from the fertilization of two reduced gametes. Similar results were obtained from tetraploid hybrids produced by controlled pollination. However, the majority of field hybrids were pentaploid with a genome size equivalent to four H. pilosella and one H. praealtum haploid chromosome sets. We infer that these are not first-generation hybrids but represent successful backcrossing with H. pilosella and/or hybrid-hybrid crossing, and that sexual tetraploid hybrids have been the parents. We note that populations putatively of H. pilosella often comprise apomictic pentaploid hybrids. Significantly, our data indicate the emergence of sexual hybrids that provide further opportunity for gene flow among taxa in this complex. 3ahybrids 3achromosomes 3achromosome number 3aHieracium 3aflow cytometry 3aweeds 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aPilosella officinarum 2aAsteraceaexgenetics 2aChimera 2aChromosomes, Plant 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGenome, Plant 2aGeography 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aPolyploidy 2aSpecies Specificity 3aNew Zealand 0aNew Zealand 0aHieracium praealtum 0acytogenetics 0aHieracium pilosella1 aTrewick, S.A.1 aChapman, H.M.1 aKrahulcova, A.0 tHeredity.g2004 July, v. 93, no. 1 p.34-42x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68004763Available from publisher's Web site  a20080527b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/05/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02991naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245006200186300001400248520126900262650002301531650001001554650002801564650001001592650004501602650002401647650003001671650003701701650002001738650001601758650001301774650001501787650002001802650001801822650002701840650003001867650004901897650002501946650001501971650002801986653002202014653001902036700001902055700002002074700002402094700001802118700002202136700002402158773010902182852000902291856006902300930003302369946001102402655001202413IND4387061520221120212417.0070122e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438706152DNAL7 a171199692pmid7 a10.1007/s00294-006-0108-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrinyer, Jasmine 10aProteome mapping of the Trichoderma reesei 20S proteasome  ap. 79-88.  aThe 26S proteasome, a multicatalytic protease comprising the catalytic 20S core particle and the 19S regulatory particle has a crucial role in cellular protein quality control. We have used a chromatography-based approach to purify and map the protein content of the 20S core particle from the industrially-exploited filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. There are no previous reports on the isolation or proteomic mapping of the proteasome from any filamentous fungus. From the reference map, 13 of the 14 20S proteasome subunits and many related proteins that co-purified with the 20S proteasome have been identified. These include 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (BIP) and several chaperones including heat shock proteins involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR). Some proteasome interacting proteins (PIPs) were also identified on the proteome map and included 14-3-3-like protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, transaldolase, actin, translation elongation factor, enolase, ATPase in the ER (CDC48), and eukaryotic initiation factor. We present here a master map for the 20S catalytic core to pave the way for future differential display studies addressing intracellular degradation of endogenous and foreign proteins in filamentous fungi. 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aactin 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3afungi 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3aheat shock proteins 3aphosphopyruvate hydratase 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein content 3aproteinases 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aquality control 3atransaldolase 3atranslation (genetics) 3aunfolded protein response 2aProteasome Endopeptidase Complexxmetabolism 2aProteomexmetabolism 2aProteomics 2aTrichodermaxenzymology 0aFilamentous fungi 0a20S proteasome1 aKautto, Liisa 1 aTraini, Mathew 1 aWillows, Robert D. 1 aTe'o, Junior 1 aBergquist, Peter 1 aNevalainen, Helena 0 tCurrent genetics.g2007 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.79-88dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0172-80837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-006-0108-83electronic resource  a20070122b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02812naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245009900202300001800301506007600319520131900395506003701714650002201751650002501773650002201798650002001820650003201840650001101872650001001883650001501893650001301908650001901921650002401940650001901964650002101983700001802004700001802022700002302040700002202063700001902085773008302104852000902187856007802196939003302274946001102307655001202318IND4459774420221207121720.0110708e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445977442DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkr0672doi7 aPMC31302582pmcid7 a213171902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotenza, Nicoletta10aHuman microRNA hsa-miR-125a-5p interferes with expression of hepatitis B virus surface antigen  ap. 5157-5163.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that modulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level, playing a crucial role in cell differentiation and development. Recently, some reports have shown that a limited number of mammalian microRNAs are also involved in anti-viral defense. In this study, the analysis of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome by the computer program MiRanda led to the identification of seven sites that are potential targets for human liver microRNAs. These sites were found to be clustered in a 995-bp segment within the viral polymerase ORF and the overlapping surface antigen ORF, and conserved among the most common HBV subtypes. The HBV genomic targets were then subjected to a validation test based on cultured hepatic cells (HepG2, HuH-7 and PLC/PRF/5) and luciferase reporter genes. In this test, one of the selected microRNAs, hsa-miR-125a-5p, was found to interact with the viral sequence and to suppress the reporter activity markedly. The microRNA was then shown to interfere with the viral translation, down-regulating the expression of the surface antigen. Overall, these results support the emerging concept that some mammalian microRNAs play a role in virus-host interaction. Furthermore, they provide the basis for the development of new strategies for anti-HBV intervention.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHepatitis B virus 3acell differentiation 3acomputer software 3agene expression 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahumans 3aliver 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aopen reading frames 3areporter genes 3asurface antigens1 aPapa, Umberto1 aMosca, Nicola1 aZerbini, Francesca1 aNobile, Valentina1 aRusso, Aniello0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 July, v. 39, no. 12 p.5157-5163x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkr0673Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110708  aNon-US 7aarticle02861naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010900163300001600272520131300288650001801601650002101619650002501640650001101665650003701676650002301713650001301736650002201749650001601771650002001787650003501807650001001842650001101852650002501863650001801888650000901906650001401915650001501929700001901944700002301963700002001986700002202006700003002028700002602058700002102084773010202105852000902207856006902216930003302285946001302318655001202331IND4389060720221120185210.0070318e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438906072DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-006-0082-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Luzhou 10aFaithful tissue-specific expression of the human chromosome 21-linked COL6A1 gene in BAC-transgenic mice  ap. 113-122.  aWe created transgenic mice with a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the human COL6A1 gene. In high-copy and low-copy transgenic lines, we found correct temporal and spatial expression of COL6A1 mRNA, paralleling the expression of the murine Col6a1 gene in a panel of nine adult and four fetal organs. The only exception was the fetal lung, in which the transgene was expressed poorly compared with the endogenous gene. Expression of COL6A1 mRNA from the transgene was copy number-dependent, and the increased gene dosage correlated with increased production of collagen VI alpha 1 in skin and heart, as indicated by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. COL6A1 maps to Chromosome 21 and this gene has been a candidate for contributing to cardiac defects and skin abnormalities in Down syndrome. The low-copy and high-copy COL6A1 transgenics were born and survived in normal Mendelian proportions, without cardiac malformations or altered skin histology. These data indicate that the major promoter and enhancer sequences regulating COL6A1 expression are present in this 167-kb BAC clone. The lack of a strong cardiac or skin phenotype in the COL6A1 BAC-transgenic mice suggests that the increased expression of this gene does not, by itself, account for these phenotypes in Down syndrome. 3aDown syndrome 3aWestern blotting 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3achromosome mapping 3acollagen 3aenhancer elements 3agene dosage 3agene expression 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheart 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aphenotype 3atransgenes1 aSalas, Martha 1 aLin, Chyuan-Sheng 1 aZigman, Warren 1 aSilverman, Wayne 1 aSubramaniyam, Shivakumar 1 aMurty, Vundavalli V. 1 aTycko, Benjamin 0 tMammalian genome.g2007 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.113-122dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-006-0082-y3electronic resource  a20070318b20070402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02683naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245009400208300001400302506007600316520120500392506003701597650001701634650001501651650001701666650001201683650001001695650002701705650002501732650001201757650000901769650001001778650001201788650001401800650001301814650002501827650002301852650001201875700002201887700002401909700002001933773010001953852000902053856006902062930003302131946001302164655001202177IND4387473320221207123959.0070204e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438747332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-006-0083-x2doi7 aPMC17941372pmcid7 a172428622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoschiavo, Maria 10aMapping and identification of candidate loci responsible for Peromyscus hybrid overgrowth  ap. 75-85.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCrosses between two recently diverged rodent species of the genus Peromyscus result in dramatic parent-of-origin effects on growth and development. P. maniculatus females crossed with P. polionotus males yield growth-retarded conceptuses, whereas the reciprocal cross results in overgrowth and lethality. These hybrid effects are particularly pronounced in the placenta. We previously detected linkage to two regions of the genome involved in the overgrowth effects. One locus, termed Peal, is a paternally expressed autosomal locus mapping to a domain whose house mouse equivalent contains several clusters of imprinted genes. The other locus, termed Mexl, maps to a gene-poor region of the X chromosome. Here we use an advanced intercross line to verify and narrow the regions of linkage and identify candidate genes for Mexl and Peal. While we have previously shown that Mexl affects both pre-and postnatal growth, we show here that Peal affects only prenatal growth. Utilizing criteria such as mutant phenotypes and allelic expression, we identify the loci encoding the homeobox protein Esx1 and the zinc-finger protein Pw1/Peg3 as candidates. Both loci exhibit expression changes in the hybrids.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMus musculus 3aPeromyscus 3aX chromosome 3afemales 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ahomeodomain proteins 3ahybrids 3aloci 3amales 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplacenta 3aprenatal development 3areciprocal crosses 3arodents1 aNguyen, Quang K. 1 aDuselis, Amanda R. 1 aVrana, Paul B. 0 tMammalian genome.g2007 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.75-85dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-006-0083-x3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03734naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001500166245010200181300001600283500002400299500001500323520193700338650001702275650002202292650002702314650001702341650001402358650001902372650002902391650001002420650002002430650002802450650002002478650001402498650002802512650001002540650002602550650002302576650002502599650002602624650001802650650003202668651001902700653002702719653001202746653002002758653001502778700001802793700001502811700001902826773009702845852000902942856008802951930003303039945002503072946001103097655001203108IND4401697420221120140207.0080219e20071215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440169742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL1001 aThakur, S.10aOccurrence of multidrug resistant Salmonella in antimicrobial-free (ABF) swine production systems  ap. 362-367.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella species in swine reared in the intensive (indoor) and extensive (outdoor) ABF production systems at farm and slaughter in North Carolina, U.S.A. We sampled a total of 279 pigs at farm (extensive 107; intensive 172) and collected 274 carcass swabs (extensive 124; intensive 150) at slaughter. Salmonella species were tested for their susceptibility against 12 antimicrobial agents using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Serogrouping was done using polyvalent and group specific antisera. A total of 400 salmonellae were isolated in this study with a significantly higher Salmonella prevalence from the intensive (30%) than the extensive farms (0.9%) (P < 0.001). At slaughter, significantly higher Salmonella was isolated at the pre- and post-evisceration stages from extensively (29% pre-evisceration and 33.3% post-evisceration) than the intensively (2% pre-evisceration and 6% post-evisceration) reared swine (P < 0.001). The isolates were clustered in six serogroups including B, C, E1, E4, G and R. Highest frequency of antimicrobial resistance was observed against tetracycline (78.5%) and streptomycin (31.5%). A total of 13 antimicrobial resistance patterns were observed including the pentaresistant strains with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline resistance pattern observed only among isolates from the intensive farms (n = 28) and all were serotype Salmonella typhimurium var. Copenhagen. In conclusion, this study shows that multidrug resistant Salmonella are prevalent in ABF production systems despite the absence of antimicrobial selection pressure. In addition, it also highlights the possible role played by slaughterhouse and other environmental factors in the contamination and dissemination of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella in ABF production systems. 3atetracycline 3aextensive farming 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3astreptomycin 3aslaughter 3aswine diseases 3amultiple drug resistance 3afarms 3arisk assessment 3aepidemiological studies 3aslaughterhouses 3aserotypes 3apathogen identification 3aswine 3aantibiotic resistance 3adisease prevalence 3adisease transmission 3aenvironmental factors 3asalmonellosis 3aintensive livestock farming 3aNorth Carolina 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0astrains 0afarming systems 0aSalmonella1 aTadesse, D.A.1 aMorrow, M.1 aGebreyes, W.A.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2007 Dec. 15, v. 125, no. 3-4 p.362-367dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.05.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080522b20080606c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/04/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03683naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002200182245014700204300001800351500002400369506007600393520168000469506003702149650002102186650001602207650001402223650001402237650001302251650002202264650001402286650001402300650002002314650001802334650001002352650001402362650001102376650002402387650001302411650001402424650005002438650002502488650003102513650002602544650001302570650002502583650005502608650004802663650005202711650002602763700002102789700002102810773011502831852000902946856008102955856003303036655001203069IND4394070420221207121356.0070812e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439407042DNAL7 a175565122pmid7 aPMC19498752pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.107.0967272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiyama, Akifumi10aInvolvement of a Soybean ATP-Binding Cassette-Type Transporter in the Secretion of Genistein, a Signal Flavonoid in Legume-Rhizobium Symbiosis  ap. 2000-2008.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLegume plants have an ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen into nutrients via symbiosis with soil microbes. As the initial event of the symbiosis, legume plants secrete flavonoids into the rhizosphere to attract rhizobia. Secretion of flavonoids is indispensable for the establishment of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, but almost nothing is known about the membrane transport mechanism of flavonoid secretion from legume root cells. In this study, we performed biochemical analyses to characterize the transport mechanism of flavonoid secretion using soybean (Glycine max) in which genistein is a signal flavonoid. Plasma membrane vesicles prepared from soybean roots showed clear transport activity of genistein in an ATP-dependent manner. This transport activity was inhibited by sodium orthovanadate, a typical inhibitor of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, but was hardly affected by various ionophores, such as gramicidin D, nigericin, or valinomycin, suggesting involvement of an ABC transporter in the secretion of flavonoids from soybean roots. The Km and Vmax values of this transport were calculated to be 158 μM and 322 pmol mg protein⁻¹ min⁻¹, respectively. Competition experiments using various flavonoids of both aglycone and glucoside varieties suggested that this ABC-type transporter recognizes genistein and daidzein, another signaling compound in soybean root exudates, as well as other isoflavonoid aglycones as its substrates. Transport activity was constitutive regardless of the availability of nitrogen nutrition. This is, to our knowledge, the first biochemical characterization of the membrane transport of flavonoid secretion from roots.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aABC transporters 3aGlycine max 3agenistein 3anigericin 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aplasma membrane 3aroot exudates 3aroots 3asecretion 3asodium 3asoil microorganisms 3asoybeans 3asymbiosis 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxmetabolism 2aBinding, Competitive 2aBradyrhizobiumxphysiology 2aGenisteinxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSecretory Vesiclesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSoybeansxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSymbiosisxphysiology1 aShitan, Nobukazu1 aYazaki, Kazufumi0 tPlant physiology.g2007 Aug., v. 144, no. 4 p.2000-2008dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.0967273Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle02828naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001200186245008600198300001600284500002400300500001500324520045500339650001500794650002200809650001300831650003200844650002300876650000900899650002500908650003800933650001200971650002500983650002001008650002401028650001201052650004001064650007301104650003501177650005101212650001801263650002301281650002201304650004101326650000901367650005001376650001701426650007701443650002801520650003201548650003701580653002801617653001001645700001801655700001601673700001401689700001301703700001401716700001801730700001701748700001701765700001301782773009401795852000901889856008901898930003301987945002502020946001302045655001202058IND4401697020221120131315.0080219e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440169702DNAL7 a178700702pmid7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2007.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL8101 aJia, H.10aBabesia gibsoni: Identification of an immunodominant, interspersed repeat antigen  ap. 146-149.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this report, an immunodominant antigen called BgIRA from Babesia gibsoni is identified and described.

The specificity and sensitivity of the rBgIRA in an ELISA indicated that this antigen might be useful in a diagnostic test. 3ababesiosis 3acomplementary DNA 3aantigens 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3aantibody detection 3adogs 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aintrons 3arepetitive sequences 3aBabesia gibsoni 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxbiosynthesis 2aAntigens, Protozoanxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aBabesiaxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBabesiosisxdiagnosisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aBlotting, Western 2aDog Diseasesxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aDogs 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aGene Library 2aImmunodominant Epitopesxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes1 aTerkawi, M.A.1 aAboge, G.O.1 aGoo, Y.K.1 aZhou, J.1 aLee, E.G.1 aNishikawa, Y.1 aIgarashi, I.1 aFujisaki, K.1 aXuan, X.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2008 Jan., v. 118, no. 1 p.146-149dElsevierx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2007.07.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100827b20100903c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/04/14  aOther US 7aarticle03039naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100001800140245010800158300001400266520174400280650001302024650001902037650002002056650002602076650001202102650001102114650002302125650001202148650001102160650000902171650001702180700002002197700002602217700002402243700001802267700002602285700002502311700002602336700002102362773006302383852000902446856008002455939003302535946001302568655001202581IND4436897720221120115621.0100513e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443689772DNAL7 a10.1038/oby.2009.1952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrassi, Guido10aStructural and Functional Alterations of Subcutaneous Small Resistance Arteries in Severe Human Obesity  ap. 92-98.  aObese persons are at increased cardiovascular risk and exhibit increased arterial stiffness and impaired endothelial function of large- and medium-size arteries. We hypothesized that normotensive subjects suffering from severe obesity would also present remodeling and endothelial dysfunction of small resistance arteries. A total of 16 lean (age: 49.6 ± 2.9 years, BMI: 22.9 ± 0.3 kg/m2, mean ± s.e.m.) and 17 age-matched severely obese (BMI: 41.1 ± 2.3 kg/m2) normotensive subjects were investigated. None had glucose or lipid metabolic abnormalities except for insulin resistance. Resistance arteries, dissected from abdominal subcutaneous tissue, were assessed on a pressurized myograph. For superimposable blood pressure, the media thickness, media cross-sectional area (CSA), and media-to-lumen ratio values of resistance arteries were markedly and significantly greater in obese compared to lean subjects (media thickness 26.3 ± 0.6 vs. 16.2 ± 0.6 µm, CSA 22,272 ± 1,339 vs. 15,183 ± 1,186 µm2, and media-to-lumen ratio 0.113 ± 0.006 vs. 0.059 ± 0.001, respectively, P < 0.01). Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was impaired in vessels from obese subjects compared to the lean individuals (−40.4 ± 1.3%, P < 0.01), whereas endothelium-independent vasorelaxation was similar in all groups. Stiffness of small arteries as assessed by the stress/strain relationship was similar in lean and severely obese subjects. We conclude that severe human obesity is associated with profound alterations in structural and functional characteristics of small arteries, which may be responsible for the presence of elevated cardiovascular risk and increased incidence of coronary, cerebrovascular and renal events reported in obesity. 3aarteries 3ablood pressure 3abody mass index 3afunctional properties 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3apeople 3arisk 3avasodilation1 aSeravalle, Gino1 aScopelliti, Francesco1 aDell'Oro, Raffaella1 aFattori, Luca1 aQuarti-Trevano, Fosca1 aBrambilla, Gianmaria1 aSchiffrin, Ernesto L.1 aMancia, Giuseppe0 tObesity.g2010 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.92-98x1930-73817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.1953Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120607  aOther US 7aarticle02319naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002300129245015200152300001800304520097800322650001001300650002301310650001201333650001201345650002001357650001201377650002201389650002801411650002001439650002801459650002101487650001901508650003101527650003001558653004001588700001901628700002501647700001701672700001901689773008501708852000901793930003301802945001301835946001301848655001201861IND2332262020221120115649.0030429e200212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233226202DNAL7 a124772062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez Orsi, R.10aOn-line preconcentration and determination of cadmium in honey using knotted reactor coupled to flow injection-flame atomic absorption spectrometry  ap. 1410-1414.  aAn on-line cadmium preconcentration and determination system implemented with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) associated with flow injection was studied. Cadmium was retained as Cd-2-(5-bromo-2-pyridylazo)-5-diethylaminophenol Cd-(5-Br-PADAP) complex, pH 9.3. The Cd complex was removed from the knotted reactor (KR) with ethanol. A total enhancement factor of 140 was obtained with respect to FAAS (40 for KR and 3.5 due to the use of ethanol) with preconcentration time of 120 s. The detection limit value for preconcentration of 1 g sample was 0.5 ng/g. The repeatability for 10 replicate determinations at 5.0 ng/g Cd level was 3.5% relative standard deviation, calculated from peak heights obtained. The calibration graph using the preconcentration system for Cd was linear with a correlation coefficient of 0.9990 at levels near the detection limits to at least 2000 ng/g. The method was successfully applied to determination of total Cd in honey samples. 3ahoney 3afood contamination 3acadmium 2aAnimals 2aBeesxchemistry 2aBuffers 2aCadmiumxanalysis 2aFlow Injection Analysis 2aHoneyxanalysis 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aOnline Systems 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 0aatomic absorption spectrophotometry1 aWuilloud, R.G.1 aWuilloud, J.C.A. de.1 aOlsina, R.A.1 aMartinez, L.D.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2002 , v. 85, no. 6 p.1410-1414x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02344naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009800166300001600264520118200280650001601462650001001478650002001488650000901508650001101517650002701528650002001555650002801575700002301603700002101626700002401647700002501671700001901696773010301715852000901818856008501827930003301912946001301945655001201958IND4397147620221120110331.0071028e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439714762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-007-9058-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDierks, Claudia 10aGenome-wide search for markers associated with osteochondrosis in Hanoverian warmblood horses  ap. 739-747.  aA genome-wide scan was performed to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for osteochondrosis (OC) and osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) in horses. The marker set comprised 260 microsatellites. We collected data from 211 Hanoverian warmblood horses consisting of 14 paternal half-sib families. Traits used were OC (fetlock and/or hock joints affected), OCD (fetlock and/or hock joints affected), fetlock OC, fetlock OCD, hock OC, and hock OCD. The first genome scan included 172 microsatellite markers. In a second step 88 additional markers were chosen to refine putative QTLs found in the first scan. Genome-wide significant QTLs were located on equine chromosomes 2, 4, 5, and 16. QTLs for fetlock OC and hock OC partly overlapped on the same chromosomes, indicating that these traits may be genetically related. QTLs reached the chromosome-wide significance level on eight different equine chromosomes: 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 19, and 21. This whole-genome scan was a first step toward the identification of candidate genome regions harboring genes responsible for equine OC. Further investigations are necessary to refine the map positions of the QTLs already identified for OC. 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahock 3ahorses 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aosteochondrosis 3aquantitative trait loci1 aLöhring, Kathrin 1 aLampe, Virginie 1 aWittwer, Catherine 1 aDrögemüller, Cord 1 aDistl, Ottmar 0 tMammalian genome.g2007 Oct., v. 18, no. 10 p.739-747dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-007-9058-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02747naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002600142245014000168300001600308500002400324520137900348650002201727650002001749650001101769650001701780650003101797650001101828650001901839650001401858650002301872650001001895650001601905650001101921650002001932650002501952650001801977650002501995650002102020700002102041700002202062700002402084773012702108852000902235856004502244655001202289IND4429712820100101232636.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442971282DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2009001022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeed Akram, Muhammad10aGrowth and photosynthesis of salt-stressed sunflower (Helianthus annuus) plants as affected by foliar-applied different potassium salts  ap. 884-893.  aIncludes references  aIn order to assess the effectiveness of foliar-applied potassium (K⁺, 1.25%) using different salts (KCl, KOH, K₂CO₃, KNO₃, KH₂PO₄, and K₂SO₄) in ameliorating the inhibitory effect of salt stress on sunflower plants, a greenhouse experiment was conducted. Sodium chloride (150 mM) was applied through the rooting medium to 18 d-old plants and after 1 week of salt treatment; different K⁺-containing salts were applied twice in 1-week interval as a foliar spray. Salt stress adversely affected the growth, yield components, gas exchange, and water relations, and also caused nutrient imbalance in sunflower plants. However, foliar-applied different sources of potassium improved shoot and root fresh and shoot dry weights, achene yield, 100-achene weight, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, water-use efficiency, relative water content, and leaf and root K⁺ concentrations of sunflower plants grown under saline conditions. Under nonsaline conditions, improvement in shoot fresh weight, achene yield, 100-achene weight, photosynthetic and transpiration rates, and root Na⁺ concentration was observed due to foliar-applied different K sources. Of the different salts, K₂SO₄, KH₂PO₄, KNO₃, and K₂CO₃ were more effective than KCl and KOH in improving growth and some key physiological processes of sunflower plants. 3aHelianthus annuus 3afoliar spraying 3afruits 3agas exchange 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3aroots 3asalt stress 3ashoots 3asodium chloride 3astomatal conductance 3awater content 3awater use efficiency 3ayield components1 aAshraf, Muhammad1 aShahbaz, Muhammad1 aAisha Akram, Nudrat0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2009 Dec., v. 172, no. 6 p.884-893dWiley-VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200900102 7aarticle02979naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245010800162300002100270500001500291520177000306650002302076650001102099650002202110650002302132650001802155650001202173650001302185650001302198650001502211650001702226651001502243653001802258653001002276653001302286700001802299700001802317773011802335852000902453930003302462945002502495946001302520655001202533IND4376709220221117172555.0051216e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437670922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W07004 (15 p.  a2019-12-05  aTo quantify short-term sediment movement rates across Mojave Desert piedmonts, 1600 painted and numbered pebbles were laid out in paired, orthogonal, 20 m lines at 4 sites and resurveyed five times over 2 years and revisited 2 years later. Pebble lines cross shallow (5-15 cm), ephemeral channels and adjacent unconsolidated interfluves, the latter being the dominant landform at all sites. Two sites are located on surfaces that have been or are impacted by military training activities, including the use of tracked vehicles. The two other sites have not been disturbed by human impact. Three different processes transport pebbles. Episodic streamflow in ephemeral channels transports a few pebbles long distances (decimeters to meters) down gradient. Bioturbation moves many pebbles small distances (centimeters) in any direction, and vehicular disturbance transports pebbles varying distances (centimeters to meters) in any direction. Significant down-gradient sediment movement occurred dominantly in channels where flowing water was concentrated. Interfluves were stable surfaces where little transport occurred. Off-road vehicle use is coincident with accelerated pebble movement. Pebbles moved further and faster down gradient at the disturbed Iron Mountain and East Range Road sites (mean speeds of 0.18 and 0.34 m yr(-1), respectively) than at the undisturbed Chemehuevi and Goldstone sites, (mean speeds of 0.17 and 0.02 m yr(-1), respectively). Mean pebble movement is highly and negatively correlated with vegetation density. Short-term pebble movement rates are several times lower than long-term (10(3) to 10(4) year) rates, suggesting the importance of rare, extreme precipitation events for sediment transport such as those of fall and winter 2004. 3atemporal variation 3abasins 3aephemeral streams 3asediment transport 3asoil movement 3adeserts 3avelocity 3apiedmont 3avegetation 3abioturbation 3aCalifornia 0aprecipitation 0aslope 0avehicles1 aNichols, K.K.1 aBierman, P.R.0 tWater resources research.g2005 July, v. 41, no. 7 p.W07004 (15 p-W07004 (15 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/19  aOther US 7aarticle02744naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245012300168300001600291500002400307520143800331650001201769650001201781650002101793650001301814650001401827650002301841650002401864650002201888650001701910650002401927650001201951650001101963650001101974700001901985700001802004700002202022700001902044700002202063700001902085773009602104852000902200856008902209655001202298IND4407219320221117162342.0080627s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440721932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2008.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukyai, Prakit10aComparing soluble and co-immobilized catalysts for 2-ketoaldose production by pyranose 2-oxidase and auxiliary enzymes  ap. 281-290.  aIncludes references  aThe tri-enzyme system pyranose 2-oxidase (P2O), laccase, and catalase was used to study major parameters in the homogeneous and heterogeneous application of a multi-component enzymatic machinery. P2O oxidizes aldoses to 2-ketosugars, which are interesting intermediates in carbohydrate chemistry, and concomitantly reduces oxygen or alternative electron acceptors. The enzyme was immobilized on eleven agarose or acrylic resins using various coupling methods. The binding capacity was determined and an acrylic carrier with the most suitable properties selected for detailed studies. As P2O shows higher turnover numbers with the electron acceptor 1,4-benzoquinone than with oxygen, the use of this alternative electron acceptor was enabled by employing laccase for the continuous reoxidation of hydroquinone. The laccase regeneration system was found to increase the specific productivity up to 3-fold. Catalase was used to disproportionate the formed hydrogen peroxide in close proximity to the oxygen consuming enzymes and applied in different amounts to adjust the hydrogen peroxide concentration, which was found to be the main reason for enzyme deactivation under turnover conditions. In contrast to homogeneous catalysis, the specific productivity of heterogeneous catalysts under the applied experimental conditions was limited primarily by oxygen transfer, an effect significantly reduced by the laccase regeneration system. 3aagarose 3aaldoses 3abinding capacity 3acatalase 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme inactivation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroquinone 3aimmobilized enzymes 3alaccase 3aoxygen 3aresins1 aRezić, Tonči1 aLorenz, Cindy1 aMueangtoom, Kitti1 aLorenz, Werner1 aHaltrich, Dietmar1 aLudwig, Roland0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2008 June 30, v. 135, no. 3 p.281-290dElsevierx0168-16567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2008.04.0023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03170naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245011900168300001400287500002400301520197500325650001702300650001502317650001102332650001302343650002302356650004302379650001202422650002002434650001202454650003702466650001302503650001102516650001302527650002202540700001702562773009602579852000902675856008802684655001202772IND4407442620221123034503.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440744262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.03.0872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegro, Scott S.10aSol-gel methyl coating in capillary microextraction hyphenated on-line with high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 62-71.  aIncludes references  aA sol-gel coating with anchored methyl groups was developed for capillary microextraction hyphenated on-line with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This was accomplished by using methyltrimethoxysilane as the sol-gel precursor. The methyl group on the sol-gel precursor ultimately turned into a pendant group on the created sol-gel coating and was primarily responsible for the extraction of nonpolar analytes. A 40-cm segment of 0.25mm I.D. fused silica capillary containing the sol-gel methyl coating on the inner surface was installed as a sampling loop in an HPLC injection port. The analytes were extracted by the coating when an aqueous sample containing the analytes was passed through this capillary. The extracted analytes were then transferred to the HPLC column using isocratic elution with an acetonitrile/water mobile phase. This capillary demonstrated excellent extraction capability for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ketones. Unexpectedly, this coating also provided good extraction for polar analytes, including aromatic phenols, alcohols, and amines. Considering the fact that the methyl group is nonpolar in nature, such an extraction behavior of sol-gel methyl coating toward polar analytes is counterintuitive. Thus, sol-gel sorbents with short alkyl side chains have the potential to offer a polymer-free alternative to traditional sol-gel capillary microextraction (CME) media commonly prepared with the use of polymers in the sol solution. Elimination of polymers from the sol-gel coating solution is conducive to improving thermal stability and solvent tolerance of the created sol-gel extracting phase. This also makes the preparation of sol-gel coatings facile and cost-effective. Possessing excellent solvent stability, such sol-gel coatings offer the opportunity for effective on-line hyphenation of capillary microextraction with HPLC and other liquid-phase separation techniques that employ organo-aqueous mobile phases. 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorbents 3aamines 3acoatings 3acost effectiveness 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aketones 3amicroextraction 3aphenols 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3apolymers 3asilica 3asolvents 3athermal stability1 aMalik, Abdul0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 July 18, v. 1200, no. 1 p.62-71dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.03.0873Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02742naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002300148245010100171300001200272500002400284520174200308650003302050650001102083650002002094650002102114650001302135650001102148650002302159650002002182700002302202773009402225852000902319856008802328655001202416IND4407442020221123034354.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440744202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.02.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayward, Taylor C.10aNovel on-column and inverted operating modes of a microcounter-current flame ionization detector  ap. 2-7.  aIncludes references  aImproved operating modes of a microcounter-current flame ionization detector (μFID) are demonstrated. By operating the flame inside the end of a capillary gas chromatography (GC) column, the effective cell volume enclosing the flame is considerably reduced and results in significantly lower gas flows being required to produce optimal sensitivity from the stable flame. For instance, in this mode the tiny counter-current flame is situated “upside down” inside the column on the end of a stainless steel capillary delivering 4mL/min of oxygen and is stabilized by a counter flow of only 10mL/min of hydrogen carrier gas. Under these approximately fourfold reduced gas flow conditions, the μFID carbon response is linear over almost 5 orders of magnitude and yields a detection limit of 6x10⁻¹⁰ gC/s. These figures agree well with those reported for the original μFID, which also similarly operated under hydrogen-rich conditions. To better simulate the oxygen-rich environment of a conventional FID flame, a novel “inverted” counter-current flow mode was also investigated. In this post-column μFID arrangement, a very lean flame is now situated on the end of a stainless steel capillary delivering 10mL/min of hydrogen, which is opposed by a counter-current flow of only 20mL/min of oxygen. The μFID detection limit obtained in this stable, oxygen-rich counter-current flame mode is 7x10⁻¹¹ gC/s with a response that is linear over almost 6 orders of magnitude. These findings are more comparable to those of a conventional FID. Overall, the low-flow sensitive μFID operating modes presented demonstrate that this detector may be potentially useful for adaptation to portable devices and related GC applications. 3acapillary gas chromatography 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3aflame ionization 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3aportable equipment 3astainless steel1 aThurbide, Kevin B.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 July 18, v. 1200, no. 1 p.2-7dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.02.0533Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03472naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245009400166300001400260500002400274520258400298650001902882650002002901650001502921650001802936700001602954700001902970773009602989852000903085856008803094655001203182IND4407441920221123034306.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440744192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarynuk, J.J.10aModulation-induced error in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic separations  ap. 17-27.  aIncludes references  aThere is a fundamental difference between data collected in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic (GCxGC) separations and data collected by one-dimensional GC techniques (or heart-cut GC techniques). This difference can be ascribed to the fact that GCxGC generates multiple sub-peaks for each analyte, as opposed to other GC techniques that generate only a single chromatographic peak for each analyte. In order to calculate the total signal for the analyte, the most commonly used approach is to consider the cumulative area that results from the integration of each sub-peak. Alternately, the data may be considered using higher order techniques such as the generalized rank annihilation method (GRAM). Regardless of the approach, the potential errors are expected to be greater for trace analytes where the sub-peaks are close to the limit of detection (LOD). This error is also expected to be compounded with phase-induced error, a phenomenon foreign to the measurement of single peaks. Here these sources of error are investigated for the first time using both the traditional integration-based approach and GRAM analysis. The use of simulated data permits the sources of error to be controlled and independently evaluated in a manner not possible with real data. The results of this study show that the error introduced by the modulation process is at worst 1% for analyte signals with a base peak height of 10xLOD and either approach to quantitation is used. Errors due to phase shifting are shown to be of greater concern, especially for trace analytes with only one or two visible sub-peaks. In this case, the error could be as great as 6.4% for symmetrical peaks when a conventional integration approach is used. This is contrasted by GRAM which provides a much more precise result, at worst 1.8% and 0.6% when the modulation ratio (M R) is 1.5 or 3.0, respectively for symmetrical peaks. The data show that for analyses demanding high precision, a M R of 3 should be targeted as a minimum, especially if multivariate techniques are to be used so as to maintain data density in the primary dimension. For rapid screening techniques where precision is not as critical lower M R values can be tolerated. When integration is used, if there are 4-5 visible sub-peaks included for a symmetrical peak at M R =3.0, the data will be reasonably free from phase-shift-induced errors or a negative bias. At M R =1.5, at least 3 sub-peaks must be included for a symmetrical peak. The proposed guidelines should be equally relevant to LCxLC and other similar techniques. 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aguidelines 3arapid methods1 aKwong, A.H.1 aMarriott, P.J.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 July 18, v. 1200, no. 1 p.17-27dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.03.0083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02629naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001900136245013900155300001600294500002400310520145500334650002401789650002001813650002201833650002401855650002001879650001401899650002001913650001701933650001501950650000901965651002101974700001701995700001702012700001502029773011402044852000902158856007602167655001202243IND4407364220221123034346.0080627s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440736422DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.11052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaoyong10aEffects of large woody debris on surface structure and aquatic habitat in forested streams, southern interior British Columbia, Canada  ap. 862-875.  aIncludes references  aIt is well known that large woody debris (LWD) plays an important functional role in aquatic organisms' life. However, the influence of LWD on channel morphology and aquatic environments at watershed levels is still unclear. The relationships between wood and surface structure and aquatic habitat in 35 first through fifth order streams of southern interior British Columbia were investigated. Study streams in the channel networks of the study watersheds were classified into four size categories based on stream order and bankfull width: Stream size I: bankfull width was less than 3 m, Stream size II: 3-5 m, Stream size III: 5-7 m, Stream size IV: larger than 7 m. We found the number of functional pieces increased with stream size and wood surface area in stream sizes I, II and III (24, 28 and 25 m²/100 m², respectively) was significantly higher than that in stream size IV (12 m²/100 m²). The contribution of wood pieces to pool formation was 75% and 85% in stream sizes II and III, respectively, which was significantly higher than those in stream size I (50%) and size IV (25%). Between 21% and 25% of wood pieces were associated with storing sediment, and between 20% and 29% of pieces were involved in channel bank stability in all study streams. Due to long-term interactions, LWD in the intermediate sized streams (Size II and III) exhibited much effect on channel surface structure and aquatic habitats in the studied watersheds. 3aaquatic environment 3aaquatic habitat 3aaquatic organisms 3acoarse woody debris 3aforest habitats 3asediments 3astream channels 3asurface area 3awatersheds 3awood 3aBritish Columbia1 aWei, Xiaohua1 aScherer, Rob1 aHogan, Dan0 tRiver research and applications.g2008 July, v. 24, no. 6 p.862-875dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.11053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02638naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245013700154300001600291500002400307520155600331650001701887650002901904650002401933650002301957650002001980650002602000650001302026650002302039650001102062700002802073773011402101852000902215856007602224655001202300IND4407363920221123031048.0080627s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440736392DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.10922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaunio, Janne10aSample size determination for soft-bottom sampling in large rivers and comparison with the chironomid pupal exuvial technique (CPET)  ap. 835-843.  aIncludes references  aOur objective in this study was to determine the adequate sample size for the use of grab sampling in the biomonitoring of large soft-bottom rivers. We also compared two sampling methods, grab sampling and the Chironomid Pupal Exuvial Technique (CPET), in detecting anthropogenic impacts in a large boreal river and assessed the degree of concordance between the two data sets. Sample size determination showed that, at the lowest possible taxonomic level, a minimum of eight benthic samples was required to obtain a reliable picture of benthic communities. When using the CPET, the number of chironomid species was nearly twice that of all benthic macroinvertebrates in the grab samples. In addition, a majority of the chironomid species found in the grab samples was also detected using the CPET. Although both data sets indicated significant differences in benthic communities between the sampling sites in the river Kymi, a Mantel test showed that patterns in community composition were not concordant. This was mainly because benthic samples from the deep depositional areas of the river indicated poorer ecological status than did the CPET data, which integrate species from various depths and habitats. Thus, samples from a single macrohabitat may not adequately represent environmental conditions of large rivers. Overall, our results suggest that the CPET provides a reliable and cost-effective alternative, or a supplementary assessment tool, to more traditional sampling methods when assessing anthropogenic stresses in large boreal rivers. 3aChironomidae 3aanthropogenic activities 3acommunity structure 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3arivers1 aAnttila-Huhtinen, Marja0 tRiver research and applications.g2008 July, v. 24, no. 6 p.835-843dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.10923Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03041naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245023200164300001400396500002400410520172100434650002602155650001502181650001902196650002002215650001502235650001002250650002302260650001402283650002202297650002402319650001802343650001102361650001702372650001602389700001802405700001702423773009402440852000902534856008802543655001202631IND4407210120221123000748.0080627s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440721012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.05.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSha, Yunfei10aDevelopment of C₁₈-functionalized magnetic silica nanoparticles as sample preparation technique for the determination of ergosterol in cigarettes by microwave-assisted derivatization and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  ap. 27-33.  aIncludes references  aErgosterol is one of the important precursors of tumorigenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. A large amount of ergosterol is present in mildewy cigarettes, which derives from fungal contaminations. In this paper, a novel approach based on C₁₈-functionalized magnetic silica nanoparticles (C₁₈-f-MS NPs) coupled with microwave-assisted derivatization and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was developed for the rapid enrichment and determination of ergosterol in cigarettes. Due to that, microwave-assisted derivatization requires very short time (several minutes), and the extraction and concentration of ergosterol become the key step in the sample preparation process. In this study, the prepared C₁₈-f-MS NPs with its unique properties (high surface area and strong magnetism) provided an efficient way for extraction and concentration of ergosterol in the samples. Additionally, the analyte of ergosterol adsorbed with C₁₈-f-MS NPs in cigarettes can be simply and rapidly isolated (only about 2s) through placing a strong magnet on the bottom of container. In this work, different parameters such as added amounts of C₁₈-f-MS NPs, extraction temperature, and extraction time were optimized to enhance the extraction efficiency. Method validations (linear range, detection limit, precision, and recovery) were also studied. The results obtained by the optimal conditions showed that the proposed method based on C₁₈-f-MS NPs was a simple, high efficient, and had a rapid approach for the enrichment of ergosterol in cigarettes and was successfully applied to the analysis of ergosterol in normal and mildewy cigarettes followed by microwave-assisted derivatization and GC/MS. 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3acigarettes 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3aergosterol 3afungi 3agas chromatography 3amagnetism 3amass spectrometry 3amicrowave treatment 3ananoparticles 3asilica 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aDeng, Chunhui1 aLiu, Baizhan0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 July 11, v. 1198-1199 p.27-33dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.05.0493Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02403naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245015100171300001600322520129300338650001201631650002801643650001601671650001601687650001301703650000901716650001401725700002401739700002401763700002401787773010201811852000901913856008501922930003302007946001302040655001202053IND4393555920221122224842.0070729e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439355592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-007-9013-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonder, Christine A. 10aGenetic architecture of fear conditioning in chromosome substitution strains: relationship to measures of innate (unlearned) anxiety-like behavior  ap. 221-228.  aWe measured fear conditioning (FC) in a panel of chromosome substitution strains (CSS) created using the C57BL/6J (B6) and A/J (AJ) inbred strains. Mice were trained to associate a specific context and tone with a foot shock. FC was measured by observing freezing behavior during re-exposure to the context and tone. Freezing to context was more than twofold greater in the AJ strain relative to the B6 strain. Among the CSS we identified four strains with higher (CSS-6, -10, -11, and -18) and two strains with lower (CSS-7 and -14) freezing to context. CSS-10 and -18 also showed higher freezing to tone, while CSS-12 showed less freezing to tone. CSS-1 has been implicated in open-field (OF) and light-dark box (LDB); we observed significant activity differences prior to training but no differences in FC. Chromosomes 6 and 10 have been associated with differences in anxiety-like behaviors, suggesting the existence of pleiotropic alleles that influence both learned and innate fear. By utilizing a genetic reference population, we have identified chromosomes that pleiotropically influence multiple phenotypes hypothesized to reflect a common ethologic construct that has been termed emotionality. The CSS provide a straightforward means of isolating the underlying genetic factors. 3aalleles 3achromosome substitution 3achromosomes 3afearfulness 3afreezing 3amice 3aphenotype1 aMunoz, Michaelanne 1 aGilliam, T.

The original confirmatory method for moxidectin in cattle fat, the target tissue for regulatory purposes, was LC with mass spectrometry (MS) using thermospray (TSP) ionization and selected ion monitoring. As newer ionization techniques for LC/MS made TSP obsolete and with the availability of a new generation of benchtop LC/MS instrumentation, the confirmation of moxidectin in cattle fat was re-evaluated. The ionization techniques of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization versus electrospray ionization, the detection techniques of single-stage MS versus tandem MS, and the instrumentation of ion trap versus quadrupole were investigated. The final confirmatory method was based on full-scan single-stage MS. Even with full-scan detection, the analysis required at least 10-fold less extract than the original TSP method. The applicability of this new confirmatory method was demonstrated on both ion trap and quadrupole instruments. 3acattle 3aanimal fats and oils 3amoxidectin 3adrug residues 3adetection 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aionization 2aAdipose Tissuexchemistry 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aCattle 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aMacrolides 2aMass Spectrometry 0aevaluation 0atest procedure 0adetermination1 aWickremesinhe, E.1 aDaCunha, A.R.1 aKhunachak, A.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2000 , v. 83, no. 6 p.1446-1450x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03079naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245013000165300001400295500002400309520172700333650001702060650001402077650001202091650001802103650001602121650001702137650001902154650002002173650002302193650002302216650001102239650001102250650001002261650001402271650001802285650002002303650003202323650001202355700001302367700001802380700002002398773009402418852000902512856008802521655001202609IND4407210220221122214015.0080627s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440721022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2008.05.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Huaqing10aField analysis of acetaldehyde in mainstream tobacco smoke using solid-phase microextraction and a portable gas chromatograph  ap. 34-37.  aIncludes references  aAcetaldehyde is generated in the mainstream tobacco smoke mainly from the pyrolysis (and oxidative pyrolysis) of carbohydrates that are present in tobacco plant, cigarette paper, and also used as additives in tobacco. Acetaldehyde has been classified as an animal carcinogen, and may be cytotoxic or genetoxic. Owing to its high volatility and reactivity, it is difficult to accurately measure it, especially on site. In this work, a novel analytical method based on collection and simultaneous derivatization in water, solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and portable gas chromatography (GC) analysis has been developed for the field and rapid analysis of acetaldehyde in the mainstream tobacco smoke. In the proposed method, acetaldehyde in mainstream tobacco smoke was collected in 1ml water, and derivatizated with O-2,3,4,5,6-(pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine. The formed acetaldehyde oximes were headspace extracted by a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fiber at 30°C for 10min, with a stirring rate of 1100rpm. The acetaldehyde oximes extracted on the fiber were desorbed and analyzed rapidly by portable GC. The method validations including detection limit, recovery, precision and linearity were studied. It was found that the proposed method required the whole analysis time 27min, and provided low detection limit of 0.04774mg/ml, good recovery of 85%, RSD value 6.7%, and linear range 0.0716-0.7160mg/ml (r ² =0.997). The obtained results demonstrated that SPME-portable GC is a simple, rapid and solvent-free method for the field analysis of acetaldehyde. Finally, the proposed method was further applied to the quantification of acetaldehyde in mainstream tobacco smoke of five different brands. 3aacetaldehyde 3aadditives 3aanimals 3acarbohydrates 3acarcinogens 3acytotoxicity 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3amixing 3aoximes 3apaper 3apyrolysis 3arapid methods 3asmoking (habit) 3asolid phase microextraction 3atobacco1 aYe, Qing1 aDeng, Chunhui1 aZhang, Xiangmin0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 July 11, v. 1198-1199 p.34-37dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2008.05.0503Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02485naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245016100142300001800303520094500321650002301266650001501289650002301304650001501327650001401342650001801356650001601374650003301390650002701423650002101450650002401471650003301495650002001528650003201548650002601580651001201606651001201618653001501630653001901645653001901664653001001683653002801693700001801721700001701739700001601756700001801772773008501790852000901875930003301884945001301917946001301930655001201943IND2206362220221122214046.0000810e199912  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220636222DNAL7 a105894962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, J.10aMultiresidue analysis of pesticides in fresh fruits and vegetables using procedures developed by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services  ap. 1419-1435.  aImproved quality and efficiency of pesticide residue analysis were achieved by examining all aspects of the laboratory process.

Sample size and solvent consumption were reduced with the new method. Custom glassware racks and disposable supplies reduced overall analysis time. Gravity-fed, solid-phase extraction simplified sample preparation and provided cleaner extracts for gas chromatographic analyses. Modifications to the method were made to achieve the ruggedness needed to maintain quality objectives during routine analysis. Instrumental improvements, including new selective detectors, retention time locking, and mass spectrometry screening for all samples, provided the laboratory with efficient, reliable, and confirmed analytical results. 3afood contamination 3apesticides 3apesticide residues 3amonitoring 3adetection 2aAcetonitriles 2aAgriculture 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aFruitxchemistry 2aGovernment Agencies 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aQuality Control 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aVegetablesxchemistry 3aFlorida 0aFlorida 0aevaluation 0atest procedure 0afresh products 0afruit 0aacetonitrile extraction1 aBeckett, M.P.1 aReliford, B.1 aHammock, W.1 aEngel, Malka.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g1999 , v. 82, no. 6 p.1419-1435x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03259naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002100141245017000162300001800332500001500350520161900365650001701984650001802001650002602019650002202045650001202067650001602079650001102095650001402106650001202120650001702132650002002149650002202169650002002191650001202211650003002223650001802253653002002271700002102291700002202312700002102334700002402355700003502379700002002414700002802434700001702462700002002479773007202499852000902571856008102580939003302661946001102694655001202705IND4459771620221122214108.0110708e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445977162DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwr0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGustafsson, Anki10aPichia pastoris-produced mucin-type fusion proteins with multivalent O-glycan substitution as targeting molecules for mannose-specific receptors of the immune system  ap. 1071-1086.  a2019-12-04  aMannose-binding proteins like the macrophage mannose receptor (MR), the dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) play crucial roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Immunoglobulin fusion proteins of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1/mIgG₂b) carrying mostly O-glycans and, as a control, the α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP/mIgG₂b) carrying mainly N-linked glycans were stably expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Pichia pastoris-produced PSGL-1/mIgG₂b was shown to carry O-glycans that mediated strong binding to mannose-specific lectins in a lectin array and were susceptible to cleavage by α-mannosidases including an α1,2- but not an α1,6-mannosidase. Electrospray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of O-glycans containing up to nine hexoses with the penta- and hexasaccharides being the predominant ones. α1,2- and α1,3-linked, but not α1,6-linked, mannose residues were detected by ¹H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirming the results of the mannosidase cleavage. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for binding of PNGase F-treated mannosylated PSGL-1/mIgG₂b to MR, DC-SIGN and MBL were shown by surface plasmon resonance to be 126, 56 and 16 nM, respectively. In conclusion, PSGL-1/mIgG₂b expressed in P. pastoris carried O-glycans mainly comprised of α-linked mannoses and with up to nine residues. It bound mannose-specific receptors with high apparent affinity and may become a potent targeting molecule for these receptors in vivo. 3amannosidases 3aglycoproteins 3aKomagataella pastoris 3aadaptive immunity 3alectins 3amacrophages 3ayeasts 3areceptors 3amannose 3adissociation 3aimmunoglobulins 3amass spectrometry 3apolysaccharides 3ahexoses 3asurface plasmon resonance 3acell adhesion 0aPichia pastoris1 aSjöblom, Magnus1 aStrindelius, Lena1 aJohansson, Tomas1 aFleckenstein, Tilly1 aChatzissavidou, N.q(Nathalie)1 aLindberg, Linda1 aÅngström, Lars-Jonas.1 aRova, Ulrika1 aHolgersson, Jan0 tGlycobiology.g2011 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.1071-1086x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwr0463Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110708  aNon-US 7aarticle03552naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245013900160300001800299520202700317650002102344650001702365650001502382650001502397650002702412650001602439650001902455650001402474650001002488650002402498650001602522650002502538650001402563650001602577650001102593650001602604650001202620650001302632650002002645650000902665650001402674650001602688650001702704650001202721700002002733700002102753700001802774773007202792852000902864856008102873939003302954946001102987655001202998IND4459771120221122214023.0110708e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445977112DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwr0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Young-Dok10aEnhanced sialylation of recombinant human erythropoietin in Chinese hamster ovary cells by combinatorial engineering of selected genes  ap. 1019-1028.  aTherapeutic glycoproteins with exposed galactose (Gal) residues are cleared rapidly from the bloodstream by asialoglycoprotein receptors in hepatocytes. Various approaches have been used to increase the content of sialic acid, which occupies terminal sites of N- or O-linked glycans and thereby increases the half-life of therapeutic glycoproteins. We enhanced sialylation of human erythropoietin (EPO) by genetic engineering of the sialylation pathway in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The enzyme GNE (uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl glucosamine 2-epimerase)/MNK (N-acetyl mannosamine kinase), which plays a key role in the initial two steps of sialic acid biosynthesis, is regulated by cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-sialic acid through a feedback mechanism. Since sialuria patient cells fail in regulating sialic acid biosynthesis by feedback mechanism, various sialuria-like mutated rat GNEs were established and subjected to in vitro activity assay. GNE/MNK-R263L-R266Q mutant showed 93.6% relative activity compared with wild type and did not display feedback inhibition. Genes for sialuria-mutated rat GNE/MNK, Chinese hamster CMP-sialic acid transporter and human α2,3-sialyltransferase (α2,3-ST) were transfected simultaneously into recombinant human (rh) EPO-producing CHO cells. CMP-sialic acid concentration of engineered cells was significantly (>10-fold) increased by sialuria-mutated GNE/MNK (R263L-R266Q) expression. The sialic acid content of rhEPO produced from engineered cells was 43% higher than that of control cells. Ratio of tetra-sialylated glycan of rhEPO produced from engineered cells was increased ~32%, but ratios of asialo- and mono-sialylated glycans were decreased ~50%, compared with control. These findings indicate that sialuria-mutated rat GNE/MNK effectively increases the intracellular CMP-sialic acid level. The newly constructed host CHO cell lines produced more highly sialylated therapeutic glycoproteins through overexpression of sialuria-mutated GNE/MNK, CMP-SAT and α2,3-ST. 3aChinese hamsters 3abiosynthesis 3ablood flow 3acell lines 3acytidine monophosphate 3aengineering 3aerythropoietin 3agalactose 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aglucosamine 3aglycosyltransferases 3ahalf life 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3amannosamine 3amutants 3apatients 3apolysaccharides 3arats 3areceptors 3asialic acid 3atherapeutics 3auridine1 aJeong, Yeon Tae1 aPark, Seung-Yeol1 aKim, Jung Hoe0 tGlycobiology.g2011 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.1019-1028x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwr0343Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110708  aNon-US 7aarticle02366naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002500141245017300166300001800339520102200357650002401379650002101403650002401424650001001448650001201458650002101470650001301491650003801504700002101542700001701563700002501580700002001605700001801625700002301643700001801666700002001684700002201704773007201726852000901798856008101807939003301888946001101921655001201932IND4459771220221122182150.0110708e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445977122DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwr0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBacilieri, Magdalena10aInhibitory effects of glycosaminoglycans on basal and stimulated transforming growth factor-β1 expression in mesangial cells: biochemical and structural considerations  ap. 1029-1037.  aA number of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) species related to heparin, dermatan sulfate (DeS) and chondroitin sulfate were tested for their ability to interfere with the physiological expression and/or pathological overexpression of the TGF-β1 gene. The influence of the molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, degree of sulfation and location of the sulfate groups was examined in an attempt to unveil fine relationships between structure and activity. The nature of the polysaccharide plays a major part, heparins proving able to inhibit both basal and stimulated TGF-β1 gene expression, DeSs being essentially inactive and chondroitin sulfates only inhibiting stimulated TGF-β1 gene expression. Within this frame, the particular physical and chemical properties of some GAGs appear to further modulate TGF-β1 gene response. Judging from our investigation, chondroitin sulfates seem the most promising for potential pharmacological applications in disorders characterized by fibrogenic TGF-β1 overexpression. 3achondroitin sulfate 3adermatan sulfate 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aheparin 3amolecular weight 3asulfates 3atransforming growth factor beta 11 aNaggi, Annamaria1 aCeol, Monica1 aSchleicher, Erwin D.1 aTosetto, Enrica1 aComoli, Maura1 aTorri, Giangiacomo1 aMoro, Stefano1 aPalumbo, Manlio1 aGambaro, Giovanni0 tGlycobiology.g2011 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.1029-1037x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwr0383Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110708  aNon-US 7aarticle02686naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009600168300001400264520129900278650001401577650001701591650001101608650002301619650002901642650001001671650002001681650001701701650001101718650000901729650002701738650001301765650001301778650000901791650001201800700002301812700002401835700001901859700002101878700002001899700002401919700002501943773010001968852000902068856006902077930003302146946001302179655001202192IND4387472520221122145115.0070204e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438747252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-006-0016-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Angela M. 10aLinkage mapping of the locus for inherited ovine arthrogryposis (IOA) to sheep Chromosome 5  ap. 43-52.  aArthrogryposis is a congenital malformation affecting the limbs of newborn animals and infants. Previous work has demonstrated that inherited ovine arthrogryposis (IOA) has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Two affected homozygous recessive (art/art) Suffolk rams were used as founders for a backcross pedigree of half-sib families segregating the IOA trait. A genome scan was performed using 187 microsatellite genetic markers and all backcross animals were phenotyped at birth for the presence and severity of arthrogryposis. Pairwise LOD scores of 1.86, 1.35, and 1.32 were detected for three microsatellites, BM741, JAZ, and RM006, that are located on sheep Chr 5 (OAR5). Additional markers in the region were identified from the genetic linkage map of BTA7 and by in silico analyses of the draft bovine genome sequence, three of which were informative. Interval mapping of all autosomes produced an F value of 21.97 (p < 0.01) for a causative locus in the region of OAR5 previously flagged by pairwise linkage analysis. Inspection of the orthologous region of HSA5 highlighted a previously fine-mapped locus for human arthrogryposis multiplex congenita neurogenic type (AMCN). A survey of the HSA5 genome sequence identified plausible candidate genes for both IOA and human AMCN. 3aautosomes 3abackcrossing 3acattle 3achromosome mapping 3acongenital abnormalities 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aneonates 3apedigree 3arams 3asurveys1 aMacHugh, David E. 1 aPark, Stephen D.E. 1 aScraggs, Erik 1 aHaley, Chris S. 1 aLynn, David J. 1 aBoland, Maurice P. 1 aDoherty, Michael L. 0 tMammalian genome.g2007 Jan., v. 18, no. 1 p.43-52dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-006-0016-83electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02176naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002000141245007100161300001600232520095200248650001601200650001601216650002601232650002001258650002101278650001801299650001401317650001201331650002501343650001101368700001701379700001701396700001801413700001901431700001901450700002201469700002201491700001301513773007001526852000901596856008101605939003301686946001101719655001201730IND4459772220221122145057.0110708e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445977222DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwq1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsui, Takeshi10aN-glycosylation at noncanonical Asn-X-Cys sequences in plant cells  ap. 994-999.  aThe vesicular transport pathway in plant cells is often used for higher accumulation of recombinant proteins. In the endoplasmic reticulum, which acts as a gateway to the vesicular transport pathway, N-glycosylation occurs on specific Asn residues. This N-glycosylation in recombinant proteins must be carefully regulated as it can impact their enzymatic activity, half lives in serum when injected, structural stability, etc. In eukaryotic cells, including plant cells, N-glycans were found to be attached to Asn residues in Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X [not equal] Pro) sequences. However, recently, N-glycosylations at noncanonical Asn-X-Cys sequences have been found in mammals and yeast. Our laboratory has discovered that N-glycans are attached to Asn residues at Asn-Thr-Cys sequences of double-repeated B subunit of Shiga toxin 2e produced in plant cells, the first reported case of N-glycosylation at a noncanonical Asn-X-Cys sequence in plant cells. 3aShiga toxin 3ablood serum 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzyme activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3aglycosylation 3ahalf life 3amammals 3arecombinant proteins 3ayeasts1 aTakita, Eiji1 aSato, Toshio1 aKinjo, Satoko1 aAizawa, Michie1 aSugiura, Yukie1 aHamabata, Takashi1 aSawada, Kazutoshi1 aKato, Ko0 tGlycobiology.g2011 Aug., v. 21, no. 8 p.994-999x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq1983Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110708  aNon-US 7aarticle02016naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245005600172300001600228500002400244520082600268650001301094650002301107650001801130650002301148650001501171650001101186650002601197650002501223650002401248650002301272650002601295650001501321650001901336650001101355700001801366700002501384773009901409852000901508856008901517655001201606IND4407214720221122145140.0080627s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440721472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Jorge.10aEnergy-based models for environmental biotechnology  ap. 366-374.  aIncludes references  aEnvironmental biotechnology is evolving. Current process objectives include the production of chemicals and/or energy carriers (biofuels) in addition to the traditional objective of removing pollutants from waste. To maximise product yields and minimise biomass production, future processes will rely on anaerobic microbial communities. Anaerobic processes are characterised by small Gibbs energy changes in the reactions catalysed, and this provides clear thermodynamic process boundaries. Here, a Gibbs-energy-based methodology is proposed for mathematical modelling of energy-limited anaerobic ecosystems. This methodology provides a basis for the description of microbial activities as a function of environmental factors, which will allow enhanced catalysis of specific reactions of interest for process development. 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3abiotechnology 3acatalytic activity 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental models 3amathematical models 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3apollutants 3athermodynamics 3awastes1 aLema, Juan M.1 aKleerebezem, Robbert0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2008 July, v. 26, no. 7 p.366-374dElsevier Sciencex0167-77997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03529naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014500174506011700319506007600436520203000512592002802542506003702570650002002607650002002627650001602647650001002663650002002673650001702693650001502710651001102725653002902736653003202765653002202797653001902819700001902838700002002857773015102877856008203028852000903110655001203119IND60776646720221207114712.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077664672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaghighatgou, Niloufar12aA method for automatic identification of openings in buildings facades based on mobile LiDAR point clouds for assessing impacts of floodings  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGiven the high frequency and major impact of flood events, decision-makers are in urgent need to have tools allowing them to predict or assess the impact of flood events on the population, such as flood simulation through digital 3D cities. While building’s lowest openings are more subject to potential damages during the flood, 3D building models of rural environments still lack this information. Thus, it would be required to provide the location of the building lowest openings, in the context of flood risk assessment. Unlike frequently developed methods in opening detection domain that benefit from the repetitive structure and symmetrical characterization of the openings on the facades of modern buildings in urban areas, this paper proposed a comprehensive approach that investigates low-rise residential houses of rural areas where openings have various shapes, sizes, and non-symmetrical positions on the facade. First, it proposed a generalized segmentation approach in a context involving various and complex facade structures, in the presence of frequent occlusion and noticeable point density changes. Second, it proposed a simple and consistent hole-based opening detection by effective elimination of window crossbars and curtains. Finally, by proposing an inventory of frequent challenges related to facade extraction and opening detection tasks, it enables a better understanding of the difficulties to help in providing more efficient and relevant solutions in rural residential contexts. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations were performed using an MLS real-world dataset of the Quebec Province, Canada. Related statistics revealed that the proposed approach could obtain good performance rates despite the complexity of the dataset, representative of the data acquired in real situations. Challenges regarding the characteristics of the MLS point cloud and the presence of large surrounding occlusions should be further investigated for obtaining more accurate opening information on the facade.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3adecision making 3ainventories 3alidar 3arisk assessment 3aspatial data 3astatistics 3aQuebec 0aMobile LiDAR point cloud 0aRegion growing segmentation 0aOpening detection 0aRural building1 aDaniel, Sylvie1 aBadard, Thierry0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Apr., v. 108 p.102757-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01785naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005500168300001400223520065500237592002800892650001200920650002400932650002000956650001300976650002200989653001701011653001801028653001201046653000801058653001901066700001901085700002001104700001601124700006001140773010601200856008401306852000901390655001201399IND60598946820221123044010.0180702e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059894682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuruta, Toru10aSynthesis of chiral dopants based on carbohydrates  ap. 15-22.  aChiral dopants based on carbohydrates for nematic liquid crystals were synthesized from d-glucose, and their helical twisting power (HTP) values were evaluated.

This approach, PROTREC (short for PROtein RECovery), dominates existing network-based methods – such as Functional Class Scoring (FCS), Hypergeometric Enrichment (HE), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) – across a variety of proteomics datasets derived from different proteomics data acquisition paradigms: Higher PROTREC scores are much more closely correlated with higher recovery rates of MPs across sample replicates. The PROTREC score, unlike methods reporting p-values, can be directly interpreted as the probability that an unreported protein in a proteomic screen is actually present in the sample being screened.Mass spectrometry (MS) has developed rapidly in recent years; however, an obvious proportion of proteins is still undetected, leading to missing protein problems. A few existing protein recovery methods are based on biological networks, but the performance is not satisfactory. We propose a new protein recovery method, PROTREC, a Bayesian-inspired approach based on biological networks, which shows exceptional performance across multiple validation strategies. It does not rely on peptide information, so it avoids the ambiguity issue that most protein assembly methods face.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3agenes 3apeptides 3aprobability 3aproteomics 3aspectroscopy 0aBioinformatics 0aProtein complexes 0aMissing proteins 0aNetworks 0aStatistics1 aWong, Bertrand Jern Han1 aGao, Huanhuan1 aGuo, Tiannan1 aLiu, Xianming1 aDu, Xiaoxian1 aWong, Limsoon1 aGoh, Wilson Wen Bin0 tJournal of proteomics.g2022 Jan. 06, v. 250 p.104392-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2021.1043923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122245008800140300001600228520159600244592002801840650001001868650001801878650001101896650002001907650001201927650001401939650001301953651001901966700001801985773013602003856007502139852000902214655001202223IND60765103520221119163720.0220422e20111122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510352DNAL7 a10.17221/3840-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL10aStability of Aberdeen Angus breeding values in the Czech Republic from 1997 to 2007  ap. 509-520.  aWe predict the stability of breeding values (BVs) for direct effect (DE) and maternal effect (ME) for live weights at 210 days of age in the entire population of purebred Aberdeen Angus cattle in the Czech Republic according to an increase of progeny number in performance recording over a period of 11&nbsp;years (1997 to 2007) and the course of BVs for DE and ME during the years of observation in animals born until 1997.&nbsp; Furthermore we compare genetic trends of BVs for DE and ME among animals born in different years and detect the level and significance of correlation coefficients among predictions of BVs for DE and ME performed during the years of observation. The animal model and the BLUPF90 programme were used for these predictions. The used model included the effects of animal, sex, contemporary group, dam, age of dam, and permanent environment of dam. The variance of BVs ranged from 4.96 to 10.87 depending on the year of evaluation and whether it was related to maternal or direct genetic effect. The animals were initially assigned to groups according to their BV in 1997, and this ranking was not affected by the BVs predicted in subsequent years. The existence of a negative correlation between direct and maternal effects was confirmed. The significant correlations (P &lt; 0.0001) demonstrated a strong relationship between the BVs predicted in successive years, e.g. the correlation coefficient for the relationship between BVs for direct effect predicted in the last years of the examined period was above 0.9 and that for maternal effect was above 0.8.&nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aAngus 3aanimal models 3acattle 3amaternal effect 3aprogeny 3apurebreds 3avariance 3aCzech Republic1 aStádník, L.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 56, no. 11 p.509-520dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3840-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009500172300001800267520106200285592002801347650001101375650001501386650001201401650002101413650001901434650001801453650001401471650002001485700002401505700001801529700002301547700001701570700002101587700002301608700002401631700002001655700001901675700002101694700002001715700002101735700001801756700002401774700002301798700001901821773012701840856008401967852000902051655001202060IND60099641120221119144700.0141105e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009964112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2012.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParolini, Daniele10aExpression of CD20 reveals a new store-operated calcium entry modulator in skeletal muscle  ap. 2095-2105.  aAmong the scarce available data about the biological role of the membrane protein CD20, there is some evidence that this protein functions as a store-operated Ca²⁺ channel and/or regulates transmembrane Ca²⁺ trafficking. Recent findings indicate that store-operated Ca²⁺ entry (SOCE) plays a central role in skeletal muscle function and development, but there remain a number of unresolved issues relating to SOCE modulation in this tissue. Here we describe CD20 expression in skeletal muscle, verifying its membrane localization in myoblasts and adult muscle fibers. Additionally, we show that inhibition of CD20 through antibody binding or gene silencing resulted in specific impairment of SOCE in C2C12 myoblasts. Our results provide novel insights into the CD20 expression pattern, and suggest that functional CD20 is required for SOCE to consistently occur in C2C12 myoblasts. These findings may contribute to future identification of mechanisms and molecules involved in the fine regulation of store-operated Ca²⁺ entry in skeletal muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantibodies 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3agene silencing 3amuscle fibers 3amyoblasts 3askeletal muscle1 aCassinelli, Letizia1 aRazini, Paola1 aSitzia, Clementina1 aTonna, Noemi1 aErratico, Silvia1 aColleoni, Federica1 aAngeloni, Valentina1 aMaffioli, Elisa1 aFarini, Andrea1 aMaciotta, Simona1 aPorretti, Laura1 aBelicchi, Marzia1 aBianco, Fabio1 aTedeschi, Gabriella1 aMeregalli, Mirella1 aTorrente, Yvan0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2012 Dec., v. 44, no. 12 p.2095-2105dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2012.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01972naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245006200173300001600235520100800251592002801259650001301287650002301300650001601323650002701339650002201366650002201388650002501410650001001435650001001445773010101455856008101556852000901637655001201646IND60119643220221122111439.0141219e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011964322DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-014-0834-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatic, Pamela Giselle10aGroundwater Spatial Dynamics and Endogenous Well Location  ap. 181-196.  aGroundwater economic models have refined optimal extraction rules while lagging behind in the study of optimal spatial policies. This paper develops a theoretical model to estimate welfare gains from optimal groundwater management when the choice variable set is expanded to include well location decisions as well as optimal groundwater extraction paths. Our theoretical results show that if there is spatial heterogeneity in groundwater, the welfare gains from optimal location of wells are substantial even if extraction rates are unregulated. Furthermore, second-best economically defined spacing regulations may possibly have better efficiency results (and lower implementation costs) than first-best uniform taxes or quotas. An application of the model to a real-world aquifer shows the importance of including well location decisions in spatially differentiated groundwater models and the need for (1) robust estimates of the gains from optimal management and; (2) spatially explicit regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aeconometric models 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3ahydrologic models 3aissues and policy 3aspatial distribution 3ataxes 3awells0 tWater resources management.g2015 Jan., v. 29, no. 1 p.181-196dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-014-0834-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008900163300001600252520118000268592002801448650001601476650001701492650001001509650001301519650001201532650002301544650001101567650001101578650001401589653001701603653002201620653001801642653002101660653002601681700001801707700002001725773012101745856008101866852000901947655001201956IND60558371720221120170934.0190318e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055837172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chen10aRelationship between pasting parameters and length of paste drop of various starches  ap. 655-658.  aWhen a starch paste stretches and breaks during dropping under gravity, the length of fully stretched paste drop is considered as an important flowing characteristic of starch. The length of paste drop (LPD) often determines eating quality of the starch-containing foods. The relationship between pasting parameters measured using a rapid visco-analyzer and LPD of various starches from different botanical sources was investigated at different starch concentrations (50, 70 & 90 g/kg). Starch content in the paste mainly affected the single pasting parameters (p < 0.05), whereas the type of starches such as genotype, botanical source, cereal/root vs tuber, and variety affected the LPD (p < 0.05). Pasting parameters such as peak viscosity, breakdown, final viscosity, peak viscosity/final viscosity, and peak viscosity-final viscosity exhibited significant correlations with LPD (p < 0.05) regardless of starch source. Especially for cereal starches, the correlation coefficient values between the 2nd order pasting properties (breakdown/setback, peak viscosity-final viscosity, and peak viscosity/final viscosity) and LPD were relatively high (r = 0.81–0.93).  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3afood quality 3afoods 3agenotype 3agravity 3apasting properties 3astarch 3atubers 3aviscosity 0aStarch paste 0aPasting viscosity 0aCereal starch 0aBotanical source 0aRoot and tuber starch1 aKim, Jong-Yea1 aLim, Seung-Taik0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2017 June, v. 79 p.655-658dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01296naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009300165300001600258520022800274592002800502650001700530650002300547650002300570650002300593650001200616653001200628653002400640653002700664700002200691700002200713773013700735856007700872852000900949655001200958IND60521931020221120191639.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052193102DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-03272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuneck, Siegfried14aThe Final Structures of the Lichen Chromones Galapagin, Lobodirin, Mollin, and Roccellin  ap. 449-451.  aThe structures of the lichen chromones galapagin, lobodirin, mollin, and roccellin, specific com­ pounds of Roccellaceae (lichens), have been es­ tablished as 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, by NOE difference spectroscopoy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRoccellaceae 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3alichens 0aLichens 0aChromone Glucosides 0aNOE Difference Spectra1 aJakupovic, Jasmin1 aFollmann, Gerhard0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 47, no. 3 p.449-451dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1992-03273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010100171300001600272500001900288520167500307592002801982650002102010650002802031650002702059650001502086650001502101650002202116650002202138650001502160650001602175650003002191650001702221650001402238650002502252650001502277650000902292650003702301650000902338653002402347653002702371653001002398700001602408700001902424700001902443700001202462773013902474856008502613852000902698655001202707IND60723909520221122073712.0210415e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072390952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecohyd.2021.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorbanzadeh, N.10aEffect of the biogenic precipitation of calcium carbonate on bacterial transport in sand columns  ap. 280-291.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrediction of bacteria transport to riparian shallow groundwater is very important to prevent the pollution of water resources by coliform bacteria. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICCP) in reducing bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens) transport. To perform the MICCP process, air-dried sterile sand was poured into polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders (4.8 × 14.92 cm) and incubated for 3 days in the presence of Sporosarcina pasteurii (~10⁸ Cell g⁻¹sand), urea and CaCl₂ (1.5 M). A pulse (0.1 pore volume (PV)) of bacteria suspension (10⁸ CFU mL⁻¹) was added on top of the sand columns (MICCP treated and control) and leaching experiments were followed at steady-state, saturated flow condition. Culturable bacteria were determined in the leachate and the sand extracts (resident bacteria) by colony count method. The MICCP treatment reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛ) value 3.9 times compared to the control and thereby reduced bacteria leaching. Bioprecipitated calcium carbonate in MICCP columns increased bacteria straining compared to control columns especially in surface layer (0-3 cm). MICCP process increased filtration coefficient (λf), and relative adsorption index (SR), and decreased maximum depth of bacteria transport (Zₘₐₓ). The average (Cₐᵥ) and cumulative cell density (Ccᵤₘ) of both bacteria passed from the MICCP column decreased around 3.9-fold compared to the control. Overall, the MICCP process has potential in bacteria filtration in the porous media reducing the risk of groundwater pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aSporosarcina pasteurii 3aadsorption 3aair drying 3acalcium carbonate 3acoliform bacteria 3afiltration 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydrobiology 3aleachates 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3aprediction 3asand 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3aurea 0aBacteria filtration 0aHydraulic conductivity 0aMICCP1 aShokati, R.1 aFarhangi, M.B.1 aShabanpour, M.1 aUnc, A.0 tInternational journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology.g2021 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.280-291dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2195x1642-35937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2021.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016700164500002200331520203400353592002802387650001202415650001702427650001302444650001502457650002702472650001402499650001802513650001602531650001002547650001702557650001002574650001802584650001202602650001002614651001702624653002402641653002102665653002302686653001702709653001402726700002202740700002002762700002102782700001902803700001602822773009602838856008502934852000903019655001203028IND60679693120221118161126.0191231e20191216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067969312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.1029382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yu10aDeveloping an experimental database of burning characteristics of combustible informal dwelling materials based on South African informal settlement investigation  aPre-press version  aInformal settlements, which have little or no legal status and no official planning remit, such as slums, shacks and favelas, are exposed to an extensive risk of fire. Due to flammable construction materials of the dwellings, the combustibility and flammability of the materials of dwelling furnishings and the proximity and density of these settlements, fires can readily develop and spread to neighbouring dwellings. To understand the hazards related to fire development and spread, a database of material properties is required, however, the materials found within the informal settlement homes vary and are sometimes hard to define. Therefore, an accurate assessment of the common materials found in informal settlements, and their comparison to literature data, is required. This paper presents a total of 345 cone calorimeter tests used to develop a database of combustible materials found in informal settlements of the Western Cape in South Africa. Thirty-two different typical materials were collected from one South African informal settlement and heated by an electronic cone calorimeter. The critical heat flux for ignition was determined by decreasing the incident heat flux until no ignition occurrence. The materials were also heated under different heat fluxes of 30 kW/m2, 50 kW/m2 and 75 kW/m2 to simulate their burning behaviour under different fire conditions. Other important parameters were obtained including ignition time, burning time, maximum heat release rate and flame height. Different materials contribute to fire development/spread/severity in different ways and phases: for the fire development inside the shack, PU foam, carpets and clothing are most important; for fire spread between dwelling: clothing, shade netting and tyre play a key role; meanwhile for fire severity, tyre, PU foam, carpets and Masonite timber need most notice. The experimental results can provide basic data for theoretical and numerical analysis of compartment fire development and spread in informal settlements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acalorimeters 3aclothing 3acombustion 3aconstruction materials 3adatabases 3afire severity 3afire spread 3afires 3aflammability 3afoams 3aheat transfer 3anetting 3atires 3aSouth Africa 0aInformal settlement 0aCone calorimeter 0aCritical heat flux 0aBurning rate 0aFire risk1 aBertrand, Camille1 aBeshir, Mohamed1 aKahanji, Charles1 aWalls, Richard1 aRush, David0 tFire safety journal.g2019 Dec. 16,  p.102938-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3526x0379-71127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.1029383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012700160300002000287520107800307592002801385650001301413650002001426650002101446650002201467650002201489650001701511653003301528653002401561653001201585653002401597653001801621700001101639700002101650700001301671700005601684773014201740856007801882852000901960655001201969IND60614669420221122043044.0181002e20180828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061466942DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b099852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lecai10aCompound-Hierarchical-Sphere LiNi₀.₅Co₀.₂Mn₀.₃O₂: Synthesis, Structure, and Electrochemical Characterization  ap. 32120-32127.  aCompound-hierarchical-sphere-structured LiNi₀.₅Co₀.₂Mn₀.₃O₂ was synthesized to improve the electrochemical performance of this material in lithium-ion battery cathodes. The product was found to have a large specific surface area, good electron and ion conductivities, a stable interface, and a robust nano/microhierarchical structure, all of which improved the rate capability, capacity, and cycling stability of this material. When this material was cycled between 3.0 and 4.3 V, a high discharge capacity of 180.8 mA h g–¹ was obtained at 0.2C with 94.0% capacity retention after 100 cycles. In addition, a superior discharge capacity of 148.9 mA h g–¹ was observed at a high current density of 1600 mA g–¹. This compound-hierarchical-sphere LiNi₀.₅Co₀.₂Mn₀.₃O₂ is readily prepared using our ternary coprecipitation method. We also propose an effector unit theory to explain the enhanced cycling stability of this substance and believe that the present results will assist in the design of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3acoprecipitation 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium batteries 3amaterials science 3asurface area 0acompound-hierarchical-sphere 0alithium-ion battery 0acathode 0aLiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 0aeffector unit1 aLi, Li1 aZhang, Xiaojiao,1 aWu, Feng1 aChen, Renjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7001-29260 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Aug. 28, v. 10, no. 38 p.32120-32127dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b099853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006800165300001800233520115600251592002801407650001801435650002001453650001001473650001801483650002001501650003701521650001901558650001101577650001201588653002501600653002801625653001801653653002401671653001001695653001301705700001201718700002401730700001901754700002101773700002201794700002101816773012801837856008301965852000902048655001202057IND60753095620221117090738.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075309562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRey, Juan S.10aDeep-learning in situ classification of HIV-1 virion morphology  ap. 5688-5700.  aTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) has a multitude of uses in biomedical imaging due to its ability to discern ultrastructure morphology at the nanometer scale. Through its ability to directly visualize virus particles, TEM has for several decades been an invaluable tool in the virologist’s toolbox. As applied to HIV-1 research, TEM is critical to evaluate activities of inhibitors that block the maturation and morphogenesis steps of the virus lifecycle. However, both the preparation and analysis of TEM micrographs requires time consuming manual labor. Through the dedicated use of computer vision frameworks and machine learning techniques, we have developed a convolutional neural network backbone of a two-stage Region Based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) capable of identifying, segmenting and classifying HIV-1 virions at different stages of maturation and morphogenesis. Our results outperformed common RCNN backbones, achieving 80.0% mean Average Precision on a diverse set of micrographs comprising different experimental samples and magnifications. We expect that this tool will be of interest to a broad range of researchers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3acomputer vision 3alabor 3amorphogenesis 3aneural networks 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3avirion 3aviruses 0aQuantitative biology 0aArtificial intelligence 0aDeep learning 0aElectron microscopy 0aHIV-1 0aVirology1 aLi, Wen1 aBryer, Alexander J.1 aBeatson, Hagan1 aLantz, Christian1 aEngelman, Alan N.1 aPerilla, Juan R.0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2021, v. 19 p.5688-5700dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004100140245014500181300002000326520132800346592002801674650001301702650000801715650002801723650001401751650001001765650001301775650001401788650003301802700003501835700004301870700002901913700003201942700004501974700003302019700003002052700002602082773012402108856007402232852000902306655001202315IND60672340420221120101112.0191016e20191009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234042DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra04159a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoyaho-Bernal, María de los Angeles14aThe roughness of deciduous dentin surface and shear bond strength of glass ionomers in the treatment with four minimally invasive techniques  ap. 32197-32204.  aThe concept of minimally invasive technique in dentistry emphasizes conservative strategies in the management of caries, which results in less destruction of healthy tooth structure. The use of different techniques seems to interfere in the roughness of dentin and the mechanisms of adhesion with the restorative material. This study characterized the roughness of deciduous dentin surface treated with four minimally invasive techniques using profilometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); moreover, shear bond strength of Vitremer™ glass ionomer was determined. Samples were divided into four groups: G1_CB carbide bur, G2_PB polymer bur, G3_C Carisolv™, and G4_AA air abrasive. No differences were found between groups before and after treatment in the roughness. Samples treated with a carbide bur presented a smear layer; smart bur surface exhibited the remains of the material; G3_C Carisolv™ showed a rough surface, and air abrasive presented particle traces. Concerning the shear bond strength of Vitremer™ glass ionomer were not found differences after treatment (p > 0.05). It is concluded that roughness showed characteristic patterns derived from the technique used and the shear bond strength is not significantly affected after using any minimally invasive method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aair 3aatomic force microscopy 3adentistry 3aglass 3apolymers 3aroughness 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aBadillo-Estévez, Bitia Eunice1 aSoberanes-de la Fuente, Ester Luminosa1 aGonzález-Torres, Maykel1 aTeutle-Coyotecatl, Bernardo1 aRubín de Celís-Quintana, Gisela Nataly1 aCarrasco-Gutiérrez, Rosendo1 aVaillard-Jiménez, Esther1 aLezama-Flores, Gloria0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 09, v. 9, no. 55 p.32197-32204dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra04159a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010000204506011700304506007600421520124300497592002801740506003701768650001301805650001101818650001501829650002001844650001701864650002201881650001501903650001801918651001301936653001801949653002101967653003601988653001502024653003002039653002102069653001502090653001002105653000802115653000902123653000702132653000602139653000802145653000802153653000602161653000802167653000802175700001602183700001402199700001802213700001502231700001302246700001802259700001702277700001902294773015102313856008202464852000902546655001202555IND60776647320221207114655.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077664732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Mingxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4682-931910aDetecting and mapping tree crowns based on convolutional neural network and Google Earth images  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMapping tree crown is critical for estimating the functional and spatial distribution of ecosystem services. However, accurate and up-to-date urban crown mapping remains a challenge due to the time-consuming nature of field sampling and spatial heterogeneity. Another challenge is the data cost, which is always a concern for low-cost processing of forest maps on large scales. Here, we developed a novel working framework by integrating an advanced deep learning technology, the Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) model with Google Earth images to detect tree crown cover in New York’s Central Park, which is a typical testbed for an urban forest area with highly heterogeneous tree crown cover. The results indicated that the tree number detection rate estimated by the Mask R-CNN crown detection model was 82.8% and the crown area detection rate was 81.8% for the entire study area. The model detected isolated trees and closed forest trees areas with a recall of 87.5% and 81.6% of the tree numbers, respectively. The analysis indicates that the tree crown detection model could accurately detect tree crowns under highly complex environments and demonstrates great potential to map urban tree crown covers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3acanopy 3aecosystems 3aneural networks 3aspatial data 3aspatial variation 3atree crown 3aurban forests 3aNew York 0aDeep learning 0aForest inventory 0aIndividual tree crown detection 0aMask R-CNN 0aNew York’s Central Park 0aTarget detection 0aMask R-CNN 0aR-CNN 0aCNN 0aITCs 0aDR 0aR 0aTPR 0aFPR 0aF 0aIoU 0aUAV1 aMou, Yuling1 aLiu, Shan1 aMeng, Yanrong1 aLiu, Zelin1 aLi, Peng1 aXiang, Wenhua1 aZhou, Xiaolu1 aPeng, Changhui0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Apr., v. 108 p.102764-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015500174300001800329520161600347592002801963650002101991650001902012650001802031650001602049650001602065650001102081650001102092650001102103650001502114650002102129650002602150650001802176653001102194653002002205653002502225653001702250653001602267653001602283653000902299653001802308653002202326700002002348700002202368773012802390856008302518852000902601655001202610IND60753095820221117091301.0211219s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075309582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Michael David10aComputational modeling of RNase, antisense ORF0 RNA, and intracellular compartmentation and their impact on the life cycle of the line retrotransposon  ap. 5667-5677.  aNearly half of the human genome is occupied by repetitive sequences of ancient virus-like genetic elements. The largest class, comprising 17% of the genome, belong to the type 1 Long INterspersed Elements (LINE-1) and are the only class capable of autonomous propagation in the genome. When epigenetic silencing mechanisms of LINE-1 fail, the proteins encoded by LINE-1 engage in reverse transcription to make new copies of their own or other DNAs that are pasted back into the genome. To elucidate how LINE-1 is dysregulated as a result of carcinogen exposure, we developed a computational model of key elements in the LINE-1 lifecycle, namely, the role of cytosolic ribonuclease (RNase), RNA interference (RNAi) by the antisense ORF0 RNA, and sequestration of LINE-1 products into stress granules and multivesicular structures.The model showed that when carcinogen exposure is represented as either a sudden increase in LINE-1 mRNA count, or as an increase in mRNA transcription rate, the retrotransposon copy number exhibits a distinct threshold behavior above which LINE-1 enters a positive feedback loop that allows the cDNA copy number to grow exponentially. We also found that most of the LINE-1 RNA was degraded via the RNAase pathway and that neither ORF0 RNAi, nor the sequestration of LINE-1 products into granules and multivesicular structures, played a significant role in regulating the retrotransposon’s life cycle. Several aspects of the prediction agree with experimental results and indicate that the model has significant potential to inform future experiments related to LINE-1 activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3abioinformatics 3abiotechnology 3acarcinogens 3aepigenetics 3agenome 3ahumans 3amodels 3aprediction 3aretrotransposons 3areverse transcription 3aribonucleases 0aLINE-1 0aRetrotransposon 0aStochastic modelling 0aVirtual Cell 0aMass Action 0aLINE-1 ORF0 0aRNAi 0aSequestration 0aProcessing bodies1 aBrown, David N.1 aRamos, Kenneth S.0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2021, v. 19 p.5667-5677dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009900155300001400254520058100268592002800849650001100877650000900888650002100897650001100918650001200929700001600941700001500957773012600972856007401098852000901172655001201181IND60765104120221119163121.0220419e20111125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510412DNAL7 a10.17221/3863-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKundu, J.K.10aDetection of Apple stem grooving virus in different tissues of apple trees throughout the year  ap. 93-96.  aThe suitability of different apple tissues for Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV) detection throughout the year was checked by RT-PCR and ELISA.

The quadruple M - M bond is stabilized by the bridging acetato and destabilized by the axial halogeno ligands. The valence force constants fd(MM) are determined to 3,96-4,08 mdyn/Å. The interaction constants fdd(MM/MX), fdd(MM/MO) and fdα (MM/MMO) are about three times higher for the technetates as compared with the rhenates. The stronger interaction between oppo­site bonds in the equatorial ligand sphere is revealed by the stretching interaction constants fdd', which are about two times higher than fdd for M - O bonds at right angles. The strong coupling of the ring co-ordinates implies extensive mixing of the M - O valence and deformation modes. The electronic spectra of Tc₂(O₂CCH₃)₄X₂, agree with those of the corresponding Re compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aacetic acid 3aacetic anhydride 3abromine 3achlorine 3adeformation 3aligands 3amixing 0aTetraacetatodihalogenodirhenates 0aTetraacetatodihalogenoditechnetates 0aVibrational Spectra 0aUV-Vis Spectra 0aNormal Coordinate Analysis1 aPreetz, W.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 47, no. 4 p.482-490dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1992-04063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009700160300002000257520105000277592002801327650001401355650001101369650002501380650002101405650000901426650001301435650001101448650001701459650001401476650001601490650001801506650001301524650001101537650001301548700002501561700001901586700001801605700002101623700001801644700002001662700002101682700002201703700002601725700001901751700002501770700002601795773012401821856007401945852000902019655001202028IND60672340620221120101053.0191016e20191007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067234062DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra04293h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarma, Abhisakh10aElectrodeposition of nanowires of a high copper content thiourea precursor of copper sulfide  ap. 31900-31910.  aCopper thiourea complexes are an important material class for application as a precursor of copper sulfide nanocrystals with potential use in solar cells, optoelectronics, medicine, etc. They represent a type of single source precursor, comprising both copper and sulfur in one chemical compound, whose tunable stoichiometry and morphology enable control of the quality and properties of the synthesized copper sulfide nanocrystals. Here, we present a template free electrochemical route to prepare nanowires of copper thiourea (tu) chloride hemihydrate ([Cu(tu)]Cl·½H₂O) by pulse deposition. We proposed the model of the growth of nanowires. We also demonstrate complete transformation from the precursor to copper sulfide nanowire by heating it to 180 °C that involves 20% volume loss due to the decomposition of organic constituents; the obtained nanowires have around 38% covellite (CuS) and 62% digenite (Cu₁.₈S) phases. Electrochemistry offers the advantage of spatially selected deposition e.g. in the active regions of a device.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorides 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3aelectrochemistry 3aheat 3amedicine 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3ananowires 3asolar cells 3astoichiometry 3asulfides 3asulfur 3athiourea1 aDippel, Ann-Christin1 aGutowski, Olof1 aEtter, Martin1 aLippmann, Milena1 aSeeck, Oliver1 aManna, Gouranga1 aSanyal, Milan K.1 aKeller, Thomas F.1 aKulkarni, Satishkumar1 aGuha, Puspendu1 aSatyam, Parlapali V.1 aZimmermann, Martin V.0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 07, v. 9, no. 55 p.31900-31910dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra04293h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008300164300001800247500002000265520176000285592002802045650001402073650001602087650001902103650001602122650002602138650002002164650002402184700006302208700002702271700002102298700002202319700002002341700002902361700002202390700005902412700002202471700002402493700002102517700002302538773014202561856007502703852000902778655001202787IND60760465420221121225308.0211222e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076046542DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.161762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGriffin, Maureen A.10aCholedochal stenting for treatment of extrahepatic biliary obstruction in cats  ap. 2722-2729.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Limited information currently exists regarding the clinical progression and outcomes of cats that undergo choledochal stenting as a treatment for extrahepatic biliary obstruction (EHBO). HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Describe clinical characteristics, indications for choledochal stent placement, procedure, and outcomes in a cohort of cats undergoing choledochal stenting and evaluate risk factors associated with survival as well as recurrence of EHBO in affected cats. ANIMALS: Twenty‐three client‐owned cats undergoing choledochal stent placement. METHODS: Retrospective study. Medical records from 6 academic institutions were reviewed, and data were extracted and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Median age of cats was 10.1 years (range, 2‐16), and all cats had at least 2 clinical signs. Most common clinical signs were vomiting in 20/22 (90.9%), inappetence in 19/22 (86.4%), and lethargy in 19/23 (82.6%). Procedural complications were uncommon and rarely related to the stenting procedure. Clinical signs improved postoperatively in 15/20 (75.0%) cats and serum total bilirubin concentration decreased postoperatively in 13/19 (68.4%) cats. Eighteen (78.3%) cats survived to discharge. Recurrence of EHBO was documented in 7/18 (38.9%) cats that survived to discharge. Cholelithiasis was associated with recurrence of EHBO. Median survival time for cats that survived to discharge was 931 days (range, 19‐3034). Absence of peritoneal effusion was associated with survival to discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Choledochal stenting was an effective treatment modality in cats with EHBO with few procedural complications and potential for prolonged survival, but substantial risk for recurrence of EHBO was identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3abilirubin 3ablood serum 3acholelithiasis 3acholestasis 3aretrospective studies 3arisk assessment 3aveterinary medicine1 aCulp, William T.

Determination of heavy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by four-way parallel factor analysis  ap. 52-63.  aFor the first time, a simple and environmentally friendly third-order/four-way calibration was applied for the simultaneous determination of five heavy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in interfering environments. The kinetic evolution of the Fenton degradation of benzo[a]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene and benz[a]anthracene was followed by recording full excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEFMs) of the samples at different reaction times, obtaining third-order EEFM-kinetic (EEFM-K) data. The sensitivity of the method was increased by carrying out the reaction in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin. The four-way parallel factor (PARAFAC) algorithm, which was used for data processing, exploits the second-order advantage, allowing analyte concentrations to be estimated even in the presence of an uncalibrated fluorescent background. The clear superiority of the applied approach in comparison with second-order/three-way calibration performed with unreacting EEFMs is demonstrated, using two sets of samples with foreign compounds with particular spectral profiles. In one of the latter sets, the existence of a third-order advantage was explored and discussed. The feasibility to directly determine parts-per-trillion concentration levels of PAHs after a very simple solid-phase extraction with C18 membranes is established with natural water samples containing uncalibrated constituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanthracenes 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3afactor analysis 3afluorescence 3ainformation processing 3asolid phase extraction 0aExcitation-emission fluorescence matrix-kinetic data 0aThird-order/four-way calibration 0aThird-order advantage 0aFenton reaction 0aHeavy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aArancibia, Juan A.1 aEscandar, Graciela M.0 tTalanta.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 165 p.52-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03394naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008000162300002000242520183300262592002802095650001902123650001602142650001402158650001102172650001302183650000902196650001902205650002602224650001602250650002502266650000902291650001102300650001802311650001902329650001402348650002202362650001702384650001902401650001202420650001602432653002202448653002402470653001702494653001602511653001202527700002102539700002102560700001802581700001802599773012902617856007302746852000902819655001202828IND60527695220221119122946.0160715e20140813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052769522DNAL7 a10.1021/am504071z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanto, Nurunnabi,10aPhotoluminescent Graphene Nanoparticles for Cancer Phototherapy and Imaging  ap. 12413-12421.  aGraphene-based nanomaterials are of great interest in a wide range of applications in electronics, the environment, and energy as well as in biomedical and bioengineering. Their unique properties make them generally applicable as prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic agents in cancer. In this work, we focused on photodynamic and photothermal therapeutic properties of our previously synthesized carboxylated photoluminescent graphene nanodots (cGdots). The cGdots are ∼5 nm in diameter and excited at 655 nm. Our findings reveal that, upon laser irradiation by near-infrared (wavelength 670 nm) sensitizer, electrons of the cGdots starts to vibrate and form electron clouds, thereby generating sufficient heat (>50 °C) to kill the cancer cells by thermal ablation. The generation of singlet oxygen also occurs due to irradiation, thus acting similarly to pheophorbide-A, a well-known photodynamic therapeutic agent. The cGdots kills MDA-MB231 cancer cells (more than 70%) through both photodynamic and photothermal effects. The cGdots were equally effective in the in vivo model of MDA-MB231 xenografted tumor-bearing mice also as observed for 21 days. The cGdot was intravenously injected, and the tumor was irradiated by laser, resulting in final volume of tumor was ∼70% smaller than that of saline-treated tumor. It indicates that the growth rate of cGdot-treated tumor was slower compared to saline-treated tumor. The synthesized cGdots could enable visualization of tumor tissue in mice, thereby illustrating their use as optical imaging agents for detecting cancer noninvasively in deep tissue/organ. Collectively, our findings reveal that multimodal cGdots can be used for phototherapy, through photothermal or photodynamic effects, and for noninvasive optical imaging of deep tissues and tumors simultaneously.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioengineering 3aelectronics 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3agraphene 3aheat 3aimage analysis 3aintravenous injection 3airradiation 3amedicinal properties 3amice 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphotoluminescence 3aphototherapy 3asinglet oxygen 3atissues 3awavelengths 0agraphene nanodots 0anoninvasive imaging 0aphototherapy 0abiomaterial 0ain vivo1 aKhatun, Zehedina1 aReeck, Gerald R.1 aLee, Dong Yun1 aLee, Yong-kyu0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Aug. 13, v. 6, no. 15 p.12413-12421dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am504071z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02760naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009700162300002000259500001900279520141700298592002801715650002201743650001801765650002601783650001301809650001601822650001801838650001501856700005401871700005701925700005701982700005602039700006102095773014202156856007902298852000902377655001202386IND60715778220210804000000.0201103e20201022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071577822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c053582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Jiewen10aStructural Effects of Amines in Enhancing Methanesulfonic Acid-Driven New Particle Formation  ap. 13498-13508.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAtmospheric amines can enhance methanesulfonic acid (MSA)-driven new particle formation (NPF), but the mechanism is fundamentally different compared to that of the extensively studied sulfuric acid (SA)-driven process. Generally, the enhancing potentials of amines in SA-driven NPF follow the basicity, while this is not the case for MSA-driven NPF, where structural effects dominate, making MSA-driven NPF more prominent for methylamine (MA) compared to dimethylamine (DMA). Therefore, probing structural factors determining the enhancing potentials of amines on MSA-driven NPF is key to fully understanding the contribution of MSA to NPF. Here, we performed a comparative study on DMA and MA enhancing MSA-driven NPF by examining cluster formation using computational methods. The results indicate that DMA–MSA clusters are more stable than the corresponding MA–MSA clusters for cluster sizes up to (DMA)₂(MSA)₂, indicating that the basicity of amines dominates the initial cluster formation. The methyl groups of DMA were found to present significant steric hindrance beyond the (DMA)₂(MSA)₂ cluster and this adds to the lower hydrogen bonding capacity of DMA, making the cluster growth less favorable compared to MA. This study implies that several amines could synergistically enhance MSA-driven NPF by maximizing the advantage of different amines in different amine–MSA cluster growth stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomparative study 3adimethylamine 3aenvironmental science 3ahydrogen 3amethylamine 3asulfuric acid 3atechnology1 aElm, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3736-43291 aXie, Hong-Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9119-97851 aChen, Jingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5756-33361 aNiu, Junfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2592-31031 aVehkamäki, Hanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5018-12550 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Oct. 22, v. 54, no. 21 p.13498-13508dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c053583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245011700171300001800288500001100306520110000317592002801417650002001445650001501465650001201480650002401492650003101516650002001547650001301567650001601580650001501596700002001611700002301631700002801654700001801682773012101700856007901821852000901900655001201909IND60119146020221120155831.0141203e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011914602DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.123522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSt. John, Freya A.

This has led to many applied ecologists using research tools developed by social scientists. This comes with challenges as ecologists often lack relevant disciplinary training. Using an example from the current issue of Journal of Applied Ecology that investigated how conservation interventions influenced conservation outcomes, we discuss the challenges of conducting interdisciplinary science. We illustrate our points using examples from research investigating the role of law enforcement and outreach activities in limiting illegal poaching and the application of the theory of planned behaviour to conservation. Synthesis and applications. Interdisciplinary research requires equal rigour to be applied to ecological and social aspects.

The zinc and copper concentrations of the water samples were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. Colonies of Escherichia coli were subjected to increasing concentration (0.1–1.0 mM) of copper and zinc in the isolation medium. Isolates showing resistance to both metals at 1 mM were identified using conventional methods and by targeting the uidA gene, while PCR amplification of the copA and zntA genes was carried out using specific primers. The selected bacteria were subjected to 10 classes of antibiotics using the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion technique. Five E. coli showing resistance to copper and zinc and possessing uidA gene were obtained. Of the five isolates, three possessed both zntA and copA genes, while zntA was absent in the remaining two. All the isolates peculiarly showed resistance to ampicillin and doxycycline, while three were multi-drug resistant (MDR).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acopper 3adoxycycline 3agenes 3amultiple drug resistance 3asurface water 3azinc 3aNigeria 0aBacteria 0ametals 0aantibiotics 0aresistance 0azntA 0acopA1 aAdeleke, Oluwaferanmi Joy0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2020 Sept. 02, v. 77, no. 5 p.876-885dRoutledgewJournal:12219x1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2020.17198043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011400170300001600284520084400300592002801144650002001172650001501192650000901207650001301216653002301229653002201252653001301274653001801287700001701305700002601322773009201348856008501440852000901525655001201534IND60593352620221116141330.0180426e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059335262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOchab, Mateusz10aDetermination of trace Se(IV) by anodic stripping voltammetry following double deposition and stripping steps  ap. 364-368.  aA procedure of Se(IV) determination by anodic stripping voltammetry using two deposition and stripping steps at gold electrodes was proposed. A well-defined stripping peak of selenium was obtained at potential 0.9 V. The optimization of parameters influencing the selenium peak current including both deposition and stripping steps was performed. A linear relationship was observed between the Se(IV) peak current and its concentration in the range from 5×10⁻⁹ to 1×10⁻⁷mol L⁻¹. The limit of detection was found to be 8.5×10⁻¹⁰mol L⁻¹. Repeatability of the method determined as RSD % for Se(IV) concentration of 5×10⁻⁸mol L⁻¹ was 4.3% (n=7). The proposed procedure was used for Se(IV) determination in certified reference material and natural water samples and acceptable results and recoveries were obtained.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aselenium 0aStripping analysis 0aDouble deposition 0aSelenium 0aDetermination1 aGęca, Iwona1 aKorolczuk, Mieczyslaw0 tTalanta.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 165 p.364-368dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245011100205300001200316506007600328520099200404592002801396506003701424650001901461650001301480650001601493650001001509650001401519650001101533650001701544650001801561650001101579650001301590650001701603650003601620650005301656650002101709650003201730650002601762650004301788650002901831650002801860650001101888650003801899650003901937650003101976650002502007650001702032650003002049700001502079700001602094700001802110700001702128700001402145700001902159773009202178856008102270852000902351655001202360IND50071670420221207063733.0150211e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007167042DNAL7 a240684992pmid7 aPMC38898742pmcid7 a10.1007/s10529-013-1325-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Shaohui10aTransmembrane routes of cationic liposome-mediated gene delivery using human throat epidermis cancer cells  ap. 1-7.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor studying the mechanism of cationic liposome-mediated transmembrane routes for gene delivery, various inhibitors of endocytosis were used to treat human throat epidermis cancer cells, Hep-2, before transfection with Lipofectamine 2000/pGFP-N2 or Lipofectamine 2000/pGL3. To eliminate the effect of inhibitor toxicity on transfection, the RLU/survival rate was used to represent the transfection efficiency. Chlorpromazine and wortmannin, clathrin inhibitors, decreased transfection efficiency by 44 % (100 μM) and 31 % (100 nM), respectively. At the same time, genistein, a caveolin inhibitor, decreased it by 30 % (200 μM). Thus combined transmembrane routes through the clathrin and caveolae-mediated pathways were major mechanisms of cell uptake for the cationic liposome-mediated gene delivery. After entering the cells, microtubules played an important role on gene delivery as vinblastine, a microtubulin inhibitor, could reduce transfection efficiency by 41 % (200 nM).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achlorpromazine 3aclathrin 3aendocytosis 3agenes 3agenistein 3ahumans 3amicrotubules 3asurvival rate 3athroat 3atoxicity 3atransfection 2aCationsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCaveolinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDrug Delivery Systems 2aEndocytosisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aGenisteinxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aLiposomesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLuciferasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicrotubulesxdrug effects 2aPharyngeal Neoplasms 2aTransfection 2aVinblastinexpharmacology1 aWang, Bing1 aZhao, Yinan1 aChen, Huiying1 aDing, Huiqin1 aZhi, Defu1 aZhang, Shubiao0 tBiotechnology letters.g2014 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.1-7dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-013-1325-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003600132024001100168040001800179100002100197245013500218300001400353506017300367520140300540592002801943650002401971650002301995650001302018650001402031650001002045650001102055650001902066650001702085650002802102650001102130650001502141650002102156650001502177650003002192650002002222653002402242653002302266653001302289653001202302773011602314856008302430856011202513956012502625961001302750852000902763655001202772IND60006172420221214230908.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000617242DNAL7 a3154212aris7 a10113/617242hdl7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2015.08.0012doi8 ans8742  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArthur, Frank H.10aResidual efficacy of pyrethrin + methoprene for control of Tribolium castaneum and Tribolium confusum in a commercial flour mill  ap. 42-44.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aConcrete arenas with and without flour were placed in open, obstructed, and hidden positions inside a commercial flour mill and exposed to a combination treatment of pyrethrin + methoprene. Bioassays were conducted 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks after the arenas were treated by adding flour to those arenas that were exposed without flour, and then placing late-stage larvae of either Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), the red flour beetle, or Tribolium confusum Jacqueline DuVal, the confused flour beetle, on an individual arena. There were no differences in adult emergence of either species on any of the exposed arenas in any position for the residual bioassays, indicating no loss of effectiveness of the insecticide. There was less adult emergence of both species on arenas that had contained flour when they were exposed to the aerosol compared to those exposed without flour and then flour added for the bioassay process. Adult emergence of both species was also lower in arenas with flour in the open position compared to those in the hidden and obstructed positions but regardless of exposure position or whether or not the arenas contained flour when they were exposed to the aerosol, adult emergence was greater in T. confusum than in T. castaneum. Results show how species variability and the presence of structural barriers within a facility can affect susceptibility to aerosol insecticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTribolium castaneum 3aTribolium confusum 3aaerosols 3abioassays 3aflour 3aimagos 3ainsect control 3ainsecticides 3ainterspecific variation 3alarvae 3amethoprene 3amilling industry 3apyrethrins 3astored product protection 3astored products 0aTribolium castaneum 0aTribolium confusum 0aAerosols 0aControl0 tJournal of stored products research.g2015 Oct., v. 64 p.42-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2015.08.0013Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/617243Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/JSPR%20%202015%20%2064%20%2042-44%20%20Arthur.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008900168300001800257520136300275592002801638650001501666650001501681650001501696650001301711650002001724650001901744650001501763650001201778700007001790773014401860856008202004852000902086655001202095IND60746965620221122155233.0210809e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074696562DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-021-01382-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Mina10aEvaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks for Urban Mapping Using Satellite Images  ap. 2125-2131.  aVery high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and image processing algorithms allow for the development of remote sensing applications including multi-temporal classification, tracking of specific targets, multimedia data integration, ecosystem processes analysis, and land cover/land use (LULC) mapping. Classification algorithms are the primary source to generate LCLU maps. Since texture information is essential to generate LULC maps from VHR images, the object-based classification methods should be used instead of pixel-based methods. Also, in urban mapping, it is vital to select the appropriate classifier according to the type of land covers. Recently, in addition to machine learning algorithms, deep learning methods have also been used to classify VHR images. In this study, we compare the accuracy of convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with some machine learning methods, for classification of Pleiades satellite image with 50 cm spatial resolution. The results showed CNN algorithm has the highest classification accuracy when the training samples are increased. However, the difference between the classification accuracy of the CNN and relevance vector machine (RVM) models is not that significant so that one could use a more straightforward method with less training data rather than a complicated one with large volumes of data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aecosystems 3aland cover 3aland use 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atexture1 aSharīfī, ʻAlī Riz̤ā,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7110-75160 tJournal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing.g2021 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.2125-2131dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000001231x0255-660X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-021-01382-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010000157300002000257520067700277592002800954650001500982650001500997650001201012650002001024650001301044650001901057650001101076650001401087650002201101650001301123700001501136700001401151700001601165700001501181773014101196856007401337852000901411655001201420IND60617250020221118052737.0181024e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061725002DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta08006b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yongmeng10aBoosting ethanol electrooxidation via photothermal effect over palladium/reduced graphene oxide  ap. 18426-18429.  aA photothermal effect strategy to combine the model thermal material, namely, reduced graphene oxide with active species (palladium) was developed to greatly improve the activity and stability of ethanol electrooxidation reaction (EOR). The improvement can be ascribed to both accelerated reaction kinetics of EOR and promoted desorption of the toxic reaction intermediate COₐdₛ from active palladium caused by the efficient light absorption and subsequent conversion to thermy of reduced graphene oxide. Additionally, this photothermally enhanced strategy was found to be suitable for electrooxidation reactions of other alcohols (e.g., ethylene glycol and glycerol).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adesorption 3aethanol 3aethylene glycol 3aglycerol 3agraphene oxide 3amodels 3apalladium 3areaction kinetics 3atoxicity1 aHan, Shuhe1 aHuang, Yi1 aShi, Yanmei1 aZhang, Bin0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 6, no. 38 p.18426-18429dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta08006b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010300163300001200266520158300278592002801861596005901889596010501948596006602053596007602119596006302195596008102258650002402339650002402363650001502387700001602402700002102418700001502439700001802454700001202472773013502484856008302619852000902702655001202711IND60746965820221122215544.0220831e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074696582DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-09844-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Lifu10aEvaluation and analysis of metal mine filling based on numerical simulation and actual measurement  ap. 505.  aIn order to make a reasonable evaluation of the effect of backfill mining on non-coal mines, the first phase of the Laixin iron ore mine project is taken as an example. First, a geomechanical model of iron ore mining was established according to geological theory; second, numerical simulation software FLAC3D was used to analyze the surface subsidence, horizontal displacement, plastic failure range of the surrounding rocks, and stress conditions of the surface and surrounding rocks under unfilled and filled conditions; finally, the observation data of surface subsidence in the open area were analyzed against the background of the Phase I mining project of Laixin iron ore mine. The results show that: (1) the amount of surface subsidence increases with the increase of burial depth. As the mining depth increases, the amount of ground subsidence gradually increases. (2) Numerical simulation of the amount of surface subsidence and horizontal displacement in the unfilled condition is ten times that in the filled condition; the plastic zone of destruction in the unfilled condition extends to the surface, and the plastic destruction in the filled condition is mainly in the vicinity of the mining location, and the vertical stress in the unfilled condition is much larger than that in the filled condition; (3) the on-site measured results are basically consistent with the numerical simulation results, and the numerical simulation can be used to reasonably predict the amount of subsidence and horizontal displacement of the ground surface, and the force on the goaf.  aPublisher supplied data  a51874192cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2015AA016404-4cthe National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China  aZR2019MEE084cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  a2017YFC0804108cthe State Key Research and Development Program of China  a2018TDJH102cShandong University of Science and Technology  a420071720cthe Youth Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China 3acomputer simulation 3amathematical models 3asubsidence1 aLiu, Weitao1 aZheng, Qiushuang1 aDu, Yanhui1 aMeng, Xiangxi1 aLi, Xin0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 Aug., v. 80, no. 16 p.505-505dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09844-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245009400204300002000298520173100318592002802049650001602077650001302093650002202106650001602128650000902144650001102153650001302164650001802177650001502195700001702210700005202227700001702279700002102296700005602317700001802373700005602391773011702447856008402564852000902648655001202657IND60677898120221122060429.0191213e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b021722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4598-474710aProbing the Self-Assembly and Nonlinear Friction Behavior of Confined Gold Nano-Particles  ap. 15701-15709.  aFor the wide application of nanoparticles (NPs) (e.g., in nanotribology), it is of fundamental and practical importance to understand the self-assembly and lubrication behavior of confined NPs. In this work, a systematic study was conducted to probe the assembly and associated surface forces of spherical gold nanoparticles (Au NPs, diameter ∼5 nm) confined between pairs of mica (negatively charged) and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane modified mica (APTES-mica, positively charged) surfaces using a surface forces apparatus (SFA) under aqueous conditions. It is observed that Au NPs were squeezed out of the confined gap between two mica surfaces during the loading process, resulting from the repulsive electric-double layer force. In contrast, multilayers of Au NPs were confined between two APTES-mica surfaces because of the attractive double-layer force between oppositely charged Au NPs and APTES-mica. Interestingly, the interaction between Au NPs and APTES-mica is stronger than the interactions between Au NPs, resulting in the rearrangement of the confined Au NPs under shearing. Importantly, a large friction coefficient (μ > 0.7) with unexpected nonlinear stick–slip friction was observed when sliding two APTES-mica surfaces with thin layers of Au NPs (∼20 nm) confined in between. The observed stick–slip motion could be explained by the velocity-dependent friction model where a critical shear velocity was required for transiting from stick–slip to smooth sliding. Our study provides useful information on the assembly and interaction forces of confined nanoparticles on charged surfaces, with implications for predicting the behaviors of NPs under confinement in various engineering applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3afriction 3afriction velocity 3alubrication 3amica 3amodels 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aprediction1 aYan, Yonggan1 aXie, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3520-48151 aLiu, Hanlian1 aHuang, Chuanzhen1 aLü, Qingye,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4157-76021 aQiu, Xiaoyong1 aZeng, Hongbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1432-59790 tLangmuir.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 35, no. 48 p.15701-15709dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b021723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015900157300002000316520155200336592002801888650001301916650001801929650001701947650001601964650001501980650001701995650001302012650002102025650000902046650001802055650001902073650001502092650001602107650002502123650002402148700001802172700001502190700001702205700001802222700001202240700001702252700001902269700001702288700001702305773014202322856007402464852000902538655001202547IND60617250120221118052716.0181024e20181023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061725012DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta08008a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiongwei10aHighly thermally conductive flame retardant epoxy nanocomposites with multifunctional ionic liquid flame retardant-functionalized boron nitride nanosheets  ap. 20500-20512.  aThe low heat dissipation efficiency and serious security issues related to polymer-based thermal management materials (TMMs) have seriously limited their practical applications. However, simultaneously improving their thermal conductivity (TC) and flame retardancy is still a challenge due to performance limitations and complicated processing. Here, non-covalent ionic liquid flame retardant-functionalized boron nitride nanosheets (ILFR-fBNNSs) were used as a multifunctional nano-additive for fabricating epoxy (EP)-based nanocomposites with both superior TC and flame retardancy. Owing to its structural uniqueness and multifunctionality, the ILFR-fBNNS triggers resin crosslinking at a given temperature, while conferring significant improvements in dispersion and interfacial adhesion, thereby forming a thermally conductive network with reduced interfacial phonon scattering and a high-efficiency nano-barrier network acting synergistically with ILFR-induced char residues during thermal degradation. Therefore, the ILFR-fBNNS not only functions as a curing agent for fabricating the nanocomposites, but also acts as a thermal conductor and flame retardant for the nanocomposites. The optimal comprehensive performances of EP/ILFR-fBNNS nanocomposite are achieved with a 12.1 vol% ILFR-fBNNS content with TC enhancement of 478%, and reductions of up to 68.9% and 42.3% by microscale combustion calorimetry (42.4% and 37.7% by cone calorimeter) in peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR) respectively compared to neat EP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aboron nitride 3acalorimeters 3acalorimetry 3acombustion 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides 3aflame retardants 3aheat 3aionic liquids 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3athermal degradation1 aFeng, Yuezhan1 aChen, Chao1 aYe, Yunsheng1 aZeng, Hongxia1 aQu, Hao1 aLiu, Jingwei1 aZhou, Xingping1 aLong, Shijun1 aXie, Xiaolin0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Oct. 23, v. 6, no. 41 p.20500-20512dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta08008a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245018100171300001600352500001900368520101500387536008201402592002801484596002001512650001701532650001701549650001001566650001201576650001201588650002001600650002001620653001601640653001701656653001201673700002001685773012301705856008601828852000901914655001201923IND60711953520221116160323.0201112e20200318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071195352DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2020.17476532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurks, Roger A.10aFirst described fossil representatives of the parasitoid wasp taxa Asaphesinae n. n. and Eunotinae (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Pteromalidae sensu lato) from Eocene Baltic amber  ap. 801-812.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNew Baltic amber species of Pteromalidae sensu lato are described, from two different subfamilies, Asaphesinae n. n. and Eunotinae. Asaphesinae is provided as a replacement name for Asaphinae Ashmead 1904, which is a junior homonym of the trilobite family Asaphidae Burmeister 1843.

Selected core biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, glutathione-S transferase (GST) activity, metallothionein concentration), along with digestive enzyme activities (amylase, endocellulase) and energy reserve concentrations (glycogen, lipids), were monitored throughout the study in exposed mussels. At the Fismes and Ardre sites (downstream basin), metallic and organic contamination levels were low but still high enough to elicit AChE and GST activity induction in exposed mussels (chemical stress); besides, chemical pollutants had no apparent deleterious effects on mussel condition. At the Bouy and Sept-Saulx sites (upstream basin), mussels obviously suffered from adverse food conditions which seriously impaired individual physiological state and survival (nutritional stress); food scarcity had however no apparent effects on core biomarker responses. Digestive enzyme activities responded to both chemical and nutritional stresses, the increase in energy outputs (general adaptation syndrome—downstream sites) or the decrease in energy inputs (food scarcity—upstream sites) leading to mid- or long-term induction of digestive carbohydrase activities in exposed mussels (energy optimizing strategy). Complex regulation patterns of these activities require nevertheless the use of a multi-marker approach to allow data interpretation. Besides, their sensitivity to natural confounding environmental factors remains to be precised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abiomarkers 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3afoods 3aglutathione transferase 3aglycogen 3alipids 3ametallothionein 3amonitoring 3amussels 3anutrition 3aphysiological state 3apollutants 3awatersheds 2aAmylasesxmetabolism 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCellulasesxmetabolism 2aDigestive Systemxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aDreissenaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFresh Waterxanalysis 2aGeneral Adaptation Syndromexchemically inducedxmetabolism. 2aMalnutrition 2aRivers 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity. 3aFrance1 aDedourge-Geffard, O.1 aBeaudon, A.1 aPain-Devin, S.1 aTrapp, J.1 aGeffard, O.1 aNoury, P.1 aGourlay-Francé, C.1 aUher, E.1 aMouneyrac, C.1 aBiagianti-Risbourg, S.1 aGeffard, A.0 tEcotoxicology.g2012 Apr., v. 21, no. 3 p.888-905dSpringer-Verlagx0963-92927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-012-0851-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245004300173300001600216520167100232592002801903653000901931653001101940653001201951653001101963653002001974700002401994700004502018773009602063856008102159852000902240655001202249IND60639729220221121050929.0190503e20190425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063972922DNAL7 a10.1163/22134468-201911382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCocenas-Silva, Raquel10aChronic Stress Impairs Temporal Memory  ap. 108-130.  aTemporal memory is formed from processes encoding and consolidating durations in memory. These processes can be enhanced in acute stressful contexts, which increase the arousal level, typical of the alert phase of the General Adaptation Syndrome of stress. However, prolonged stressful experiences (chronic stress) can cause damage to the storage of duration in memory. This study investigated the effects of psychological and physiological stress on the temporal memory of 50 nurses working in an emergency situation. They performed a temporal generalization task with a retention delay of 24 hours between the learning of a standard duration (4 s) and testing. Their blood was collected to examine circulating inflammatory markers related to stress. Their feeling of stress was also examined with two self-reported questionnaires, the Job Stress Scale (JSS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The results show that temporal judgment is more variable when participants have high exposure to occupational stress (JSS). A quadratic relationship was also observed between the accuracy of time judgment and the level of perceived stress. Indeed, the proportion of accurate responses increased until a certain threshold of perceived stress, and then decreased. The results also showed a significant quadratic relationship between nitric oxide and the proportion of accurate responses. A low stress level is positively related to improving memory for a time, consistent with the reaction triggered in the alarm stage of the General Adaptation Syndrome of stress. However, above a certain level of stress, psychological and physiological stress damages temporal memory.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTime 0amemory 0aarousal 0astress 0ahospital nurses1 aDroit-Volet, Sylvie1 aGherardi-Donato, Edilaine Cristina Silva0 tTiming and time perception.g, v. 7, no. 2 p.108-130dBrillwJournal:26960x2213-44687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22134468-201911383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02627naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012800168300001600296520118400312592002801496650002901524650001601553650002201569650003501591650002001626650002001646650001101666650002601677650001401703650000701717650001301724650001501737653003001752653003201782653001701814653001701831653002201848700001801870700001601888700002201904700001601926700001701942773009201959856008502051852000902136655001202145IND60593353020221116141330.0180426e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059335302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jingwen12aA novel microchip electrophoresis-based chemiluminescence immunoassay for the detection of alpha-fetoprotein in human serum  ap. 107-111.  aA sensitive immunoassay method based on microchip electrophoresis chemiluminescence (MCE-CL) detection technology was developed for the detection of tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). This method adopts the non-competitive immunoassay mode, and was conducted after AFP reacted with excessive horseradish peroxidase (HRP) labeled monoclonal antibody. The extreme pH value was adopted in the electrophoresis buffer solution. The use of brij 35 as an additive of electrophoresis buffer increased dramatically the resolution (Rs) and the reproducibility of the analysis. Under the optimized experimental conditions, effective separation of the immune complex Ag-Ab* and free Ab* was achieved within 60s. The peak height of the immune complex Ag-Ab* was taken as quantification of AFP. Good linearity was observed within AFP concentrations ranging from 10ng/mL to 150ng/mL, and the detection limit was found to be 7.2ng/mL (1.0×10⁻¹⁰M). The present method was successfully applied for the detection of AFP in human serum from both healthy and cancer patients, and the AFP levels in the both were found be in the range of 16.5–23.4ng/mL and 416.2–825.4ng/mL, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen-antibody complex 3ablood serum 3achemiluminescence 3achemiluminescence immunoassays 3adetection limit 3aelectrophoresis 3ahumans 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apatients 3aperoxidase 0aMicrochip electrophoresis 0aChemiluminescence detection 0aImmunoassays 0aTumor marker 0aAlpha-fetoprotein1 aZhao, Jingjin1 aLi, Shuting1 aZhang, Liangliang1 aHuang, Yong1 aZhao, Shulin0 tTalanta.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 165 p.107-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01662naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245004300172300001500215520082700230592002801057650001501085650001301100650002001113650001301133650001101146700002301157700002301180773009301203856005501296852000901351655001201360IND4501433720221121061844.0150416e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450143372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0006-341X.2002.00098.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerring, Amy H.10aFrailty Models with Missing Covariates  ap. 98-109.  aWe present a method for estimating the parameters in random effects models for survival data when covariates are subject to missingness. Our method is more general than the usual frailty model as it accommodates a wide range of distributions for the random effects, which are included as an offset in the linear predictor in a manner analogous to that used in generalized linear mixed models. We propose using a Monte Carlo EM algorithm along with the Gibbs sampler to obtain parameter estimates. This method is useful in reducing the bias that may be incurred using completeâcase methods in this setting.

These data show clear island-to-open ocean gradients in fCO₂ and total alkalinity that can be measured 10–20 km offshore, indicating that metabolic processes influence the CO₂–carbonic acid system over large areas of ocean surrounding FFS and by implication the islands and atolls of the NWHI. The magnitude and extent of this spatial gradient may be driven by a combination of physical and biogeochemical processes including reef water residence time, hydrodynamic forcing of currents and tidal flow, and metabolic processes that occur both on the reef and within the lagoon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3aatolls 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3ahydrodynamics 3aislands 3apH 3aseawater 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aHawaii1 aMackenzie, Fred T.1 aKahng, Samuel E.1 aKosaki, Randall K.1 aAlin, Simone R.1 aWinn, Christopher D.0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2017 Apr., v. 23, no. 2 p.75-88dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-017-9310-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010900155300002000264520108500284592002801369650001701397650001101414650001901425650001401444650002301458650002101481650002201502650001301524650001001537650002901547650001801576650000801594650001601602650001601618700001701634700001501651700001801666700001901684700002601703700001801729700002701747773014201774856007401916852000901990655001201999IND60617250420221118052727.0181024e20181023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061725042DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta08058e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYiliguma, 10aSub-5 nm SnO₂ chemically coupled hollow carbon spheres for efficient electrocatalytic CO₂ reduction  ap. 20121-20127.  aThe electrochemical CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR) represents a sustainable approach to convert the continuously accumulating CO₂ emission into fuels or value-added chemicals. Tin and its compounds are recognized as formate selective CO₂RR catalysts, while their catalytic activities and stabilities significantly depend on the micro/nanostructures and the corresponding electronic structures of the catalysts. Herein, we developed a sub-5 nm SnO₂ nanoparticle-decorated hollow carbon spherical structure (SnO₂/C) as an efficient CO₂RR electrocatalyst. Compared to the plain SnOₓ nanoparticle-aggregated hollow spheres and hollow carbon spheres, SnO₂/C achieved a much enhanced CO₂RR catalytic performance, including better faradaic efficiencies (FE) and enhanced electrochemical stability. The much improved CO₂RR activity and stability of SnO₂/C were attributed to the Sn–O–C linkages between SnO₂ and the carbon sphere, which led to the increased CO₂ chemisorption, fast electron transfer, and the increased number of catalytically active sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aformates 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ananomaterials 3atin 3atin dioxide 3avalue added1 aWang, Zhijie1 aYang, Chao1 aGuan, Anxiang1 aShang, Longmei1 aAl-Enizi, Abdullah M.1 aZhang, Lijuan1 aZheng, G.q(Gengfeng),0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Oct. 23, v. 6, no. 41 p.20121-20127dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta08058e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245011600215300002000331500001900351520034200370592002800712650001400740650002000754650001900774650001300793653004500806653001500851653001500866653002100881653001700902653003100919700006100950700002401011700002201035700002101057700006101078773014601139856008501285852000901370655001201379IND60707179520210903000000.0200819e20200805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070717952DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c038162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrawford, Deborah E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2579-798710aSolvent-Free, Continuous Synthesis of Hydrazone-Based Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients by Twin-Screw Extrusion  ap. 12230-12238.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTwin-screw extrusion (TSE) was used to synthesize hydantoin-based active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) such as nitrofurantoin and dantrolene, employing minimal or no solvent.

When selecting sites to deposit their eggs, female flies are capable of ranking the relative attractiveness of their options and choosing the "greater of two goods." However, most egg-laying preference assays are not practical if one wants to take a systematic genetic screening approach to search for the circuit basis underlying this simple decision-making process, as they are population-based and laborious to set up. To increase the throughput of studying of egg-laying preferences of single females, we developed custom chambers that each can simultaneously assay egg-laying preferences of up to thirty individual flies as well as a protocol that ensures each female has a high egg-laying rate (so that their preference is readily discernable and more convincing). Our approach is simple to execute and produces very consistent results. Additionally, these chambers can be equipped with different attachments to allow video recording the egg-laying animals and to deliver light for optogenetics studies. This article provides the blueprints for fabricating these chambers and the procedure for preparing the flies to be assayed in these chambers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aanimals 3adecision making 3aeggs 3afemales 3agenetic testing 3amodels 3aoptogenetics 3aoviposition 3avideo recording1 aZhu, Edward1 aHe, Ruo1 aStern, Ulrich1 aYang, Zhonghui,0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Mar. 24, , no. 109 p.e53716-e53716dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/537163Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53716/high-throughput-assay-to-examine-egg-laying-preferences-individual  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014700164300001200311520177100323592002802094650002502122650002002147650001402167650001502181650003102196650001302227650002102240650001302261650002402274650001502298650001402313650001302327650000902340650001902349650003002368650001102398650002002409650001102429650001802440700001902458700001402477700001502491700001502506773010502521856008302626852000902709655001202718IND60746966420221121074312.0220621e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074696642DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-021-03135-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNi, Xianzhi10aPhysiological and transcriptomic analyses to reveal underlying phenolic acid action in consecutive monoculture problem of Polygonatum odoratum  ap. 362.  aBACKGROUND: The root rot of fragrant solomonseal (Polygonatum odoratum) has occurred frequently in the traditional P. odoratum cultivating areas in recent years, causing a heavy loss in yield and quality. The phenolic acids in soil, which are the exudates from the P. odoratum root, act as allelochemicals that contribute to the consecutive monoculture problem (CMP) of the medicinal plant. The aim of this study was to get a better understanding of P. odoratum CMP. RESULTS: The phenolic acid contents, the nutrient chemical contents, and the enzyme activities related to the soil nutrient metabolism in the first cropping (FC) soil and continuous cropping (CC) soil were determined, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the regulation of the phenolic acids in roots were analyzed. The results showed that five low-molecule-weight phenolic acids were detected both in the CC soil and FC soil, but the phenolic acid contents in the CC soil were significantly higher than those in the FC soil except vanillic acid. The contents of the available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium in the CC soil were significantly decreased, and the activities of urease and sucrase in the CC soil were significantly decreased. The genomic analysis showed that the phenolic acid anabolism in P. odoratum in the CC soil was promoted. These results indicated that the phenolic acids were accumulated in the CC soil, the nutrient condition in the CC soil deteriorated, and the nitrogen metabolism and sugar catabolism of the CC soil were lowered. Meantime, the anabolism of phenolic acids was increased in the CC plant. CONCLUSIONS: The CC system promoted the phenolic acid anabolism in P. odoratum and made phenolic acids accumulate in the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolygonatum odoratum 3aallelochemicals 3aanabolism 3acatabolism 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3amedicinal plants 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aroot rot 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3asugars 3atranscriptomics 3aurease 3avanillic acid1 aJin, Chenzhong1 aLiu, Aiyu1 aChen, Yong1 aHu, Yihong0 tBMC plant biology.g2021 Dec., v. 21, no. 1 p.362-362dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03135-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245015200160300001600312520213400328592002802462650002502490650002402515650001102539650001902550650001302569650001402582650001602596650001902612650002002631700001902651700002602670700001402696700001802710700002102728700002002749773012202769856004002891852000902931655001202940IND50090242220221118192946.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009024222DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.121412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanderperren, K.10aClinical, radiographic, ultrasonographic and computed tomographic features of nonseptic osteitis of the axial border of the proximal sesamoid bones  ap. 463-467.  aREASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Lysis of the axial aspect of equine proximal sesamoid bones (PSBs) is a rare condition reported to have septic or traumatic origins. Limited information exists regarding imaging of nonseptic axial osteitis of a PSB. OBJECTIVES: To report the clinical, radiographic, ultrasonographic, computed tomographic and intra‐arterial contrast‐enhanced computed tomographic abnormalities in horses with axial nonseptic osteitis of a PSB. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. METHODS: Eighteen horses diagnosed with nonseptic osteitis of the axial border of a PSB between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Case details, clinical examination, radiographic, ultrasonographic, computed tomographic and intra‐arterial/intra‐articular contrast‐enhanced computed tomographic features were recorded, when available. Radiographic, ultrasonographic and computed tomographic evaluations of the fetlock region had been performed on 18, 15 and 9 horses, respectively. The effect of the degree of lysis on the grade and duration of lameness was determined. RESULTS: All horses had chronic unilateral lameness, 4 with forelimb and 14 with hindlimb signs. On radiographs, lysis was identified in both PSBs in 14 horses, one PSB in 3 horses and in one horse no lysis was identified. The degree of osteolysis was variable. Ultrasonography identified variably sized irregularities of the bone surface and alteration in echogenicity of the palmar/plantar ligament (PL). All horses undergoing computed tomographic examination (n = 9) had biaxial lysis. The lesions were significantly longer and deeper on computed tomographic images compared with radiographic images. Intra‐arterial contrast‐enhanced computed tomography may reveal moderate to marked contrast enhancement of the PL. There was no significant effect of the degree of lysis on the grade and duration of lameness. CONCLUSIONS: Lesions of nonseptic axial osteitis of a PSB can be identified using a combination of radiography and ultrasonography.

Trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. Gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. Eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564–566) and ceca (140–142, 218–220, 284–286, 312, and 482) across trials. OTU 564–566 was associated with lower performance, while OTUs 140–142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. Targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight OTUs revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related to Lactobacillus spp., Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales, Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidales, Clostridiales/Lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. Where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the Firmicutes, with Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria also identified. Some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus aviarius, Lactobacillus crispatus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Escherichia coli, Gallibacterium anatis, Clostridium lactatifermentans, Ruminococcus torques, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Alistipes finegoldii). The 16S rRNA gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. This information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides vulgatus 3aClostridium 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus aviarius 3aLactobacillus crispatus 3aLactobacillus salivarius 3aRuminococcus torques 3abacteria 3abreeds 3abroiler chickens 3acecum 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afeed formulation 3amicrobial communities 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis1 aHughes, Robert J.1 aMikkelsen, Lene L.1 aPerez-Maldonado, Rider1 aBalding, Katherine1 aMacAlpine, Ron1 aPercy, Nigel J.1 aOphel-Keller, Kathy0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 77, no. 17 p.5868-5878dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00165-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010200166300001400268520090900282592002801191650002301219650002101242650001801263650002301281650001601304650001401320650000901334650002101343650000701364650003901371650001401410650001601424653002301440653002101463653002001484653001801504653001701522653001801539700001701557700002001574700001801594773012001612856008201732852000901814655001201823IND60527909520221121083002.0190416e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052790952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazaraa, Wael10aPurification and characterization of extracellular glutaminase from Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 32567  ap. 76-81.  aThe glutaminase produced from Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 32567 was purified (10.2 folds) using ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. SDS-PAGE of the purified glutaminase showed the presence of one band with a molecular weight of 68kDa. Optimum pH was 7.0 while a temperature range 30–40°C was optimal the activity. The highest pH stability was obtained at pH 7.0 while a temperature range 30–40°C resulted in the highest temperature stability. The apparent Km value was calculated from the Linenweaver-Burk plot and was found to be 4.5mM. Glutamine was the preferred substrate for the enzyme and the maximum relative activity of 130% was observed at 2.5% glutamine . Potassium showed a slight increase in activity of glutaminase especially at the concentration of 0.5mM.

It is involved in the immune response or apoptosis by activating the nuclear factor-κB pathway and is associated with polyglucosan body myopathy 1, an autosomal recessive disorder with progressive muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. However, little is currently known regarding the function of linear ubiquitination in muscles. Here, we investigated the role of linear ubiquitin E3 ligase (LUBEL), a DrosophilaHOIP ortholog, in the development and aging of muscles. The muscles of the flies with down-regulation of LUBEL or its downstream factors, kenny and Relish, developed normally, and there were no obvious abnormalities in function in young flies. However, the locomotor activity of the LUBEL RNAi flies was reduced compared to age-matched control, while LUBEL RNAi did not affect the increased mitochondrial fusion or myofiber disorganization during aging. Interestingly, the accumulation of polyubiquitinated protein aggregation during aging decreased in muscles by silencing LUBEL, kenny, or Relish. Meanwhile, the levels of autophagy and global translation, which are implicated in the maintenance of proteostasis, did not change due to LUBEL down-regulation. In conclusion, we propose a new role of linear ubiquitination in proteostasis in the muscle aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acardiomyopathy 3aimmune response 3alocomotion 3amitochondria 3amuscles 3amuscular diseases 3aresearch 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination 0aAging 0aLinear ubiquitination 0aLUBEL 0aMuscle 0aProteostasis1 aShin, Changmin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9875-29501 aShin, Myeongcheol1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0665-864X1 aChoi, Byoungyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6561-04461 aYuan, Chunyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2230-59591 aCho, Kyoung Sang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3277-82690 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Apr. 23, v. 550 p.184-190dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012100168500002200289500001500311520177100326592002802097650001602125650001302141650001902154650001702173650001502190650001602205650001802221650001202239650001302251650001302264650001102277650002202288650001402310650001102324650001502335650001702350650001602367650001102383650001502394650001702409650002002426650001202446650001902458653001102477653001902488653002302507653002702530653002202557653001702579700006202596700001802658773010402676856008302780852000902863655001202872IND60628710620221121155906.0190415e20190119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062871062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2019.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGori, Antonella10aGrowing healthy food under heavy metal pollution load: Overview and major challenges of tree based edible landscapes  aPre-press version  a2019-12-06  aAfter an unpreceded physical separation occurred since the Industrial revolution, at present there is growing understanding that depriving humans from their connections with nature reduces mental, physical and social well-being. Accordingly, urban edible landscaping is now booming worldwide but, although UE is adopting policies supporting food production within the boundaries of many cities, research and knowledge on design and management practices for urban food forestry is still limited and no common guidelines for fruit production in urban areas are available. In particular, the urban environment is a pollution hotspot, and knowledge about the uptake and translocation of pollutants to a plant edible part is needed to match food security to food safety of edible landscapes. Widespread heavy metal pollution in urban soils sets the need of understanding the species-specific patterns of metal translocation within the plant and to its edible parts. Most common strategies include: exclusion, passive accumulation and active accumulation, but mechanisms are known only for very a limited number of woody edible species. Particulate matter and atmospheric can be other appreciable, soil-independent, sources of pollution for food cultivated in urban sites. Airborne metals can directly enter into the fruit or be absorbed by leaf through stomata and then translocated. Existing knowledge and gaps about metal uptake through leaf and re-distribution within the plant are reviewed here.This knowledge may guide species and cultivar selection to produce healthy food in urban sites and might be a pre-requisite to drive planning and management of edible landscapes with a higher degree of ecological complexity than urban orchards, such as urban food forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aurban soils 3aplanning 3aedible species 3aheavy metals 3aguidelines 3aurban areas 3afood security 3aforests 3aorchards 3aforestry 3acities 3aissues and policy 3acultivars 3ahumans 3apollutants 3aparticulates 3alandscaping 3afruits 3alandscapes 3ahealthy diet 3afood production 3astomata 3apollution load 0aleaves 0aSoil pollution 0aParticulate matter 0aPlant pollutant uptake 0aUrban food forest 0aHeavy metals1 aFerrini, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2222-04371 aFini, Alessio0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2019 Jan. 19, dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2019.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245015900173300001400332520122800346592002801574650002601602650002201628650001901650650001601669650001601685650002601701650002801727650001701755650003301772650001201805650001001817653001601827653001601843653003401859653001601893700002101909700002401930773012001954856008202074852000902156655001202165IND60527909620221121062319.0190416e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052790962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeena, Sunita Kumari10aEffect of seed bio-priming and N doses under varied soil type on nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under greenhouse conditions  ap. 68-75.  aThis study was aimed to investigate an impact of bio-priming by Trichoderma harzianum BHU51, varied N doses (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% RDN) along with varied soils types (alluvial, red and black) on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under greenhouse conditions.

Significantly higher effective tillers, chlorophyll content and root length were recorded with recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) of NPK @ 120-60-60kgha−1 followed by seed bio-priming with T. harzianum+3/4th N and RDF of PK. The seed bio-priming also enhanced the plant growth and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Agronomic use efficiency (AUE) and physiological use efficiency (PUE) were significantly higher with alluvial soil as compared to black and red soils.

Furthermore, the signaling pathways involved in the activation of KPCs and HDFs were investigated, and wound-healing effect is evaluated in vivo through animal wound models. We found that the ginsenoside Rd significantly increased the proliferation and migration level of KPCs and HDFs in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the cell survival was significantly increased in H₂O₂ treated KPCs. Moreover, the ginsenoside Rd effectively induced collagen type 1 and down-regulated matrix metalloprotinase-1 (MMP-1) in a dose-dependent manner. All of these beneficial effects are associated with an induction of intracellular cAMP levels and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein expression in nucleus, which both attenuated by adenine 9-β-d-arabinofuranoside, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor. Application of the ginsenoside Rd to an excision wound in mice showed an effective healing process. As skin regeneration is mainly associated with the activation of HDFs and KPCs, P. ginseng leaf, an alternative source of the ginsenoside Rd, can be used as a natural source for skin regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3aactive ingredients 3aadenine 3aadenylate cyclase 3acell viability 3acollagen 3aexcision 3afibroblasts 3aginsenosides 3ahumans 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amice 3amodels 3apharmacology 3aprotective effect 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3atraditional medicine 2aAnimals 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCollagenxmetabolism 2aCyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Proteinxmetabolism 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFibroblastsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGinsenosidesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aKeratinocytesxcytology 2aMatrix Metalloproteinase 1xmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Hairless 2aPanax 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aSignal Transduction 2aSkinxcytology 2aStem Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aWound Healingxdrug effects1 aSong, Seung-Yong1 aOh, Won Keun1 aKaewsuwan, Sireewan1 aTran, Tien Lam1 aKim, Won-Serk1 aSung, Jong-Hyuk0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 702, no. 1-3 p.285-293dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0483Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245012200155300001600277520193600293592002802229650002502257650002402282650000902306650001102315650001902326650000902345650002602354650001002380700001502390700001702405700001502422700001602437773012202453856004002575852000902615655001202624IND50090242420221118192919.0140612e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009024242DNAL7 a10.1111/evj.121742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBühler, M.10aComputed tomographic features of apical infection of equine maxillary cheek teeth: A retrospective study of 49 horses  ap. 468-473.  aREASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Computed tomographic (CT) studies evaluating the relevance of individual CT features of apical infection in maxillary cheek teeth are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence and relationship of single CT features in horses with and without clinical evidence of apical infection in maxillary cheek teeth. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case–control study. METHODS: Multislice CT scans of the head of 49 horses were evaluated retrospectively. Changes of the infundibulum, pulp, root, lamina dura, periodontal space and alveolar bone in maxillary cheek teeth were recorded. RESULTS: Single CT changes were much more prevalent in the 28 horses with clinical signs. However, infundibular changes and a nondetectable lamina dura were also common in the 21 horses without clinical evidence of apical infection. Computed tomographic abnormalities of the pulp, root, periapical bone and periodontal space and the presence of a tooth fracture were significantly related. Infundibular changes were not associated with other CT signs of apical infection. Although nondetectable lamina dura was the most frequent CT change in all teeth in both studied groups, it was most commonly a solitary feature in otherwise normal teeth. Apical infections, defined as ≥3 CT changes, occurred mainly in the 108/208, 109/209 and 110/210 (Triadan numbers) and were found only in horses with clinical evidence of apical infection, except in one horse without clinical signs that had one affected root. CONCLUSIONS: Combined CT changes of the pulp, root, lamina dura, periapical bone and periodontal space and the presence of a tooth fracture appear to be reliable features to diagnose apical infection in maxillary cheek teeth. As a solitary feature, a nondetectable lamina dura should be interpreted cautiously and may even be considered normal due to its minor thickness and/or too low resolution of the imaging modality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase-control studies 3acomputed tomography 3ahead 3ahorses 3aimage analysis 3apulp 3aretrospective studies 3ateeth1 aFurst, A.,1 aLewis, F.

The implementation of national and international regulations is in fact nearly fully based on the use of such indicators. On the other hand, scientists spend a considerable effort into trying to express and understand the physical processes underlying a certain system, but often they do not put the necessary effort to translate them into useful indicators which can be used by coastal managers. This paper tries to close the existing gap between scientists and coastal managers by describing the morphological development of the Holland coast through an indicator approach. In particular, three indicators have been chosen to quantify three different coastal functions, i.e. the short-term safety, the medium term safety and the available space for nature and recreation. The dynamics of the indicators have been quantified in relation to the external pressure factors determining those changes. Those relations provide simple rules of thumb which can be used by coastal managers to quantify the effects of specific actions (e.g. implementation of nourishments), to assess the impact of changes in the natural forcing (e.g due to climate change), or as a basis for cost-benefit analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acost benefit analysis 3amanagers 3arecreation 3ascientists1 aSantinelli, Giorgio1 aVuik, Vincent0 tOcean & coastal management.g2014 Jan., v. 87 p.93-101dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2013.09.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003000149245010000179300001600279520137500295592002801670650003101698650002501729650001601754650001901770650001901789650001601808650002701824650001201851650001001863650001701873650001901890650002301909650001101932653001901943653001701962653001201979653001001991700001702001700002202018700002102040773011302061856008302174852000902257655001202266IND60547067120221120204359.0161023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054706712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchut-Mikolajczyk, Olga10aBiodegradation of diesel oil hydrocarbons enhanced with Mucor circinelloides enzyme preparation  ap. 142-148.  aThe aim of the study was to use immobilized in situ Mucor circinelloides (MC) enzymes preparation as an agent for enhanced microbial hydrocarbons biodegradation. It is a new element of complex biological degradation of diesel oil hydrocarbons (8% v/v) performed by bacterial consortia (Gordonia alkanivorans S7 (S7), Achromobacter xylosoxidans G21 (G21), Pseudomonas sp. A34 (A34)). After 14 days of biodegradation experiments, addition of M. circinelloides enzyme preparation not only increased the efficiency of hydrocarbons degradation in about 20 %–30 % compared to samples without the preparation, but also resulted in higher metabolic activity of microorganisms (higher respiratory activity, 30% decrease in critical oxygen concentration). The use of M. circinelloides enzyme preparation has significant influence on the emulsifying activity of the strains, which is very important in case of utilization of hydrophobic substances, such as hydrocarbons. Values of the parameter were relatively higher in the presence of the preparation (trail with A. xylosoxidans G21 and MC OD500 = 1.3 ± 20.8 × 10−3 at the same time trail with A. xylosoxidans G21 OD500 = 0.925 ± 0.5 × 10−3).

The additive hydroxylamine hydrochloride plays a critical role in reversing the negatively charged pristine rGO to positively charged rGO, which favors the electrostatic attraction of ReO₄⁻ and facilitates the subsequent growth of the few-layered ReS₂ nanosheets perpendicular to the rGO substrates, where ReS₂ nanosheets present a thickness of ∼3.7 nm and a height of ∼50 nm relative to the rGO scaffold. Due to the synergistic effects of the elegant 2D–2D nano-hierarchy created on graphene, the resulting v-ReS₂/rGO nanocomposite exhibits reversible lithium and sodium storage with excellent specific capacity and rate capability at low potentials, making such 2D–2D materials promising candidates as anode hosts in alkali ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3achemistry 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahosts 3ahydroxylamine 3alithium 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3asodium 3asynergism1 aLiu, Yan1 aLei, Wanwan1 aZhou, Xin1 aXu, Kang1 aQiao, Qiquan1 aZhang, Wen-Hua0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Oct. 23, v. 6, no. 41 p.20267-20276dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta08206e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245009500178300001600273520093900289592002801228650001901256650001301275650001301288650002601301650002301327650002101350650001101371650001601382650001601398650002601414650001301440650001301453651001001466653001301476653001301489653001301502653002101515653001701536653001601553700003101569773012201600856008201722852000901804655001201813IND60527910020221116160148.0190416e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052791002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnusuya, Sathiyanarayanan10aEffect of chitosan on growth, yield and curcumin content in turmeric under field condition  ap. 102-106.  aField experiments were conducted at the experimental field in Erode, TamilNadu to investigate the effect of foliar application of chitosan (a growth promoter) on growth, yield attributes and curcumin content of turmeric (Erode local). The chitosan (0.1%, w/v) was sprayed at a regular interval of 30 days up to 210 days. Results revealed that the growth parameters (shoot height, leaf number/plant, plant fresh weight) were increased with application of chitosan. Foliar application of chitosan induced the activity levels of defense enzymes such as protease inhibitors (PI), β-1,3 glucanases, peroxidases (PO) and polyphenol oxidases (PPO) in the leaves and rhizomes of turmeric plants. Chitosan treatment to turmeric plants results in high yield and curcumin content.

The detection was based on monitoring the spectral shifts during the binding of CRP on the antibody molecules that have been immobilized on the sensing arms of the BB-MZIs. By employing the reaction rate as the analytical signal the assay time was compressed to few minutes. The detection limit was 2.1ng/mL, the quantification limit was 4.2ng/mL and the linear dynamic range extended up to 100ng/mL. The measurements performed in human serum samples with the developed immunosensor were characterized by high repeatability and accuracy as it was demonstrated by dilution linearity and recovery experiments. In addition, the concentration values determined were in excellent agreement with those determined for the same samples by a standard clinical laboratory method. The compact size of the chip makes the proposed immunosensor attractive for incorporation into miniaturized devices for the determination of clinical analytes at the point-of-need.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectronic chips 3ahumans 3aimmunosensors 3ainterferometers 3alaboratory techniques 3amonitoring 0aBroad-band Mach-Zehnder interferometer 0aMonolithic integration 0aLabel-free immunosensor 0aC-reactive protein1 aBotsialas, Athanasios1 aSalapatas, Alexandros1 aStefanitsis, Gerasimos1 aNikita, Dimitra1 aJobst, Gerhard1 aChaniotakis, Nikolaos1 aGoustouridis, Dimitrios1 aMakarona, Eleni1 aPetrou, Panagiota S.1 aRaptis, Ioannis1 aMisiakos, K.q(Konstantinos),1 aKakabakos, Sotirios E.0 tTalanta.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 165 p.458-465dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245022600214300002000440520153200460592002801992650001502020650001602035650001502051650002802066650001002094650001902104650002402123650000902147650001802156650001302174700006102187773011602248856008402364852000902448655001202457IND60677899320221122060330.0191213e20191107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067789932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b024722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKataoka-Hamai, Chiho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4068-040510aInteraction Mechanisms of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles with Hydrophobic Glass Surfaces and Silicone Oil–Water Interfaces: Adsorption, Deformation, Rupture, Dynamic Shape Changes, Internal Vesicle Formation, and Desorption  ap. 16136-16145.  aPhospholipid monolayers at oil–water interfaces are often obtained via vesicle adsorption. However, the interaction mechanisms of vesicles with these oil–water interfaces remain unclear. Herein, we studied the adsorption of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of approximately 2–5 μm diameter onto silicone oil–water interfaces and glass surfaces modified with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and octadecyltrimethoxysilane (ODTMS) using fluorescence microscopy. The GUVs exhibited various modes of interaction, adsorbing on the silanized glass surfaces without sizable deformation, whereas GUVs bound to the silicone oil–water interface exhibited large deformation. After adsorption, GUV rupture occurred within 350, 110, and 3 ms on HMDS-modified glass, ODTMS-modified glass, and silicone oil–water interface, respectively. On glass surfaces, GUV rupture was often initiated and proceeded with pore formation near the surface. The monolayer patches formed by GUV rupture on HMDS-modified glass remained for at least 1 h over an area approximately twice of that estimated from the original GUV. On the ODTMS-modified glass and silicone oil surfaces, the monolayer patch structures disappeared in milliseconds owing to lipid diffusion across the interface. When adsorbed on the oil–water interface, the GUVs spontaneously underwent dynamic shape changes, internal vesicle formation, and desorption without rupture. Thus, it can be concluded that these different pathways arose from different lipid–surface affinities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3adeformation 3adesorption 3afluorescence microscopy 3aglass 3ahydrophobicity 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3aphospholipids 3asilicone1 aKawakami, Kohsaku1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3466-93650 tLangmuir.g2019 Nov. 07, v. 35, no. 49 p.16136-16145dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b024723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01528naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245007000170300001600240500001900256520049000275592002800765650001100793650001300804650001000817650001100827650002600838650001600864650001900880651001000899653001500909653002100924700002100945773011100966856008001077852000901157655001201166IND60695833520221120084446.0200519e20061201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069583352DNAL7 a10.1179/174328206X1523242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHedderson, Terry A.10aOncophorus dendrophilus, a new moss species from Cyprus and Crete  ap. 357-359.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOncophorus dendrophilus is described from two upland forest localities in the Paphos District of Cyprus, and from the White Mountains of Crete.

The antagonist affinity of ibodutant was evaluated through concentration-dependent inhibition curves at the [¹²⁵I]NKA specific binding by using membranes prepared from human colon smooth muscle. In this assay the affinity of ibodutant (pKᵢ 9.9) was compared to that of other two selective NK₂ receptor antagonists, nepadutant (pKᵢ 8.4) and saredutant (pKᵢ 9.2). The antagonist potency of ibodutant was evaluated towards the [βAla⁸]NKA(4-10)-mediated contractions of human colon smooth muscle strips. In this assay ibodutant (3, 10, 30 and 100nM) induced a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the [βAla⁸]NKA(4-10) concentration-response curves without depressing the maximal contractile effect. The analysis of the curves yielded a Schild-plot linear regression with a slope not different from unity (1.02), thus indicating a surmountable antagonist behavior. The calculated apparent antagonist potency as pKB value was 9.1. No sex related differences were observed in NK₂ receptor pharmacology for [βAla⁸]NKA(4-10) or ibodutant in colonic strips obtained from male or female patients. Reversibility experiments of tachykinin NK₂ receptor blockade indicated that the inhibition of the agonist-induced contractions in preparations pre-exposed to ibodutant, and afterwards subjected to repeated washing cycles remained almost constant showing no sign of recovery during the 3h observation period. Overall, the present study indicates ibodutant as a potent tachykinin NK₂ receptor antagonist in the human colon tissue, also endowed with a persistent duration of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3acolon 3ahumans 3alinear models 3apatients 3apharmacology 3asmooth muscle 3awashing1 aMeini, Stefania1 aGiuliani, Sandro1 aCatalani, Claudio1 aBechi, Paolo1 aRiccadonna, Sara1 aRingressi, Maria Novella1 aMaggi, Carlo Alberto0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2013 Feb. 28, v. 702, no. 1-3 p.32-37dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2013.01.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009000169300001400259520130400273592002801577650001501605650001601620650001501636650001401651650001301665650001101678650001301689650002301702650001701725650000801742650001601750653001501766653001501781653001301796653001801809653001301827700002101840700002101861700001601882700001901898700001801917773011101935856008302046852000902129655001202138IND60547067520221122130449.0161023e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054706752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzeng, Jing-Hua10aSpent tea leaves: A new non-conventional and low-cost biosorbent for ethylene removal  ap. 67-73.  aThis characterizations of the low-cost microsized spent tea leaf powder (MSTLP) and the effectiveness on its use as biosorbent in the removal of ethylene from a gaseous stream was investigated. Microprocessing treatment of used tea leaves significantly enhanced its ethylene removal capability. The effects of MSTLP dosage, initial ethylene concentration, and temperature on the adsorption of ethylene on MSTLP were evaluated. Moreover, the surface area/pore size distribution, functional group, and morphology of MSTLP samples were characterized. The kinetic adsorption data conformed well to a pseudo-second-order equation, and this adsorption was involved in intraparticle diffusion. The negative value of ΔG0 and the positive value of ΔS0 indicate that the adsorption of ethylene onto MSTLP was a spontaneous process. The adsorption capacity was found to increase with decreasing temperature and increasing MSTLP dosage. The maximum adsorption capacities varied from 0.68 to 6.93 μmol/g at 25 °C based on the fits of Langmuir isotherm. MSTLP could be regenerated, and reused ten times for ethylene adsorption. The results show that a suitable choice of the microprocessing procedure for agriculture byproducts permits production of cheap biosorbent with high sorption capacity of ethylene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiosorbents 3abyproducts 3aequations 3aethylene 3aleaves 3aporosity 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atea 3atemperature 0aAdsorption 0aBiosorbent 0aEthylene 0aKinetic study 0aTea leaf1 aWeng, Chih-Huang1 aHuang, Jenn Wen,1 aLin, Yu-Hao1 aLai, Chung-Wei1 aLin, Yao-Tung0 tInternational Biodeterioration & Biodegradation.g2015 Oct., v. 104 p.67-73dElsevier Ltdx0964-83057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2015.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245019900168300001600367520146200383592002801845650001601873650002201889650002001911650001301931650002101944650002201965650001501987650000902002650001302011650001402024650001902038650002402057653001302081653003602094653003502130653002402165653001102189700002002200700002702220773009202247856008502339852000902424655001202433IND60593354120221116141557.0180426e20170401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059335412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖzcan, Ali,10aDevelopment of a disposable and low-cost electrochemical sensor for dopamine detection based on poly(pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid)-modified electrochemically over-oxidized pencil graphite electrode  ap. 489-495.  aIn this study, preparation of a single-use electrochemical sensor for the selective and sensitive determination of dopamine (DOP) was investigated by electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid on electrochemically over-oxidized pencil graphite electrode (p(P3CA)/EOPGE). Cyclic voltammetry measurements of Fe(CN)6⁴⁻/³⁻ indicated that the electrochemically over-oxidized PGE (EOPGE) showed superior electron transfer characteristics according to bare PGE. The ionized carboxyl groups found in the structure of poly(pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid) (p(P3CA)) showed high affinity towards positively charged DOP. The combination of the advantages of EOPGE and p(P3CA) in p(P3CA)/EOPGE led to a synergistic effect on the electrochemical oxidation of DOP. The effects of experimental variables on the voltammetric performance of the p(P3CA)/EOPGE were examined by preparing the electrodes at different conditions. The p(P3CA)/EOPGE showed high selectivity towards DOP by discriminating its oxidation potential from the common interfering substances such as ascorbic and uric acids. The p(P3CA)/EOPGE showed linear responses in the electrochemical oxidation of DOP between the concentration values of 0.025µM and 7.5µM. Detection limit was determined as 0.0025µM according to signal to noise ratio (S/N: 3). Analytical application of p(P3CA)/EOPGE was successfully tested in the determination of DOP in blood serum and pharmaceutical samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acarbon electrodes 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aionization 3airon 3amoieties 3aoxidation 3apolymerization 3asensors (equipment) 0aDopamine 0aPoly(pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid) 0aElectrochemical over-oxidation 0aModified electrodes 0aSensor1 aİlkbaş, Salih1 aAtılır Özcan, Ayça0 tTalanta.g2017 Apr. 01, v. 165 p.489-495dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012100158300002000279520086200299592002801161650001101189650001001200650001301210650001201223650001501235650002101250650001601271653002001287653002001307653003301327700001601360700001801376700001701394700001901411700002001430700001801450700001701468700002001485700001701505700001601522773012901538856007301667852000901740655001201749IND60527696620221119122345.0160715e20140827xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052769662DNAL7 a10.1021/am502281t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJung, Min Wook10aNovel Fabrication of Flexible Graphene-Based Chemical Sensors with Heaters using Soft Lithographic Patterning Method  ap. 13319-13323.  aWe have fabricated graphene-based chemical sensors with flexible heaters for the highly sensitive detection of specific gases.

The amount of accepted variability during the comparative assessments of biosimilar products introduces a significant challenge for both the biosimilar developers and the regulatory authorities. The aim of this study was to explore unsupervised machine learning tools as a mathematical aid for the interpretation and visualization of such comparability under control and stress conditions using data extracted from high throughput analytical techniques. For this purpose, a head-to-head analysis of the physicochemical characteristics of three Trastuzumab (TTZ) approved biosimilars and the originator product (Herceptin®) was performed. The studied quality attributes included the primary structure and identity by peptide mapping (PM) with reversed-phase chromatography-UV detection, size and charge profiles by stability-indicating size exclusion and cation exchange chromatography. Stress conditions involved pH and thermal stress. Principal component analysis (PCA) and two of the widely used cluster analysis tools, namely, K-means and Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), were explored for clustering and feature representation of varied analytical datasets. It has been shown that the clustering patterns delineated by the used algorithms changed based on the included chromatographic profiles. The applied data analysis tools were found effective in revealing patterns of similarity and variability between i) intact and stressed as well as ii) originator and biosimilar samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acation exchange chromatography 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3ahealth services 3apH 3apeptides 3aprincipal component analysis 3athermal stress 0aTrastuzumab 0aBiosimilarity assessment 0aMonoclonal antibodies 0aStability indicating assay1 aAl-Ghobashy, Medhat A.1 aFathalla, Faten A.1 aAbbas, Samah S.1 aEltanany, Basma M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1803-962X0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 1184 p.122976-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1229763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01787naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007600154300001200230520086800242592002801110650001101138650001901149650001401168650001201182650002101194700001901215700001501234700001701249773012401266856007401390852000901464655001201473IND60765101020221118233941.0220419e20111111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510102DNAL7 a10.17221/3819-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolák, J.10aEvaluation of American peach cultivars for resistance to Plum pox virus  ap. 1-6.  aTwenty-eight American peach cultivars were screened for their reaction to Plum pox virus (PPV).

They are obtained under mild conditions in cyclohexane or n-hexane solution by the reaction of the norbornadiene precursors M(CO)₄NBD with the corresponding ligands. In case of the Ge containing ligands the dilution principle was used to improve the yields of the mononuclear derivatives. The rate of the NBD replacement is mainly determined by the central atom M (Mo > W > Cr) and only little by R, M' or x . The new com pounds have been characterized by analytical (C, H) and spectroscopic investigations (₁H, ³¹P NMR, IR, MS). The ligand properties are discussed on the basis of spectroscopic data (in particular coordination effects) and the molecular structure of the complexes Cr(CO)₄[Ph₂Si(OCH₂PMe₂)₂] (12) and Mo(CO)₄Me₂Ge(CH₂CH₂PMe₂)₂] (28) obtained by X-ray diffraction studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achromium 3acyclohexanes 3agermanium 3ahexane 3aligands 3amolybdenum 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus 3asilicon 3aspectral analysis 3astable isotopes 0aDipod Phosphane Ligands 0a1HNMR Spectra 0a31P NMR Spectra 0aX -R ay1 aKrummen, Anita1 aKrebs, Bernt1 aLäge, Mechtild0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 47, no. 3 p.310-320dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1992-03033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01482naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245013100166300002000297520050300317592002800820650002800848650002400876650001600900700002400916700002500940700001900965773012500984856007401109852000901183655001201192IND60641301220221121234926.0190505e20160920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064130122DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra21981k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhulanov, Vladimir E.10aNew method for in situ generation of enolate-iminium 1,4-dipoles for [4 + 2] and [4 + 1] dipolar heterocycloaddition reactions  ap. 90239-90247.  aGeneration of hydrazoylketenes by thermal decomposition of N-(diphenylenamino)pyrrolediones is accompanied by 5-exo-trig ring closure to furnish a zwitterionic dihydropyrazolone species.

This is a novel insect positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, which we named Riptortus pedestris virus-1 (RiPV-1) (GenBank accession no. KU958718). The genome of RiPV-1 consists of 10,554 nucleotides (nt), excluding the poly(A) tail, which contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) of 10,371 nt encoding a polyprotein (3456 aa) and flanked by 71 and 112 nt at the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR), respectively. RiPV-1 genome organization from the 5′ end contains a consensus organization of picorna-like RNA virus helicase, cysteine protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), in addition to two putative structural proteins located at the 3′ region and a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. The viral particles were approximately 30nm in diameter with some dispersal distinctive surface projections. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp sequences, RiPV-1 was clustered in the unassigned insect RNA viruses with two other viruses, APV and KFV. These three viruses were suggested to constitute a new group of insect RNA viruses. RiPV-1 could be found in all stages of lab-reared bean bugs and was detected abundantly in the thorax, abdomen, midgut and fat body, but not in the reproductive organs and muscle. Interestingly, RiPV-1 replication was increased dramatically in bean bugs 2–6days after fungal infection. In conclusion, a novel insect RNA virus was found by NGS data assembly. This virus can provide further insight into the interaction between virus, fungus and the host.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRiptortus clavatus 3aRiptortus pedestris 3aabdomen 3abeans 3acysteine proteinases 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3afat body 3agenome 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ainsects 3amidgut 3amuscles 3anucleotides 3aopen reading frames 3aphylogeny 3apolyproteins 3assRNA viruses 3astructural proteins 3athorax 3avirion 3aviruses 0aRiptortus pedestris 0aRiPV-1 0aPicorna-like virus 0aBeauveria bassiana1 aNai, Yu-Shin1 aLee, Se Jin1 aLee, Mi Rong1 aKim, Sihyeon1 aKim, Jae Su0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2016 Nov., v. 141 p.57-65dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2016.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009800176500001900274520170400293592002801997650001402025650001502039650001402054650001302068650001202081650001502093651001502108653001802123653001602141653001402157653001702171653002002188700002602208700002302234700003102257700002402288700002002312773010102332856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60723906620221122033402.0210212e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072390662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1073212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBehivoke, Faustinato10aEstimating fishing effort in small-scale fisheries using GPS tracking data and random forests  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring the last decade spatial patterns of industrial fisheries have been increasingly characterized using tracking technologies and machine learning analytical algorithms. In contrast, for small-scale fisheries, fishers’ behaviour for estimating and mapping fishing effort has only been anecdotally explored. Following a comparative approach, we conducted a boat tracking survey in a small-scale reef fishery in Madagascar and investigated the performance of a learning random forest algorithm and a speed threshold for estimating and mapping fishing effort. We monitored the movements of a sample of 31 traditional sailing fishing boats at around 45 s time interval using small GPS trackers. A total of 306 daily tracks were recorded among five gear types (beach seine, mosquito trawl net, gillnet, handline, and speargun). To ground-truth GPS location data, fishers’ behaviour was simultaneously recorded by a single on-board observer for 49 tracks. Typical, gear-specific track patterns were observed. Overall, the random forest model was found to be the most reliable, generic, and complex method for processing boat GPS tracks and detecting spatially-explicit fishing events regardless gear type. Predictions of mean fishing effort per trip showed that both methods reached from 89.4% to 97.0% accuracy across gear types. Our findings showed that boat tracking combined with on-board observation would improve the reliability of spatial fishing effort indicators in small-scale fisheries and contribute to more efficient management. Selection of the most appropriate GPS data processing method is dependent on local gear use, fishing effort indicators, and available analytical expertise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aalgorithms 3afisheries 3agillnets 3asurveys 3atrawl nets 3aMadagascar 0aBoat movement 0aFishery map 0aGPS track 0aSpatial data 0aSpeed threshold1 aEtienne, Marie-Pierre1 aGuitton, Jérôme,1 aRandriatsara, Roddy Michel1 aRanaivoson, Eulalie1 aLéopold, Marc,0 tEcological indicators.g2021 Apr., v. 123 p.107321-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1073213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245011100168300001600279520135200295592002801647650001301675650002201688650001101710650002301721650000901744650001601753650001601769650001301785650001301798650000701811650001501818650001601833700002001849700001701869700001701886700002201903773013101925856007802056852000902134655001202143IND60765101120221118233908.0220714e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076510112DNAL7 a10.17221/382/2019-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradáčová, Klára10aMicrobial consortia inoculants stimulate early growth of maize depending on nitrogen and phosphorus supply  ap. 105-112.  aAdoption of microbial consortia as plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPMs) instead of single-strain inoculants is discussed as an approach to increase the efficiency and flexibility of PGPM-assisted production strategies. This study provides the functional characterisation of a commercial microbial consortia product (MCP) in a series of greenhouse experiments with maize on a silty-loam field soil (pH 5.9). A 60%-increased abundance of bacteria that could be cultivated after rhizosphere extraction was measured after MCP inoculation at the end of the 42-days culture period. MCP inoculation did not stimulate shoot biomass production of maize fertilised with nitrate, but growth improvement was recorded in combination with stabilised ammonium, especially with reduced phosphorus (P) supply. The MCP inoculant improved the acquisition of ammonium-N but also increased shoot-P. MCP inoculation stimulated root length development under reduced P supply with stabilised ammonium by 52%. This was accompanied by the increased auxin production capacity of rhizosphere bacteria. C-, N-, and P-turnover in the rhizosphere were little affected by the MCP inoculation, as deduced from the analysis of activities of extracellular soil enzymes. The findings suggest that the form of N supply is crucial for the efficiency of plant-MCP interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3aauxins 3abiomass production 3acorn 3aenvironment 3agreenhouses 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere1 aKandeler, Ellen1 aBerger, Nils1 aLudewig, Uwe1 aNeumann, Günter,0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 66, no. 3 p.105-112dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/382/2019-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245025900161300001600420520093500436592002801371650001001399650004401409650002001453650002401473650002001497650002401517653002501541653004701566653002301613653002801636700002201664700002001686700002301706773015001729856007701879852000901956655001201965IND60521928720221120054341.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052192872DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-03042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrobe, Joseph10aReaktive E=C (p-p)π-System e, XXX.

In contrast to other derivatives, 1 cannot be prepared by the reaction of the secondary phosphane Me₂NP(H)CF₃ (9) with secondary or tertiary amines or KOH. 1 and 2 are labile compounds which undergo quick oligomerization above 0 °C to (Me₂NPCF₂)ₙ and (Me₂NPCFCF₃)ₙ, respectively. By thermal degradation of (Me₂NPCF₂)ₙ at 500 to 600 °C the trans- 1 ,3-diphosphetane (Me₂NPCF₂)₂ (11) is formed in high yield. Reaction of 2 with cyclopentadiene leads to the corresponding [2+4] cycloadduct 2-dimethylamino-3-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)-2-phosphabicyclo [2.2.1]-hept-5-ene (12).

However, the mechanisms of this formular has not been studied yet.Aim of the study: The present study was designed to investigate the effect of FSG against intestinal dysfunction during PD treatment and explore the potential mechanisms using a rat PD model.In the present study, the effect of FSG on improving intestinal mucosal architecture injury was intuitively shown by hematoxylin-eosin staining, the serum levels of DAO and D-lactate were measured to evaluate the intestinal permeability by the DAO Assay Kit and D-Lactic Acid ELISA Kit. The expression of the intestinal mucosal barrier related inflammation factor by real-time PCR. The main effective constituents of FSG were characterized by UPLC/Q-TOF analysis, and the targets and pathways of the constituents were predicted via TCMSP database and IPA. the activation of p38MAPK signaling pathway by western blotting.HE staining results showed that FSG protected against intestinal mucosal injury in pathology in PD rats. FSG decreased the intestinal mucosal permeability by increasing the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) level and decreasing the intestinal clearance of fluorescein-isothiocyanate dextran (FD4) and the level of D-lactate and diamine oxidase (DAO). FSG significantly decreased the expression of ICAM-1, IL-1β, iNOS and TNF-α, and further inhibited the activation of p38MAPK signaling pathway via down-regulating the expression of P-p38MAPK and up-regulating the expression of DUSP1, occludin, and ZO-1.This study demonstrates that FSG ameliorated intestinal mucosal dysfunction in PD by decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the activation of p38MAPK signaling pathway. The results provide a promising basis for the alternative medicine treatment of intestinal mucosal dysfunction in PD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3adatabases 3adextran 3adialysis 3adiamine oxidase 3aelectrical resistance 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3aintercellular adhesion molecule-1 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aintestines 3alactic acid 3aoccludins 3apermeability 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aIntestinal mucosal dysfunction 0aPeritoneal dialysis 0aChinese herbal medicine 0ap38MAPK1 aLin, Wei1 aWang, Lingyun1 aLv, Yang1 aSong, Yu1 aChen, Xin1 aYang, Hongtao0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Apr. 06, v. 251 p.112501-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1125013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001400188245012500202300001800327506007600345520139800421592002801819506003701847650002101884650003501905650003001940650001601970650001501986650001802001650001302019650001902032653000702051653000602058653000802064653000702072653000702079653000802086653000902094653000802103653005302111653004402164653003702208653002602245700001602271700001502287700001702302700001702319700002302336773009902359856008102458852000902539655001202548IND60558369720221207102541.0161115e20161120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055836972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.08.0122doi7 aPMC55297152pmcid7 a275348152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Jiang10aBiochemical Characterization of APOBEC3H Variants: Implications for Their HIV-1 Restriction Activity and mC Modification  ap. 4626-4638.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAPOBEC3H (A3H) is the most polymorphic member of the APOBEC3 family. Seven haplotypes (hap I–VII) and four mRNA splicing variants (SV) of A3H have been identified. The various haplotypes differ in anti-HIV activity, which is attributed to differences in protein stability, subcellular distribution, and/or RNA binding and virion packaging. Here, we report the first comparative biochemical studies of all the A3H variants using highly purified proteins. We show that all haplotypes were stably expressed and could be purified to homogeneity by Escherichia coli expression. Surprisingly, four out of the seven haplotypes showed high cytosine (C) deaminase activity, with hap V displaying extremely high activity that was comparable to the highly active A3A. Furthermore, all four haplotypes that were active in C deamination were also highly active on methylated C (mC), with hap II displaying almost equal deamination efficiency on both. The deamination activity of these A3H variants correlates well with their reported anti-HIV activity for the different haplotypes, suggesting that deaminase activity may be an important factor in determining their respective anti-HIV activities. Moreover, mC deamination of A3H displayed a strong preference for the sequence motif of T-mCpG-C/G, which may suggest a potential role in genomic mC modification at the characteristic “CpG” island motif.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantiretroviral properties 3adeamination 3ahaplotypes 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3avirus assembly 0aA3 0aC 0aA3H 0aSV 0amC 0aSEC 0aMALS 0aMwt 0aexpression/purification of all APOBEC3H variants 0acomparative in vitro functional studies 0amC deamination activity for mCpG 0amC selectivity factor1 aChen, Qihan1 aXiao, Xiao1 aIto, Fumiaki1 aWolfe, Aaron1 aChen, Xiaojiang S.0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016 Nov. 20, v. 428 p.4626-4638dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012500172300001600297520088500313592002801198650002201226650002501248650001601273650001101289650001601300650001001316650002401326650001201350650001001362650001401372650001401386653002201400653001501422653002001437653001601457700004101473700003001514700003201544773012701576856008101703852000901784655001201793IND60113644320221118002327.0190318e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011364432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2012.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandri, Ivana Greice10aUse of pectinases produced by a new strain of Aspergillus niger for the enzymatic treatment of apple and blueberry juice  ap. 469-475.  aIn this work, pectinases-producing filamentous fungi were isolated with the aim of using their enzymes in the clarification of apple and blueberry juices.

Here, broad-band high-performance ZnO/Au heterostructures photodetectors with various morphologies of self-assembled Au nanoantennas are fabricated via a facile approach under the spin-coated ZnO colloidal quantum dots films. With a systematic control on growth condition, the self-assembled Au nanoantennas undergo a drastic evolution from the corrugated nanomounds to the island-like nanostructures, and the light absorption of the resulting ZnO/Au heterostructures correspondingly exhibits a strongly morphological dependence on the Au nanoantennas. Meanwhile, the photoresponse of the ZnO-based photodetectors is significantly improved throughout a wide spectrum between UV and visible regions owing to the enhanced light absorption induced by the localized surface plasmon resonance. As a result, the optimal switch ratio of the ZnO/Au heterostructures photodetector increases by 1 order to ∼1.13 × 10⁵ than that of the pristine ZnO one because of the obviously increased photocurrent (Iₚₕ) and comparable dark current, thus leading to ∼9.1 and ∼4.9 times increases in the photoresponsivity and the normalized detectivity. Meanwhile, the significant increases in the Iₚₕ of ∼5.2 and ∼9.7 times are likewise observed with the ZnO/Au heterostructures under 530 nm and white-light illumination. This work can offer a handy and effective approach for the fabrication of ultrasensitive ZnO-based photodetectors within a broad-band wavelength by utilizing the Au plasmonic nanostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectric current 3aelectrons 3agold 3alighting 3ananogold 3aquantum dots 3asurface plasmon resonance 3awavelengths 3awhite light 3azinc oxide 0aZnO/Au heterostructures photodetectors 0aplasmonic enhancement 0abroad-band photoresponse 0aZnO colloidal quantum dots 0aself-assembled Au nanoantennas1 aLi, Mingyou,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4812-86041 aSu, Dong1 aYu, Muni1 aKan, Hao1 aLiu, Huan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0625-21831 aWang, Xian1 aJiang, Shenglin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6500-73640 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Aug. 30, v. 10, no. 38 p.32516-32525dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b094423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01858naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009700169300001600266520071000282592002800992650001701020650002101037650001501058650002301073650002201096650001301118650001101131653002601142653002301168653002301191653002201214700002101236700002601257773010801283856008401391852000901475655001201484IND60598945020221120092115.0180702e20140604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059894502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2014.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasava, Vikram13aAn improved synthesis of 3,6-anhydro-d-glucal and a study of its unusual chemical reactivity  ap. 106-111.  a6-O-Tosyl-d-glucal 1 upon treatment with excess LiAlH4 unexpectedly gave 3,6-anhydro-d-glucal 2 as a major product in good yield.

Reaction of 1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidine-α-d-galactopyranose with the anhydro sugar 2 in the presence of N-iodosuccinimide did not give the expected iodoglycoside mixture, but instead gave an unusual 1,4:3,6-dianhydride 7 as the major product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aammonium nitrate 3aanhydrides 3achemical reactions 3acrystal structure 3amethanol 3asugars 0a3, 6-Anhydro-d-glucal 0a6-O-Tosyl-d-glucal 0aAddition reactions 0aDianhydride sugar1 aGorun, Sergiu M.1 aMarzabadi, Cecilia H.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2014 June 04, v. 391 p.106-111dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2014.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245015400160300002000314520134700334592002801681650001201709650002201721650002201743650001601765650001701781653002901798653001101827653002301838653002501861653002601886700005501912700005601967700005502023700001802078700001402096700001602110700005602126700005102182773014202233856007902375852000902454655001202463IND60614667520221121205108.0181020e20180823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061466752DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b094612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Yanping10aBromine Doping as an Efficient Strategy to Reduce the Interfacial Defects in Hybrid Two-Dimensional/Three-Dimensional Stacking Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 31755-31764.  aSolar-to-electricity conversion efficiency, power conversion efficiency (PCE), and stability are two important aspects of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, both aspects are difficult to simultaneously enhance. In the recent two years, two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) stacking structure, designed by covering the 3D perovskite with a thin 2D perovskite capping layer, was reported to be a promising method to achieve both a higher PCE and improved stability simultaneously. However, when reducing the surface defects of 3D perovskite, the thin 2D capping layer itself may probably introduce additional interfacial defects in a 2D/3D stacking structure, which is thought to be able to trigger trap-assisted nonradiative recombination or ion migration. Thus, efforts should be paid to reduce the interfacial defects of 2D hybrid perovskite when serving as a modification layer in a 2D/3D stacking structure PSCs. Here, we demonstrate that bromine (Br) doping of the 2D perovskite capping layer is an efficient strategy to passivate interfacial defects robustly, by which the photoluminescence lifetime is enhanced notably, whereas the interfacial charge recombination is suppressed a lot. As a result, the PCE is enhanced from 18.01% (3D perovskite) to 20.07% (Br-doped 2D/3D perovskite) along with improved moisture stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3amaterials science 3aphotoluminescence 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 0a2D/3D stacking structure 0adoping 0ainterfacial defect 0acharge recombination 0aperovskite solar cell1 aShi, Yantao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7318-29631 aSong, Xuedan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7531-43441 aLiu, Junxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8349-10171 aWang, Minhuan1 aWang, Shi1 aFeng, Yulin1 aJin, Shengye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2001-22121 aHao, Ce1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4379-04740 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Aug. 23, v. 10, no. 37 p.31755-31764dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b094613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010200157300001800259520081300277592002801090650001501118650002701133650001301160650003401173650001701207700001401224700001501238700002001253700001301273700001301286700001701299700001601316773013101332856007501463852000901538655001201547IND60541305720221117073617.0160821e20150128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054130572DNAL7 a10.1021/ja510926w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Yongfei10aCovalent Organic Frameworks Formed with Two Types of Covalent Bonds Based on Orthogonal Reactions  ap. 1020-1023.  aCovalent organic frameworks (COFs) are excellent candidates for various applications. So far, successful methods for the constructions of COFs have been limited to a few condensation reactions based on only one type of covalent bond formation. Thus, the exploration of a new judicious synthetic strategy is a crucial and emergent task for the development of this promising class of porous materials. Here, we report a new orthogonal reaction strategy to construct COFs by reversible formations of two types of covalent bonds. The obtained COFs consisting of multiple components show high surface area and high H₂ adsorption capacity. The strategy is a general protocol applicable to construct not only binary COFs but also more complicated systems in which employing regular synthetic methods did not work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acondensation reactions 3ahydrogen 3astandard operating procedures 3asurface area1 aZou, Ruyi1 aLuo, Zhong1 aZhang, Huacheng1 aYao, Xin1 aMa, Xing1 aZou, Ruqiang1 aZhao, Yanli0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Jan. 28, v. 137, no. 3 p.1020-1023dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja510926w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01537naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245013200180300001600312520033400328592002800662650001400690650002100704650001400725650001200739650001800751650001100769650001400780653002300794653002800817653002600845653002700871653002400898700002100922773012700943856008401070852000901154655001201163IND60543952320221117231015.0190415e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054395232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtusci.2014.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallah, Nasibeh Shahrivar10aTin oxide nanoparticles (SnO2-NPs): An efficient catalyst for the one-pot synthesis of highly substituted imidazole derivatives  ap. 531-537.  aIn this work, direct three component condensation of 9,10-phenanthraquinone or acenaphthenequinone with aryl aldehyde and ammonium acetate to generate highly substituted imidazole derivatives was performed over tin oxide nanoparticles.

Livestock animals, such as cattle, convert plants to protein biomass due to a compartmentalized gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the complementary contributions of a diverse GIT microbiota, thereby providing humans with meat and dairy products. Research on cattle gut microbial symbionts has mainly focused on the rumen (which is the primary fermentation compartment) and there is a paucity of functional insight on the intestinal (distal end) microbiota, where most foodborne zoonotic bacteria reside. Here, we present the Fecobiome Initiative (or FI), an international effort that aims at facilitating collaboration on research projects related to the intestinal microbiota, disseminating research results, and increasing public availability of resources. By doing so, the FI can help mitigate foodborne and animal pathogens that threaten livestock and human health, reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance in cattle and their proximate environment, and potentially improve the welfare and nutrition of animals.

However, the anti-inflammatory effects and the underlying mechanisms of LGS are not fully studied.This study aims to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity and explore the underlying mechanisms of LGS in zebrafish and cell inflammation models.LPS-induced zebrafish inflammation model was established by LPS-yolk microinjection. The protective effect of LGS on zebrafish injected with LPS was observed using survival analysis. Infiltration of inflammatory cells was determined by H&E staining assay. Expression levels of key inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 were measured by q-PCR assay. Recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages were observed by fluorescence microscopy, SB staining and NR staining. In vitro anti-inflammatory effects of LGS were evaluated on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The generation of IL-6 and TNF-α was detected by ELISA. The protein expression levels of JNK, p-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), Nur77 and p-Nur77 (Ser351) were determined by Western blotting. Finally, two additional inflammatory models in zebrafish, which were induced by CuSO₄ or tail fin injury, were also established and the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages were observed for the determination of the anti-inflammatory activity of LGS.LGS protected zebrafish against LPS-induced death and dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced acute inflammatory response in zebrafish, as indicated by increased survival rate, reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, decreased recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, and downregulated expression levels of TNF-α and IL-6. Additionally, LGS inhibited the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6, increased the expression of Nur77, and reduced the expression of p-Nur77 (Ser351) and p-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The anti-inflammatory action of LGS was also observed in another two zebrafish inflammation models, which was supported by the inhibition on neutrophils and macrophages recruitment.The present study demonstrates that LGS possesses anti-inflammatory activity in zebrafish inflammation models and LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, which is related to the inhibition on p-JNK and p-Nur77. This finding provides a pharmacological basis for LGS in the control of inflammatory disorder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acopper sulfate 3adeath 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescence microscopy 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amodels 3aneutrophils 3aprotective effect 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3astaining 3asurvival rate 3atail 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aLiang-Ge-San 0aLPS 0aAcute inflammation 0aZebrafish 0aRAW 264.7 cell 0aALI 0aLPS 0ahpf 0aLGS 0aPTU 0adpf 0aDEX 0aPBS 0aNR 0aSB 0aRT 0ahpi 0aECL 0aMTT 0aELISA 0aTBS-T 0ahpt 0aJNK1 aCao, Huihui1 aZheng, Yuanru1 aLu, Zibin1 aChen, Yuyao1 aLiu, Dongyi1 aYang, Huayi1 aQuan, Jingyu1 aHuo, Chuying1 aLiu, Junshan1 aYu, Linzhong0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 249 p.112427-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1124273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015400168300001400322520148600336592002801822650002201850650001101872650001401883650000901897650001301906650001201919650000901931650001501940650002701955653002701982653001702009653001702026653001402043653002802057700001702085700001802102700001802120700001802138700001502156773021202171856008302383852000902466655001202475IND60753093020221117091625.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075309302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jher.2021.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhiqiang10aImprovement of rainwater infiltration and storage capacity by an enhanced seepage well: From laboratory investigation to HYDRUS-2D numerical analysis  ap. 15-24.  aSeepage well is an emerging Low Impact Development (LID) technology that can effectively control the storm runoff. However, its rainwater infiltration rate and storage capacity still require further enhancement. By setting a horizontal infiltration structure at the bottom of conventional rainwater seepage well (CSW), an enhanced seepage well (ESW) was proposed in this study, and its infiltration performances compared with the permeable pavement (PP) and the CSW were systemically investigated using static infiltration experiment and HYDRUS-2D simulation. The results showed that the infiltration efficiency of ESW was significantly higher than that of PP and CSW, and the process of water infiltrated through soil mainly controlled the macroscopic infiltration rate. The Nash-Sutcliff Efficient (NSE) index was used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the HYDRUS-2D model, and the results of NSE values greater than 0.75 (varied between 0.75 and 0.91) confirmed the applicability of HYDRUS-2D to describe correctly the hydraulic behavior of the ESW system. Simulation infiltration tests showed that the ESW performed a higher average infiltration rate and fewer total runoff volume than the CSW, indicating the effectively enhancement of the infiltration and water retention capacity of ESW, especially under heavy rainfall intensities. Additionally, the ESW system exhibited an excellent runoff-control and rainwater retention capacity in an actual rainfall scenario.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfiltration rate 3amodels 3apavements 3arain 3aresearch 3aseepage 3asoil 3astormwater 3awater holding capacity 0aLow impact development 0aSeepage well 0aStorm runoff 0aHYDRUS-2D 0aInfiltration efficiency1 aWang, Zijian1 aWang, Sheping1 aDing, Yanping1 aYuan, Zhiming1 aLu, Jinsuo0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2021 Nov., v. 39 p.15-24dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific DivisionwJournal:2188x1570-64437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2021.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245015800162300002000320520149800340592002801838650002801866650001001894650002201904650002201926650001501948650001301963650001101976650001301987650001902000650001402019650000702033650001602040650001202056653001502068653001602083653001802099653002002117653001502137700001702152700001702169700001802186700001702204700001902221700002002240700001602260700001502276700002002291700005602311700001802367700001802385700005302403700005802456773014302514856007802657852000902735655001202744IND60614667620221121163027.0181002e20180904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061466762DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b094982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiao-Ling10aSialic Acid-Functionalized pH-Triggered Micelles for Enhanced Tumor Tissue Accumulation and Active Cellular Internalization of Orthotopic Hepatocarcinoma  ap. 31903-31914.  aBoth targeted and stimuli-sensitive drug-delivery systems (DDSs) have been developed to augment antitumor effects. However, lack of knowledge regarding tumor tissue targeting and different effects of the stimuli-sensitive DDSs in orthotropic and ectopic tumors have impeded further advances in their clinical applications. Herein, we first reported a pH-triggered micelle with sialic acid (SA)-driven targeting ability (SA–poly(ethylene glycol)–hydrazone linker-doxorubicin (DOX), SPD). The SPD micelles encapsulated with DOX (SPDD) showed sustained drug release over 48 h in response to the pH gradient in vivo, slow under physical conditions and accelerated in the acid tumor microenvironment. In addition, the SPD micelles showed 2.3-fold higher accumulation in tumors after 48 h compared to the micelles lacking the SA moiety. The overexpression of E-selectin on the inflammatory vascular endothelial cells surrounding the tumors increased the accumulation of SPD micelles in tumor tissues, whereas that on the tumor cells increased the internalization of micelles. Consequently, SPDD micelles exerted remarkable antitumor effects in both orthotopic and ectopic models. Application of SPDD micelles in the in situ model reduced the tumor volume (77.57 mm³ vs 62.13 mm³) and metastasis after treatment for 25 days. These results suggest that SA-driven targeted DDS with a pH-responsive switch has the potential to treat hepatocarcinoma effectively both ectopically and orthotopically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3adrugs 3aendothelial cells 3amaterials science 3ametastasis 3amicelles 3amodels 3amoieties 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apH 3asialic acid 3atissues 0aE-selectin 0asialic acid 0apH-responsive 0ahepatocarcinoma 0aorthotopic1 aLu, Kong-Jun1 aZhu, Meng-Lu1 aDu, Yang-Long1 aZhu, Ya-Fang1 aZhang, Nan-Nan1 aWang, Xiao-Juan1 aKang, Xu-Qi1 aXu, De-Min1 aYing, Xiao-Ying1 aYu, Ri-Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0554-94841 aLu, Chen-Ying1 aJi, Jian-Song1 aYou, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7114-62991 aDu, Yong-Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2137-45170 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Sept. 04, v. 10, no. 38 p.31903-31914dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b094983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003100132024001100163040001800174100002500192245009900217300001300316506017300329520140200502650002401904650001801928650001001946650001901956650001701975650002701992650001702019650003002036650001502066650002602081651001102107700002502118700002602143700002302169700003102192773010902223856011202332856004402444956010302488961000902591852000902600655001202609IND50060158120221214224412.0130304s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006015812DNAL7 a2525472aris7 a10113/558362hdl7 a10.4322/rbpv.018030022doi8 ans1064  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabatini, Gustavo A.10aKnockdown resistance in pyrethroid-resistant horn fly (Diptera:Muscidae) populations in Brazil  ap. 8-14.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aTo investigate the kdr (knockdown resistance) resistance-associated gene mutation and determine its frequency in pyrethroid-resistant horn fly (Haematobia irritans) populations, a total of 1,804 horn flies of 37 different populations from all Brazilian regions (North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South) were molecular screened through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The kdr gene was not detected in 87.08% of the flies. However, the gene was amplified in 12.92% of the flies, of which 11.70% were resistant heterozygous and 1.22% were resistant homozygous. Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was found only in 1 ranch with an excess of heterozygous. When populations were grouped by region, three metapopulations showed significant deviations of HWE (Central-West population, South population and Southeast population). This indicates that populations are isolated one from another and kdr occurrence seems to be an independent effect probably reflecting the insecticide strategy used by each ranch. Although resistance to pyrethroids is disseminated throughout Brazil, only 48% of resistant populations had kdr flies, and the frequency of kdr individuals in each of these resistant populations was quite low. But this study shows that, with the apparent exception of the Northeast region, the kdr mechanism associated with pyrethroid resistance occurs all over Brazil. 3aHaematobia irritans 3agene deletion 3agenes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apyrethrins 3aresistance mechanisms 3aBrazil1 aRibolla, Paulo E.

Generating description of these remote sensing images have gained much attention in recent past owing to its applications in remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) and image analysis. Remote sensing images capture huge diversity in different perspectives and levels. Due to overhead perspective and significantly larger scale of the scene, extraction of visual features from the remote sensing images to generate descriptions has become a challenging task. In this work, a model is proposed to generate novel captions by considering multi-scale features processed through adaptive attention based decoder using topic sensitive word embedding. The proposed model has been quantitatively evaluated using the benchmark remote sensing image captioning datasets and ablation study has been conducted to investigate the reason behind its effectiveness. Experimental evaluation depicts that the proposed model shows promising results compared to the existing state of the art remote sensing image description models.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3asatellites 3aspatial data 0aRemote sensing image retrieval 0aMulti-modal domains 0aImage descriptions1 aMohsin Riaz, M.1 aGhafoor, Abdul0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Apr., v. 108 p.102741-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01748naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245014800162300001600310520052700326592002800853650002200881650002100903650001600924650001400940650001700954650001100971650001700982653002700999653002001026653002201046653003001068653002101098700001901119773015001138856007701288852000901365655001201374IND60521929320221120075259.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052192932DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1992-03102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Peter10aAg20O33H22(ClO4)4 – ein Hybrid aus Silberoxidclathrat und Gashydrat / Ag20O33H22(ClO4)4 – A Hybrid of Silver Oxide Clathrate and Gashydrate  ap. 365-368.  aBy electrochemical oxidation of an aqueous silver perchlorate solution (c(Ag⁺) = 2.0 M) a new compound with the formula Ag₂₀O₃₃H₂₂(ClO₄)₄ was obtained.

They crystallize in different space groups: C2/m for Na₉Sb(Ge₂S₆)₂ and C2/c for Na₉Sb(Ge₂Se₆)₂. In comparison with their structures, similar ethane-like [Ge₂Q₆]⁶⁻ ligands and infinite [(Na/Sb)Q₄]ₙ chains exist in both of them, but note that two interesting [Na₂Sb₂(Ge₂S₆)₂]⁸⁻ and [NaS₆] layers are discovered in the structure of Na₉Sb(Ge₂S₆)₂, rather than a 3D framework structure for Na₉Sb(Ge₂Se₆)₂. Moreover, overall investigation of the quaternary chalcogenides containing M–M bonds (M = Si, Ge) indicates that the orientation of the M–M bonds has a close relation with the number ratio of sodium/another cation and cation radius in the crystal structure, which may provide a feasible way to predict the orientations of the M–M bonds in the layers for new compounds. The UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance and IR spectra of Na₉Sb(Ge₂S₆)₂ are measured and show that it can be expected to be a promising IR optical window material with a wide IR transmission range from 0.48–22 μm. Raman spectra further verify the IR absorption edges and the presence of Ge–Ge bonds for the title compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aantimony 3acations 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3agermanium 3aligands 3areflectance 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aselenium 3asilica 3asilicon 3asodium 3asulfides 3asulfur1 aHu, Yi1 aPan, Hui1 aSu, Zhi0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 19, v. 6, no. 101 p.99475-99481dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra22000b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04780naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011500167300001600282520292000298592002803218650002003246650002103266650002103287650002103308650001903329650001103348650001103359650001003370650002203380650002403402650002503426650001703451650001903468650001003487650001203497650001803509650002503527650001403552650001003566650001103576650001203587650001203599650001103611650002203622650001403644650001603658650001303674650001603687650001003703651001003713653001803723653002503741653002903766653000903795653001303804700001703817700001903834700001403853700001703867773011603884856008504000852000904085655001204094IND50070842520221119163400.0190403e20131215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007084252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.08.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemwal, R.L.10aGrowth and carbon stocks of multipurpose tree species plantations in degraded lands in Central Himalaya, India  ap. 450-459.  aDeficiency of long-term data on performance of multipurpose tree plantations in degraded lands delimits the scope of realization of economic benefits from the United Nations-REDD+(Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) initiative of climate change mitigation by making payments for reducing emissions in developing countries. This study reports survival, growth and carbon stocks over a period of 20years of mixed-species (Albizia lebbeck, Alnus nepalensis, Boehmaria rugulosa, Celtis australis, Dalbergia sissoo, Ficus glomerata, Grewia optiva, Prunus cerasoides, Pyrus pashia and Sapium sebiferum) plantations (planting density of 110 treesha−1 of each species and random mixing such that neighboring individuals did not belong to the same species) established with people’s participation in abandoned agricultural land (AAL) and highly degraded forest land (HDFL), in Central Himalaya, India. Trees were lopped and crops were grown at the AAL site, while grasses were cut after planting at the HDFL site. Mortality occurred during the initial 3-year-period at both sites but after 7years only at the AAL site. After 20years, average survival at the AAL site was 87% compared to 51% at the HDFL site, with B. rugulosa, G. optiva and F. glomerata showing higher mortality than other species at the latter site. Annual height, girth and aboveground biomass increment rates across species and sites over 20-year period varied in the range of 23–84cmyear−1, 1.3–3.9cmyear−1 and 1.0–8.0 kg tree−1 year−1, respectively. The site as well as species effects tended to diminish with age. At the age of 20years, B. rugulosa accumulated aboveground biomass 5.7-fold, G. optiva 3.2-fold, C. australis 2.3-fold, F. glomerata and P. cerasoides 1.5–1.6-fold and, A. nepalensis and D. sissoo 1.2-fold greater at the AAL site compared to the HDFL site. S. sebiferum and A. lebbeck had marginally lower biomass at the AAL site than the HDFL site, while the site effect was not significant in P. pashia. Over the 20-year period, tree-crop mixed system at the AAL site, apart from supporting better tree growth, provided larger quantities of utilizable biomass (206Mg of food, fodder and fuelwoodha−1) compared to the HDFL site (14.4Mg of palatable grassesha−1). The two sites had similar total (vegetation+litter+soil) C accumulation rates (2.3–2.5MgCha−1year−1). With ban on income from timber in the current policies, payments for carbon sequestration from exclusive tree planting (US $ 37family−1year−1) would be negligible compared to the income from crops (US $ 400–900family−1year−1) in tree-crop mixed system. There is an urgent need of policies (i) safeguarding economic interests of local people from tree planting in degraded lands and (ii) enhancing silvicultural and ecological knowledge of multipurpose tree species to optimize multiple benefits from them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbizia lebbeck 3aAlnus nepalensis 3aCeltis australis 3aDalbergia sissoo 3aFicus racemosa 3aGrewia 3aPrunus 3aPyrus 3aTriadica sebifera 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3acrops 3acutting 3adeforestation 3adeveloping countries 3aemissions 3afoods 3aforage 3aforests 3agrasses 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amortality 3aplantations 3aplanting 3atree growth 3atrees 3aIndia 0aAfforestation 0aCarbon sequestration 0aPeoples’ participation 0aSoil 0aHimalaya1 aNautiyal, S.1 aMaikhuri, R.K.1 aRao, K.S.1 aSaxena, K.G.0 tForest ecology and management.g2013 Dec. 15, v. 310 p.450-459dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.08.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245006800176500002200244520103100266592002801297650000801325650001501333650001501348650002001363650002501383650002501408650001001433650002901443650001901472650002901491653000901520653000801529653000801537653000801545653000901553653001001562653000901572653001001581653000701591653000801598653001001606653001201616653001101628653001001639653000901649653001501658653001001673653000901683653000901692653000901701653001101710653001101721653000901732653003001741653001201771653002501783653002701808700003301835773007301868856008101941852000902022655001202031IND60558370220221121205010.0161115s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055837022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2016.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Alessandro, Giuseppina10aTranscription and DNA Damage: Holding Hands or Crossing Swords?  aPre-press version  aTranscription has classically been considered a potential threat to genome integrity. Collision between transcription and DNA replication machinery, and retention of DNA:RNA hybrids, may result in genome instability. On the other hand, it has been proposed that active genes repair faster and preferentially via homologous recombination. Moreover, while canonical transcription is inhibited in the proximity of DNA double-strand breaks, a growing body of evidence supports active non-canonical transcription at DNA damage sites. Small non-coding RNAs accumulate at DNA double-strand break sites in mammals and several other organisms and are involved in DNA damage signaling and repair. Furthermore, RNA binding proteins are recruited to DNA damage sites and participate in the DNA damage response. Here, we discuss the impact of transcription on genome stability, the role of RNA binding proteins at DNA damage sites, and the function of small non-coding RNAs generated upon damage in the signaling and repair of DNA lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aRNA-binding proteins 3agenes 3ahomologous recombination 3anon-coding RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 0aDSBs 0aDDR 0aMRN 0aATM 0aMDC1 0a53BP1 0aNHEJ 0ancRNA 0aHR 0aRPA 0aATRIP 0asncRNAs 0aDDRNAs 0adiRNA 0aRBPs 0aRNA Pol II 0aPIKKs 0aPARP 0aRNAi 0aRISC 0amiRNAs 0aqiRNAs 0aDINO 0aDNA damage response (DDR) 0aR loops 0aRNA binding proteins 0aNon-coding RNA (ncRNA)1 aD'Adda di Fagagna, Fabrizio,0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2016.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04730naa a2200961 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165520236300259592002802622650001802650650002402668650001702692650001702709650002002726650001502746650001302761650001002774650002402784650002002808650001502828650001902843650002002862650001202882650002402894650001802918650000902936650002302945650002102968650002202989650001603011650000903027650001903036650001303055650001303068650001703081650002503098650003603123650001303159650001403172653000903186653001103195653001603206653000703222653000803229653000903237653000903246653000803255653000703263653000803270653001003278653000803288653000903296653001003305653000803315653000803323653000703331653000803338653000703346653000703353653000803360653000803368653000803376653000703384700001803391700001203409700001203421700001603433700001203449700001803461700001803479700002103497700001803518700001303536773011603549856008203665852000903747655001203756IND60679691420221118161642.0200128e20200325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067969142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1125022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Hua-ying10aCurcumin, as a pleiotropic agent, improves doxorubicin-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats  aCurcumin, a phenolic compound extracted from the rhizome of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), has been reported to have broad biological functions including potent antioxidant and renoprotective effects. It has been reported that Curcumin has a certain protective effect on the kidney. However, its mechanism of action needs further study.The present research aims at investigating the therapeutic effects and its underlying mechanism of curcumin on NS.The conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cell line was utilized to evaluate the podocyte-protective effect of curcumin and its effects on NF-κB pathway and Nrf2/ARE pathway in podocyte in vitro. Furthermore, the DOX-induced NS rats were utilized to investigate the therapeutic effects and its underlying mechanism of curcumin against NS in vivo.The consequences of this study revealed that curcumin activated Nrf2, inhibited NF-κB pathway and up-regulated podocin in DOX-induced podocyte. Further research results showed that curcumin can considerably alleviate proteinuria and improve hypoalbuminemia in NS rats, and lower blood lipid levels to alleviate hyperlipidemia in NS rats, indicating that curcumin has significant therapeutic effects on rat NS. Further observation by electron microscopy and detection showed that curcumin can improve renal function and podocyte injury, which may be related to the repairment of mRNA expression and podocin protein. Interestingly, the results of the blood rheology test showed that curcumin can effectively reduce whole blood viscosity (WBV) and plasma viscosity (PV), and reduce hematocrit (Hct). In addition, the oxidative stress state of kidney in NS rats was considerably reversed by curcumin, which may be achieved by activating Nrf2 and increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes HO-1, NQO-1. We also found that NF-κB pathway is activated in the kidney of NS rats, and curcumin can inhibit the activation of NF-κB by down-regulating the expression of NF-κB p65, reducing the level of p-IκBα and up-regulating the expression of IκBα.These findings suggest that curcumin, as a multifunctional agent, exerts a protective effect on DOX-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, which provides a pharmacological basis for the further development of curcumin and also provides a basis for the advantages of multi-targeted drugs in the processing of NS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurcuma longa 3aantioxidant enzymes 3ablood lipids 3ablood plasma 3ablood viscosity 3acell lines 3acurcumin 3adrugs 3aelectron microscopy 3agene expression 3ahematocrit 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypoalbuminemia 3akidneys 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anephrotic syndrome 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aproteinuria 3arats 3arenal function 3arheology 3arhizomes 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aturmeric 3aviscosity 0aNrf2 0aNF-κB 0aDoxorubicin 0aNS 0aDOX 0aPred 0aNrf2 0aWBV 0aPV 0aHct 0aKeap1 0aARE 0aHO-1 0aNQO-1 0aSOD 0aROS 0aTP 0aALB 0aTC 0aTG 0aBUN 0aSCr 0aMDA 0aSD1 aWang, Xue-kai1 aLi, Xin1 aJi, Kai1 aDu, Shi-hao1 aLiu, Yu1 aKong, Lin-lin1 aXu, Jing-chen1 aYang, Gang-qiang1 aChen, Da-quan1 aQi, Dong0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Mar. 25, v. 250 p.112502-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1125023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02716naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010500168300001800273520115100291592002801442650001801470650003101488650001601519650001401535650001301549650001001562650001601572650001001588650001301598650002001611650001701631650001601648650002401664650001001688650001101698650001601709650000901725650001601734650001301750650002101763650002101784650002301805650001301828700002201841700001901863700001901882700001801901700002301919773012701942856008402069852000902153655001202162IND60099639720221118060232.0141105e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009963972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2012.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Zhihong10aCurcumin mediated epigenetic modulation inhibits TREM-1 expression in response to lipopolysaccharide  ap. 2032-2043.  aTriggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on macrophage and neutrophils and is emerging as a potent amplifier of TLR initiated inflammatory responses. Blockade of TREM-1 improves survival in animal models of sepsis. In this study, we show that curcumin or diferuloylmethane, a yellow pigment present in turmeric, a major ingredient of curry spice inhibited the expression of TREM-1 in vitro in primary bone marrow derived macrophages and in vivo in lungs of mice with sepsis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that curcumin inhibits the binding of p65 to TREM-1 promoter in response to LPS. Further we show that curcumin inhibited p300 activity in the TREM-1 promoter region leading to hypoacetylation of histone 3 and 4 in the lysine residues. Inhibition of TREM-1 by curcumin is oxidant independent.

The developed cerium-oxide surface showed a superhydrophobic characteristic with a low (<5°) contact angle hysteresis because of the unique surface morphology and hydrophobicity of cerium oxide. The surface was successfully incorporated to popular engineering materials including copper, aluminum, and steel. Thermal stability of the surfaces was investigated by exposing them to hot (∼100 °C) steam conditions for 12 h. The introduced ceria surfaces could maintain active dropwise condensation after the thermal stability test, whereas silane-treated surfaces completely lost their hydrophobicity. The heat-transfer coefficient was calculated using the thermal network model incorporating the droplet size distribution and morphology obtained from the microscopic measurement. The analysis shows that the suggested cerium-oxide surfaces can provide approximately 2 times and 5 times higher heat-transfer coefficient before and after the thermal stability test, respectively, mainly because of the decrease in the thermal conduction resistance across droplets. The results indicate that the introduced nanostructured cerium-oxide surface is a promising condenser coating to enhance the droplet mobility and the resulting condensation heat-transfer performance for various thermal and environmental applications, especially those being exposed to hot steam conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aceric oxide 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3acopper 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aengineering 3aheat transfer 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3amodels 3asteam 3asteel 3athermal stability 0arare earth oxide 0acerium oxide 0asuperhydrophobic surface 0athermal stability 0adropwise condensation 0aheat transfer enhancement1 aSeo, Donghyun1 aOh, Seungtae1 aLee, Jinki1 aNam, Youngsuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8807-64180 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Aug. 23, v. 10, no. 37 p.31765-31776dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b095973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011400166300001800280520146400298592002801762650001301790650002501803650001201828650002201840650001401862650000901876650001001885650001201895650002101907650002001928651001001948700002001958700002101978773010401999856008102103852000902184655001202193IND60119641720221122111401.0141219e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011964172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-014-0818-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomano, Giulia10aFactors Affecting Water Utility Companies’ Decision to Promote the Reduction of Household Water Consumption  ap. 5491-5505.  aThe present paper investigates the factors affecting water utility companies’ decision to implement public information campaigns aimed at promoting sustainable water use and reducing household water consumption. We have analyzed 114 Italian water utility companies. For each we hand-collected data regarding their suggestions for reducing household water consumption and sustainable reporting information, published on the corporate websites. We then classified each utility on the basis of their ownership, diversification, location, sales, population served, tariff and annual rainfall. Using M-quantile regression for count data we have constructed a performance measure of Italian water utility companies and have ranked them by the identification of a unique M-quantile coefficient associated with each datum observed. The paper provides some interesting insights into the type of companies most sensitive to water sustainability issues, providing potential guidance to policy makers in defining a water management framework and selecting firms to manage water services. Larger firms located in the center of Italy, in drought regions and the driest areas, seem to be more sensitive to promoting the reduction of household water consumption. Moreover, companies operating only in the water business that are publicly owned and apply lower tariffs embody the type of institutions that make greater use of web information campaigns to reduce consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abusiness enterprises 3adrought 3aissues and policy 3aownership 3arain 3asales 3atariffs 3awater management 3awater utilities 3aItaly1 aSalvati, Nicola1 aGuerrini, Andrea0 tWater resources management.g2014 Dec., v. 28, no. 15 p.5491-5505dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-014-0818-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007000163506010400233506007600337520137700413592002801790506003701818650001201855650002001867650001401887650001101901650001701912653001801929653002601947653001201973653001001985653003301995700001402028700001502042773015102057856008202208852000902290655001202299IND60776645620221207124727.0220606e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077664562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Jiajun10aProgressive spatiotemporal image fusion with deep neural networks  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpatiotemporal image fusion (STIF) provides a feasible and effective solution for generating satellite images with high spatial and temporal resolution. As deep learning-based fusion algorithms show great potential in generating high-quality images, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely a deep progressive spatiotemporal fusion network (DPSTFN), which is coupled with pansharpening and super-resolution learning processes to satisfy requirements of STIF based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data. First, a pansharpening process is adopted to make full use of two MODIS bands with 250 m spatial resolution. Second, a super-resolution process enhances the spatial information that existed in coarse-resolution images to alleviate the enormous spatial resolution gap between MODIS and Landsat images. Third, combining the aforementioned two auxiliary processes, a progressive spatiotemporal fusion framework is proposed to generate deliberate and robust fusion results. Experiments are conducted using two MODIS-Landsat datasets of distinctive landforms to evaluate the performance of DPSTFN. The results of the subjective and objective evaluation show that our proposed network performs better than the state-of-the-art traditional STIF algorithms Fit-FC and RASTFM, and the deep learning-based algorithms EDCSTFN and StfNet.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLandsat 3adata collection 3alandforms 3amodels 3aspatial data 0aDeep learning 0aSpatiotemporal fusion 0aLandsat 0aMODIS 0aConvolutional neural network1 aHuang, Bo1 aFung, Tung0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2022 Apr., v. 108 p.102745-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.1027453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245012000160300002000280520191600300592002802216650002202244650003702266650001202303650001402315650002302329650001302352650001602365650001302381650002202394650001502416650001902431650001302450650002202463650001802485650001402503650002002517650001702537650001602554650003702570653001902607653002302626653002702649653002202676653003402698700001902732700001902751700005902770773014202829856007802971852000903049655001203058IND60614668120221120212615.0181002e20180831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061466812DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b096052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Su Hyo10aMnO₂ Nanowire–CeO₂ Nanoparticle Composite Catalysts for the Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOₓ with NH₃  ap. 32112-32119.  aMnOₓ-based catalysts have been applied to the selective catalytic reduction of NOₓ with ammonia (NH₃) owing to their high NOₓ removal efficiency and catalytic stability. In general, the fabrication of a variety of nanomaterials in a complex structure requires complicated processes, including heat treatment and a series of cleaning steps. In addition, MnO₂ which has diverse polymorphs, exhibits different catalytic effects depending on its crystalline structure. Among them, synthesizing the ε-MnO₂ phase, which functions as a nanocatalyst, has been the most difficult and has hardly been reported. Here, we report the synthesis of heterostructured composite nanocatalysts consisting of ε-MnO₂ nanowires (NWs) and CeO₂ nanoparticles (NPs) by applying pulsed currents sequentially. This method drastically simplifies the overall process compared to the conventional techniques. Through X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, it was confirmed that 2–3 nm of CeO₂ NPs were formed on the surfaces of the ε-MnO₂ NWs. The de-NOₓ efficiency of the nanocatalysts was analyzed in terms of content variation, specific surface area, and the elemental chemical state of the surface. A ceramic filter containing the nanocatalysts shows a high catalytic activity over the broad operating temperature range 100–400 °C. In the low-temperature region, ε-MnO₂ plays a major role in determining the catalytic property, which is consistent with the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET), H₂ temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. On the other hand, in the high-temperature region, the efficiency increases gradually as the content of CeO₂ increases. The H₂ TPR, NH₃-temperature-programmed desorption, and XPS patterns reveal why the composite exhibits such superior characteristics in the temperature range mentioned above.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aceramics 3aceric oxide 3acleaning 3acrystal structure 3adesorption 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen 3amanganese dioxide 3ananoparticles 3ananowires 3anitrogen oxides 3asurface area 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aMnO2 nanowires 0aCeO2 nanoparticles 0acomposite nanocatalyst 0aelectrodeposition 0aselective catalytic reduction1 aPark, Bum Chul1 aJeon, Yoo Sang1 aKim, Young Keun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0868-46250 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Aug. 31, v. 10, no. 38 p.32112-32119dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b096053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02204naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010500162300001800267500001500285520130100300592002801601650001501629650001501644650002201659651002101681653001801702773010401720856008101824852000901905655001201914IND60119641820221122111355.0141219e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011964182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-014-0819-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, H. S.10aAdequacy of a Multi-objective Regional Calibration Method Incorporating a Sequential Regionalisation  ap. 5507-5526.  a2019-12-04  aA multi-objective regional calibration technique that incorporates a sequential regionalisation procedure was introduced and evaluated based on 12 catchments in Korea. This study was focused on investigating the impacts of the predictive capacity of a rainfall-runoff model for multiple objectives on the adequacy of regional relationships during the regional calibration. The effectiveness of the regional calibration using a multi-objective approach was evaluated by comparing the predictive performance of the regional calibration using a single-objective approach. The comparative assessment of the regional calibration approaches in the regionalisation suggests that the predictability of the regional models derived from the multi-objective regional calibration approach is generally good and reasonable with respect to the simultaneous catchment response to high and low flows and water balance. However, the multi-objective regional calibration approach displayed weaknesses associated with matching the water balance in the hydrograph, which was primarily caused by the reduced variation of the regional parameters. A more extensive study with a larger number of catchments is needed to develop more accurate regional relationships from the multi-objective regional calibration approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3awatersheds 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic models 3aKorean Peninsula 0awater balance0 tWater resources management.g2014 Dec., v. 28, no. 15 p.5507-5526dSpringer-Verlagx0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-014-0819-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001900162245005900181300001800240500001500258520130200273592002801575650003701603650002201640650001401662650001501676650001201691650001501703650001701718650002501735650002201760650001401782650001501796650001401811653001601825653001801841773015501859852000902014856007902023655001202102IND4462277820221121081901.0160905e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446227782DNAL7 a219957962pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-05-11-01142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoyle, Jeff J.10aPhylogenetic Perspectives on the Origins of Nodulation  ap. 1289-1295.  a2019-12-05  aRecent refinements to the phylogeny of rosid angiosperms support the conclusion that nodulation has evolved several times in the so-called N₂-fixing clade (NFC), and provide dates for these origins. The hypothesized predisposition that enabled the evolution of nodulation occurred approximately 100 million years ago (MYA), was retained in the various lineages that radiated rapidly shortly thereafter, and was functional in its non-nodulation role for at least an additional 30 million years in each nodulating lineage. Legumes radiated rapidly shortly after their origin approximately 60 MYA, and nodulation most likely evolved several times during this radiation. The major lineages of papilionoid legumes diverged close to the time of origin of nodulation, accounting for the diversity of nodule biology in the group. Nodulation symbioses exemplify the concept of “deep homology,” sharing various homologous components across nonhomologous origins of nodulation, largely due to recruitment from existing functions, notably the older arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Although polyploidy may have played a role in the origin of papilionoid legume nodules, it did not do so in other legumes, nor did the prerosid whole-genome triplication lead directly to the predisposition of nodulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3anitrogen fixation 3aphylogeny 3apolyploidy 3alegumes 3anodulation 3aAngiospermae 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aPhylogeny 2aPolyploidy 2aSymbiosis 0arecruitment 0aMagnoliophyta0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Nov., v. 24, no. 11 p.1289-1295dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-05-11-01143Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03603naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015500171300001400326520153600340536014101876592002802017596006502045650002702110650002802137650002402165650001702189650000802206650001002214650002802224650001502252650001402267650002302281650001002304650003302314650001502347650001102362650001702373650001802390650001602408650001202424651001402436653002502450653002202475653002302497653001402520653003202534653002002566653002302586653001602609700002602625700002302651700002502674700002302699700002702722773013302749856008602882852000902968655001202977IND60621786420221121215938.0190726e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062178642DNAL7 a10.1080/02827581.2018.15411912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenkis, Audrius10aOccurrence of common phyllosphere fungi of horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is unrelated to degree of damage by leafminer (Cameraria ohridella)  ap. 26-32.  aThe horse chestnut leaf-miner (Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimić, Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) is an invasive pest causing extensive damage to leaves of the horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) in Europe. In Lithuania, C. ohridella invaded in 2002 causing wilting, browning and premature fall of A. hippocastanum leaves. The aim was to get a better understanding of possible linkages between foliar fungal communities and leaf-miner damage in A. hippocastanum. Leaves of A. hippocastanum, differentially damaged by C. ohridella, were collected in 10 sites in Lithuania. The fungal communities were described through DNA isolation and amplification using an ITS rRNA marker and Ion Torrent-sequencing. Clustering of 214,897 high-quality sequences resulted in 1017 non-singleton fungal taxa, among which Aureobasidium pullulans (28.2% of all fungal sequences), Endoconidioma populi (27.7%), Phoma fungicola (11.3%), Cladosporium ramotenellum (7.6%) and Cryptococcus sp. 2185_4 (5.0%) were most common. Correspondence analysis showed that fungal communities from heavily and slightly damaged leaves were largely intermingled, showing that in both types of samples fungal communities were similar. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the phyllosphere of A. hippocastanum is inhabited by a high diversity of fungal species, the majority of which constitute generalist endophytes, epiphytes and saprotrophic fungi. The occurrence of common phyllosphere fungi was unrelated to the degree of damage by C. ohridella.  aThis research was funded by the European Regional Development Fund under the Global Grant measure, project no.

Combating desertification in Cape Verde is complex because it involves addressing a mixture of endogenous (manual agriculture, fuel wood and fodder extraction, land tenure and steep slopes) and exogenous drivers (high rainfall variability, climate change, prolonged drought or heavy rainfall). To address and mitigate the adverse effects of desertification, it is necessary to develop an approach that identifies and brings together all the key stakeholders affected by and acting on the desertification issue, including land users, policy makers, managers, researchers and rural development technicians. This paper presents a hybrid methodology based on global best practices, applied in Cape Verde. It combines experiences and skills of local stakeholders (farmers, local association of land users and local non‐governmental organizations) with scientific knowledge of external stakeholders such as technicians of the Ministry of Rural Development, environmental advisors of Municipalities and researchers. Integration takes place following a participatory process of appraising and selecting desertification control strategies. The paper presents the first results obtained from application of the hybrid methodology to Ribeira Seca, the largest watershed of Santiago Island. The approach was evaluated with local and external stakeholders. Both groups appreciated that they could voice their views and discuss ways to overcome barriers and also to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by jointly selected promising desertification mitigation options.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aclimate change 3adesertification 3adrought 3afarmers 3aforage 3afuelwood 3aissues and policy 3aland tenure 3amanagers 3arain 3aresearchers 3arural development 3astakeholders 3atechnicians 3awatersheds 3aCape Verde1 aFerreira, António J.

As one special kind of scientific workflow, geospatial Web processing workflows are data-intensive, deal with complex structures in data and geographic features, and execute automatically with limited human intervention. To enable the proper execution and coordination of geospatial workflows, a specially enhanced BPEL execution engine is required. BPELPower was designed, developed, and implemented as a generic BPEL execution engine with enhancements for executing geospatial workflows. The enhancements are especially in its capabilities in handling Geography Markup Language (GML) and standard geospatial Web services, such as the Web Processing Service (WPS) and the Web Feature Service (WFS). BPELPower has been used in several demonstrations over the decade. Two scenarios were discussed in detail to demonstrate the capabilities of BPELPower. That study showed a standard-compliant, Web-based approach for properly supporting geospatial processing, with the only enhancement at the implementation level. Pattern-based evaluation and performance improvement of the engine are discussed: BPELPower directly supports 22 workflow control patterns and 17 workflow data patterns. In the future, the engine will be enhanced with high performance parallel processing and broad Web paradigms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abusiness enterprises 3acomputers 3ageography 3ageospatial data processing 3ahumans1 aZhao, Peisheng1 aDi, Liping1 aChen, Aijun1 aDeng, Meixia1 aBai, Yuqi0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Oct., v. 47 p.87-101dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245015500174300001400329520141300343592002801756650001301784650002201797650001501819650002101834650001401855650002001869650001701889650002801906650002401934650002601958650002301984650001002007650001702017650001702034650001502051650002102066650001202087650001102099650001802110650001302128650002302141650002002164650001702184650001602201650001102217650001902228653003002247653001302277653002702290653002102317700001802338700001202356700001702368773013702385856008502522852000902607655001202616IND60621787120221121215922.0181121e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062178712DNAL7 a10.1080/03601234.2017.13693262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuján-Rhenals, D.10aQuantification of nitrogen in the liquid fraction and in vitro assessment of lysine bioavailability in the solid fraction of soybean meal hydrolysates  ap. 12-17.  aSoybean meal (SBM) is a product generated from the manufacture of soybean oil and has the potential for use as a source of fermentable sugars for ethanol production or as a protein source for animal feeds. Knowing the levels of nitrogen available from ammonium is a necessary element of the ethanolic fermentation process while identifying the levels of essential amino acids such as lysine is important in determining usage as a feed source. As such the purpose of this study was to quantify total nitrogen and ammonium in the liquid fraction of hydrolyzed SBM and to evaluate total and bioavailable lysine in the solid fraction of the hydrolyzed SBM. The effects of acid concentration, cellulase and β-glucosidase on total and ammonium nitrogen were studied with analysis indicating that higher acid concentrations increased nitrogen compounds with ammonium concentrations ranging from 0.20 to 1.24 g L⁻¹ while enzymatic treatments did not significantly increase nitrogen levels. Total and bioavailable lysine was quantified by use of an auxotrophic gfpmut3 E.coli whole-cell bioassay organism incapable of lysine biosynthesis. Acid and enzymatic treatments were applied with lysine bioavailability increasing from a base of 82% for untreated SBM to up to 97%. Our results demonstrated that SBM has the potential to serve in ethanolic fermentation and as an optimal source essential amino acid lysine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrogen 3aauxotrophs 3abeta-glucosidase 3abioassays 3abioavailability 3abiosynthesis 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic treatment 3aessential amino acids 3aethanol production 3afeeds 3afermentation 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro studies 3aliquids 3alysine 3amanufacturing 3anitrogen 3anitrogen compounds 3aprotein sources 3asoybean meal 3asoybean oil 3asugars 3atotal nitrogen 0aSoybean meal hydrolysates 0anitrogen 0alysine bioavailability 0aEscherichia coli1 aMorawicki, R.1 aShi, Z.1 aRicke, S.

However, searching, accessing, and processing heterogeneous data from different sources are very time-consuming tasks. There is lack of a comprehensive visual platform to acquire distributed and heterogeneous scientific data and to render processed images from a single accessing point for climate studies. This paper documents the design and implementation of a Web-based visual, interoperable, and scalable platform that is able to access climatological fields from models, satellites, and ground stations from a number of data sources using Google Earth (GE) as a common graphical interface. The development is based on the TCP/IP protocol and various data sharing open sources, such as OPeNDAP, GDS, Web Processing Service (WPS), and Web Mapping Service (WMS). The visualization capability of integrating various measurements into GE extends dramatically the awareness and visibility of scientific results. Using embedded geographic information in the GE, the designed system improves our understanding of the relationships of different elements in a four-dimensional domain. The system enables easy and convenient synergistic research on a virtual platform for professionals and the general public, greatly advancing global data sharing and scientific research collaboration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aclimate 3acomputers 3amodels 3aprofessionals 3asatellites 3aspatial data1 aShen, Suhung1 aLeptoukh, Gregory G.1 aWang, Panxing1 aDi, Liping1 aLu, Mingyue0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Oct., v. 47 p.160-168dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013500167300001400302520176000316592002802076650001402104650001102118650001602129650001002145650001902155700002802174700001502202773008602217856008302303852000902386655001202395IND60096093920221117064858.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009609392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Tanvir10aTree-based genetic programming approach to infer microphysical parameters of the DSDs from the polarization diversity measurements  ap. 20-30.  aThe use of polarization diversity measurements to infer the microphysical parametrization has remained an active goal in the radar remote sensing community. In view of this, the tree-based genetic programming (GP) as a novel approach has been presented for retrieving the governing microphysical parameters of a normalized gamma drop size distribution model D₀ (median drop diameter), Nw (concentration parameter), and μ (shape parameter) from the polarization diversity measurements. A large number of raindrop spectra acquired from a Joss–Waldvogel disdrometer has been utilized to develop the GP models, relating the microphysical parameters to the T-matrix scattering simulated polarization measurements. Several functional formulations retrieving the microphysical parameters-D₀ [f(ZDR), f(ZH, ZDR)], log₁₀Nw [f(ZH, D₀), f(ZH, ZDR, D₀), and μ[f(ZDR, D₀), f(ZH, ZDR, D₀)], where ZH represents reflectivity and ZDR represents differential reflectivity, have been investigated, and applied to a S-band polarimetric radar (CAMRA) for evaluation. It has been shown that the GP model retrieved microphysical parameters from the polarization measurements are in a reasonable agreement with disdrometer observations. The calculated root mean squared errors (RMSE) are noted as 0.23–0.25mm for D₀, 0.74–0.85 for log₁₀Nw (Nw in mm⁻¹ mm⁻³), and 3.30–3.36 for μ. The GP model based microphysical retrieval procedure is further compared with a physically based constrained gamma model for D₀ and log₁₀Nw estimates. The close agreement of the retrieval results between the GP and the constrained gamma models supports the suitability of the proposed genetic programming approach to infer microphysical parameterization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3amodels 3apolarimetry 3aradar 3aremote sensing1 aRico-Ramirez, Miguel A.1 aHan, Dawei0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Nov., v. 48 p.20-30dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012400168300001800292520180200310592002802112650001402140650001302154650001502167650001302182650001302195650001202208650001302220650001702233650001502250650001002265650001002275650001002285650002302295650001202318650001002330650001502340650000902355651001002364653001702374653001702391653001802408653001302426653001002439653002102449653002902470653002502499700002102524773010702545856008002652852000902732655001202741IND60622293320221119070414.0181124e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062229332DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836103719922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Nathan A.10aLate-Holocene relationships among fire, climate and vegetation in a forest-sagebrush ecotone of southwestern Idaho, USA  ap. 1179-1194.  aThe forest-sagebrush ecotone is characterized by a more arid climate than forested regions; therefore, establishing fire histories using traditional methods (e.g. fire-scars from trees, charcoal in lake sediments) is problematic. This study uses radiocarbon dating of charcoal preserved in alluvial deposits to reconstruct a record of fire and geomorphic response in southwestern Idaho. Samples indicate three primary periods of fire-related activity: 4400—4000, 2000—1400, and 650—400 cal. yr BP. Charcoal macrofossil identification and comparison with other regional records indicate this area has likely alternated between a ‘fuel-limited’ system (fires limited by lack of fuels), and a ‘moisture-limited’ system (fires limited by too much moisture) with changes in Holocene climate. Over the past ~2000 yr, samples from this site indicate most fires occurred during wetter times than the record average. During overall wetter periods, (e.g. ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA); 600—100 cal. yr BP) tree density may have increased, and fires occurred during intervals of relative drought. During times of prolonged drought (e.g. ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’ (MCA); 1025—650 cal. yr BP) fire was recorded during a wetter interval. After ~600 cal. yr BP, fire activity was similar to alluvial charcoal records of low-intensity fires in a nearby ponderosa pine-dominated drainage, and sagebrush is common in charcoal samples. Both the ponderosa site and the Wood Creek site show low fire activity in ~6500—5000 cal yr BP; climatically, ~7—5 ka appears to correspond with regional records of drought. This work provides a unique record of fire in a semi-arid ecotone where (1) few records exist because of the paucity of dating sites, and (2) climatic sensitivity is likely enhanced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aalluvium 3aarid zones 3acharcoal 3adrainage 3adrought 3aecotones 3afire history 3afire scars 3afires 3afuels 3alakes 3aradiocarbon dating 3astreams 3atrees 3avegetation 3awood 3aIdaho 0afire history 0afuel limited 0ageomorphology 0aHolocene 0aIdaho 0amoisture limited 0asagebrush-forest ecotone 0asedimentary charcoal1 aPierce, Jennifer0 tHolocene.g2010 Dec., v. 20, no. 8 p.1179-1194dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836103719923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169300001800279520138400297592002801681650002301709650002701732650003101759650001401790650001501804650003701819650000901856650001701865653002301882653002501905653002501930653002301955700002701978773014702005856008502152852000902237655001202246IND60621788220190311000000.0181121e20181206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062178822DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2018.14723762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilias, Fotis10aContribution of non-exchangeable potassium on its quantity-intensity relationships under K-depleted soils  ap. 1988-2004.  aQuantity-Intensity (Q/I) parameters were used for elucidating the role of buffering properties of soils through K depletion. Winter wheat was sown in a greenhouse pot experiment until K-depletion and soils were analyzed with NH₄OAc and NaBPh₄ (1 min incubation period). Q/I isotherms (partitioned in exchangeable and non-exchangeable form) were constructed for the soils before and at the end of the K-exhaustion experiment. Results showed that NaBPh₄-K correlated better than NH₄OAc-K with intensity parameter (ARₑᴷ) or labile K (-ΔΚ₀) in K-depleted soils (r = 0.41 and 0.70), indicating the importance of non-exchangeable K in K dynamics. The latter was confirmed from the comparison of buffering characteristics between initial and K-depleted soils which showed that among the soils studied there was a group whose increase in buffering capacity (PBCᴷₜ) was due to non-exchangeable K fixation. Furthermore, NaBPh₄-K was well predicted by the sum of exchangeable K and the quantity of K that has to be applied to achieve K balance as derived from Q/I isotherms (EK₀ + CK₀). Finally, relationships were found between Q/I parameters of the initial soils (-ΔΚ₀ᵢ, ΕΚ₀ᵢ, ΕΚᵣᵢ, CK₀ᵢ) and the K-depleted ones (ΕΚᵣd, ΕΚ₀d, CK₀d, CKᵣd) which allowed corresponding prediction of the initial parameters (r² = 0.78–0.87).  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffering capacity 3aexchangeable potassium 3agreenhouse experimentation 3apotassium 3aprediction 3aquantity-intensity relationships 3asoil 3awinter wheat 0aQuantity-intensity 0abuffering properties 0apotassium exhaustion 0apotassium dynamics1 aBarbayiannis, Nikolaos0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2018 Dec. 6, v. 64, no. 14 p.1988-2004dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2018.14723763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013700172300001800309520175800327592002802085650001202113650001802125650001602143650001602159650001202175650002202187650001302209650002202222650001502244650001102259650002302270650002002293650001202313650001602325650001502341650001002356650001402366650001802380650001702398650001002415653001602425653001102441653002202452653002002474653002002494700001902514700003902533773014702572856008502719852000902804655001202813IND60621788320190311000000.0181121e20181206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062178832DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2018.14723772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShanazari, Mahdi10aEffects of drought stress on some agronomic and bio-physiological traits of Trititicum aestivum, Triticale, and Tritipyrum genotypes  ap. 2005-2018.  aDrought tolerance is a complex trait that involves different biochemical and physiological mechanisms in plants. It was the objective of the present study to evaluate the agronomic and biochemical responses of triticale, tritipyrum, and wheat to drought stress. For this purpose, twenty-seven genotypes were evaluated under two levels (non-stress and drought stress) of irrigation during 2015‒2017. The metabolic traits studied included relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI), chlorophyll a (Chla), chlorophyll b (Chlb), carotenoids (Car), leaf proline content (Pro), leaf soluble carbohydrates (LSC), glycine betaine (GB), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), seeds per spike (SS), seed weight (SW), biological yield (BY) and seed yield (SY). Drought stress increased Pro, LSC, and GB contents as well as lipid peroxidation through increasing MDA and H₂O₂ activities. However, both RWC and MSI indices as well as SS, SW, SY and BY reduced as a result of drought treatment although the least decrease of SY was observed at triticale group. During the two years of study, the tritipyrum genotypes exhibited their drought tolerance by accumulation of more LSC and GB as well as lower decrease in SW while the triticale ones responded by maintaining higher levels of RWC but producing less MDA and H₂O₂. It may, therefore, be concluded that the three species studied exploit different mechanisms to maintain tolerance against drought stress. Finally, correlation analysis indicated the positive effects of LSC on SY under both drought and normal conditions, which is obviously a promising trait in wheat, triticale, and tritipyrum that can be beneficially exploited in drought tolerance improvement programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abetaine 3acarbohydrates 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airrigation 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aproline 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3atriticale 3awater content 3awater stress 3awheat 0aBread wheat 0abiplot 0adrought tolerance 0aglycine betaine 0amalondialdehyde1 aGolkar, Pooran1 aMirmohammady Maibody, Ali Mohammad0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2018 Dec. 6, v. 64, no. 14 p.2005-2018dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2018.14723773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008300171300001600254520147500270592002801745650001401773650001601787650002201803650001201825650001001837700003001847700002101877773008801898856008301986852000902069655001202078IND60096094420221117065539.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009609442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeffrey Starn, J.10aMethods for simulating solute breakthrough curves in pumping groundwater wells  ap. 244-255.  aIn modeling there is always a trade-off between execution time and accuracy. For gradient-based parameter estimation methods, where a simulation model is run repeatedly to populate a Jacobian (sensitivity) matrix, there exists a need for rapid simulation methods of known accuracy that can decrease execution time, and thus make the model more useful without sacrificing accuracy. Convolution-based methods can be executed rapidly for any desired input function once the residence-time distribution is known. The residence-time distribution can be calculated efficiently using particle tracking, but particle tracking can be ambiguous near a pumping well if the grid is too coarse. We present several embedded analytical expressions for improving particle tracking near a pumping well and compare them with a finely gridded finite-difference solution in terms of accuracy and CPU usage. Even though the embedded analytical approach can improve particle tracking near a well, particle methods reduce, but do not eliminate, reliance on a grid because velocity fields typically are calculated on a grid, and additional error is incurred using linear interpolation of velocity. A dilution rate can be calculated for a given grid and pumping well to determine if the grid is sufficiently refined. Embedded analytical expressions increase accuracy but add significantly to CPU usage. Structural error introduced by the numerical solution method may affect parameter estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3agroundwater 3asimulation models 3asolutes 3awells1 aBagtzoglou, Amvrossios C.1 aRobbins, Gary A.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Nov., v. 48 p.244-255dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245012800181300001800309520121500327536010701542592002801649596011401677650001501791650002201806650001701828650002901845650003301874650002801907650002401935650001501959650002201974650001501996650002602011650003102037650000902068650001702077650001802094650001802112650002502130651001002155653002002165653002302185653001702208653002102225653002102246700002102267700002602288700002402314700003102338700002502369700002102394700002202415700002302437700001702460700002502477700002102502773014702523856008502670852000902755655001202764IND60621788520190311000000.0181121e20181206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062178852DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2018.14767552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoharana, Pravash Chandra10aAssessment of soil quality monitoring indicators under long term rice cultivation in hot arid Ghaggar-flood plains of India  ap. 2030-2044.  aThe evaluation of soil quality is essential in monitoring the long term effects of rice cultivation. Present study investigated the effects of long term rice cultivation on soil properties and organic C pools and identified indicators for monitoring soil quality in Ghaggar-flood plains of hot arid India. Soil samples were collected from fields with 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 years of rice cultivation. The study revealed that electrical conductivity (EC) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) increased after 30–40 years of rice cultivation. Available nutrients increased with increasing years of rice cultivation. The organic carbon pools namely, total organic carbon (TOC), Walkley Black carbon (WBC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were increased above 50% in 20 and above years of rice cultivation. The TOC and POC were increased by 40.6 to 132.4% and 31.7% to 104.8% in 10 to 40 years of rice cultivation. Cation exchange capacity, WBC, ESP and CaCO₃ could serve as soil monitoring indicators of long term rice cultivation in arid region. The findings clearly indicated that long term rice cultivation could aggravate soil salinity and have negative impact on soil quality in arid environment.  aThis work was supported by the ICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS & LUP).  aPublisher supplied data  cICAR-National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS & LUP)dhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001503 3aarid zones 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon sinks 3acation exchange capacity 3adry environmental conditions 3aelectrical conductivity 3aexchangeable sodium 3aleukocytes 3along term effects 3amonitoring 3anutrient availability 3aparticulate organic carbon 3arice 3asoil quality 3asoil salinity 3asoil sampling 3atotal organic carbon 3aIndia 0aSoil properties 0aavailable nutrient 0acarbon pools 0arice cultivation 0aarid environment1 aSingh, Ram Sakal1 aSingh, Surendra Kumar1 aJena, Roomesh Kumar1 aNaitam, Ravindra Kashinath1 aVerma, Thakur Prasad1 aNogiya, Mahaveer1 aMeena, Roshan Lal1 aGupta, Dipak Kumar1 aKumar, Sunil1 aTailor, Bhagwati Lal1 aSingh, Rameshwar0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2018 Dec. 6, v. 64, no. 14 p.2030-2044dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4585x1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2018.14767553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02011naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011100173300001600284520104500300592002801345650001501373650002801388650001401416650002401430650001101454650001201465651002101477700001901498773008801517856008301605852000901688655001201697IND60096094720221117065340.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009609472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLattner, Andreas D.10aEnsemble modeling of transport and dispersion simulations guided by machine learning hypotheses generation  ap. 267-279.  aIn this article an approach is presented where machine learning classifiers are used to drive an ensemble modeling method of multiple atmospheric transport and dispersion simulations. The goal is to achieve a higher spread of the results with a lower number of ensemble simulations. Symbolic machine learning algorithms are used to define choices for the variation of meteorological input data, model parameters, model physics, based on their combined effects on the final dispersion calculations (i.e., construction of ensembles). The methodology uses an iterative approach with the aim to identify ensemble members leading to a more balanced distribution of results. The methodology is tested using real meteorological data from Istanbul, Turkey, simulating atmospheric releases along the Bosphorus channel.

The chronology is constructed using 78 quartz OSL ages obtained using a Single Aliquot Regenerative dose (SAR) protocol; samples were retrieved from seven sediment cores, each up to 25 m long, taken from locations on the island and within the back-barrier lagoon. The reliability of the OSL results is assessed using preheat plateaus, thermal transfer tests, and dose recovery measurements, and by comparison with independent age control. The OSL ages compare favourably with three ¹⁴C age estimates, and range between 220±20 and 15 800±1200 years. Rømø appears to have developed as a progradational barrier system, and the island appeared for the first time approximately 8000 years ago. It then gradually expanded towards the west, north and south as a result of an abundant sediment supply. Luminescence dating is concluded to be well-suited for establishing precise and accurate chronologies for barrier island deposits, and the technique has provided an excellent basis for the reconstruction of barrier island evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aislands 3aluminescence 3aprotocols 3aquartz 3aradiocarbon dating 3asediments 3aDenmark 3aNorth Sea 0abarrier island 0aOSL 0aquartz 0aSAR protocol 0asea level 0a14C1 aMurray, A.S.1 aAndersen, T.J.1 aPejrup, M.0 tHolocene.g2010 Dec., v. 20, no. 8 p.1247-1256dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836103748833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245011300165300001800278520121400296592002801510650001401538650001401552650001201566650001501578650001301593650001301606650001601619650001501635650001501650650002901665650001201694650001101706650001601717650001501733650001701748650001101765650001701776650001101793650001401804650001401818650001101832650001101843650001501854651001701869653001301886653001901899653002401918653002201942653001101964653003401975700002402009700002102033700002102054700002202075700002002097773010702117856008002224852000902304655001202313IND60622294220221119070244.0181124e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062229422DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836103748842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProske, Ulrike14aThe palaeoenvironmental development of the northeastern Vietnamese Mekong River Delta since the mid Holocene  ap. 1257-1268.  aThree radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from the northeastern Vietnamese Mekong River Delta have been analysed with a multiproxy approach (grain size, pollen and spores, macro-charcoal, carbon content) to unravel the palaeoenvironmental history of the region since the mid Holocene. During the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand a diverse, zoned and widespread mangrove belt (dominated by Rhizophora) covered the extended tidal flats. The subsequent regression and coeval delta progradation led to the rapid development of a back-mangrove community dominated by Ceriops and Bruguiera but also represented locally by e.g. Kandelia, Excoecaria and Phoenix. Along rivers this community seems to have endured even when the adjoining floodplain had already shifted to freshwater vegetation. Generally this freshwater vegetation has a strong swamp signature but locally Arecaceae, Fabaceae, Moraceae/ Urticaceae and Myrsinaceae are important and mirror the geomorphological diversity of the delta plain. The macro-charcoal record implies that natural burning of vegetation occurred throughout the records, however, the occurrence of the highest amounts of macro-charcoal particles is linked with modern human activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArecaceae 3aBruguiera 3aCeriops 3aExcoecaria 3aFabaceae 3aKandelia 3aPrimulaceae 3aRhizophora 3aUrticaceae 3aanthropogenic activities 3aburning 3acarbon 3afloodplains 3afreshwater 3apaleoecology 3apollen 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asea level 3asediments 3aspores 3aswamps 3avegetation 3aMekong River 0aHolocene 0amacro-charcoal 0amodern human impact 0apalaeoenvironment 0apollen 0aVietnamese Mekong River Delta1 aHanebuth, Till J.J.1 aBehling, Hermann1 aVan Lap Nguyen, 1 aThi Kim Oanh Ta, 1 aBui Phat Diem, 0 tHolocene.g2010 Dec., v. 20, no. 8 p.1257-1268dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836103748843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02041naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245008300171300001400254520094600268592002801214650001401242650002001256650002001276650001301296650001301309650001401322650001901336650002201355650002101377700002201398700002501420700002201445700002201467773008601489856008301575852000901658655001201667IND60096095720221117065749.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009609572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuján Ganuza, M.10aSpinelViz: An interactive 3D application for visualizing spinel group minerals  ap. 50-56.  aSpinelViz is an application for the visualization of the spinel group minerals in three dimensions.

Spinels, particularly chromites from mafic–ultramafic igneous rocks are used to discriminate among various tectonic settings. Their existence in ultramafic rocks and their resistance to alteration make them excellent tectonic tracers and a very important tool in search for economic deposits of the platinum group elements (PGE) and Ni-Cu-PGE.

In this study, hydroponically grown C. sativa plants were sampled over a 3-year period (2014–2017) to determine the prevalence of root pathogens. Following isolation, pathogenicity studies were conducted to establish the extent of disease symptoms caused by the recovered microbes. Root rot was found to be caused by two Pythium species – Pythium dissotocum Drechsler and P. myriotylum Drechsler. As well, two Fusarium species were recovered from diseased plants – Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht. emend. Snyder & Hansen and F. solani (Mart.) Sacc. Upon inoculation onto healthy plants, all isolates of Pythium spp. caused browning and a reduction in root mass, accompanied by stunting. Inoculation of plants with F. oxysporum caused browning of roots and crown rot infection, accompanied by pith and vascular discolouration, and in some cases wilting of plants, while root and crown infection was observed with F. solani. Phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) sequences revealed that the Fusarium species affecting cannabis plants shared 99–100% sequence homology with isolates causing stem rot and wilt in other hosts, including cumin and tomato, suggesting they were not uniquely adapted to cannabis. The potential for spread of F. oxysporum through the hydroponic system was confirmed by its detection in the recirculating nutrient solution. Furthermore, rooted cuttings obtained from commercial propagators were found to harbour Fusarium root infection that resulted in subsequent stunting, yellowing and occasional death of plants. This demonstrates the potential for long-distance spread of the pathogen. The two Pythium species recovered from cannabis plants have an extremely broad host range and are not unique to this host. An additional species, P. aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp., was recovered from diseased plants grown under greenhouse conditions in 2018. The management of these root pathogens on C. sativa will require the evaluation and implementation of sanitization methods, biological control agents, and chemical products adapted from greenhouse vegetable production practices. The use of pathogen-free propagation materials and identification of potential sources of disease resistance should also become a priority.  aThis research was funded by Agrima Botanicals in conjunction with matching funds from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Collaborative Research and Development Grant.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgrima Botanicals in conjunction with matching funds from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)  cCollaborative Research and Development Grant 3aCannabis sativa 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium solani 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3aPythium myriotylum 3abiological control agents 3acrown rot 3acumin 3adeath 3adiscoloration 3adisease resistance 3afungal diseases of plants 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ahydroponics 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anutrient solutions 3apathogenicity 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3apith 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apropagation materials 3aroot rot 3aroots 3asequence homology 3astem rot 3atomatoes 3avegetable growing 3awilting 3aCanada 0adisease management 0ahydroponics 0amarijuana 0apathogen detection 0aroot rot 0awilt1 aRodriguez, Gina0 tCanadian journal of plant pathology.g2018 Oct. 2, v. 40, no. 4 p.498-513dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43214x1715-29927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2018.15354663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009800170300001500268520055300283592002800836650001500864650001400879650001900893650003000912650002400942650001700966650001800983700002201001700002501023700001901048700001901067700001901086700001801105773008701123856008301210852000901293655001201302IND60096096420221117065308.0141104e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009609642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyväluoma, Jari10aUsing microtomography, image analysis and flow simulations to characterize soil surface seals  ap. 93-101.  aRaindrops that impact on soil surface affect the pore structure and form compact soil surface seals.

Such errors commonly cause systematic degradations, including over-smoothing and decreased resolution of estimated geophysical models. In this paper, the relationship between systematic errors and an estimated geophysical estimated model is analyzed. A convolution model for systematic degradations is also derived. On the basis of the convolution model, we suggest using the inverse method to reduce systematic degradations and enhance estimated geophysical models. Accordingly, we propose a geophysical model enhancement algorithm based on blind deconvolution. The algorithm uses the mixed norm total variation regularizations to optimize the precision of the solution. We conduct experiments on 1D linear and 2D magnetotelluric geophysical model enhancement to confirm the validity of the proposed convolution approximation theory and model enhancement algorithm. Results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves geophysical models. In particular, the 2D enhancement experiment shows that the proposed algorithm increases overall model precision by 75%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3ageophysics 3amodels1 aHu, Xiangyun0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Dec., v. 49 p.170-181dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245007400170300001400244520161700258592002801875650002601903650001701929650001201946650002201958650001901980650002201999650001002021650002202031650001802053650001402071650001102085650002002096650001102116650001202127651002202139653001902161653001302180653002202193653001802215653002002233653001402253700001502267700003002282700002102312700002202333700001802355700003202373773010302405856008002508852000902588655001202597IND60622296520221119070223.0181124e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062229652DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836103841612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Obiol, Ramon10aMid-Holocene vegetation and climatic history of the Iberian Peninsula  ap. 75-93.  aThe aim of this research is to study the climate and vegetation history in the western Mediterranean, in the Iberian Peninsula, during the middle Holocene through pollen analysis. The origin of the deposits varied from the most xeric to more mesic Mediterranean environments. The timing, extent, and progress of the establishment of the Mediterranean climate have a degree of variability depending on the biogeographical region. Analyses of several pollen sequences reveal climatic transformations in the flora and vegetation between 7000 and 4000 cal. yr BP. Pollen concentrations have been used in some sequences to evaluate the order of magnitude in biomass changes through time. Three main spatial and taxonomic responses could be assumed: (1) in littoral regions, deciduous broadleaf trees were frequently dominant and then replaced by sclerophyllous and evergreen forests; (2) in continental regions and sub-Mediterranean mountains, the dominance of pine throughout the whole Holocene signals a change of less magnitude; and (3) in southeastern semiarid Mediterranean regions, the main changes are reflected by alternation between steppe and shrub communities. The emplacement of the Mediterranean climate is reflected in an aridification process. A temporal first approach of Holocene climatic changes is proposed: a humid phase (12 000—7000 cal. yr BP), a transition phase (7000—5500 cal. yr BP) and an aridification phase (5500 cal. yr BP—Present). According to archaeological data, natural changes in the forests favoured the environments suitable for human settlements, farming and sheepherding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3abiogeography 3abiomass 3abroadleaved trees 3aclimate change 3aevergreen forests 3aflora 3ahuman settlements 3alittoral zone 3amountains 3apollen 3apollen analysis 3ashrubs 3asteppes 3aIberian Peninsula 0aclimate change 0aHolocene 0aIberian Peninsula 0aMediterranean 0apollen analysis 0asemi-arid1 aJalut, Guy1 aJulià i Brugués, Ramon,1 aPèlachs, Albert1 aIriarte, Ma José1 aOtto, Thierry1 aHernández-Beloqui, Begoña0 tHolocene.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.75-93dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836103841613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03119naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011000167300001600277520166400293592002801957650001901985650001102004650002102015650002202036650001202058650001202070650001902082650001102101650001102112650000902123650001102132650001602143650001302159650001902172651001602191653001902207653001902226653003502245653002802280653003002308653001802338653001602356700002202372700002502394773010502419856008002524852000902604655001202613IND60622297020221119070205.0181124e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062229702DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836103857172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGlone, Matt S.10aSeasonality in the early Holocene: Extending fossil-based estimates with a forest ecosystem process model  ap. 517-526.  aPast seasonality changes are often poorly represented by Quaternary proxies because one season, or one factor, dominates the reconstructed signal. During the early Holocene in New Zealand, mean annual temperatures were at least 1.5°C warmer than present. However, treelines were lower, suggesting summers were cooler. Here we use a forest ecosystem process model, LINKNZ, to explore past precipitation and temperature seasonality changes in an intermontane basin of the Southern Alps, New Zealand. Pollen and macrofossils from the basin show that during an early-Holocene warm event (11 500 to 9500 cal. yr BP) podocarp and broadleaved species dominated. In exploratory modelling runs, mean annual temperatures were increased by up to 2°C, precipitation was reduced by 20—30%, and temperature seasonality reduced. When mean annual temperature was increased by 1.0—2.0°C, LINKNZ reconstructed wet forest associations, very different to those in the early-Holocene fossil assemblages. Acceptable matches were made with the early-Holocene vegetation using elevated temperature scenarios with up to 30% lower annual precipitation and decreased temperature seasonality. Longer growing seasons apparently compensate for cooler summer temperatures. We suggest that during the early Holocene in this area, westerly wind flow over the Southern Alps to the west of the basin was less, reducing spill-over rainfall and vapour pressure deficits. Warm oceans generated milder, cloudier climates reducing seasonal contrasts. Inverse modelling is recommended as a tool for exploring past climate scenarios when proxies fail to reconstruct important climate variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3abasins 3aclimatic factors 3aforest ecosystems 3aforests 3afossils 3agrowing season 3amodels 3apollen 3arain 3asummer 3atemperature 3atreeline 3awind direction 3aNew Zealand 0aclimate change 0aearly Holocene 0aforest ecosystem process model 0amean annual temperature 0amodern analogue technique 0aprecipitation 0aseasonality1 aHall, Graeme M.J.1 aWilmshurst, Janet M.0 tHolocene.g2011 June, v. 21, no. 4 p.517-526dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836103857173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245012500210300001600335500001900351520100900370592002801379650001701407650003901424650002101463650001601484650000901500650001401509650001801523653001501541653003701556653002501593653002501618653002301643700001301666700001201679700005501691700001901746773010701765856008801872852000901960655001201969IND60654338320221118225916.0201023e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065433832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.07.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Yongchao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3511-108810aEffects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on the UV-induced fluorescence spectra of crude oil films on the sea surface  ap. 977-984.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs the main fluorescent substances in oils, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the basis of ultraviolet (UV)-induced fluorescence spectroscopy methods to detect oil films on the sea surface. The relative contents of PAHs in six crude oil samples and their effects on ultraviolet fluorescence spectra were studied. The PAHs were divided into four categories according to their fluorescence characteristics. Naphthalene series dominated the fluorescence spectra, which led to a main peak at 320–350 nm, but this showed no relationship with PAH content. The six oil samples could not be distinguished by differences in the fluorescence spectra in this range, but could be distinguished by the fluorescence spectra in the 350–380 nm band. The relative contents of dibenzothiophene and phenanthrene series showed significant positive correlations (R² = 0.96) with fluorescence intensity. Fluorescence spectroscopy combined with GC–MS can be used to distinguish and identify crude oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amarine pollution 3anaphthalene 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aphenanthrenes 0aOil spills 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aFluorescence spectra 0aCorrelation analysis 0aOil identification1 aLi, Ying1 aLiu, Yu1 aLi, Guannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9377-61791 aZhang, Zhenduo0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Sept., v. 146 p.977-984dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.07.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013300175520198200308592002802290650001902318650002202337650001402359650001102373650001202384650000902396650001302405650001502418650001502433650001702448650001502465650000802480650002502488650001002513650002402523650001302547650001702560650001302577650001502590651001902605651001602624651001302640653002902653653002502682653002002707653001802727653002602745653001802771700002702789773013302816856008502949852000903034655001203043IND60654338820221118230038.0191214e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065433882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaremba, Nicholas J.10aHigh-resolution seismic stratigraphy of Late Pleistocene Glacial Lake Iroquois and its Holocene successor: Oneida Lake, New York  aOneida Lake, New York, is the remnant of Glacial Lake Iroquois, a large proglacial lake that delivered fresh water to the Atlantic Ocean during the last deglaciation. The formation of Glacial Lake Iroquois and its subsequent drainage into the Atlantic Ocean via the Mohawk Valley was a significant shift in the routing of Laurentide Ice Sheet meltwater to the east instead of south via the Allegheny or Susquehanna Rivers. Catastrophic drainage of Glacial Lake Iroquois into the Atlantic Ocean via the Champlain Valley is interpreted as the meltwater pulse responsible for the Intra-Allerod cold stadial. Therefore, understanding the evolution of Glacial Lake Iroquois has significant implications for understanding late Pleistocene paleoclimate.High-resolution CHIRP seismic reflection data provides insight into the evolution of Glacial Lake Iroquois and Oneida Lake. Three seismic units image distinct stages of the Oneida Basin. Unit 1 is interpreted as proglacial lake deposits that overlie glacial till. Unit 2 is interpreted as sediments deposited when the Oneida Basin became isolated from Glacial Lake Iroquois and Unit 3 is interpreted as lacustrine sediments of the modern lake. Distally sourced turbidites possibly triggered by seismic activity or ice sheet meltwater pulses are represented as reflection-free acoustic facies that infill topographic lows and range in thickness from ~1–5 m within otherwise conformable proglacial lake deposits. Local slump deposits imaged at the boundary between Unit 1 and 2 were likely triggered by the drainage of Glacial Lake Iroquois. Wave cut terraces indicative of a low stand on the upper bounding surface of Unit 2 are likely the result of drier conditions during the Holocene Hypsithermal. Furthermore, preservation of this low stand suggests a rapid rise in lake level, possibly the result of the same transition to a wetter climate responsible for the Nipissing transgression observed in the Laurentian Great lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aPleistocene epoch 3aacoustics 3abasins 3aclimate 3acold 3adrainage 3afreshwater 3ageophysics 3aglacial till 3aglaciation 3aice 3alacustrine sediments 3alakes 3asediment deposition 3asnowmelt 3astratigraphy 3aterraces 3atopography 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aGreat Lakes 3aNew York 0aProglacial lake deposits 0aLaurentide ice sheet 0aMeltwater pulse 0aMohawk Valley 0aHolocene Hypsithermal 0aIntra-Allerod1 aScholz, Christopher A.0 tPalaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 534 p.109286-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2694x0031-01827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.1092863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009200155300002000247520132300267592002801590650002501618650001601643700001901659700002201678773013501700856007501835852000901910655001201919IND60539951420221121154751.0160818e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053995142DNAL7 a10.1021/ja507740u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Amy S.12aA Unified Strategy for the Synthesis of 7-Membered-Ring-Containing Lycopodium Alkaloids  ap. 13442-13452.  aA unique subset of the Lycopodium alkaloid natural products share a 7-membered-ring substructure and may potentially arise from a common biosynthetic precursor. To both explore and exploit these structural relationships, we sought to develop a unified biosynthetically inspired strategy to efficiently access these complex polycyclic alkaloids through the use of a cascade sequence. In pursuit of these goals, the first total synthesis of (+)-fastigiatine (2) was accomplished via a series of cascade reactions; we describe herein a full account of our efforts. Insight from these endeavors led to critical modifications of our synthetic strategy, which enabled the first total syntheses of (−)-himeradine A (1), (−)-lycopecurine (3), and (−)-dehydrolycopecurine (4), as well as the syntheses of (+)-lyconadin A (5) and (−)-lyconadin B (6). Our approach features a diastereoselective one-pot sequence for constructing the common 7-membered-ring core system, followed by either a biomimetic transannular Mannich reaction to access himeradine A (1), lycopecurine (3), and dehydrolycopecurine (4) or an imine reduction for lyconadins A (5) and B (6). This strategy may potentially enable access to all 7-membered-ring-containing Lycopodium alkaloids and provides additional insight into their biosynthetic origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycopodium alkaloids 3abiomimetics1 aLiau, Brian B.1 aShair, Matthew D.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 24, v. 136, no. 38 p.13442-13452dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja507740u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008000163500001900243520205700262592002802319650002302347650002002370650001302390650001902403650001402422650001102436650001902447650001602466650001202482650004102494650002502535650001802560650001702578650001402595650001202609650002402621650002402645651001002669700002902679700002402708700002102732700002602753773013602779856008102915852000902996655001203005IND60698194220221118192859.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069819422DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200034682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArpón, Ana10aAdiposity and dyslipidaemia are associated with epigenetic age acceleration  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAdipose tissue is an endocrine organ involved in a variety of regulatory functions beyond simple fat storage. Excessive fat accumulation in the visceral tissue has been related to obesity associated comorbidities and manifestations such as hypertension, hyperglycaemia, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory processes. In the later stages of life, there is a shift of fat distribution from subcutaneous to visceral depots, which is associated to the development of several age-related diseases. Epigenetics has been described as a potential contributor in aging processes, being also associated with diseases and fat deposition that progress with age. The aim of this research was to investigate the relationships between aging, epigenetic processes and visceral adipose tissue. The study population included 269 adult subjects recruited in the University of Navarra, Spain. Methylation data was assessed by Infinium MethylationEPIC beadchip from Illumina. Epigenetic age acceleration was calculated using the method GrimAge (AgeAccGrim), available in the website DNA methylation Age Calculator (https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/home). Anthropometric, biochemical and blood pressure measurements were assessed following standardized methods. Body composition measurements by DXA were also carried out. Statistically significant correlations were found between age acceleration and waist circumference, some DXA-measured variables (lean mass, trunk fat mass, android fat mass, visceral adipose tissue mass), glucose, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides levels and C-reactive protein. Linear regression models showed that visceral adipose tissue mass and HDL-cholesterol were conjointly influencing the epigenetic age acceleration. In addition, a mediation by HDL-cholesterol in the relationship between AgeAccGrim and visceral adipose tissue mass was found. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that visceral adiposity and dyslipidaemia are associated with accelerated aging effects, contributing to understand the development of age-related diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aDNA methylation 3aInternet 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3aadults 3ablood pressure 3aepigenetics 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypertension 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3awaist circumference 3aSpain1 aRiezu-Boj, José-Ignacio1 aMilagro, Fermín I.1 aSantos, Jose L.,1 aAlfredo Martínez, J.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Formulations containing five different protein:fat ratios (0.21–0.43) were investigated. Increasing protein:fat ratio increased viscosity and decreased fat globule size. Fat globule size increased significantly upon evaporation (P<0.05) for all formulations, but decreased significantly (P < 0.05) following atomization during spray drying. The specific surface area of fat globules increased with increasing protein:fat ratio, while protein load (τ) did not differ significantly between treatments. Increasing protein:fat ratio resulted in decreased creaming rates and improved emulsion stability. In conclusion, decreasing the protein:fat ratio of the formulae, particularly to 0.21, reduced the physical stability of the emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomization 3aemulsions 3aevaporation 3afat globules 3ainfant formulas 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aspray drying 3asurface area 3aviscosity1 aKelly, Alan L.1 aO’Mahony, James A.1 aHickey, Dara K.1 aChaurin, Valérie1 aFenelon, Mark A.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2012 Aug., v. 25, no. 2 p.80-86dElsevier Ltdx0958-69467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012700157300002000284520066900304592002800973650001401001650001401015650001101029650001801040650000901058650001201067650001101079650001401090650001301104650001401117700001601131700002201147700002101169700002301190773013501213856007501348852000901423655001201432IND60539952120170628000000.0160818e20140924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053995212DNAL7 a10.1021/ja507947d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManna, Kuntal10aSalicylaldimine-Based Metal–Organic Framework Enabling Highly Active Olefin Hydrogenation with Iron and Cobalt Catalysts  ap. 13182-13185.  aA robust and porous Zr metal–organic framework, sal-MOF, of UiO topology was synthesized using a salicylaldimine (sal)-derived dicarboxylate bridging ligand.

Results from non-controlled 12-week intervention study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLow FODMAP diet is shown to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome in many populations. Until today, no holistic FODMAP diet studies have been published among Finnish IBS patients. This study was a 12-week non-controlled follow-up study of a previously published randomised cross-over trial on different rye bread products ¹. In this follow-up study (n = 50) symptom values during rye bread periods, i.e. low-FODMAP and regular rye periods, are used as baseline values. Participants were instructed to follow holistic low-FODMAP diet after they had first consumed regular and low-FODMAP rye bread for 4 weeks of each bread. Symptoms were measured with a validated symptom severity scoring system (IBS-SSS. Quality of life (QOL) was monitored and fiber intake during the rye bread periods and low-FODMAP diet was calculated from 4-day food diaries. Mean IBS-SSS was 211 (SD 84) during low-FODMAP rye bread and 218 (86) during regular rye bread. During low-FODMAP diet IBS-SSS was 178 (79) at week 1 and reduced further to 135 (80) by the end of week 12 (p < 0.001). IBS-SSS scores at week 1 and week 12 during low-FODMAP diet were lower compared to low-FODMAP rye bread and regular rye bread (p < 0.01 for all comparisons. Mean QOL was 68 during low-FODMAP rye bread, 67 during regular rye bread ; 68 at week 1 and 74 at week 12 during low-FODMAP diet. At week 1 no improvement was found in QOL vs. either rye bread period, but at week 12 the improvement was significant (p < 0.001 vs. both rye breads). Fiber intake was lower at the end of week 12 (median 19 g/d) than during either low-FODMAP rye bread (28 g/d) or regular rye bread period (31 g) (p < 0.001 vs. both rye breads). Low-FODMAP diet reduced the symptoms of IBS and improved quality of life in Finnish IBS patients. However, due to non-controlled nature of this follow-up study, the results need to be interpreted with caution, and randomised studies are warranted also in Finland. Achieving recommended intake of fiber seems to be challenging for Finnish patients with IBS, and therefore the use high fiber food items and/or fiber supplements which are also low in FODMAP should be encouraged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFODMAP diet 3abreads 3aclinical trials 3across-over studies 3airritable bowel syndrome 3aquality of life 3arye 3aFinland1 aPoussa, Tuija1 aKoskenpato, Jari1 aHillilä, Markku1 aLoponen, Jussi1 aHongisto, Sanna-Maria1 aKorpela, Riitta0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

As such, we have successfully synthesized polycyclic marine pyrrole alkaloids, lamellarins C and I, by using this β-selective arylation of pyrroles with aryl iodides (C–H/C–I coupling) and a new double C–H/C–H coupling as key steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaloids 3acatalysts 3adrugs 3aiodides 3apyrroles 3arhodium1 aAmaike, Kazuma1 aMaceiczyk, Richard

Consolidation and layering play a critical role in the growth process. However, little is known about the kinetics.In this work, a novel consolidation-only granulator (COG) was used to study dynamic consolidation and layering only, eliminating other granulation mechanisms. Prenucleated granule growth was studied over time. Based on experimental data and literature models, a mechanistic layering kernel for population balance modelling was developed.Granule growth kinetics were qualitatively predicted by a previously reported model; growth behaviour was linear with the square root of time to a certain critical size, after which growth stopped. X-ray computed tomography revealed that consolidation mainly occurred in the outer layers of the granules.The results greatly advance understanding of consolidation and layered growth, and the new model opens the way for improved predictive modelling and design of granulation processes and products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputed tomography 3agrowth models 3apowders 0aWet granulation 0aLayering kinetics 0aConsolidation 0aModelling1 aBright, Augustus,cMrs.1 aLitster, James D.1 aSmith, Rachel M.0 tPowder technology.g2019 Oct., v. 355 p.514-525dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2019.07.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245010300180300001800283520181700301592002802118650000802146650001102154650001902165650000902184650001502193650001902208650001602227650001602243700002002259700002002279700001702299700001602316773010402332856008902436852000902525655001202534IND60539953720221121123435.0160818e20160818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053995372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b004302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathekga, Happy Isaac,10aPerformance Evaluation of South African Coals under Oxy-Fuel Combustion in a Fluidized Bed Reactor  ap. 6756-6763.  aIn this study, the experimental results of the oxy-fluidized combustion of three different South African coals (sub-bituminous) are presented. The coal samples were denoted Coal A, B, and C. Three combustion atmospheresair, oxy (21% O₂/79% CO₂), and oxy (30% O₂/70% CO₂)were studied. A total of 18 tests were conducted in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor at 850 and 925 °C. The results obtained showed that the highest carbon burnout was obtained at 30% O₂/CO₂, followed by air, and last at 21% O₂/CO₂. Coals A and B had a higher carbon burnout than Coal C. There was a marginal difference of 1% in the carbon burnout for both Coals A and B in all the conditions except at 21% O₂/CO₂ at 925 °C, when the carbon burnout of Coal A was 5% higher than that of Coal B. Carbon burnout in Coal C was about 20% lower than those of Coals A and B. Carbon burnout had a good correlation with the char particle temperature at all the combustion conditions studied for the three coals. The carbon burnout only had a good correlation with the vitrinite random reflectance at 21% O₂/CO₂ at 925 °C for the three coals. The highest char particle temperature (1250 K) was obtained in Coal B at 30% oxy-combustion (30% O₂/CO₂) at a 925 °C bed temperature, and it had the highest carbon burnout of 99.34%. The lowest char particle particle temperature (1167 K) was obtained in Coal C at 21% oxy-combustion (21% O₂/CO₂) at a 850 °C bed temperature, and it had the lowest carbon burnout of 65.81%. There was a higher fuel-nitrogen conversion in air combustion than in oxy-fuel combustion than for all the coals. Fuel-S conversion ratios to SOₓ indicated that air combustion had relatively higher conversions than oxy-fuel, with the highest conversion of 35% observed for Coal A at 925 °C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3afluidized beds 3areflectance 3atemperature1 aOboirien, B.

It has been observed that the food pattern and anthropometric parameters in W or B consumers may be different from non-alcoholic drinkers (NAD), in populations from North of Europe and USA. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the dietary pattern and anthropometric parameters among consumers of W, B and NAD, in an elderly population at high cardiovascular risk. 4940 participants recruited from the Predimed trial, a 5-year parallel group, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial, were evaluated. We used date from a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire with 137 items, that included the amount and type of alcoholic beverage consumed. Adherence to traditional Mediterranean diet also was evaluated using a validated 14-point score test as well as anthropometric parameters (height, body weight and waist perimeter) measured using standard methods. Comparisons among groups showed that W drinkers had a higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet than drinkers of B and NAD (P < 0.001; both). On the other hand, the drinkers of W showed also lower body weight and body mass index (BMI) than B and NAD drinkers (P < 0.001; both). Moderate wine consumption is associated lower body weight and BMI and a higher adherence to Mediterranean diet. Accordingly, W drinkers could have extra beneficial effects on CVD than others alcoholic beverages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3abeers 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3acardiovascular diseases 3aclinical trials 3aeating habits 3aelderly 3afermentation 3afood frequency questionnaires 3arisk 3awaist 3awines 3aEurope1 aCasas, Rosa1 aRoth, Irene1 aEstruch, Ramón0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

This study aims to determine the individual workload perception of the FSS personnel and to ascertain whether the individual workload perception differs across demographic variables and occupational groups. The population of this descriptive study consists of the personnel working in the kitchen of the Akdeniz University Hospital, and the sample consists of 87 people who accepted to participate in the study by filling out the questionnaire forms on a voluntary basis. Individual Workload Perception Scale was used to evaluate the personnel's perception on their work environment and Personal Information Form was used to detect the participants’ data related to the independent variables. Approximately half of the individuals (47.1%) participating in the study were aged 31–40 years (33.5 ± 7.32). 56.3% of the individuals were waiter and three quarters of the individuals worked in shifts. Total individual workload perception of the FSS personnel was detected as 64.7 ± 15.25 on average. The mean score of the colleague support sub-group of the individuals was the highest and the mean score of the unit support was the lowest. It was determined that FSS personnel did not display a statistically significant difference across age groups, gender, marital status, educational status and individual workload sub-groups. It was only seen that there was a significant association between the work distribution of the individuals and the colleague&unit support (p < 0.05). A positively significant correlation was detected in FSS personnel between colleague support (r = 0.859), unit support (r = 0.473), work environment perception (r = 0.647) and intention to resume current work (r = 0.434) subscales and total individual workload perception scale (p < 0.01). The workload of the FSS personnel working in the hospital was found to be high, and it is necessary to evaluate the individual workload and develop solutions for the provision of dietary services in a safe, high quality and efficient manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3adescriptive studies 3aeducational status 3agender 3ahospital food service 3ahospitals 3ahuman resources 3amarital status 3anutrition 3apeople 3aquestionnaires 3aworking conditions1 aKurklu, Nilgun Seremet0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

In the field of nutrition, the concept of food literacy is emerging. Food literacy is the interrelated combination of knowledge, skills and self-efficacy on food planning, selecting foods, food preparation, eating and evaluating information about food with the ultimate goal of developing a lifelong healthy, sustainable and gastronomic relationship with food. The present study describes the systematic development of a food literacy intervention for couples trying to conceive. The development of the food literacy intervention was guided by Intervention Mapping, a protocol for developing theory- and evidence-based health promotion interventions in combination with consulting stakeholders. Decisions during intervention development were based on literature, an observational study evaluating the diet of couples trying to conceive using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and semi-structured interviews and user tests with experts in the field and couples trying to conceive. An innovative intervention to influence preconception diet and food literacy based on stakeholders opinion, effective behavior change strategies and attractive intervention channels was developed. Regarding needs assessment, the observational study showed that the diet of couples trying to conceive (n = 57) was inadequate (i.e. lack of vegetable intake) and highly correlated between partners. Objectives regarding food literacy were determined by participating experts (n = 12) rating ‘making healthy food choices’ as most important objective. A blended format (i.e. a mobile application in combination with telephone interaction with a health care professional) was selected as intervention channel based on semi-structured interviews with people trying to conceive (n = 17) as they highlighted the importance of support by experts and a time efficient intervention. Knowledge and self-efficacy regarding food literacy were selected as determinants to address. The main behavioral change strategies included in the intervention were tailoring, goal setting and motivational interviewing resulting in tailored goals, tips about food literacy and recipes. Experts (n = 15) and couples trying to conceive (n = 8) evaluated the intervention as easy to use. This intervention will be evaluated on reproductive and dietary outcomes via a randomized controlled trial in Belgian Fertility clinics among 460 couples trying to conceive. If this theory- and evidence based food literacy intervention proves to be effective on reproductive and dietary outcomes in couples trying to conceive, it will offer vision and practical tools for implementing food literacy interventions in preconception care.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3afood frequency questionnaires 3agastronomy 3ahealth care workers 3ahealthy diet 3aliteracy 3aobservational studies 3arandomized clinical trials 3aself-efficacy 3astakeholders 3atelephones 3avegetable consumption 3avision1 aVoorend, Roos1 aDerboven, Jan1 aDancet, Eline1 aSpiessens, Carl1 aMatthys, Christophe0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

To determine the optimum operational parameters for biomass pyrolytic polygeneration while using bamboo waste as the feedstock, the product characteristics were investigated over a temperature range of 250 to 950 °C. Meanwhile, details of the evolution of the char structure were analyzed to reveal the pyrolysis mechanism. Results showed that to increase the yield of char, the operational temperature should be at 350 °C; however, at this temperature, no inner pores were formed and a low quality char product was produced. Thus, the optimum operating temperature recommended for biomass pyrolytic polygeneration of bamboo waste was set to 550 °C. At the optimum temperature, the surface area of the char was 200 m²/g, the calorific value of gas was 14 MJ/m³, and the concentration of phenols in liquid reached the maximum level. A pyrolysis mechanism based on the evolution of the char structure was proposed. First, the ordered organic macrostructure in raw biomass was converted to a network-like structure consisting of a “3D network of benzene rings” during the “initial decomposition stage (<450°C)”, and this was followed by the “first reconstruction stage (450–550°C)” whereby the initial 3D network was converted to a “2D structure of fused rings”. Subsequently, with further increases in temperature, a “graphite microcrystalline structure” was formed during the “second condensation stage (>550°C)”. The results of this study are expected to be beneficial for the comprehensive utilization of bamboo waste and provide new insight into the pyrolysis mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3abenzene 3abiomass 3acarbonization 3afeedstocks 3agases 3agasification 3agraphene 3aindustrial wastes 3aphenols 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aHuan, Baojun1 aChen, Yingquan1 aGao, Ying1 aLi, Jian1 aChen, Hanping0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Aug. 18, v. 30, no. 8 p.6430-6439dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b007323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245019500168300001800363520154300381592002801924650004401952650001901996650002302015650001102038650002502049650002302074650001702097650002202114650001502136650001702151650004402168650002002212700001802232700002002250700001202270773010402282856008902386852000902475655001202484IND60539955520221121123359.0160818e20160818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053995552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b007702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qing10aChemical Composition and Structural Characteristics of Oil Shales and Their Kerogens Using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy and Solid-State 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)  ap. 6271-6280.  aThe chemical composition and chemical structure of selected oil shales and the kerogens isolated from them were studied by solid-state ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with curve-fitting analysis, and the changes during the removal of the inorganic matrix were also investigated. The ¹³C NMR results indicate that the oil shales and kerogens are mainly composed of aliphatic carbon (≥55%). FTIR analysis indicates that aliphatic hydrocarbons mainly contain the methylene group, mostly forming long straight chains and a small amount of branched chains, and the hydroxy groups mainly contain OH–OH and OH–O bonds (≥65%). Both the ¹³C NMR and FTIR analyses show that the acid treatment improved the hydrocarbon-generating ability in kerogen. Furthermore, the curve-fitting analysis indicates that the HCl and HF treatments slightly affected the aliphatic and hydroxyl structures, but significantly affected the oxygen-containing and aromatic structures in the oil shales. The oxygen-containing groups in the oil shales are mainly the C–OH group, followed by the C–O, OC–O, and CO groups, in descending order. After the acid treatment, the main oxygen-containing groups were the C–OH and C–O groups, because of the hydrolysis, substitution, and ion exchange. The ¹³C NMR results indicate that the acid treatment not only decreased the extent of aromatic ring condensation (fused aromatic rings), but also decreased the number of condensed aromatic rings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacid treatment 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrolysis 3aion exchange 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes1 aYe, Jiang-bin1 aYang, Hong-yang1 aLiu, Qi0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Aug. 18, v. 30, no. 8 p.6271-6280dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b007703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03700naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003800150245014800188300001400336520223700350592002802587650001202615650001802627650003102645650001102676650001202687650001602699650001602715650002202731650002002753650002502773651002202798651001002820653002902830653002202859653002702881653002702908653002602935653003502961700002602996700002403022773010203046856008503148852000903233655001203242IND60654343420221120192508.0190830e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065434342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sedgeo.2019.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Rivarés, Francisco Javier10aPeriodicity in stromatolitic lamination: A potential record of ENSO, NAO, and SUNSPOT in the Miocene lacustrine record of the Ebro Basin, Spain  ap. 83-99.  aThe spectral decomposition of time series obtained from ancient rock records can be used to study the similarity between the dynamics of present-day and past climate systems. A high-resolution periodicity analysis of luminance and lamina thickness of lacustrine stromatolites in the Ebro Basin (northeast of Iberian Peninsula) reveals a significant signal of interannual and decadal climatic variability in the Miocene. This is one out of very few works that presents the use of spectral analysis to estimate the potential of stromatolite lamination as multiple-scale recorders of climate parameters. The effects of precipitation and evaporation variations on stromatolite lamination have been detected at three orders of cyclicity based on textural and high-resolution stable-isotope analyses (C and O) obtained in prior studies. These analyses also revealed that the light and dark simple lamina couplets are identified with annual cycles (third-order isotopic cycles). In the present study, the spectral analysis results obtained through different paths in five stromatolite specimens reveal significant periods in the power spectrum at around 2.5, 3.7, 5, 7, 10, and 22 years. These cycles can be correlated with the typical oscillation bands of different climate-related agents. The 2.5-year period corresponds to the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO), or to the biennial component of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), or to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The 3 to 5 and 5 to 7-year bands can be linked to ENSO or NAO variability (second-order isotopic cycles). The 8 to 11-year bands fit the 11-year Schwabe (first-order isotopic cycles) and 22 to 23-year fit the 22-year Hale sunspot cycles. Thus, the stromatolite growth was controlled by ENSO, NAO, and solar activity cycles. The close relationship between these climate-related agents makes it difficult to specify the dominant agent controlling the stromatolite growth. Nevertheless, the significant periods obtained from this study, within interannual (2.5, 3.7, 5, 7 years), decadal (10, 22 years), and even multidecadal bands (37–42 years), support the existence, and concurrence, of ENSO and NAO precursors during the early and middle Miocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3aMiocene epoch 3aNorth Atlantic Oscillation 3abasins 3aclimate 3aevaporation 3aperiodicity 3aspectral analysis 3astable isotopes 3atime series analysis 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0aLacustrine stromatolites 0aSaline carbonates 0aAnnual lamina couplets 0aLamination periodicity 0aQuasi-periodic cycles 0aSolar and calendar frequencies1 aMartin-Bello, Leticia1 aArenas-Abad, Concha0 tSedimentary geology.g2019 July 15, v. 390 p.83-99dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2019.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011700167500001900284520201700303592002802320650004302348650001002391650001902401650001602420650002102436650002002457650001902477650001502496650002402511650001702535651001502552700002702567700001702594700002302611700002002634773013602654856008102790852000902871655001202880IND60698198920221118193127.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069819892DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200039362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Niamh M.10aDelayed onset of lactogenesis and reduced breastfeeding frequency in mothers who give birth by caesarean section  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLactogenesis stage II, also known as when a mother's milk “comes in”, is characterised by copious milk production. Delayed lactogenesis II, when onset occurs after 72 hours post-partum, has been linked to early breastfeeding cessation. It has been suggested that caesarean section is a risk factor for late onset of lactogenesis II. It is unknown why lactogenesis II may be delayed in caesarean section but there are several potential reasons such as volume of blood loss, maternal stress, delayed breastfeeding initiation and difficulties with mobility and positioning. Analysis of timing of lactogenesis and breastfeeding frequency was carried out on data from the PROMESA and IMPRINT studies, which were looking at the supplementation of breast milk with a probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis. IMPRINT was carried out in California and enrolled eighty women prior to birth or before postnatal day 4. The PROMESA study in the UK only recruited women who were booked for elective caesarean sections, and also enrolled eighty mother-baby dyads. As part of both studies mothers filled out a variety of surveys and daily logs, including a daily feeding log, along with self-reported lactogenesis. Using logistic regression, we looked at whether mode of birth (spontaneous vaginal delivery, emergency and elective caesarean section) was associated with the timing of onset of lactogenesis, and linear regression to look at the difference in breastfeeding frequency between modes of birth. Mode of birth was significantly associated with delayed onset of lactogenesis > 3 days (OR 3.38, 95% CI 2.48–4.61). There was also a reduced frequency of breastfeeding in the first week post-partum in mother-baby dyads who underwent an elective caesarean section. These findings suggest that mothers who give birth by elective caesarean section may need additional support with breastfeeding in the early days post-partum, as well as ongoing support long-term to reduce the likelihood of early cessation of breastfeeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis 3ablood 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3acesarean section 3amilk production 3amilk synthesis 3aprobiotics 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aCalifornia1 aSmilowitz, Jennifer T.1 aCagney, Orla1 aFlannery, Robin L.1 aTribe, Rachel M0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

A facile, low cost and highly efficient single-cell introduction system of time-resolved ICP-MS consists of a flow cell, a visual contrast calibration device, a customized nebulizer and a fabricated spray chamber. The flow cell includes a cell sample tube, a sheath liquid tube and a flow chamber. The visual contrast calibration device was composed of a microscope with a 16 × microscope objective (160 × total magnification). The flow chamber was used to combine a flow of red blood cell suspension (0.800 μL/min) and a flow of PBS (4.40 μL/min) into the nebulizer. The intact cells were directly introduced with the single-cell introduction system into the plasma via nebulizing, and then ion plumes corresponding to single cells were individually detected with mass spectrometer. The frequency of the spikes directly reflects the number of cells, and the intensity of spikes is proportional to the concentration of copper within one cell. The single-cell introduction system can be transported into the ICP-MS via a customized transport system with 100% efficiency. A high cell introduction efficiency into the plasma supports for a reduction of cell consumption. The Cu signal frequency was about 120 cell events per minute. This single-cell introduction system simplifies the introduction of individual and intact cells. The copper content in single red blood cell was 0.20–0.40 fg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aatomization 3acopper 3aerythrocytes 3ahumans 3aliquids 3aspectrometers 0aSingle cell analysis 0aIntroduction system 0aICP-MS 0aHuman red blood cell1 aFeng, Jinsu1 aTang, Lifu1 aYu, Chunhe1 aMo, Guichun1 aDeng, Biyang0 tTalanta.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 206 p.120174-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1201743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008500169500001900254520218200273592002802455650002002483650001402503650002302517650001802540650001502558650001602573650001102589650002502600650001202625650001602637650002202653650000902675650001902684700002302703700003002726700002002756773013602776856008102912852000902993655001203002IND60698200520221120065933.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069820052DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200040972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorquati, Luciana10aEnergy balance and occupational activity as predictors of obesity risk in women.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReduced occupational energy expenditure and increased energy intake are important contributors to the increasing prevalence of obesity. The aim of this study was to examine whether sedentary occupations, and specific indicators of energy intake and expenditure are associated with obesity risk in Australian women. Data were from 3,444 participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, who reported their weight, dietary intake, physical activity and occupation in 2009 (at age 31–36), and weight in 2012. Participants were categorised as having a ‘less sedentary’ or ‘sedentary work’, based on occupation and activity patterns at work. Multivariate models were conducted to examine the odds of being obese (> 30 body-mass index) and risk of obesity in the two occupational groups based on energy balance factors (diet and physical activity). Models were adjusted for major confounders (smoking, education, income, number of children).There was no significant difference in the prevalence of obesity between groups (20.3% less sedentary vs 22.7% sedentary work, p = 0.11) at baseline. Being in the highest total energy intake tertile, saturated fat intake > 35g/d and drinking 3 or more sugar-sweetened beverages per week increased the odds of being obese in both groups. But to a higher extent in ‘less sedentary work’ (OR 2.11 95%CI 1.41–3.19; OR 3.04 95%CI 2.09–4.45; 2.07 95%CI 1.45–2.97, respectively). High physical activity (> 1000MET.min/week) was consistently associated with lower odds of being obese (OR 0.64 95%CI 0.43–0.97 ‘less sedentary’; OR 0.58 95%CI 0.36–0.93 ‘sedentary work’) but lower incidence of obesity only in ‘less sedentary work’ group (IRR 0.52 95%CI 0.30–0.88, absolute risk 14%). High sugar-sweetened beverages increased the incidence of obesity only in this group (IRR 1.72 95%CI 1.08–2.73, absolute risk 23%). Having a sedentary work per se did not play a major role in obesity prevalence and risk in women. Instead, high saturated fat and SSB intake, and physical inactivity remained the major contributors to obesity prevalence and risk, particularly for those in less sedentary jobs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3aeducation 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy intake 3afat intake 3afood intake 3aincome 3alongitudinal studies 3aobesity 3aoccupations 3aphysical activity 3arisk 3asaturated fats1 aMielke, Gregore I.1 aKolbe-Alexander, Tracy L.1 aBrown, Wendy J.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

We established at an ecological level the relationship between FI and the incidence rate of colorectal cancer x 100.000 inhabitants (CRACI). An ecological study was carried out with information that measured the level of human, social and economic development in the territory of the 33 geodemographic units that make up Colombia. Using multiple linear regression with the CRACI as the dependent variable, the FI as the main explanatory and other variables of the context, we established the relationship between FI and the CRACI and predictive equations of the CRACI by sex. The goodness of fit in the models was the coefficient of determination (R²) and the Bland and Almant method. The FI is related in an inverse manner, and the human development Index (HDI) is directly related to the CRACI. Two equations predict the CRACI with high precision; In men, [CRACI = -6.38 + -0.25 * FI + 35.5 * HDI]. In Women, [CRACI = 6.47 + -0.23 * FI + 19.1 * HDI]. The coefficient of determination R² (%) in men is 88 and in women 72. The average difference between CRACI observed versus the estimated, was -0.00 in men (95% CI: -3.13 to 3.13), and in women of -0.00 (95% CI: -4.08 to 4.08). We establish that in Colombia, FI is significantly and inversely associated with the CRACI and that it is possible to predict the CRACI at an ecological level with a high degree of precision using two variables that are calculated on a regular basis by Colombian state agencies—FI and the HDI. FI has previously been identified as a risk factor in the development and treatment of patients with cancer since the associated economic incapacity reduces adherence to treatment and promotes a limited biological response, explained by a limited and poor-quality diet that exposes these patients to greater levels of infection and relapse. A possible explanation for this is that as greater social and economic development is achieved in the territory, decreasing FI, the diet transitions toward greater consumption of proteins of animal origin, which in turn favours the development of mediators of chronic diseases, such as obesity, hypertension, and cancer. This change is part of the phenomena called nutritional transition and food transition. The equations presented here constitute a cost-effective method for estimating CRACI in Colombia.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic diseases 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acost effectiveness 3adiet 3aecological studies 3aeconomic development 3afood security 3ahuman development 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3arelapse 3arisk factors 3aColombia1 aSalazar, Diana Cecilia Álvarez1 aFuentes-Sandoval, Carlos0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Simply measuring the height of the crude oil in a capillary at several pressures from ambient to near the MMP pressure and extrapolating the oil height versus pressure plot to zero oil height yields the MMP without the need of the additional instrumentation and labor required to perform actual IFT measurements. A total of 2–4 MMP values can be determined per day with only one experimental apparatus, and the method greatly reduces the initial cost and complexity of the required instrumentation. The use of three capillaries having different inner diameters allows for triplicate determinations of MMP from each experiment. Because the actual MMP pressure need not be reached during the experiment, MMP values that exceed the pressure ratings of the equipment can be reasonably estimated (e.g., MMPs using pure nitrogen). The method was used to determine the MMP pressure for crude oil samples from a conventional Muddy Formation reservoir in the Powder River Basin [American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity of 35.8°] and an unconventional Bakken Formation reservoir in the Williston Basin (API gravity of 38.7°). The method is reproducible [typically <4% relative standard deviation (RSD)], and the method gave good agreement for a “live” Bakken oil with the results from a slim tube test of a commercial laboratory. Approximately 80 MMP values were measured using pure CO₂, methane, and ethane as well as 0–100% mole ratios of methane/CO₂ and methane/ethane. For both oil samples, ethane MMPs were ca. one-half those with CO₂, while methane MMPs were ca. double or triple those with CO₂. MMPs with mixed methane/CO₂ showed a linear increase with mole percent methane for both crude oils, while both oils showed an exponential increase in MMP with mole percent methane in ethane, with a little increase in MMP until ca. 20 mol % methane in ethane.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarbon dioxide 3aequipment 3aethane 3agravity 3ainstrumentation 3amethane 3anitrogen 3aoils 3apetroleum 3arivers 3astatistical analysis 3asurface tension 3awatersheds1 aMiller, David J.1 aJin, Lu1 aGorecki, Charles D.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Aug. 18, v. 30, no. 8 p.6365-6372dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b011513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012800167300001800295520102900313592002801342650000801370650001501378650000901393650001401402651001001416651001201426700001601438700001201454700001901466700001101485700001501496700001501511773010401526856008901630852000901719655001201728IND60539958620221120022533.0160818e20160818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053995862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b011782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jili10aCalculation of the Heat and Material Balance for Myanmar Oil Shale Processing by Sanjiang Gas Combustion Rectangular Retort  ap. 6373-6380.  aIn this paper, with 1000 kg of oil shale for research, the heat and material balance of Myanmar oil shale processing by Sanjiang gas combustion rectangular retort (SJ-retort) was calculated. The results show that the heat requirement of Myanmar oil shale retorting can be satisfied by its high-calorie retorting gas combustion as well as the heat release from the retorting process. In the study, 33.26% surplus retorting gas is obtained, which indicates that the Myanmar oil shale processing by SJ-retort is theoretically feasible. In addition, a concise and accurate method is proposed to calculate the gas balance of the retorting process, which can calculate the dynamic equilibrium value of various types of gases (total input and output gases, recycle gases, and the new air that enters the retort) when the retorting system reaches a steady state. This method was validated with the successful operation of a pilot-scale test for oil shale retorting in Shenmu of Shanxi province and Yaojie of Gansu province in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acombustion 3aheat 3aoil shale 3aChina 3aMyanmar1 aLi, Shuyuan1 aMa, Yue1 aGeng, Cengceng1 aHe, Lu1 aZhu, Yukai1 aZhang, Lei0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Aug. 18, v. 30, no. 8 p.6373-6380dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b011783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02501naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245007700170300001800247520137200265592002801637650001801665650001901683650001501702650001901717650001301736650001301749650001601762650003701778700001801815700001401833700001701847700001701864700001601881700001601897773010401913856008902017852000902106655001202115IND60539958720221120022702.0160818e20160818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053995872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b011852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yingchao10aHigh Temperature CO2 Capture on Novel Yb2O3-Supported CaO-Based Sorbents  ap. 6606-6613.  aIncorporation of CaO in inert solid support has been identified as an effective approach to improve the cyclic CO₂ capture performance for CaO-based sorbents. In this work, Yb₂O₃-supported CaO-based sorbents were fabricated via the wet-mixing technique. Elemental dispersion observed by FSEM-EDS showed that the ultrafine active species of CaO particles was finely separated by Yb₂O₃. Different amounts of Yb₂O₃ were introduced and 10−15 wt% was found to be the optimal content range for the support to function as the metal skeleton. In comparison with pure CaO, the improved CO₂ capture performance was observed for CaYb10 over prolonged carbonation-calcination cycles under a severe test condition. This improvement could be ascribed to the enriched macropores within 50–100 nm, which was identified by the N₂ adsorption–desorption analysis. In addition, the microstructure of the synthetic sorbent (analyzed through TEM images) indicated that CaO particles of ∼160 nm were formed with the Yb₂O₃ nanocrystallines (∼15–25 nm) adhered to the surface functioning as physical barriers and as a result, the sintering was effectively retarded. Generally, the enhanced cyclic CO₂ capture performance and the promoted sintering-resistant property of Yb₂O₃-supported CaO-based sorbents made Yb₂O₃ a promising inert solid support.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3amacropores 3amicrostructure 3anitrogen 3asorbents 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLiu, Wenqiang1 aSun, Jian1 aYang, Xinwei1 aZhou, Zijian1 aZhang, Yang1 aXu, Minghou0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Aug. 18, v. 30, no. 8 p.6606-6613dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b011853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01183naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011600166300001600282520031400298592002800612650001900640650001400659650001600673651001100689700002000700700002200720773009400742856004800836852000900884655001200893IND50065450520221119202306.0130423e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006545052DNAL7 a10.1134/S00138738130201392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaslova, O.

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that CO₂ can be effectively reduced by alkali metal hydrides (LiH or NaH) to produce CH₄ and H₂ fuels concurrently by virtue of heat treatment at moderate temperatures. The yield and mole percent of methane in the gas products for both reaction systems depended upon the reaction temperature and time, and optimal performance was obtained at approximately 450 °C within 48 h. The analysis of the mechanism indicated that amorphous carbon, as an intermediate, plays an important role in the process of CO₂-to-CH₄ conversion. Alkali metal hydride–CO₂ systems are promising reaction systems for the storage and in situ preparation of H₂–CH₄ mixture fuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3aheat treatment 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3atemperature1 aWang, Long-Zheng1 aSong, Liang1 aZhao, Juan1 aTeng, Yun-Lei0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2016 Aug. 18, v. 30, no. 8 p.6620-6625dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b013533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013000167520088000297592002801177650001401205650002801219650002401247650002101271650001201292650002901304650001701333650001601350650001101366650001301377650001901390650002201409650000901431653001401440653001501454653001801469653001701487653003601504700001801540700001901558700001601577700001801593700006001611700002501671700001901696700005501715773011001770856008501880852000901965655001201974IND60654347920221120192629.0210729e20190822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065434792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2019.1509742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Suk Hun10aLewis acid-mediated cross-coupling reaction of 7-azaindoles and aldehydes: Cytotoxic evaluation of C3-linked bis-7-azaindoles  aThe synthesis of 3,3′-bis-7-indolylmethane derivatives is important for their further development as pharmaceutical compounds and other synthetic purposes.

Ideally, these products contribute to an intake of 1.2 grams of protein per kg bodyweight per day (g/kg BW/d) and ≥ 25 grams of protein per main meal. This study evaluated the effectiveness of these products on protein intake and explored the acceptance of these products. The study was a single-blind RCT with CD older adults switching from self-prepared to commercially-available home-delivered hot meals and dairy products during 28 days. The intervention group (I) received meals and dairy products high in (≥ 20EN%) protein; the control group (C) received standard meals and dairy products low(er) in protein. Dietary intake was measured at baseline, two weeks (T1) and four weeks (T2) by a three-day food diary. After study completion, 25 participants (aged > 80y, 16 female/9 male) participated in focus groups discussing information on healthy eating, attitude towards high protein products, product acceptance. Ninety-eight CD older adults (mean age: 80.4 years ± 6.8). Baseline protein intake was 1.09 (SE 0.05) (I) and 0.99 (SE 0.05) (C) g/kg BW/d. During the trial, protein intake of I remained stable at 1.12 g/kg BW/d (SE 0.05) while intake decreased in C to 0.87 (SE 0.03). More I participants reached the threshold of ≥ 25 grams protein at dinner compared to C but not at breakfast and lunch. In the focus groups, participants indicated to be aware of the importance of healthy eating (less salt and less fat). However, knowledge on high-protein products was low and participants did not know why intake of protein should be increased. Less social interaction was indicated as one of the main causes of deterioration of eating behaviour. Further, participants indicated that they primarily would like to enjoy eating instead of focusing on functionality. The ready-made meals were generally considered to be too large and low in vegetables. Switching from self-prepared meals to ready-made meals carries the risk of a decreasing protein intake in CD older adults. To stimulate a healthy dietary pattern, focus should be on behavioural change and knowledge improvement. Besides awareness for healthy eating, food enjoyment is essential. Finally, meal composition could be improved to enhance acceptance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3abody weight 3abreakfast 3adinner 3afood intake 3afood records 3alunch 3amales 3aprotein intake 3arisk 3asocial behavior1 aBeelen, Janne1 aBorkent, Jos1 ade van der Schueren, Marian A.

For surface-adsorbed π bowls, however, only conformations with the bowl opening pointing away from the surface have been observed so far. Here we show for sumanene on Ag(111) that both bowl-up and bowl-down conformations can be stabilized. Analysis of the molecular layer as a function of coverage reveals an unprecedented structural phase transition involving a bowl inversion of one-third of the molecules. On the basis of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and complementary atomistic simulations, we develop a model that describes the observed phase transition in terms of a subtle interplay between inversion-dependent adsorption energies and intermolecular interactions.

The aim of this study was thus to analyze whether folate intake is associated with body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and liver status. 409 subjects aged 20–40 were enrolled in Poznań, Poland from 2016 to 2018. Food intake was assessed using three-day food records. Folate intake was calculated based on food composition tables using the Diet 5.0 program (National Food and Nutrition Institute, Poland). Weight to 0.1 kg and height to 0.01 m were measured using an electronic scale and a stadiometer, respectively. BMI was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Fat mass and lean body mass were determined using whole-body air-displacement plethysmography (BodPod, Cosmed, Italy). Genotyping of rs1801133 (MTHFR) was performed with TaqMan probes. The following biomarkers of liver steatosis were calculated: NAFLD liver fat score (NAFLD-LFS), fatty liver index (FLI), and hepatic steatosis index (HSI). To analyze the associations between folate intake and the measured parameters, we used multiple regression with adjustments for age, sex, and energy intake. The mean body weight was 78.57 ± 18.14 kg, BMI 25.96 ± 5.28 kg/m2, and fat percentage 29.20% ± 10.78%. The median folate intake was 299.3 μg/day. Dietary folate intake was negatively associated with body weight, BMI, and body fat percentage (p < 0.05 for all associations). Folate intake was also associated with fatty liver indices—namely HSI (p < 0.05) and FLI (p < 0.05). There was no association between folate intake and NAFLD-LFS. MTHFR rs1801133 polymorphism was not associated with any of the measured parameters. Our findings suggest that folate intake may affect body weight and composition, as well as liver status. Higher folate intake could have a protective effect against obesity, but further studies are necessary to investigate the mechanism. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.

Three steroidogenic enzymes including P450arom (n = 125), 3β-HSD1 (n = 123), and 17β-HSD1 (n = 116) were measured in 125 placental tissue samples. Linear regression tested the associations between cord blood PFASs and reproductive hormones in cord blood. Mediation analysis assessed the role of placental steroidogenic enzymes between cord blood PFASs and reproductive hormones.The positive associations between PFOA, PFHxS and E2 levels, PFOS, PFUA, PFNA and T levels, and PFOS, PFUA and T/E2 ratio were significant. PFUA, PFNA, PFDA, PFHxS, and ∑PFASs were associated with higher P450arom levels. PFHxS was also associated with increased 3β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD1 levels. These associations were more pronounced in females than males when stratified by gender. Furthermore, 17β-HSD1 demonstrated mediating effects in the positive association between cord blood PFHxS and E2 levels in females.Our findings suggested the potential impacts of cord blood PFASs on fetal reproductive hormones, in which steroidogenic enzymes may play important roles. These associations were more pronounced in females than males.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal tissues 3ablood serum 3aenzymes 3aestradiol 3afemales 3amales 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aplacenta 3aregression analysis 3atestosterone 3aChina 0aPFASs 0aPFOS 0aPFOA 0aPFNA 0aPFDA 0aPFUA 0aPFHxS 0aPFBS 0aPFDoA 0aPFOSA 0aPFHpA 0aE2 0aT 0aP450arom, CYP19A1 0a3β-HSD1 0a17β-HSD1 0aCI 0aDR 0aLOD 0aLLOQ 0aEDCs 0aDE 0aIE 0aTE 0aDHEAS 0aDHEA 0aPBS 0aRSD 0aHIV 0aAIDS 0aSD 0aGLM 0aBH procedure 0aFDR 0aBMI 0aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 0aReproductive hormones 0aSteroidogenic enzymes1 aShi, Rong1 aWang, Caifeng1 aHan, Wenchao1 aGao, Yu1 aZhang, Yan1 aZhou, Yijun1 aDing, Guodong1 aTian, Ying0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Aug., v. 129 p.573-582dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007500168300001400243520175900257592002802016650001502044650001702059650001402076650001102090650001502101650001602116650001402132650001002146700002702156773008602183856008302269852000902352655001202361IND60096074220221119013201.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.06.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarp, Dylan R.13aAn agent-based approach to global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis  ap. 19-27.  aA novel sampling approach to global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of modeling results utilizing concepts from agent-based modeling is presented (Agent-Based Analysis of Global Uncertainty and Sensitivity (ABAGUS)). A plausible model parameter space is discretized and sampled by a particle swarm where the particle locations represent unique model parameter sets. Particle locations are optimized based on a model-performance metric using a standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Locations producing a performance metric below a specified threshold are collected. In subsequent visits to the location, a modified value of the performance metric, proportionally increased above the acceptable threshold (i.e., convexities in the response surface become concavities), is provided to the PSO algorithm. As a result, the methodology promotes a global exploration of a plausible parameter space, and discourages, but does not prevent, reinvestigation of previously explored regions. This effectively alters the strategy of the PSO algorithm from optimization to a sampling approach providing global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. The viability of the approach is demonstrated on 2D Griewank and Rosenbrock functions. This also demonstrates the set-based approach of ABAGUS as opposed to distribution-based approaches. The practical application of the approach is demonstrated on a 3D synthetic contaminant transport case study. The evaluation of global parametric uncertainty using ABAGUS is demonstrated on model parameters defining the source location and transverse/longitudinal dispersivities. The evaluation of predictive uncertainties using ABAGUS is demonstrated for contaminant concentrations at proposed monitoring wells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3acomputers 3amodels 3amonitoring 3auncertainty 3aviability 3awells1 aVesselinov, Velimir V.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Mar., v. 40 p.19-27dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016600168520151200334592002801846650000801874650002001882650001501902650001501917650002501932650003501957650002801992650001602020650001002036650001202046650002002058650001102078650002202089650002502111650002302136650004302159650000902202650000902211650002202220650002402242650003202266653000902298653001002307653002602317653001102343653000902354700002002363700001802383700001702401700002102418700002402439700001702463700001702480773010602497856008502603852000902688655001202697IND60646129220221122042721.0190613e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064612922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubi, John A.10aEffects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the differentiation of embryonic stem cells towards pancreatic lineage and pancreatic beta cell function  aAnimal and epidemiological studies demonstrated association of persistent exposure of TCDD, an endocrine disrupting chemical, to susceptibility of type 2 diabetes (T2D). High doses of TCDD were commonly employed in experimental animals to illustrate its diabetogenic effects. Data linking the epigenetic effects of low doses of TCDD on embryonic cells to T2D susceptibility risks is very limited. To address whether low dose exposure to TCDD would affect pancreatic development, hESCs pretreated with TCDD at concentrations similar to human exposure were differentiated towards pancreatic lineage cells, and their global DNA methylation patterns were determined. Our results showed that TCDD-treated hESCs had impaired pancreatic lineage differentiation potentials and altered global DNA methylation patterns. Four of the hypermethylated genes (PRKAG1, CAPN10, HNF-1B and MAFA) were validated by DNA bisulfite sequencing. PRKAG1, a regulator in the AMPK signaling pathway critical for insulin secretion, was selected for further functional study in the rat insulinoma cell line, INS-1E cells. TCDD treatment induced PRKAG1 hypermethylation in hESCs, and the hypermethylation was maintained after pancreatic progenitor cells differentiation. Transient Prkag1 knockdown in the INS-1E cells elevated glucose stimulated insulin secretions (GSIS), possibly through mTOR signaling pathway. The current study suggested that early embryonic exposure to TCDD might alter pancreatogenesis, increasing the risk of T2D.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3abisulfites 3acell lines 3aembryonic stem cells 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aepidemiological studies 3aepigenetics 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3ahumans 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3alaboratory animals 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3arats 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin 0aTCDD 0ahESCs 0aType 2 diabetes (T2D) 0aPRKAG1 0aGSIS1 aChen, Andy C.H.1 aFong, Sze Wan1 aLai, Keng Po1 aWong, Chris K.C.1 aYeung, William S.B.1 aLee, Kai Fai1 aLee, Yin Lau0 tEnvironment international.g2019 Sept., v. 130 p.104885-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245006900166300001400235520163900249592002801888650001501916650001701931650001401948650001901962650002001981650001602001700001502017700001902032773008602051856008302137852000902220655001202229IND60096074720221119013133.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComunian, A.10a3D multiple-point statistics simulation using 2D training images  ap. 49-65.  aOne of the main issues in the application of multiple-point statistics (MPS) to the simulation of three-dimensional (3D) blocks is the lack of a suitable 3D training image. In this work, we compare three methods of overcoming this issue using information coming from bidimensional (2D) training images. One approach is based on the aggregation of probabilities. The other approaches are novel. One relies on merging the lists obtained using the impala algorithm from diverse 2D training images, creating a list of compatible data events that is then used for the MPS simulation. The other (s2Dcd) is based on sequential simulations of 2D slices constrained by the conditioning data computed at the previous simulation steps. These three methods are tested on the reproduction of two 3D images that are used as references, and on a real case study where two training images of sedimentary structures are considered. The tests show that it is possible to obtain 3D MPS simulations with at least two 2D training images. The simulations obtained, in particular those obtained with the s2Dcd method, are close to the references, according to a number of comparison criteria. The CPU time required to simulate with the method s2Dcd is from two to four orders of magnitude smaller than the one required by a MPS simulation performed using a 3D training image, while the results obtained are comparable. This computational efficiency and the possibility of using MPS for 3D simulation without the need for a 3D training image facilitates the inclusion of MPS in Monte Carlo, uncertainty evaluation, and stochastic inverse problems frameworks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3acomputers 3adigital images 3areproducibility 3auncertainty1 aRenard, P.1 aStraubhaar, J.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Mar., v. 40 p.49-65dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013800166300001600304520145400320592002801774650001401802650002601816650001101842650001201853700003101865700001801896700002701914773008801941856008302029852000902112655001202121IND60096075220221119013618.0141104e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaogang10aOntology-aided annotation, visualization, and generalization of geological time-scale information from online geological map services  ap. 107-119.  aGeological maps are increasingly published and shared online, whereas tools and services supporting information retrieval and knowledge discovery are underdeveloped. In this study, we developed an ontology of geological time scale by using a Resource Description Framework model to represent the ordinal hierarchical structure of the geological time scale and to encode collected annotations of geological time scale concepts. We also developed an animated graphical view of the developed ontology, and functions for interactions between the ontology, the animation and online geological maps published as layers of OGC Web Map Service. The featured functions include automatic annotations for geological time concepts recognized from a geological map, changing layouts in the animation to highlight a concept, showing legends of geological time contents in an online map with the animation, and filtering out and generalizing geological time features in an online map by operating the map legend shown in the animation. We set up a pilot system and carried out a user survey to test and evaluate the usability and usefulness of the developed ontology, animation and interactive functions. Results of the pilot system and the user survey demonstrate that our works enhance features of online geological map services and they are helpful for users to understand and to explore geological time contents and features, respectively, of a geological map.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3ainformation retrieval 3amodels 3asurveys1 aCarranza, Emmanuel John M.1 aWu, Chonglong1 avan der Meer, Freek D.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Mar., v. 40 p.107-119dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010100167300001600268520132500284592002801609650001401637650001401651650001801665700002101683700001701704773008801721856008301809852000901892655001201901IND60096076020221119013246.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRzhanov, Yuri10aConstruction of seafloor thematic maps from multibeam acoustic backscatter angular response data  ap. 181-187.  aAn automatic approach for delineation of areas representing different acoustic facies is presented. A backscatter mosaic (a gray-scale image) is oversegmented, honoring all possible boundaries, both real and false (acquisition and construction artifacts), in order to separate relatively homogeneous and contiguous groups of pixels of the mosaic, which are called segments. The size of the segments is chosen such that each one is considered to represent a single acoustic facies. These segments are then joined together to end up with a predefined number of “acoustic themes,” in a process called coalescence. The difference between “facies” and “theme” is that the former represents an abstract type of seafloor, and the latter, an area (or areas) selected manually or automatically with common seafloor properties. Ideally, one theme would correspond to a single facies. Themes that are used for assignment to segments are chosen prior to coalescence, either manually or by one of the three automatic methods proposed in the paper. The process of coalescence of segments is based on all acoustic data associated with each segment (not just data used for mosaic construction), their proximity and shape. Results of segmentation are unbiased but depend on a specific goal that the user is trying to achieve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3acomputers 3athematic maps1 aFonseca, Luciano1 aMayer, Larry0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Apr., v. 41 p.181-187dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002900149245011700178300001600295520147400311592002801785650002201813650001401835650002001849650002101869650003501890650001301925650001501938650001701953651001201970700002401982700001902006773008802025856008302113852000902196655001202205IND60096076220221119012909.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJackson, Chester W., Jr.10aApplication of the AMBUR R package for spatio-temporal analysis of shoreline change: Jekyll Island, Georgia, USA  ap. 199-207.  aThe AMBUR (Analyzing Moving Boundaries Using R) package for the R software environment provides a collection of functions for assisting with analyzing and visualizing historical shoreline change. The package allows import and export of geospatial data in ESRI shapefile format, which is compatible with most commercial and open-source GIS software. The “baseline and transect” method is the primary technique used to quantify distances and rates of shoreline movement, and to detect classification changes across time. Along with the traditional “perpendicular” transect method, two new transect methods, “near” and “filtered,” assist with quantifying changes along curved shorelines that are problematic for perpendicular transect methods. Output from the analyses includes data tables, graphics, and geospatial data, which are useful in rapidly assessing trends and potential errors in the dataset. A forecasting function also allows the user to estimate the future location of the shoreline and store the results in a shapefile. Other utilities and tools provided in the package assist with preparing and manipulating geospatial data, error checking, and generating supporting graphics and shapefiles. The package can be customized to perform additional statistical, graphical, and geospatial functions, and, it is capable of analyzing the movement of any boundary (e.g., shorelines, glacier terminus, fire edge, and marine and terrestrial ecozones).  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aecological zones 3ageographic information systems 3aglaciers 3ashorelines 3aspatial data 3aGeorgia1 aAlexander, Clark R.1 aBush, David M.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Apr., v. 41 p.199-207dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012500166300001600291520177400307592002802081650001202109650002002121650001302141650002302154650002302177650002002200650001502220650002402235650001502259650000902274650002002283650001302303650001402316650005202330650001002382651001002392653000802402653001102410653000802421653000902429653000802438653000802446653000802454653000802462653001102470653000802481653000802489653003702497653002802534653002902562653001402591653001402605653002702619700001502646700001802661700001902679700001702698700001702715700001802732773010102750856008502851852000902936655001202945IND60646130420221119210619.0190725e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064613042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2019.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Caixia10aMolecular genetic characterization and haplotype diversity of swine leukocyte antigen in Chinese Rongshui miniature pigs  ap. 215-222.  aThe Rongshui miniature pig is an important model animal for studying livestock disease prevention and control in China. The highly polymorphic swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) has been the focus of considerable interest because of the strong, reproducible associations between particular SLA haplotypes and infectious diseases. In this study, we identified 42 alleles at eight polymorphic SLA loci (SLA-1, SLA-3, SLA-2, SLA-6, DRA, DRB1, DQA, and DQB1) representing seven class I and six class II haplotypes using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sequence-based typing and PCR-sequence specific primers in Rongshui miniature pigs. The official names were designated by the SLA Nomenclature Committee of the International Society for Animal Genetics. Seven class I haplotypes, Hp-5b.0, 86.0, 87.0, 88.0, 89.0, 90.0 and 91.0, and four class II haplotypes, Hp-0.18b, 0.19c, 0.41 and 0.47, had not previously been reported in other pig breeds. We also comprehensively analyzed the molecular genetic characterization and phylogenies of the identified alleles and the SLA haplotype diversity in Rongshui miniature pigs. SLA-1 and SLA-6 genes were under positive selection, while SLA-2 was under neutral selection, and the other five genes were under purifying selection. The highly polymorphic new alleles may be derived by nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and fragment recombination, and alleles segregated based on sequence differences and peptide-binding motifs, rather than on pig breed. SLA haplotype diversity was generated by allele/gene conversion and recombination. These results will be helpful for elucidating the molecular genetic mechanisms influencing differential disease resistance among pigs with different SLA haplotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aanimal genetics 3aantigens 3adisease prevention 3adisease resistance 3agene conversion 3ahaplotypes 3ainfectious diseases 3aleukocytes 3aloci 3aminiature swine 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aswine 3aChina 0aSLA 0aRT-PCR 0aMHC 0aISAG 0aIPD 0aSBT 0aSSP 0aCDS 0aindels 0aPBG 0aSNP 0aMajor histocompatibility complex 0aSwine leukocyte antigen 0aGenetic characterization 0aHaplotype 0aDiversity 0aRongshui miniature pig1 aXin, Chang1 aWang, Xiuying1 aQuan, Jinqiang1 aLi, Changwen1 aWang, Jingyu1 aChen, Hongyan0 tMolecular immunology.g2019 Aug., v. 112 p.215-222dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245007300165300001400238520141200252592002801664650002201692650001401714650001601728650001501744650001601759650001401775650001201789650001601801650001101817650002101828650001501849650001501864650001601879700001301895773008601908856008301994852000902077655001202086IND60096077520221119013400.0141104e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Iaco, S.10aPredicting spatio-temporal random fields: Some computational aspects  ap. 12-24.  aModeling of spatio-temporal processes is critical in many fields such as environmental sciences, meteorology, hydrology and reservoir engineering. Nowadays spatio-temporal analysis cannot be adequately faced without considering important issues, such as: (a) modeling the spatio-temporal random field from which data might be reasonably derived, (b) choosing suitable covariance models which describe the spatio-temporal correlation of the variables of interest, (c) using adequate software packages which tackle different inferential problems. In this paper, the above aspects are properly analyzed. In particular, three different space–time random field decomposition choices are considered and the flexibility of using the generalized product–sum model is highlighted. A customized GSLib routine for kriging in space-time is proposed. This Fortran routine, named “K2ST”, is based on the use of the generalized product -sum model, with nested structures, and appropriate space-time search neighborhoods. An application to NO₂ pollutant in an urban area is presented. In order to compare kriging results associated with three hypotheses of space–time random field decomposition, correlation coefficients and standardized errors between true values and predicted ones are computed. Moreover, nonparametric tests are applied to check the significance of the difference among the three approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3acorrelation 3acovariance 3aengineering 3ahydrology 3akriging 3ameteorology 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3apollutants 3aprediction 3aurban areas1 aPosa, D.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Apr., v. 41 p.12-24dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03667naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014100167300001600308520167600324592002802000650002302028650001702051650001902068650001602087650001502103650002802118650002702146650000902173650001302182650000902195650002502204650001002229650004002239650001002279650001102289650001902300650001402319650001502333653001502348653001302363653001602376653001702392653002202409653001102431653001502442653000902457653000802466653000802474653001002482653001102492653001302503653000902516653000802525653000802533653000802541653001302549653002002562653001102582653000802593653002002601653000902621653000802630653000902638700001802647700001302665773013802678856008402816852000902900655001202909IND60604806820221117215226.0180718e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2014.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeverins, N.10aEffects of lutein-enriched egg yolk in buttermilk or skimmed milk on serum lipids & lipoproteins of mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects  ap. 210-217.  aEarlier studies in our group suggested that traditionally prepared buttermilk influences cholesterol metabolism. We therefore designed a study to evaluate whether traditionally prepared buttermilk lowers serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or prevents the LDL-C raising effect of egg yolks.Mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects were randomly allocated to one of four diet groups consuming daily at lunch 80 ml skimmed milk with (n = 23) or without (n = 25) lutein-enriched egg yolk (28 g from 1.5 eggs providing 323 mg cholesterol) or traditionally prepared buttermilk with (n = 23) or without (n = 21) lutein-enriched egg yolk during a 12 week period. Fasting blood samples were taken to measure concentrations of serum lipids, (apo)lipoproteins, liver and kidney function markers, and plasma lutein, zeaxanthin and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Egg yolk consumption significantly increased serum total cholesterol (total-C) (p = 0.035) and LDL-C concentrations (p = 0.022). Buttermilk did not change the effects of egg yolk on serum lipids and (apo)lipoproteins. There was a trend towards significant lower total-C (p = 0.077), but not LDL-C (p = 0.204) concentrations in the buttermilk groups. Plasma lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.001) in the egg yolk groups.In mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects, daily consumption of traditionally prepared buttermilk for 12 weeks did not lower serum total-C or LDL-C concentrations, nor did it prevent the serum total-C and LDL-C raising effect of daily egg yolk consumption.This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01566305.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3ablood lipids 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abuttermilk 3acardiovascular diseases 3acholesterol metabolism 3adiet 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3ahypercholesterolemia 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alunch 3alutein 3arenal function 3askim milk 3azeaxanthin 0aButtermilk 0aEgg yolk 0aCholesterol 0aSerum lipids 0aMilk polar lipids 0aLutein 0aZeaxanthin 0aALAT 0aALP 0aAMD 0aANOVA 0aApo A1 0aApo B100 0aASAT 0aBMI 0aCVD 0aFFQ 0aGamma GT 0aHDL cholesterol 0ahs CRP 0aLAB 0aLDL cholesterol 0aMFGM 0aTAG 0aVLDL1 aMensink, R.P.1 aPlat, J.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2015 Feb., v. 25, no. 2 p.210-217dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2014.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001100150245013400161300001600295520161900311592002801930650002801958650001901986650002402005650001802029650002202047650001102069650001802080650001502098650001102113650001702124650001802141650002602159650001502185653001002200653001402210653002902224653003102253653003202284700001402316700001402330700001402344773013802358856008402496852000902580655001202589IND60604806920221117215151.0180718e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2014.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Y.10aFruit and vegetable consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: A dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies  ap. 140-147.  aWe conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to summarize the evidence from prospective cohort studies regarding the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Pertinent studies were identified by searching Embase and PubMed through June 2014. Study-specific results were pooled using a random-effect model. The dose-response relationship was assessed by the restricted cubic spline model and the multivariate random-effect meta-regression. We standardized all data using a standard portion size of 106 g. The Relative Risk (95% confidence interval) [RR (95% CI)] of T2DM was 0.99 (0.98–1.00) for every 1 serving/day increment in fruit and vegetable (FV) (P = 0.18), 0.98 (0.95–1.01) for vegetable (P = 0.12), and 0.99 (0.97–1.00) for fruit (P = 0.05). The RR (95%CI) of T2DM was 0.99 (0.97–1.01), 0.98 (0.96–1.01), 0.97 (0.93–1.01), 0.96 (0.92–1.01), 0.96 (0.91–1.01) and 0.96 (0.91–1.01) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 servings/day of FV (Pfor non-linearity = 0.44). The T2DM risk was 0.96 (0.95–0.99), 0.94 (0.90–0.98), 0.94 (0.89–0.98), 0.96 (0.91–1.01), 0.98 (0.92–1.05) and 1.00 (0.93–1.08) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 servings/day of vegetable (Pfor non-linearity < 0.01). The T2DM risk was 0.95 (0.93–0.97), 0.91 (0.89–0.94), 0.88 (0.85–0.92), 0.92 (0.88–0.96) and 0.96 (0.92–1.01) for 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 servings/day of fruit (Pfor non-linearity < 0.01).Two-three servings/day of vegetable and 2 servings/day of fruit conferred a lower risk of T2DM than other levels of vegetable and fruit consumption, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardiovascular diseases 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adose response 3afruit consumption 3afruits 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolism 3amodels 3aportion size 3arelative risk 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 0aFruit 0aVegetable 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aProspective cohort studies 0aDose-response meta-analysis1 aZhang, D.1 aJiang, X.1 aJiang, W.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2015 Feb., v. 25, no. 2 p.140-147dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2014.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245013000204300001600334520180000350592002802150650002002178650001502198650001702213650001502230650001302245650001902258650002002277653002602297653002802323653001702351653002702368700001502395700001702410700001502427700001702442700001802459700001602477773013802493856008402631852000902715655001202724IND60604807320221117215229.0180718e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060480732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2014.10.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeraci, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3806-115110aRenal haemodynamics and severity of carotid atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients with and without impaired renal function  ap. 160-166.  aRenal resistance index (RRI), assessed by Duplex-Doppler sonography, has been classically considered as a mere expression of intrarenal vascular resistance. Recent studies, however, have showed that RRI is also influenced by upstream factors, especially arterial compliance, confirming its possible role as a marker of systemic vascular alterations.Several studies have shown that carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and carotid plaques (cP), assessed by ultrasonography, are documented markers of subclinical organ damage as well as expression of progressive atherosclerotic disease, and that they get worse with the progressive deterioration of renal function.The study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between RRI and severity of carotid atherosclerosis in hypertensive subjects with and without impaired renal function.The study population, including 263 hypertensive patients (30–70 years), was split into 3 groups based on cIMT and presence of cP (cIMT ≤ 0.9 mm and no cP; cIMT > 0.9 mm and no cP; cP). All patients were also divided into 2 subgroups (normal renal function; CKD stage I–IV).A stepwise increase in RRI corresponding to the groups of progressive severity of carotid atherosclerosis was observed (respectively 0.61 ± 0.07, 0.65 ± 0.06, 0.68 ± 0.06; p < 0.001). A strong positive correlation was observed between RRI and cIMT in the whole population (r = 0.43; p < 0.001) and in the subgroups with (r = 0.42; p < 0.001) and without (r = 0.39; p < 0.001) CKD. These associations remained statistically significant even after adjustment for various confounding factors.Showing a close association between RRI and severity of carotid atherosclerosis, our results strengthen the concept that RRI is a marker of systemic vascular changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3acompliance 3ahemodynamics 3ametabolism 3apatients 3arenal function 3aultrasonography 0aRenal resistive index 0aCarotid atherosclerosis 0aHypertension 0aChronic kidney disease1 aMulè, G.,1 aMogavero, M.1 aGeraci, C.1 aD'Ignoti, D.1 aGuglielmo, C.1 aCottone, S.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2015 Feb., v. 25, no. 2 p.160-166dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2014.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245015600188300001600344520183700360592002802197650001102225650001402236650001902250650001402269650002302283650001502306650001702321650001302338650001102351650001902362650002702381650001602408650001102424650001502435650002602450650000902476650001002485650001902495650001202514650003702526650002702563650002702590650003402617650002902651650002802680650003302708650000902741650002702750773011302777856008102890852000902971655001202980IND50068726820221118093904.0141111e20130916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006872682DNAL7 a238994542pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimpfel, Wilfried10aPharmacological classification of herbal extracts by means of comparison to spectral EEG signatures induced by synthetic drugs in the freely moving rat  ap. 583-589.  aHerbal extracts targeting at the brain remain a continuous challenge to pharmacology. Usually, a number of different animal tests have to be performed in order to find a potential clinical use. Due to manifold possibly active ingredients biochemical approaches are difficult. A more holistic approach using a neurophysiological technique has been developed earlier in order to characterise synthetic drugs. Stereotactic implantation of four semi-microelectrodes into frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation of rats allowed continuous wireless monitoring of field potentials (EEG) before and after drug intake. After frequency analysis (Fast Fourier Transformation) electric power was calculated for 6 ranges (delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2). Data from 14 synthetic drugs – tested earlier and representative for different clinical indications – were taken for construction of discriminant functions showing the projection of the frequency patterns in a six-dimensional graph. Quantitative analysis of the EEG frequency pattern from the depth of the brain succeeded in discrimination of drug effects according to their known clinical indication (Dimpfel and Schober, 2003). Extracts from Valerian root, Ginkgo leaves, Paullinia seed, Hop strobile, Rhodiola rosea root and Sideritis scardica herb were tested now under identical conditions. Classification of these extracts based on the matrix from synthetic drugs revealed that Valerian root and hop induced a pattern reminiscent of physiological sleep. Ginkgo and Paullinia appeared in close neighbourhood of stimulatory drugs like caffeine or to an analgesic profile (tramadol). Rhodiola and Sideritis developed similar frequency patterns comparable to a psychostimulant drug (methylphenidate) as well to an antidepressive drug (paroxetine).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo 3aPaullinia 3aRhodiola rosea 3aSideritis 3aactive ingredients 3aanalgesics 3aanimal tests 3acaffeine 3acortex 3aelectric power 3aelectroencephalography 3ahippocampus 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3asleep 2aMagnoliopsida. 2aAnimals 2aBrainxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCaffeinexpharmacology 2aElectroencephalography 2aMethylphenidatexpharmacology 2aParoxetinexpharmacology 2aPhenytoinxpharmacology 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRats 2aTramadolxpharmacology0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Sept. 16, v. 149, no. 2 p.583-589dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010200171300001400273520190000287592002802187650001202215650001902227650001902246650001402265650002002279650002302299650001502322650002902337650001102366650001302377650001502390650002202405650000902427650001102436650001902447650001702466650001702483650001502500700001602515700002602531700002302557773008502580856008302665852000902748655001202757IND60096079620221119013126.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009607962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.01.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParish, Esther S.10aEstimating future global per capita water availability based on changes in climate and population  ap. 79-86.  aHuman populations are profoundly affected by water stress, or the lack of sufficient per capita available freshwater. Water stress can result from overuse of available freshwater resources or from a reduction in the amount of available water due to decreases in rainfall and stored water supplies. Analyzing the interrelationship between human populations and water availability is complicated by the uncertainties associated with climate change projections and population projections. We present a simple methodology developed to integrate disparate climate and population data sources and develop first-order per capita water availability projections at the global scale. Simulations from the coupled land–ocean–atmosphere Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) forced with a range of hypothetical greenhouse gas emissions scenarios are used to project grid-based changes in precipitation minus evapotranspiration as proxies for changes in runoff, or fresh water supply. Population growth changes, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) storylines, are used as proxies for changes in fresh water demand by 2025, 2050 and 2100. These freshwater supply and demand projections are then combined to yield estimates of per capita water availability aggregated by watershed and political unit. Results suggest that important insights might be extracted from the use of the process developed here, notably including the identification of the globe's most vulnerable regions in need of more detailed analysis and the relative importance of population growth versus climate change in altering future freshwater supplies. However, these are only exemplary insights and, as such, could be considered hypotheses that should be rigorously tested with multiple climate models, multiple observational climate datasets, and more comprehensive population change storylines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aevapotranspiration 3afreshwater 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahumans 3apolitics 3apopulation 3apopulation growth 3arain 3arunoff 3asupply balance 3awater stress 3awater supply 3awatersheds1 aKodra, Evan1 aSteinhaeuser, Karsten1 aGanguly, Auroop R.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 May, v. 42 p.79-86dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02223naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006300169300001600232520131700248592002801565650001501593650001201608650001001620650002201630650001401652650002201666650001901688700002301707773008701730856008301817852000901900655001201909IND60096080320221119012918.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009608032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRittner, Martin10a2D mapping of LA-ICPMS trace element distributions using R  ap. 152-161.  aA new add-on package (LAICPMS) for the R language for statistical computing is presented, which greatly facilitates data reduction and visualisation (single tracks and 2D element maps) of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) data. The package determines many input parameters automatically and is easy to use. We present major and trace element distribution maps of natural calcite samples, processed using LAICPMS. Data processing from raw data to presented graphics takes only a few minutes. The empirical cumulative density function (ECDF) is used for optimised colour coding of the maps rather than linear or logarithmic scale, making a maximum of element-specific detail visible. For preprocessing, several different smoothing algorithms were evaluated and can be chosen by the user; for the presented data, a simple running median/running average was chosen. Typical data analysis is performed via short, easy-to-understand script files, and results can be used for further analyses within R. Owing to other R add-on packages utilised, the results can be output either numerically or as high-quality graphics in a wide range of file formats. Inheriting from its host environment R, the package is open-source software and freely available for all major computer platforms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acalcite 3acolor 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3amass spectrometry 3atrace elements1 aMüller, Wolfgang,0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 May, v. 42 p.152-161dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01646naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005200171300001600223520055400239592002800793650001400821650001100835650001600846653000800862653000800870653000800878653000800886653000800894653000800902653002300910653001500933653003400948653001700982653002300999700001901022773011301041856008501154852000901239655001201248IND60646134320221119210354.0190606e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064613432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2018.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasani, Stefano10aAre uncertainty shocks aggregate demand shocks?  ap. 142-146.  aThis note considers the Leduc and Liu (JME, 2016) model and studies the effects of their uncertainty shock under different Taylor-type rules. It shows that both the responses of real and nominal variables highly depend on the Taylor rule considered. Remarkably, inflation reacts positively so that uncertainty shocks look more like negative supply shocks, once an empirically plausible degree of interest rate smoothing is taken into account. This result is reinforced with less reactive monetary rules. Overall, these rules alleviate the recession.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainflation 3amodels 3auncertainty 0aE12 0aE21 0aE22 0aE24 0aE31 0aC32 0aUncertainty shocks 0aDSGE model 0aSearch and matching frictions 0aTaylor rules 0aInflation dynamics1 aRossi, Lorenza0 tEconomics letters.g2018 June, v. 167 p.142-146dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2018.03.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009600167300001600263520103600279592002801315650002101343650001701364650002301381650002201404650002201426650001101448650001501459650002101474650002501495651001001520651001601530651001101546651001601557700001701573700002101590773010601611856004801717852000901765655001201774IND50062792420221120213214.0130323e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006279242DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255120700622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgureeva, G.

The models used for conservation of the mountain Korean pine broad-leaved forests in the transboundary areas of Russia, China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), and the Republic of Korea should be based on the coordinated management of national resources. Estimating the ecological potential of Korean pine broad-leaved forests and the state and role played by forest ecosystems in the contemporary structure of the vegetation cover of the Manchurian Natural Area is significant for a more successful management of forests and scientifically grounded distribution of the nature reserves to conserve biodiversity. The united ecological-geographical system taking into account the regional peculiarities of forests can serve as a key in the development of the conservation of the biome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus koraiensis 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3adeciduous forests 3aforest ecosystems 3amodels 3amonitoring 3avegetation cover 3avegetation structure 3aChina 3aNorth Korea 3aRussia 3aSouth Korea1 aDudov, S.

EPR is an evolutionary data mining technique that generates a transparent and structured representation of the behaviour of a system directly from data. This method can operate on large quantities of data in order to capture nonlinear and complex relationships between variables of the system. It also has the additional advantage that it allows the user to gain insight into the behaviour of the system. Results from pressure plate tests carried out on clay, silty clay, sandy loam, and loam are used for developing and validating the EPR model. The model inputs are the initial void ratio, initial gravimetric water content, logarithm of suction normalised with respect to atmospheric air pressure, clay content, and silt content. The model output is the gravimetric water content corresponding to the assigned input suction. The EPR model predictions are compared with the experimental results as well as the models proposed by previous researches. The results show that the proposed approach is very effective and robust in modelling the soil–water characteristic curve in unsaturated soils. The merits and advantages of the proposed approach are highlighted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3acomputers 3amodels 3aprediction 3asandy loam soils 3asilt fraction 3asilty clay soils 3asoil water 3awater content1 aJohari, A.1 aJavadi, A.A.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 June, v. 43 p.25-33dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.02.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245017000168300001300338520206500351592002802416650001502444650001402459650002902473700001602502773008502518856008302603852000902686655001202695IND60096081820221119013047.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009608182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Cheng-Zhi10aParallelizing flow-accumulation calculations on graphics processing units—From iterative DEM preprocessing algorithm to recursive multiple-flow-direction algorithm  ap. 7-16.  aAs one of the important tasks in digital terrain analysis, the calculation of flow accumulations from gridded digital elevation models (DEMs) usually involves two steps in a real application: (1) using an iterative DEM preprocessing algorithm to remove the depressions and flat areas commonly contained in real DEMs, and (2) using a recursive flow-direction algorithm to calculate the flow accumulation for every cell in the DEM. Because both algorithms are computationally intensive, quick calculation of the flow accumulations from a DEM (especially for a large area) presents a practical challenge to personal computer (PC) users. In recent years, rapid increases in hardware capacity of the graphics processing units (GPUs) provided in modern PCs have made it possible to meet this challenge in a PC environment. Parallel computing on GPUs using a compute-unified-device-architecture (CUDA) programming model has been explored to speed up the execution of the single-flow-direction algorithm (SFD). However, the parallel implementation on a GPU of the multiple-flow-direction (MFD) algorithm, which generally performs better than the SFD algorithm, has not been reported. Moreover, GPU-based parallelization of the DEM preprocessing step in the flow-accumulation calculations has not been addressed. This paper proposes a parallel approach to calculate flow accumulations (including both iterative DEM preprocessing and a recursive MFD algorithm) on a CUDA-compatible GPU. For the parallelization of an MFD algorithm (MFD-md), two different parallelization strategies using a GPU are explored. The first parallelization strategy, which has been used in the existing parallel SFD algorithm on GPU, has the problem of computing redundancy. Therefore, we designed a parallelization strategy based on graph theory. The application results show that the proposed parallel approach to calculate flow accumulations on a GPU performs much faster than either sequential algorithms or other parallel GPU-based algorithms based on existing parallelization strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3adigital elevation models1 aZhan, Lijun0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 June, v. 43 p.7-16dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012100165300001500286520109100301592002801392650001501420650001401435650001401449650001601463650002001479650001501499650001801514651002101532773008701553856008301640852000901723655001201732IND60096082120221119012917.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009608212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArel, Ersin10aPredicting the spatial distribution of soil profile in Adapazari/Turkey by artificial neural networks using CPT data  ap. 90-100.  aThe infamous soils of Adapazari, Turkey, that failed extensively during the 46-s long magnitude 7.4 earthquake in 1999 have since been the subject of a research program. Boreholes, piezocone soundings and voluminous laboratory testing have enabled researchers to apply sophisticated methods to determine the soil profiles in the city using the existing database. This paper describes the use of the artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the complex soil profiles of Adapazari, based on cone penetration test (CPT) results. More than 3236 field CPT readings have been collected from 117 soundings spread over an area of 26km². An attempt has been made to develop the ANN model using multilayer perceptrons trained with a feed-forward back-propagation algorithm. The results show that the ANN model is fairly accurate in predicting complex soil profiles. Soil identification using CPT test results has principally been based on the Robertson charts. Applying neural network systems using the chart offers a powerful and rapid route to reliable prediction of the soil profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3adatabases 3aearthquakes 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3asoil profiles 3aTurkey (country)0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 June, v. 43 p.90-100dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.01.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245010800173300001600281520196100297592002802258650001402286650002002300650001902320650001502339650001002354650001102364650002102375650001902396650001602415650001502431700003302446773008802479856008302567852000902650655001202659IND60096082220221119013147.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009608222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehvari, Abdolhamid10aRemoving non-ground points from automated photo-based DEM and evaluation of its accuracy with LiDAR DEM  ap. 108-117.  aThree sets of DEM, including LiDAR, stereo photo based DEM, and contour-based DEM, were created using different tools and sources. Because different tools produce different raster data sets, they were reprojected into the same coordinate system and converted to point clouds as vector format, then a triangulated irregular network (TIN) retaining all grid or mass points was created from each point coverage. Corresponding orthophoto involved in extracting stereo photo DEM, classified by object-oriented approach to create vector polygons representing non-ground points (building and vegetation classes) and bare-ground elevation points. Non-ground points were removed from stereo pairs DEM using classified orthophoto polygons, and filled with contour DEM data. Also a 5th order trend surface over photo-based DEM was fitted and non-ground points were removed and filled using local interpolation. It was observed that automated photo-based extraction yields high precision terrain models in a short time, reducing manual editing; their accuracy is strictly related to image quality and terrain features. Results showed that such photogrammetric extracted DEM represents better accuracy along x and y directions than LiDAR does, while LiDAR has the best vertical accuracy, compared to other DEMs. The differences between horizontal errors are large since there were no significant differences between vertical errors of LiDAR and photo-based DEM. This indicates that there is a good correlation between elevation points of DEMs, and a stereo pair-based DEM can be a good substitute, whenever LiDAR is not affordable. This study provides several important insights into the magnitudes and spatial patterns of LiDAR and photo-based DEM errors, further studies need to verify the error extent in more diverse landscape. However, automated photo-based DEM extraction is currently an efficient method for collecting data useful for rural and small study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3alandscapes 3alidar 3amodels 3aorthophotography 3aphotogrammetry 3araster data 3avegetation1 aHeck, R.

However, large data volumes pose computing issues when disseminating and processing the data. The main goals of this paper are to evaluate a vertex decimation algorithm used to reduce the size of the LiDAR data and to test parallel computation frameworks, particularly multicore CPU and GPU, in processing the data. In this paper we use a vertex decimation technique to reduce the number of vertices available in a triangulated irregular network (TIN) representation of LiDAR data. In order to validate and verify the algorithm, the authors have used last returns only (LRO) and all returns (AR) of points from four tiles of LiDAR data taken from flat and undulating terrains. The results for flat terrain data showed decimation rates of roughly 95% for last returns only and 55% for all returns without significant loss of accuracy in terrain representation. Accordingly, file sizes were reduced by about 96.5% and 60.5%. The processing speed greatly benefited from parallel programming using the multicore CPU framework. The GPU usage demonstrated an additional impediment caused by noncomputational overhead. Nonetheless, tremendous acceleration was demonstrated by the GPU environment in the computational part alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3alidar 3atiles1 aSugumaran, Ramanathan1 aDegroote, John,1 aGray, Paul0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 June, v. 43 p.118-125dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.09.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245013400164300001600298520118000314592002801494650002301522650001401545650001601559650001001575650002401585650001501609650002101624700001401645700001501659773008801674856008301762852000901845655001201854IND60096082420221119015147.0141104e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009608242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, H.T.12aA generalized Kelvin solution based method for analyzing elastic fields in heterogeneous rocks due to reservoir water impoundment  ap. 126-136.  aThis paper develops an analytical method for assessing the additional elastic fields in the heterogeneous rocks beneath a reservoir due to its water weight loading. The proposed method is based on the fundamental solution of layered elastic solids and integrates numerically it over the loading areas. It can deal with arbitrarily depth-heterogeneous rock solids and complex surface loads. Specifically, the method is applied to the analysis of the stress increases in the rock strata due to the impoundment of water in the Zipingpu reservoir. Nearby the reservoir, the epicenter of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake was located. The surface contours of the Zipingpu reservoir from the Google map are utilized to obtain the reservoir topography. It is assumed that the water loads act on the projection surface of the water level of the reservoir on the horizontal plane of the dam foundation. The projection surface is discretized into the element mesh and used to generate the reservoir topography and the water loading on the layered rock surface. The proposed method is used to calculate the additional elastic fields in the neighbourhood of the epicenter and beneath the dam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acomputers 3aearthquakes 3arocks 3asurface water level 3atopography 3awater reservoirs1 aYue, Z.Q.1 aZhao, X.M.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 June, v. 43 p.126-136dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013600171300001800307520131800325592002801643650001201671650001101683650001201694650003501706650001201741650001601753650003301769650001901802650002501821650002401846650001701870650001101887651001001898700002601908773013901934856008502073852000902158655001202167IND60621779820221117112223.0181121e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062177982DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.14660722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabiha Sultana,10aUrban heat island intensity during winter over metropolitan cities of India using remote-sensing techniques: impact of urbanization  ap. 6692-6730.  aThe present study aims to quantify spatial relationship of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and land surface temperature (LST) using remote-sensing and geographical information system techniques over 10 major metropolitan cities of India. For this purpose, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images of these cities during winter period from 2001 to 2013 are used. Statistical analysis of the LULC classification has shown overall accuracy ranging between 85% and 88%. The LULC classification and estimated LST using the satellite imageries reveals the presence of multiple urban heat islands (UHIs) and their increase in number in all cities. Significant increase in built-up/urban areas are noticed at the expense of vegetated lands and barren lands over Lucknow, Nagpur, and Jaipur, whereas in Hyderabad and Bengaluru the built-up area and the dry/barren lands are observed to be increasing, at the expense of crop/grass lands. Higher UHI intensities in the range of 8.9–10.3°C are noticed over Mumbai, Nagpur, and Hyderabad compared to the other cities. Higher temperature zones (hotspots) are found to be increasing in the built-up area as well as in barren lands. Varying increase in UHI intensity among the cities is noticed which may have implications in the regional climate over the cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acities 3aclimate 3ageographic information systems 3agrasses 3aheat island 3aland use and land cover maps 3aremote sensing 3astatistical analysis 3asurface temperature 3aurbanization 3awinter 3aIndia1 aSatyanarayana, A.N.V.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2018 Oct. 18, v. 39, no. 20 p.6692-6730dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.14660723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245009300170300001400263520115600277592002801433650002201461650001401483650001601497650002601513650002401539773008601563856008301649852000901732655001201741IND60096083720221119015237.0141104e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009608372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCannavó, Flavio10aSensitivity analysis for volcanic source modeling quality assessment and model selection  ap. 52-59.  aThe increasing knowledge and understanding of volcanic sources has led to the development and implementation of sophisticated and complex mathematical models with the main goal of describing field and experimental data. Quantification of the model's ability in describing the data becomes fundamental for a realistic estimate of the model parameters. The analysis of sensitivity can help us in identifying the parameters that significantly affect the model's output and in assessing its quality factor. In this paper, we describe the Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) methods based both on Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test and on the Sobol' approach and discuss their implementation in a Matlab software tool (GSAT). We also introduce a new criterion for model selection based on sensitivity analysis. The proposed approach is tested and applied to quantify the fitting ability of an analytic volcanic source model on a synthetic deformation data. Results show the validity of the method, against the traditional approaches, in supporting the volcanic model selection and the flexibility of the GSAT software tool in analyzing the model sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3adeformation 3afield experimentation 3amathematical models0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 July, v. 44 p.52-59dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245014000168300001400308520099400322592002801316650001501344650001001359650001701369650001301386650001701399650001101416650001301427650002001440650001201460650001201472650001501484650001601499650002301515650000901538651001601547651001101563653002201574653001301596653001801609653001701627653001601644653002101660700002001681700001701701773010301718856008001821852000901901655001201910IND60622285220221119070042.0181124e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062228522DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836093489002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTouflan, Philippe10aSoil charcoal analysis: a reliable tool for spatially precise studies of past forest dynamics: a case study in the French southern Alps  ap. 45-52.  aThis paper presents and discusses the use of soil charcoal analysis (pedoanthracology) to reconstruct past forest dynamics in a larch forest of the upper Guil valley (French Alps, Queyras). We also discuss the role of anthropogenic fire in forest dynamics. The radiocarbon dates from this site demonstrate that arolla pine (Pinus cembra) and larch were present in the area since 7566—7673 cal. BP and 5934—6123 cal. BP, respectively. The identification of a piece of charcoal to fir (Abies alba) dated to 5734—5908 cal. BP suggests that this species was present at 1980 m a.s.l. since c. 6000 cal. BP and had a higher ecological tolerance than previously assumed. The cover of larch forests has increased since the second half of the Holocene because of anthropogenic practices (eg, clearing with fire, cattle grazing). However, today, owing to the abandonment of pastoral practices, the arolla pine has become dominant, which greatly modifies the forest structure and the landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aLarix 3aPinus cembra 3aaltitude 3acase studies 3acattle 3acharcoal 3aforest dynamics 3aforests 3agrazing 3alandscapes 3apastoralism 3aradiocarbon dating 3asoil 3aAlps region 3aFrance 0aCharcoal analysis 0aHolocene 0aLarix decidua 0aPinus cembra 0aFrench Alps 0asubalpine stage.1 aTalon, Brigitte1 aWalsh, Kevin0 tHolocene.g2010 Feb., v. 20, no. 1 p.45-52dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836093489003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245008700161300001600248520181800264592002802082650003702110650000902147650001702156650001202173650002402185650001102209650002202220650001602242650001002258650001302268650002202281651001002303653001902313653003102332653002702363653002002390653002902410653002302439700002102462700002202483700001502505700001502520700001902535773010502554856008002659852000902739655001202748IND60622285620221119070617.0181124e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062228562DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836093503882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao Yang, 12aA 622-year regional temperature history of southeast Tibet derived from tree rings  ap. 181-190.  aA tree ring-width record spanning from AD 1377—1998 was developed from Tibetan juniper (Cupressus gigantea) growing at sites north of the deep gorge of the Yarlung Tsangbo River of southeast Tibet. A linear regression model between ring width and mean January—June temperature accounts for 35% of January—June temperature variance for the period 1961—1998. Based on this model, we reconstructed January—June temperature variation history for the study region during the past 622 years. Warm conditions occurred during AD 1385—1418, 1443—1466, 1482—1501, 1523—1548, 1570s, 1705—1759, 1770—1790, 1851—1888, 1910s, and 1938—1965, and periods of relatively cold years are identified for AD 1419—1442, 1470s, 1502—1522, 1550—1569, 1610—1640, 1680—1700, 1760s, 1791—1850, 1900s and 1965—1995. Spatial correlation between tree rings and observed temperatures indicates that the reconstruction is representative of temperature change for southeast Tibet. Regional cold conditions during AD 1625, 1685, 1760, 1800—1850, 1890—1930 and 1965—1995, and warm conditions during 1710, 1730—1750, 1850—1890 and 1930—1960 can be identified in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Our reconstruction shows good agreement with modelled regional temperatures derived from an ECHO-G model simulation. Common cold periods around 1470, 1685 and 1845 corresponding to the Spörer Minimum, the Maunder Minimum and the Dalton Minimum periods of low solar activity and increased volcanic activity were identified, indicating that solar and volcanic activity played an important role in temperature change of this region. The discrepancy between modelled and reconstructed temperatures was noted around 1965, reflecting that temperature decrease in the late 20th century (1965—1995) is anomalous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCupressus torulosa var.

This type of 3D reconstruction is facilitated by freely available software, which does not require expert-level skills. This technology provides a 3D working environment, which integrates sample/field data visualization and measurement tools. In this study, we test the potential of this method for 3D reconstruction of decimeter-scale objects of geological interest. We generated 3D models of three different outcrops exposed in a marble quarry and two solids: a volcanic bomb and a stalagmite. Comparison of the models obtained in this study using the presented method with those obtained using a precise laser scanner shows that multiview 3D reconstruction yields models that present a root mean square error/average linear dimensions between 0.11 and 0.68%. Thus this technology turns out to be an extremely promising tool, which can be fruitfully applied in geosciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3amodels 3aworking conditions 3ayields1 aFornaciai, A.1 aIsola, I.1 aTarquini, S.1 aNannipieri, L.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 July, v. 44 p.168-176dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011000164300001600274520157700290592002801867650000801895650001301903650001901916650001101935650001801946650002001964650002001984650001202004651001002016651001402026651001502040653001502055653001002070653003002080653002102110653001602131653001102147700001902158700001602177700001502193700002502208700002002233700001902253700001802272700001902290700002002309700001502329773010502344856008002449852000902529655001202538IND60622286120221119070107.0181124e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062228612DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836093503932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJinguo Dong, 12aA high-resolution stalagmite record of the Holocene East Asian monsoon from Mt Shennongjia, central China  ap. 257-264.  aHigh-resolution oxygen isotope (δ¹⁸O) profiles of six stalagmites from Sanbao Cave in Hubei province, central China, established with 1413 oxygen isotope data and 65 ²³⁰Th ages, provide a continuous history of East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) intensity for the period from 13—0.2 thousand years before present (ky BP, relative to AD 1950). The δ ¹⁸O record includes four distinct stages in the evolution of the EASM: (1) an abrupt transition (~11.5 ky BP) into the Holocene; (2) a period of gradual increase in monsoon intensity (11.5—9.5 ky BP); (3) the maximum humid period (9.5—6.5 ky BP); and (4) a period of gradual decline in monsoon intensity (6.5—0.2 ky BP). Comparison of Sanbao with regional records of comparable resolution reveals that the timing of the beginning and end of the Holocene Optimum (as defined by the minimum in δ¹⁸ O) was similar in the Indian and East Asian monsoon systems. This supports the idea that shifts in the monsoon tied to shifts in the mean position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) may control monsoon intensity throughout the entire low-latitude region of Asia on orbital timescales. This observation also supports the idea that the fluctuations in δ¹⁸ O recorded across southern Asia reflect broad changes in the monsoon, as opposed to local meteoric precipitation. The EASM records from Sanbao largely follow orbital-scale insolation changes, yet exhibit similar variability to Greenland ice core δ¹⁸O on millennial to centennial scales during the early to middle Holocene (r = 0.94).  aPublisher supplied data 3aice 3alatitude 3amonsoon season 3aoxygen 3aradionuclides 3asolar radiation 3astable isotopes 3athorium 3aChina 3aGreenland 3aSouth Asia 0aStalagmite 0aδ18O 0aEast Asian summer monsoon 0aHolocene Optimum 0aSanbao Cave 0aChina.1 aYongjin Wang, 1 aHai Cheng, 1 aHardt, Ben1 aEdwards, R.

To make simulations much closer to real SAR imaging, the changes of antenna observation angle and frequency bandwidth of SAR are considered in the image processing, and the antenna pattern in the azimuth plane is also taken into consideration in the scattering model. The combination of the scattering model and the image-processing algorithm will contribute to understanding the imaging result of SAR response to forest structures and to optimizing the design of the SAR sensor. Furthermore, a height extraction method from the interferometry of airborne single-pass SAR is used to extract vegetation height. Finally, the scattering amplitude and height images of virtual trees in a stand are simulated. The simulation results demonstrate that the combination of the radar coherent scattering model and the image-processing algorithm provides a reasonable interpretation of the images according to the scattering mechanism.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [61671032].  aPublisher supplied data  a61671032cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3aalgorithms 3aforests 3aimage analysis 3ainterferometry 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atrees1 aLiu, Dawei1 aQiao, Xinya1 aSun, Guoqing0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2018 Oct. 18, v. 39, no. 20 p.6983-6994dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.14681103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02284naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245008500175300001400260520128800274592002801562650002201590650001401612650000901626650002401635650001601659650002201675700001601697700001901713700001601732700002001748773008601768856008301854852000901937655001201946IND60096085920221119015222.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009608592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2012.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHubschwerlen, Nicolas10aUsing Tough2-MP on a cluster—optimization methodology and study of scalability  ap. 26-35.  aEvaluating the impacts of heat and gas production in a deep geological repository for radioactive waste necessitates a large number of numerical simulations. The task is best approached by running a massively parallel code such as Tough2-MP on a cluster. One key issue then becomes the optimal utilization of the computer resources. The newly developed methodology facilitates the efficient distribution of the workload on the cluster by guiding the selection of the partitioning settings for the model and the repartitioning of the computation load among the nodes and cores. Its application involves a series of numerical test routines which are performed prior to the realization of the repository simulations. The new methodology has been applied on two actual simulation cases. One is based on the Couplex-Gaz 1b exercise with variable mesh size, the other is the larger MAVL 3D model concerning the storage of intermediate-level long-lived radioactive waste. The results from testing show a good scalability of the Tough2-MP code under certain conditions. Good practices for domain partitioning and processor load repartitioning have been derived. The results may be applicable, too, for efficiency enhancements of other domain-decomposition based parallel simulation software.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3aheat 3amathematical models 3amethodology 3aradioactive waste1 aZhang, Keni1 aMayer, Gerhard1 aRoger, Jean1 aVialay, Bernard0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Aug., v. 45 p.26-35dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2012.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245012000166300001600286500001500302520183200317592002802149650000902177650000902186650001102195650001202206650001902218650002002237650001002257650000902267650002002276650001302296650001102309650002702320650001202347651001602359651001602375653002002391653002702411653001902438653001402457653001902471700002602490700002402516700002102540700001802561773010402579856008002683852000902763655001202772IND60622286720221119070328.0181124e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062228672DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836093519012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWehrli, Michael10aEffects of climatic change and bog development on Holocene tufa formation in the Lorze Valley (central Switzerland)  ap. 325-336.  a2019-12-06  aA massive tufa complex in the lower Lorze Valley (550 m a.s.l., north-central Switzerland) formed between 9000 and 5000 cal. yr BP. In the plain 4 km southeast of the complex lies Neugrundmoor (830 m a.s.l.), a mire in the hydrologic recharge area of the springs responsible for the tufa formation. Here we address an earlier, untested hypothesis that the transition of Neugrundmoor from fen to raised bog caused the end of the tufa formation, by means of pollen and testate amoebae analyses on a peat section. The chronology of the section is based on ten AMS ¹⁴C-dates of terrestrial plant macrofossils. Our results suggest that until 7100 cal. yr BP the plain had shallow ponds, which gradually developed into fens. Starting 5350 cal. yr BP, large raised bogs developed in the fens in a few centuries. This agrees with the hypothesis that the end of tufa formation coincided with the transition from fen to raised bog. It also coincided with the end of the mid-Holocene temperature optimum, when climate became cooler and wetter. We suggest that the main factor causing the end of tufa formation at 5500—5000 cal. yr BP was declining air temperatures, which on the one hand led to diminished calcium precipitation, on the other to enhanced bog formation. Peat has a low hydraulic conductivity, so we suggest that less water became available for tufa formation because of increased thickness of peat layers, exacerbating the direct effect of cooling on calcium precipitation. Noticeable human influence in the surroundings did presumably not start before c. 3500 cal. yr BP and was then very weak, so this was not responsible for the end of the tufa formation. Extrapolation of our results suggests that climatic cooling alone is sufficient to explain the widespread termination of tufa formation after the mid Holocene.  aPublisher supplied data 3apeat 3afens 3ahumans 3acalcium 3aglobal cooling 3aair temperature 3aponds 3abogs 3aplants (botany) 3aaltitude 3apollen 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aclimate 3aSwitzerland 0aSwitzerland 0atestate amoebae 0araised bog development 0aclimate change 0ahydrology 0aTufa formation1 aMitchell, Edward A.D.1 avan der Knaap, W.O.1 aAmmann, Brigitta1 aTinner, Willy0 tHolocene.g2010 May, v. 20, no. 3 p.325-336dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836093519013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169300001800264520110600282536023501388592002801623596009801651596008601749596006201835650001401897650001401911650005001925650001001975650001901985651002002004700001502024700001802039700001502057700001702072773013802089856008502227852000902312655001202321IND60621782120221121235307.0181121e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062178212DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.14707002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xudong10aObservations of internal waves with high sampling data of radar altimetry and MODIS images  ap. 7405-7416.  aThe 20 Hz high sampling radar altimetry data and quasi-synchronous satellite images are applied to investigate internal waves in the South China Sea (SCS) and the Sulu Sea. The response characteristics and band sensitivities of radar altimetry data to the modulation of internal waves were analysed. With quasi-synchronous observations, the responses of Sigma0 and significant wave height (SWH) in the Ku band and the C band to the modulation were discussed, respectively. The results demonstrate that for Sigma0, the Ku band is more sensitive, whereas the C band is more sensitive for SWH. The propagation speeds of internal waves in the SCS and the Sulu Sea were calculated with quasi-synchronous observation of radar altimetry high sampling data and MODIS images. The calculated speed of the internal waves is close to the phase speed obtained from the KdV equation. This work indicates that the quantitative parameter of internal waves could be extracted from radar altimetry high sampling data. The altimetry data could serve as an additional data source for the investigation of internal waves.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [61471136], National Programme on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction [GASI-02-SCS-YGST2-04], and the National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1405600]  aPublisher supplied data  a61471136cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aGASI-02-SCS-YGST2-04cNational Programme on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction  a2017YFC1405600cand the National Key R&D Program of China 3aaltimetry 3aequations 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3aSouth China Sea1 aJie, Zhang1 aFan, Chenqing1 aWang, Jing1 aMeng, Junmin0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 39, no. 21 p.7405-7416dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.14707003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03664naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245010300172300001600275520212600291592002802417650001502445650001102460650001202471650001102483650001702494650001402511650001202525650001802537650001602555650001102571650000902582650001402591650002302605650000902628650001202637650001502649650001302664651002202677651001002699653001802709653002102727653001202748653002702760653001502787653002102802653001002823700002002833700002202853700003002875773010402905856008003009852000903089655001203098IND60622287120221119070657.0181124e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062228712DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836093534292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArribas, J.q(José),10aHolocene transgression recorded by sand composition in the mesotidal Galician coastline (NW Spain)  ap. 375-393.  aThis study confirms several inferences regarding Holocene coastal dynamics and climate through a petrographic modal analysis of 60 Holocene sand samples recovered in seven sites along the NW coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Fluvial sand can be discriminated from more mature intertidal and aeolian sand according to texture and composition. Fluvial sand contains soil products and coastal sand has significant bioclasts. Quartzofeldspathic sand appears in the western area (produced by the erosion of granite and granitoid), and quartzolithic sand occurs in the eastern area (produced by the erosion of metasediment). Changes in sand composition during Holocene deposition are manifested by an increase in modern carbonate clasts (MC) correlated with the Holocene transgression. Episodes of faster sea-level rise and subsequent erosion of surrounding cliffs are indicated by the preservation of high proportions of feldspar in intertidal sand. In contrast, fluvial sand is characterized by greater quartz enrichment. These inferences were confirmed by petrographic indices (carbonate clasts/total clasts, MC/T; total feldspars/monocrystalline quartz, F/Qm; and plagioclase/total feldspars, P/F). The different maturity of intertidal and aeolian sands is revealed by their variable quartz contents, despite similar proportions of plagioclase and K-feldspar. This suggests mechanical abrasion as the main factor controlling maturity. In contrast, fluvial sand shows depleted plagioclase contents as the result of inland weathering processes. Intertidal, beach and aeolian sands are essentially the products of the erosion of coastal cliffs and head deposits, with only the scarce contribution of fluvial drainages. The long-distance transport of Galician coastal sands is discarded based on the close relationship between their composition and that of local sand sources. Our findings indicate that short-distance transport of sediments from the west closed off coastal wetlands and occluded estuarine mouths during the Holocene transgression by deposition on sediment-trap zones along the irregularly shaped Galician coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbonates 3acliffs 3aclimate 3acoasts 3aeolian sands 3aestuaries 3agranite 3alittoral zone 3aplagioclase 3aquartz 3asand 3asea level 3asediment transport 3asoil 3atexture 3aweathering 3awetlands 3aIberian Peninsula 3aSpain 0acoastal sands 0acoastal dynamics 0aGalicia 0aHolocene transgression 0aprovenance 0asand composition 0aSpain1 aAlonso, Angela,1 aPagés, Jose Luis1 aGonzález-Acebrón, Laura0 tHolocene.g2010 May, v. 20, no. 3 p.375-393dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836093534293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011800169300001600287520110500303592002801408650001501436650001401451650001601465650001001481650001801491650002001509700001801529700001901547773008801566856008301654852000901737655001201746IND60096087120221119014932.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009608712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cageo.2011.10.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhangar-Asr, A.10aDetermination of the most probable slip surface in 3D slopes considering the effect of earthquake force direction  ap. 119-130.  aConsidering the effect of earthquake forces on stability of slopes has always been of crucial importance in seismic analysis of geotechnical structures like dams, roads and embankments and there has been much concern about stability of cuts, fills and natural slopes under earthquake loadings in recent years. In this research a three-dimensional approach in conjunction with genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed to investigate the effect of earthquake force inclination on minimum stability factor of safety and the shape and direction of the corresponding failure surface. The stability factor of safety was considered to be a function of soil properties, slope dimensions, coordination of the nodal points on the slip surface mesh and their rotation angle to the rotation centre, magnitude of pseudo-static coefficient and the inclination of earthquake forces. The proposed methodology was found to be very effective in determining the minimum stability factor of safety and the corresponding most probable slip surface considering pseudo-static analysis of slopes under inclined earthquake forces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputers 3aearthquakes 3aroads 3asafety factor 3asoil properties1 aToufigh, M.M.1 aSalajegheh, A.0 tComputers & geosciences.g2012 Aug., v. 45 p.119-130dElsevier Ltdx0098-30047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.10.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245006900154300002000223520062600243592002800869650002400897650001100921650001300932650000900945650001400954650001400968650002700982700001601009700001701025700001701042700002001059700001601079700001701095700001201112773013501124856007501259852000901334655001201343IND60539940720221121045935.0160818e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053994072DNAL7 a10.1021/ja506554j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yihan10aChiral Gold Nanowires with Boerdijk–Coxeter–Bernal Structure  ap. 12746-12752.  aA Boerdijk–Coxeter–Bernal (BCB) helix is made of linearly stacked regular tetrahedra (tetrahelix).

Often, the complexity of the reactions themselves makes such investigations near impossible, as very small changes can often make dramatic differences. Herein, we explore a very simple [A + B] binary synthetic system that gives rise to the facile assembly of two isomeric anions, [Feᴵᴵᴵ(H₂O)₂{γ-FeᴵᴵᴵSiW₉O₃₄(H₂O)}₂]¹¹– (1) and [Feᴵᴵᴵ(H₂O)₂{γ-Feᴵᴵᴵ₂SiW₈O₃₃(H₂O)₂}{γ-SiW₁₀O₃₅}]¹¹– (2), which can be formed as individual and dimeric species (3) and (4). Furthermore, the simple binary nature of this synthetic system allowed its investigation by a comprehensive time-resolved ESI-MS analysis, yielding unprecedented mechanistic information regarding the initial interactions and reorganizations of the {γ-SiW₁₀} precursor in the presence of Fe²⁺.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3airon1 aCameron, Jamie M.1 aCronin, Leroy0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 10, v. 136, no. 36 p.12753-12761dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja50679163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010800167500001900275520229900294592002802593650001502621650002502636650002402661650002002685650001602705650001702721650002602738650001502764650001802779650001002797650001402807650002402821700001802845700001802863700001902881773013602900856008103036852000903117655001203126IND60698182720221120034041.0200610s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069818272DNAL7 a10.1017/S00296651200023112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHani, Saja Bani10aCommonly used method for chylomicron isolation catches less than 0.1% of chylomicrons from whole plasma  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHealth effects of orally ingested bioactive compounds can only occur if bioactive molecules are absorbed and transported to target tissues. Paradoxically, many foods are rich in micronutrients but intestinal absorption is often limited. Immediately after absorption, lipid soluble nutrients are packaged into chylomicrons (CM), therefore quantification of the micronutrient content in CM has been used as tool to evaluate bioavailability⁽¹⁾. For bioavailability studies the isolated CM fraction must not contain liver derived lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL) since only intestine derived CM carry recently absorbed lipids and lipophilic micronutrients. As isolated CM can be contaminated with liver derived lipoproteins, this study evaluated the purity of collected CM and VLDL fractions. Each CM contains one apolipoprotein B-48 (apoB-48) and each VLDL contains one apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) on its surface⁽²⁾ therefore purity of CM and VLDL fractions was evaluated via the presence/absence of apoB-100 and apoB-48. CM and VLDL fractions were isolated as previously described⁽¹,³⁾from whole plasma collected at 0, 2, 4 or 6 h after participants consumed a lipid (15.4g) and carotenoid (36mg) rich smoothie (480mL). Plasma density was adjusted to 1.1g/mL with KBr (0.14g/mL), placed in ultracentrifugation tubes (38 mL, thickwall) and overlaid with 3 solutions containing NaCl, KBr and Na-EDTA with densities of 1.020, 1.065 and 1.006g/mL.CM fraction was collected after ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 34 min in a Beckman Coulter Optima XE-90 with SW32Ti swinging bucket rotor. VLDL fraction was collected after additional 102 min at 25,000 rpm. ELISA analysis revealed that apoB-48 and apoB-100 were present in both CM and VLDL fractions. Less than 0.1% of plasma apoB-48 (< 98pmol/L) was present in CM or VLDL fraction. Less than 0.3% (< 2,425pmol/L) and 4% (< 54,124pmol/L) of plasma apoB-100 was present in CM and VLDL fractions, respectively. Low recoveries of apoB-48 and apoB-100 in CM and VLDL fraction suggests that ultracentrifugation neither concentrated nor isolated CM or VLDL. While ourapoB-48 and apoB-100 results agree with previously reported values in plasma, CM and VLDL⁽³,⁴⁾, no previous study evaluated apoB-48 and apoB-100 recovery from plasma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aapolipoprotein B-100 3aapolipoprotein B-48 3abioavailability 3acarotenoids 3achylomicrons 3aintestinal absorption 3aintestines 3alipophilicity 3aliver 3anutrition 3aultracentrifugation1 aFlint, Pamela1 aEvans, Gethin1 aGraf, Brigitte0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

It was based on GC measurement of oxygen in the headspace gas that is released from the dissolved oxygen in a liquid sample in a closed vial. The results show that the relative standard deviation of the method in quintuplicate testing was < 2.0% and the relative differences of results were less than 4.0% for the real river water samples when compared with the widely used reference method (the electrode method); The linear range of the method is about 0–9.0 mg/L with the limit of detection of 0.30 mg/L. The present method is simple in both sample preparation and method calibration. It is particularly efficient in the batch testing mode. Overall, the method is more reliable than the current reference method when used with samples from a wide range of sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectrodes 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3aindustrial wastewater 3aliquids 3aoxygen 3ariver water 3astandard deviation 0aDissolved oxygen 0aWastewater 0aHeadspace gas chromatography1 aJiang, Ran1 aYun, Na1 aPeng, Rong1 aChai, Xin-Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3448-95080 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 1608 p.460399-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4603993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012600162300001600288520070600304592002801010650001101038650002401049650001101073650001101084650002201095650001401117650001301131650001201144653001901156653002501175653002401200653002601224653001901250700001801269700002001287700001601307700001601323700005601339773012501395856008301520852000901603655001201612IND60654328520221118215556.0190913e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065432852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.07.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Yuan10aPorosity controlled synthesis of nanoporous silicon by chemical dealloying as anode for high energy lithium-ion batteries  ap. 674-681.  aSilicon is regarded as the most promising electrode material to meet the high-capacity demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).

There is increasing experimental and theoretical evidence that solvation water is not a passive spectator in biomolecular processes. New experimental techniques can quantify how water interacts with biomolecules and, in doing so, differs from “bulk” water. Terahertz (THz) absorption spectroscopy has turned out to be a powerful tool to study (bio)molecular hydration. The main concepts that have been developed in the recent years to describe the underlying solute-induced sub-picosecond dynamics of the hydration shell are discussed herein. Moreover, we highlight recent findings that show the significance of hydrogen bond dynamics for the function of antifreeze proteins and for molecular recognition. In all of these examples, a gradient of water motion toward functional sites of proteins is observed, the so-called “hydration funnel”. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we provide new evidence for a specific water–protein coupling as the cause of the observed dynamical heterogeneity. The efficiency of the coupling at THz frequencies is explained in terms of a two-tier (short- and long-range) solute–solvent interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantifreeze proteins 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy1 aHavenith, Martina0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2014 Sept. 17, v. 136, no. 37 p.12800-12807dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja504441h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245010300203300002000306506007600326520114300402592002801545506003701573650003201610650002301642650001801665650001701683650002201700650000901722650001101731650001201742650000901754650001201763650001301775650002201788650001401810650002901824650001501853650003301868700001601901700001501917700002601932773013501958856007502093852000902168655001202177IND60539942420221207052318.0160818e20140917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053994242DNAL7 a10.1021/ja505217w2doi7 aPMC43518662pmcid7 a251486492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Brien, John P.10aCharacterization of Native Protein Complexes Using Ultraviolet Photodissociation Mass Spectrometry  ap. 12920-12928.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUltraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry (MS) was used to characterize the sequences of proteins in native protein–ligand and protein–protein complexes and to provide auxiliary information about the binding sites of the ligands and protein–protein interfaces.

UVPD also generated noncovalent fragment ions containing a portion of the protein still bound to the ligand which revealed some insight into the nature of the binding sites of myoglobin/heme, eIF4E/m⁷GTP, and human peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase 1 (Pin1) in complex with the peptide derived from the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (CTD).

Under the influence of polar gaseous molecules, hybrid halide perovskites show changes in its structural and electrical properties. We, for the first time, have investigated the influence of NH3 gas molecules on the optical properties of CH3NH3PbBr3 colloidal QDs. The investigations carried out under a controlled environment reveal that even the presence of 37 ppm of ammonia (NH3) gas molecules causes a significant reduction in the PL intensity of CH3NH3PbBr3 colloidal QDs. The reduction rate of PL intensity can be tuned with the concentration of NH3 gas molecules. We propose that the decrease in PL intensity is because of the formation of a non-luminescent NH4PbBr3 phase under the presence of NH3 gas molecules. Further, the non-luminescent NH4PbBr3 retransformed into luminescent CH3NH3PbBr3 on the introduction of methylamine (CH3NH2) gas molecules. This reversible alternation in PL properties enables us to demonstrate its application for (NH3) gas sensing. The advantage of using CH3NH3PbBr3 colloidal QDs for luminescence-based sensing is that its green emission is visible with the naked eye even under daylight, which is easy to detect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aelectrical properties 3alead bromide 3amethylamine 3aoptical properties 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum dots 3asolar radiation 0aHybrid halide perovskite 0aCH3NH3PbBr3 0aGas sensing 0aColloidal quantum dots1 aSingh, Satbir1 aSingh, Vidya Nand1 aGupta, Govind1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5006-76231 aGupta, Bipin Kumar0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 554 p.668-673dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.07.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245009000164300002000254520115100274592002801425650001701453650001501470650000901485650002001494650001901514700002201533700003001555700001901585773013501604856007501739852000901814655001201823IND60539942520221121034951.0160818e20140917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053994252DNAL7 a10.1021/ja505251a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZanetti-Polzi, Laura10aSurface Packing Determines the Redox Potential Shift of Cytochrome c Adsorbed on Gold  ap. 12929-12937.  aThermodynamic and dynamic properties of iso-1-cytochrome c covalently bound to a bare gold surface are here investigated by large scale atomistic simulations. The reduction potential of the protein for low and high surface concentrations is calculated showing a good agreement with experimental estimates. The origin of the dependence of the reduction potential on the surface concentration is investigated and is demonstrated to stem from the changing polarizability of the environment surrounding the protein, a mechanism reminiscent of crowding effects. Moreover, structural analyses are performed revealing relevant changes induced by the presence of the electrode on the dynamic properties of cytochrome c. In particular, one of the two cavities previously identified on the protein surface [Bortolotti et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 13670], and that reversibly open in cytochrome c freely diffusing in solution, is found to be deformed when the protein is adsorbed on gold. This modification exemplifies a mechanism that potentially leads to changes in the protein properties by surface-induced modification of its dynamical behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytochrome c 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aredox potential 3athermodynamics1 aDaidone, Isabella1 aBortolotti, Carlo

During its milling the seed testa (hull) is removed and is a significant underutilised secondary product. The aim of this study was to examine the nutritional and functional properties of broad bean hull (BBH), specifically for blood glucose control and as a source of fibre for humans. The proximate composition of BBH was assessed using standard AOAC methods and the phytochemical profile using LC-MS⁽¹⁾. BBH extracts were characterised for total polyphenol content, antioxidant potential (FRAP, TEAC)⁽²⁾, and effects on α-amylase (AA) and α-glucosidase (AG) enzyme activity⁽³⁾. Bread containing BBH was developed and assessed for glycaemic potential using a standardised in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion model⁽⁴⁾. Wheat bran and acarbose were used as comparators. BBH showed a comparable proximate composition to wheat bran but with higher fibre (49 vs 43 g/100g), and lower carbohydrate (19 vs 23 g/100g) and fat contents (1.3 vs 5 g/100g). LC-MS profiling showed that proanthocyanidins were the predominant phytochemicals in the hull with some minor compounds including flavonols. Total polyphenol content and antioxidant potential (FRAP, TEAC) of BBH was significantly higher than in wheat bran (160.1 vs 12.3 μg Gallic acid/mL, 3877.9 vs 75.5 μM Fe Sulphate, and 0.50 vs 0.19 mM Trolox Eq respectively; P < 0.001). Compared to acarbose BBH showed a significantly higher IC₅₀ for α-amylase inhibition (76.6 vs 4.2 μg/mL), and a significantly lower value for α-glucosidase inhibition (2.7 vs 2175.8 μg/mL)(P < 0.001). The addition of BBH significantly reduced starch digestion in bread during the oral, gastric phases and at 20 and 60 min of intestinal digestion (P < 0.005). Broad bean hull is a good source of non-soluble fibre with potential for increasing fibre contents in foods by up to 15g/100 g. Compared to similar material it is a richer source of polyphenols and antioxidants, retards both α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity and shows potential for reducing the glycaemic potential of foods.

Baltic herring is one of the most frequently caught fish in Poland⁽¹⁾. It was demonstrated that the fishing season has an effect on the content of individual fatty acid fractions⁽²⁾. The aim of the study was to analyse the fatty acid profile of Baltic herring flaps originating from two fishing seasons. The study material were flaps of Baltic herring (Clupea harengus) originating from two fishing seasons (April-June following spawning and October-December prior to spawning). For each fishing season, six batches of raw material were examined (n = 6). From each batch, flaps were taken from ten fish. The flaps were comminuted and thoroughly mixed to prepare an experimental sample from which adequate weights of analytical samples were taken. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the fatty acid composition was conducted following the cold muscle lipid extraction with a mixture of chloroform : methanol (2:1). Fatty acid methylation was carried out with a chloroform : methanol : sulphuric acid mixture (100:100:1). The separation of fatty acids was performed by gas chromatography. A one-factor variance analysis method with Duncan's test (P ≤ 0.05) was used to evaluate the variation of mean values. The fishing season does not significantly affect the content of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Differences were found during the analysis of the individual groups of unsaturated acids. The amount of monounsaturated fatty acids in herring before spawning (25.27%) was significantly lower than that after spawning (35.91%) (P ≤ 0.05). The content of polyunsaturated fatty acids before spawning (43.99%) was significantly higher than that after spawning (33.49%) (P ≤ 0.05). Most changes in the fatty acid profile occur in the highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA). The most important change due to the health-promoting properties for humans is an increase in the amount of EPA from 6.24% to 9.84% after and before spawning, respectively. Analogous changes were demonstrated for DHA, whose amount increased from 9.64% to 24.56%. The obtained results demonstrate a more favourable fatty acid profile in herring caught before spawning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClupea harengus 3achloroform 3acold 3afatty acid composition 3agas chromatography 3ahealth promotion 3aherring 3amarine fish 3amethanol 3amethylation 3amuscles 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3aqualitative analysis 3araw materials 3asulfuric acid 3avariance1 aŻmijewski, Tomasz1 aWiżk, Adam0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2020, v. 79, no.

Developing an optimised platform to support the stem cells is vital to realising this, and through utilising new ‘smart’ materials such as conductive polymers we can provide a multi-pronged approach to supporting and stimulating the stem cells via engineered surface properties, electrical, and electromechanical stimulation. Here we present a fundamental study on the viability of cardiac progenitor cells on conductive polymer surfaces, focusing on the impact of surface properties such as roughness, surface energy, and surface chemistry with variation of the polymer dopant molecules. The conductive polymer materials were shown to provide a viable support for both endothelial and cardiac progenitor cells, while the surface energy and roughness were observed to influence viability for both progenitor cell types. Characterising the interaction between the cardiac progenitor cells and the conductive polymer surface is a critical step towards optimising these materials for cardiac tissue regeneration, and this study will advance the limited knowledge on biomaterial surface interactions with cardiac cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3aenergy 3aheart 3amyocardial infarction 3apolymers 3aroughness 3astem cells 3asurface interactions 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 3aviability1 aLjunggren, M.

A secondary aim was to determine whether a fractionated protocol is more effective than a single-dose protocol in terms of response, DFI and overall survival. The third aim was to evaluate whether we can identify prognostic factors that influence overall survival. This was a retrospective study that included cats with a diagnosis of nasal planum SCC treated with Sr90 plesiotherapy at a single institution. Seventy-four cats were included in the study. Thirty-two were treated with a fractionated protocol and 42 with a single-dose treatment. Sr90 plesiotherapy was able to induce complete response in 74% of cats with nasal planum SCC. The median DFI was 780 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 383–1177), with 17% of cats experiencing local recurrence. The overall survival for all cats was 1039 days (95% CI 55–1528). The DFI of cats treated with the fractionated Sr90 was significantly longer compared with the single-dose treatment, whereas response and overall survival were not statistically different. Other prognostic factors that influenced the overall survival were early-stage disease, absence of concurrent problems and complete response to the treatment. Acute and long-term toxicity associated with the treatment were minimal and the aesthetic outcome was pleasing in almost all cases. Strontium plesiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment of nasal planum SCC in cats.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3acats 3aconfidence interval 3afractionation 3anose 3aretrospective studies 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3astrontium 3atoxicity1 aMurphy, Sue1 aLaberke, Silja1 aVerganti, Sara0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2019 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.306-313dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X187739133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010400169520129700273592002801570650001501598650002301613650002401636650001201660650001201672650003101684650001801715650001301733650001501746650001901761650000901780650001301789650001101802650001401813653001801827653001001845653001201855653002401867653001401891700001401905700002001919700005701939773011801996856008802114852000902202655001202211IND60683497220221120183812.0200330e20200515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068349722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1370332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaowei10aAdsorption of triclosan onto different aged polypropylene microplastics: Critical effect of cations  aAdsorption of organic contaminants onto aged microplastics (MPs) may be important in understanding their transport potential and ecological risks in aquatic environment. Cations of Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ are common electrolytes in water, which can greatly influence the adsorption behavior of MPs by impacting the electrostatic interaction between MPs and organic contaminants. The results of this study showed that aged isotactic polypropylene (iPP) MPs exhibited higher adsorption capacity to triclosan (TCS) than pristine ones, and the sorption affinity was enhanced with the increase of ionic concentrations. The crucial influence of cations on the adsorption behavior of aged MPs mainly depended on the changed properties of TCS and interactions between MPs and TCS. Salting out effect induced the precipitation of TCS from water and facilitated the partition of TCS onto MPs in high salinity water. Besides, compressing electrostatic double layer of MPs via squeezing out effect and bridging effect between functional groups of aged MPs and contaminants may also be significant factors in the sorption process. These findings will be helpful for understanding the role of cations on the transport of pollutants, the fate of MPs and their associated environmental risks in aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic environment 3acalcium 3acations 3aelectrostatic interactions 3amicroplastics 3amoieties 3apollutants 3apolypropylenes 3arisk 3asalinity 3asodium 3atriclosan 0aMicroplastics 0aAging 0aCations 0aAdsorption behavior 0aTriclosan1 aLiu, Peng1 aHuang, Hexinyue1 aGao, Shixiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5779-21580 tScience of the total environment.g2020 May 15, v. 717 p.137033-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1370333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02997naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006800170300001600238520146100254592002801715650001401743650002301757650001301780650002301793650001101816650001501827650003401842650000901876650002801885650001801913650002201931650001501953653001701968653001801985653002002003653002802023653001902051653001502070700002302085700002002108700002102128700002202149700002502171700002202196700002302218700002502241773011002266856008202376852000902458655001202467IND60541923820221122025615.0190401e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054192382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrevel, René W.R.10aDevelopment and evolution of risk assessment for food allergens  ap. 262-276.  aThe need to assess the risk from food allergens derives directly from the need to manage effectively this food safety hazard. Work spanning the last two decades dispelled the initial thinking that food allergens were so unique that the risk they posed was not amenable to established risk assessment approaches and methodologies. Food allergens possess some unique characteristics, which make a simple safety assessment approach based on the establishment of absolute population thresholds inadequate. Dose distribution modelling of MEDs permitted the quantification of the risk of reaction at the population level and has been readily integrated with consumption and contamination data through probabilistic risk assessment approaches to generate quantitative risk predictions. This paper discusses the strengths and limitations of this approach and identifies important data gaps, which affect the outcomes of these predictions. These include consumption patterns among allergic individuals, analytical techniques and their application, severity-dose relationships, and the impact of extraneous factors which alter an individual’s physiology, such as infection or exercise. Nevertheless, application of these models has provided valuable insights, leading to further refinements and generating testable hypotheses.

Although the existing Hg²⁺ detection methods have high sensitivity and reliability, whereas there have few reports concerning bimodal detection for Hg²⁺ with one sensor. Toward this goal, a novel sensor based on rhodamine derivatives (RhD) grafted AuNS@Ag core-shell nanocubes (CSN) has been synthesized and shown the bimodal detection capabilities with metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for Hg²⁺. Herein, resultant CSN acts as the signal enhancing material; RhD was modified on the outside of the shell to ensure the signal sensitive of the CSN-RhD hybrids. In this work, we investigate the size- and shape-dependent SERS activity of plasmonic CSN comprised of AuNS as cores and Ag cuboids as shells. The SERS activity of CSN with spherical core was found to increase with the increasing thickness of the Ag cubic shell. Sequel, under an optimized condition, a display of strong MEF and SERS signals of the resulting mixtures with increasing of Hg²⁺ concentrations was observed. The proposed bimodal sensor showed excellent performances for Hg²⁺ along with wide linear range of 0.001–1000 ppm and 0.01–1000 ppm as well as the relatively low detection limit of 0.94 and 5.16 ppb for MEF and SERS assays, respectively. Furthermore, the ability of the sensor to detect Hg²⁺was also confirmed in adulterated milk samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanalytical chemistry 3afluorescence 3aions 3amercury 3amilk 3ananomaterials 3apollutants 3asilver 0aBimodal sensor 0aMetal enhanced fluorescence 0aSurface enhanced Raman scattering 0aAuNS@Ag core-shell nanocube 0aSize dependent1 aChen, Quansheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2498-32781 aHassan, Md Mehedi1 aOuyang, Qin1 aJiao, Tianhui1 aXu, Yi1 aChen, Min0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2018 Aug. 14, v. 1018 p.94-103dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11651x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2018.01.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02089naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010500170300001600275520094700291592002801238650002101266650000901287650002301296650001201319650001401331650001501345650001701360650001201377650001101389650001301400650001101413650001001424650001601434651001601450651001101466700002501477700002001502773008801522856004801610852000901658655001201667IND50072589320221121023028.0140201e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007258932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-013-9624-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRautio, Anna-Maria10aSami Resource Utilization and Site Selection: Historical Harvesting of Inner Bark in Northern Sweden  ap. 137-146.  aNative Sami people have lived for thousands of years in northern Fennoscandia, subsisting on reindeer herding, hunting, fishing and gathering of wild plants. Harvesting inner bark from Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris L.) was a common practice and traces of this resource use are still evident in old forests. In this study we analyzed trees with bark-peelings in a nature reserve in northernmost Sweden to assess the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of inner-bark harvesting. We found that the same inner-bark harvest locale was used repeatedly, in nearly every decade from the late 16th to the late 19th century and that harvest levels varied greatly over time. The harvest levels we observed were surprisingly low, in comparison to levels suggested in other studies, and indicate that inner-bark was used as a supplementary health food during early spring when game meat was naturally lean, rather than being used as bulk food year-round.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3abark 3aconservation areas 3aforests 3agame meat 3aharvesting 3ahealth foods 3aherding 3apeople 3areindeer 3aspring 3atrees 3awild plants 3aScandinavia 3aSweden1 aJosefsson, Torbjörn1 aÖstlund, Lars,0 tHuman ecology.g2014 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.137-146dSpringer-Verlagx0300-78397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-013-9624-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009500170300001600265520142000281592002801701650001401729650001201743650002001755650001101775650000901786650002001795650002301815650001701838650001501855650001601870653001701886653001801903653002001921653002801941653001901969653001901988700002302007700002202030700002002052700002002072700003102092700002102123700002202144700001702166700002002183773011002203856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60541923920221122003220.0190401e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054192392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrevel, René W.R.10aTranslating reference doses into allergen management practice: Challenges for stakeholders  ap. 277-287.  aRisk assessment describes the impact of a particular hazard as a function of dose and exposure. It forms the foundation of risk management and contributes to the overall decision-making process, but is not its endpoint. This paper outlines a risk analysis framework to underpin decision-making in the area of allergen cross-contact. Specifically, it identifies challenges relevant to each component of the risk analysis: risk assessment (data gaps and output interpretation); risk management (clear and realistic objectives); and risk communication (clear articulation of risk and benefit). Translation of the outputs from risk assessment models into risk management measures must be informed by a clear understanding of the model outputs and their limitations. This will lead to feasible and achievable risk management objectives, grounded in a level of risk accepted by the different stakeholders, thereby avoiding potential unintended detrimental consequences. Clear, consistent and trustworthy communications actively involving all stakeholders underpin these objectives. The conclusions, integrating the perspectives of different stakeholders, offer a vision where clear, science-based benchmarks form the basis of allergen management and labelling, cutting through the current confusion and uncertainty. Finally, the paper recognises that the proposed framework must be adaptable to new and emerging evidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3acutting 3adecision making 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk communication 3astakeholders 3atoxicology 3auncertainty 0aFood allergy 0aPublic health 0aRisk assessment 0aProbabilistic modelling 0aEliciting dose 0aReference dose1 aBaumert, Joseph L.1 aLuccioli, Stefano1 aBaka, Athanasia1 aHattersley, Sue1 aHourihane, Jonathan O’B.1 aRonsmans, Stefan1 aTimmermans, Frans1 aWard, Rachel1 aChung, Yong-joo0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 May, v. 67 p.277-287dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245013000167500001400297520114800311592002801459650002901487650002101516650001901537650001101556650001401567650001701581650002101598650001401619650001101633650002501644650002201669650002601691650001601717650002001733650001401753650001201767650003101779700003001810700002201840700002101862700002301883773012201906856008002028852000902108655001202117IND60711813820221121052431.0200928e20200821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071181382DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens90906852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanco, Rancés 10aRole of Epstein-Barr Virus and Human Papillomavirus Coinfection in Cervical Cancer: Epidemiology, Mechanisms and Perspectives  aNAL-light  aHigh-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is etiologically associated with the development and progression of cervical cancer, although other factors are involved. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) detection in premalignant and malignant tissues from uterine cervix has been widely reported; however, its contribution to cervical cancer development is still unclear. Here, a comprehensive analysis regarding EBV presence and its potential role in cervical cancer, the frequency of EBV/HR-HPV coinfection in uterine cervix and EBV infection in tissue-infiltrating lymphocytes were revised. Overall, reports suggest a potential link of EBV to the development of cervical carcinomas in two possible pathways: (1) Infecting epithelial cells, thus synergizing with HR-HPV (direct pathway), and/or (2) infecting tissue-infiltrating lymphocytes that could generate local immunosuppression (indirect pathway). In situ hybridization (ISH) and/or immunohistochemical methods are mandatory for discriminating the cell type infected by EBV. However, further studies are needed for a better understanding of the EBV/HR-HPV coinfection role in cervical carcinogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman gammaherpesvirus 4 3aPapillomaviridae 3acarcinogenesis 3acervix 3adetection 3aepidemiology 3aepithelial cells 3afrequency 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aimmunosuppression 3ain situ hybridization 3alymphocytes 3amixed infection 3apathogens 3atissues 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aCarrillo-Beltrán, Diego 1 aOsorio, Julio  C.1 aCalaf, Gloria  M1 aAguayo, Francisco 0 tPathogens.g2020 Aug. 21, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens90906853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005900138245021000197300001800407500001900425500002000444520162800464592002802092596005002120650002002170650002402190650002702214650002402241650002002265650001802285650000902303650001502312650001502327650001502342650001502357700005402372700001902426700001602445700002002461700001702481700002302498700006702521773013702588856007202725852000902797655001202806IND60708527420221117224509.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070852742DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.47912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosfeld, Verena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8318-237710aComparison of Alternative Methods for Bioaccumulation Assessment: Scope and Limitations of In Vitro Depletion Assays with Rainbow Trout and Bioconcentration Tests in the Freshwater Amphipod Hyalella azteca  ap. 1813-1825.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBioaccumulation assessment predominantly relies on the bioconcentration factor (BCF) as the sole decisive metric. The test guideline 305 by the Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development (OECD) provides the standard procedure for deriving this in vivo fish BCF, which is not only expensive and labor‐intensive, but also requires many animals. Accordingly, there is a great need for and interest in alternative methods that can help to reduce, replace, and refine vertebrate tests, as described in the 3R principles. Two alternative approaches have been developed: the bioconcentration test with the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca and the OECD test guideline 319 which provides a method to determine experimentally derived in vitro metabolism rates that can then be incorporated into in silico prediction models for rainbow trout BCF calculation. In the present study both alternative methods were applied to 5 substances of different physicochemical characteristics. The results were compared with literature values of fish in vivo BCFs and additional BCFs obtained with the alternative methods, if available. Potential differences between the results of the test methods are discussed utilizing information such as in vivo metabolism rates.

Based on the presence of flavonoids in CR and results from our previous in vitro investigations, this study aimed to determine whether consumption of CR crude leaf extract: (a) affected lipoprotein profile, resting glucose, systolic blood pressure and vascular function, and (b) produced toxic effects (haematological measures, organ weight) in healthy rats. Male Hooded-Wistar rats (∼230g) were supplemented for 4weeks with CR extract in their drinking water (35mg/kg body weight daily). CR extract produced a significant decrease (18%, p=0.033) in atherogenic lipoproteins (but not high density lipoprotein). CR supplemented animals showed no signs of haematological toxicity and body and organ weight, daily fluid and food consumption and in vitro vascular responsiveness were similar for both groups. CR also increased (40%, p=0.049) the renal concentration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG), consistent with HMG-containing CR flavonoids being bioavailable, and therefore possessing the potential to interfere with cholesterol synthesis pathways. CR extract appears to be safe to ingest and may reduce cardiovascular risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpobrotus 3acholesterol 3adrinking water 3aflavonoids 3afood consumption 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aleaf extracts 3alipemic effect 3amales 3ameglutol 3arats 3arisk 3asystolic blood pressure 3atissue weight 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aACh 0aCR 0aEDTA 0aHDL 0aHMG 0aHMG-CoA 0aNA 0aSNP 0aSBP 0aUPLC–MS/MS 0aCardiovascular 0aLipid 0aToxicology 0aCarpobrotus spp. 0aPolyphenolic 0aFlavonoid1 aDavies, Noel W.1 aAhuja, Kiran D.K.1 aAdams, Murray J.1 aShing, Cecilia M.1 aNarkowicz, Christian1 aJacobson, Glenn A.1 aGeraghty, Dominic P.0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2014 Apr., v. 66 p.134-139dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245013200185300001600317520196900333592002802302650002202330650000902352650002102361650002102382650002102403650001402424650001502438650000902453650001102462650001402473650001502487650001002502650003702512650000902549650001102558650001102569650002202580650005502602650000902657650001602666650005502682650003502737650001902772700002802791700001702819773008102836856008102917852000902998655001203007IND4470970920221123005136.0141112e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447097092DNAL7 a221130682pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2011.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Sang Chul10aDietary intake of Agaricus bisporus white button mushroom accelerates salivary immunoglobulin A secretion in healthy volunteers  ap. 527-531.  aOBJECTIVE: Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) acts as the first line of adaptive humoral immune defense at mucosal surfaces. A lack of SIgA or the inability to produce antigen-specific SIgA can lead to an increased risk of infections. Dietary intake may improve mucosal immunity by accelerating SIgA secretion. This study investigated the effect of dietary intake of Agaricus bisporus white button mushroom (WBM) on salivary IgA (sIgA) secretion in healthy subjects. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a normal daily diet (control group) or a normal diet with WBM. The subjects in the active group (n = 12, 41.4 ± 11.3 y old) consumed 100 g of blanched WBM daily with their normal diet for 1 wk, whereas those in the control group consumed their normal diet (n = 12, 43.5 ± 12.5 y old) without WBM. Saliva was collected before and after commencement of the study and every week thereafter for 3 wk. Saliva flow rate, sIgA concentration, and osmolality were determined and the sIgA:osmolality ratio and the sIgA secretion rate were calculated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between pre- and postdietary mushroom intakes for all indices in the control group (P > 0.05). In contrast, the mean sIgA secretion rate increased significantly at weeks 1 and 2 by 53% and 56%, respectively, compared with that at week 0 (P < 0.0005) in the WBM intake group and then returned to a baseline level at week 3. Changes in sIgA secretion rate over the intervention period were greater in the WBM group than in the control group without WBM. In both groups, no significant changes in osmolality and saliva IgG were noted. There was, however, a significant increase in the sIgA:osmolality ratio (P < 0.0012), confirming the postdietary WBM-induced sIgA increase. CONCLUSION: The dietary intake of A. bisporus WBM significantly accelerates sIgA secretion, thereby indicating its potential health benefits for improving mucosal immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3adiet 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amucosal immunity 3amushrooms 3aosmolality 3arisk 3asaliva 3asecretion 3avolunteers 2aAdult 2aAgaricusxchemistryximmunology. 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Mucosal 2aImmunoglobulin A, Secretoryxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxprevention & control 2aSalivaxchemistryximmunology. 2aSecretory Rate1 aKoyyalamudi, Sundar Rao1 aPang, Gerald0 tNutrition.g2012 May, v. 28, no. 5 p.527-531dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100001700194245010500211300001600316506007600332520094800408592002801356506003701384650001601421650001901437650001701456650001001473650001101483650002601494653002501520653001601545653002901561653001701590653002301607653005201630653002001682700002301702700002101725700002201746700002201768700002501790773009901815856008801914852000902002655001202011IND60540272420221207125548.0190318e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054027242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.05.0162doi7 aPMC41394112pmcid7 a249573012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkaar, Irene10aPurple anthocyanin colouration on lower (abaxial) leaf surface of Hemigraphis colorata (Acanthaceae)  ap. 141-146.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe functional significance of anthocyanin colouration of lower (abaxial) leaf surfaces is not clear. Two anthocyanins, 5-O-methylcyanidin 3-O-(3″-(β-glucuronopyranosyl)-β-glucopyranoside) (1) and 5-O-methylcyanidin 3-O-β-glucopyranoside (2), were isolated from Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) (Acanthaceae) leaves with strong purple abaxial colouration (2.2 and 0.6mg/gfr.wt., respectively). The glycosyl moiety of 1, the disaccharide 3″-(β-glucuronopyranosyl)-β-glucopyranoside), has previously been reported to occur only in a triterpenoid saponin, lindernioside A. The structural assignment of the aglycone of 1 and 2 is the first complete characterisation of a natural 7-hydroxy-5-methoxyanthocyanidin. Compared to nearly all naturally occurring anthocyanidins, the 5-O-methylation of this anthocyanidin limits the type of possible quinoidal forms of 1 and 2 to be those forms with keto-function in only their 7- and 4′-positions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHemigraphis 3aanthocyanidins 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3aleaves 3atriterpenoid saponins 0aHemigraphis colorata 0aAcanthaceae 0aAbaxial leaf colouration 0aAnthocyanins 0a5-O-Methylcyanidin 0a3″-O-β-Glucuronopyranosyl-β-glucopyranoside 0aQuinoidal forms1 aAdaku, Christopher1 aJordheim, Monica1 aByamukama, Robert1 aKiremire, Bernard1 aAndersen, Øyvind M.0 tPhytochemistry.g2014 Sept., v. 105 p.141-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245019600168300001600364500001900380520167500399592002802074596003602102650002202138650001402160650001502174650000902189650001702198650001402215650001902229650001902248650001802267650001802285650003002303650001202333650001002345650000902355650002102364650001302385650001102398650002102409650002402430650001302454650001302467650001202480700005802492700003002550700002902580700005602609773011302665856008202778852000902860655001202869IND60726174320221119141452.0210202e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072617432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-020-04900-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabbaghi, Ailar10aProtective cellular and mucosal immune responses following nasal administration of a whole gamma-irradiated influenza A (subtype H1N1) vaccine adjuvanted with interleukin-28B in a mouse model  ap. 545-557.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe use of gamma-irradiated influenza A virus (γ-Flu), retains most of the viral structural antigens, represent a promising option for vaccine development. However, despite the high effectiveness of γ-Flu vaccines, the need to incorporate an adjuvant to improve vaccine-mediated protection seems inevitable. Here, we examined the protective efficacy of an intranasal gamma-irradiated HIN1 vaccine co-administered with a plasmid encoding mouse interleukin-28B (mIL-28B) as a novel adjuvant in BALB/c mice. Animals were immunized intranasally three times at one-week intervals with γ-Flu, alone or in combination with the mIL-28B adjuvant, followed by viral challenge with a high lethal dose (10 LD₅₀) of A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) influenza virus. Virus-specific antibody, cellular and mucosal responses, and the balance of cytokines in the spleen IFN-γ, IL-12, and IL-4) and in lung homogenates (IL-6 and IL-10) were measured by ELISA. The lymphoproliferative activity of restimulated spleen cells was also determined by MTT assay. Furthermore, virus production in the lungs of infected mice was estimated using the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)/hemagglutination assay (HA). Our data showed that intranasal immunization with adjuvanted γ-Flu vaccine efficiently promoted humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses and efficiently decreased lung virus titers, all of which are associated with protection against challenge. This combination also reduced IL-6 and IL-10 levels in lung homogenates. The results suggest that IL-28B can enhance the ability of the vaccine to elicit virus-specific immune responses and could potentially be used as an effective adjuvant.  aPublisher supplied data  a1029cPasteur Institute of Iran 3aInfluenza A virus 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3adogs 3aimmunization 3ainfluenza 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3aintranasal administration 3akidneys 3alungs 3amice 3amucosal immunity 3aplasmids 3aspleen 3atoxicity testing 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3avirology 3aviruses1 aZargar, Mohsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3108-56551 aZolfaghari, Mohammad Reza1 aMotamedi-Sedeh, Farahnaz1 aGhaemi, Amir1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7793-29200 tArchives of virology.g2021 Feb., v. 166, no. 2 p.545-557dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04900-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001700162245006000179300001600239500001900255500000900274520208000283592002802363650002902391650001602420650001002436650001402446650002402460650002302484650001302507650002002520650001302540650001502553650001502568650001202583650001702595650001002612650000902622650001302631650001402644650001902658700002202677700001802699773012202717856009702839852000902936655001202945IND60663519620221121010207.0191122e198103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066351962DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1981.00021962007300020014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngle, J.

This study was undertaken to examine antagonistic effects of mycotoxins on growth of Rhizobium japonicum and on nodulation and growth of soybeans [Glycine max (L.)]. Seventeen common fungi were isolated from the surface horizon of an Udollic ochraqualf and examined in laboratory and growth chamber studies to determine effects of these fungi on Rhizobium juponicum struitts USDA 110 and 138. Several fungi were found to be antagonistic towards rhizobia due to mycotoxins which were exuded from the mycelia into the surrounding environment. During preliminary screening experiments Trichoderma viride, Rhizopus nigricans, and Mucor vesiculosis were observed to be consistently antagonistic to R. japonicum. Subsequently, these three fungi were inoculated simultaneously with rhizobia into perlite which was seeded to soybeans. The effect of each fungus on nodulation and growth of the soybeans during culture for 9 weeks was determined. The nodulation of soybeans by strains 110 and 138 was reduced by Trichoderma viride. Nodules per plant for strain 138 were reduced from a control value of 54 to 34. Total nodule weight and N₂(C₂H₂) reduction also decreased, however, no changes were observed in plant shoot and root weight or in total N. Mucor vesiculosis increased nodulation and plant growth, while Rhizopus nigricans had no effect. In non-sterile soil, Trichoderma viride was the only fungal isolate capable of reducing the R. japonicum population. The population was reduced to one tenth that of the control soil. Trichoderma viride also decreased nodule number which was accompanied by a decrease in N₂(C₂H₂) reduction per soybean plant from a control value of 1.07 to 0.65 µmoles/hour. The antagonistic effects of Trichoderma viride on rhizobia1 activity were paralled by decreases in plant root and shoot weights.

Sixty-eight female cats were assessed for pain after ovariohysterectomy. A cohort of 21 cats was examined independently by four raters (two board-certified anesthesiologists and two anesthesia residents) with the CSU-FAPS, and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine inter-rater reliability. Weighted Cohen’s kappa was used to determine inter-rater reliability centered on the ‘need to reassess analgesic plan’ (dichotomous scale). A separate cohort of 47 cats was evaluated independently by two raters (one board-certified anesthesiologist and one veterinary small animal rotating intern) using the CSU-FAPS and the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale (CMPS-Feline), and Spearman rank-order correlation was determined to assess convergent validity. Reliability was interpreted using Altman’s classification as very good, good, moderate, fair and poor. Validity was considered adequate if correlation coefficients were between 0.4 and 0.8. The ICC was 0.61 for anesthesiologists and 0.67 for residents, indicating good reliability. Weighted Cohen’s kappa was 0.79 for anesthesiologists and 0.44 for residents, indicating moderate to good reliability. The Spearman rank correlation indicated a statistically significant (P = 0.0003) positive correlation (0.31; 95% confidence interval 0.14–0.46) between the CSU-FAPS and the CMPS-Feline. The CSU-FAPS showed moderate-to-good inter-rater reliability when used by veterinarians to assess pain level or need to reassess analgesic plan after ovariohysterectomy in cats. The validity fell short of current guidelines for correlation coefficients and further refinement and testing are warranted to improve its performance.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesics 3aanesthesia 3acats 3aconfidence interval 3afemales 3aguidelines 3apain 3aspaying 3aveterinarians 3aColorado1 aGuedes, Alonso1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7980-90181 aGraham, Lynelle1 aGoudie-DeAngelis, Elizabeth1 aWendt-Hornickle, Erin0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2019 Apr., v. 21, no. 4 p.335-339dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X187775063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02209naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245006800167300001600235520057800251592002800829650001400857650002600871650002000897650002800917650002200945650002900967650001500996650003701011650004401048650001001092650002201102653002701124653001301151653003301164653002701197700005101224700001401275700001901289700001701308700002201325700001701347700001301364700002201377700001901399700001701418700001601435700002001451773009901471856008801570852000901658655001201667IND60540272620221117202743.0190318e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054027262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.05.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Bin10aγ-Hydroxynitrile glucosides from the seeds of Prinsepia utilis  ap. 135-140.  aγ-Hydroxynitrile glucosides (prinsepicyanosides A–E) were isolated alongside 11 known compounds from seeds of Prinsepia utilis Royle.

M.q(Daniel M.),10aRoad marking coverage by volcanic ash: an experimental approach  ap. 1348.  aCoverage of road markings by volcanic ash is one of the most commonly reported impacts to surface transportation networks during volcanic ashfall. Even minimal accumulation can obscure markings, leading to driver disorientation, diminished flow capacity and an increase in accidents. Such impacts may recur due to repeated direct ashfall (i.e. during prolonged eruptions) and/or due to the re-suspension of ash by wind, water, traffic or other human activities, and subsequent secondary deposition on the road surface. Cleaning is thus required to restore and maintain road network functionality. Previous studies have not constrained ash accumulation measurements to inform road cleaning initiation or plans for safe road operations in environments containing ash. This study uses a laboratory approach with digital image analysis to quantify the percentage of white road marking coverage by three types of volcanic ash with coarse, medium and fine particle size distributions. We find that very small accumulations of ash are responsible for road marking coverage and suggest that around 8 % visible white paint or less would result in the road markings being hidden. Road markings are more easily covered by fine-grained ash, with ash area densities of ~30 g m⁻² (estimated at <0.1 mm surface thickness) potentially causing markings to be obscured. For the coarse ash in our study, road marking coverage occurs at area densities of ~1000–2200 g m⁻² (~1.0–2.5 mm depth) with ash colour and line paint characteristics causing some of the variation. We suggest that risk management measures such as vehicle speed reduction and the initiation of road cleaning activities should be taken at or before the lower thresholds as our experiments are conducted at a relatively short horizontal distance and the ability to observe road markings when driving will be comparatively reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3acleaning 3acolor 3adigital images 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3aparticle size distribution 3arisk management 3atraffic 3avolcanic ash 3awind1 aWilson, Thomas M.1 aGomez, Christopher0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Oct., v. 75, no. 20 p.1348-1348dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-6154-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009100208300001600299500001900315520118900334592002801523596008301551650002301634650001801657650002101675650001801696650001701714650001401731650001101745650001301756650001801769650001401787650003101801650001201832651001501844651001101859653001901870653002001889700002001909700006101929773013001990856008202120852000902202655001202211IND60728824320221121190918.0210224e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072882432DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1297-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPastrana, Ana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6540-457310aColonization of Wild Blackberry Plants in California by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. mori  ap. 264-267.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. mori, the causal agent of Fusarium wilt of blackberry, was first reported in California and Mexico in 2016. A limited survey of the population revealed this pathogen to be one of the most diverse formae speciales of F. oxysporum. We explored the possibility that strains of F. oxysporum pathogenic to commercial blackberry could also be recovered from wild blackberry (Rubus spp.) in California. For this purpose, wild Rubus species in blackberry nurseries, fruit production fields, and nearby areas were collected between 2017 and 2019. Thirty-four isolates of F. oxysporum were recovered from asymptomatic Rubus armeniacus and Rubus ursinus plants. Based on sequence of the translation elongation factor 1-α, somatic compatibility, and pathogenicity to blackberry, 16 isolates were confirmed as F. oxysporum f. sp. mori. These isolates were associated with three somatic compatibility groups, one of which was first identified in this study. Recovery of the pathogen confirmed that wild blackberry plants can act as a reservoir of inoculum of F. oxysporum f. sp. mori and that it can move from wild blackberry plants to commercial cultivars or vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data  aHatch project CA-D-PPA-6699-HcUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3aRubus armeniacus 3aRubus ursinus 3ablackberries 3acultivars 3afruits 3ainoculum 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apeptide elongation factors 3asurveys 3aCalifornia 3aMexico 0areservoir host 0awild blackberry1 aWatson, Dean C.1 aGordon, Thomas R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1715-65090 tPlant disease.g2021 Feb., v. 105, no. 2 p.264-267dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1297-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007900162300001600241520082600257592002801083650001601111650001401127650001701141650003801158650001901196650004301215650001101258650001601269650002601285650001001311650000901321650004301330650001601373650001501389650004001404650001401444653001901458653001601477653000801493653000801501653001801509653001701527700001701544700001801561700001301579700001901592700001401611700001301625700001301638773011101651856008201762852000901844655001201853IND60541924420221120171342.0190401e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054192442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2014.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaoli14aThe non-cytotoxicity characterization of rebaudioside A as a food additive  ap. 334-340.  aTo evaluate the cytotoxicity of high-purity rebaudioside A (reb A, 99.16%) as a food ingredient, a combination of several methods, including tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT), lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time PCR (qPCR), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) were used to test the cytotoxicity of reb A on the human cells HT-29 and T84, as well as liver and spleen cells from mice.

Here, we reveal that supplementation with the NAD⁺ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) markedly reprograms metabolic and stress-response pathways that decline with aging through inhibition of the clock repressor PER2. NR enhances BMAL1 chromatin binding genome-wide through PER2ᴷ⁶⁸⁰ deacetylation, which in turn primes PER2 phosphorylation within a domain that controls nuclear transport and stability and that is mutated in human advanced sleep phase syndrome. In old mice, dampened BMAL1 chromatin binding, transcriptional oscillations, mitochondrial respiration rhythms, and late evening activity are restored by NAD⁺ repletion to youthful levels with NR. These results reveal effects of NAD⁺ on metabolism and the circadian system with aging through the spatiotemporal control of the molecular clock.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3acircadian rhythm 3agenomics 3ahumans 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 3amice 3amitochondria 3anicotinamide 3aphosphorylation 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 0acircadian 0aclock 0aNAD+ 0aSIRT1 0anicotinamide riboside 0anicotinamide mononucleotide 0aheat shock factor 1 0aaging 0aliver 0atranscriptomics1 aHong, Heekyung1 aWeidemann, Benjamin J.1 aRamsey, Kathryn M.1 aAffinati, Alison H.1 aSchmidt, Mark S.1 aCedernaes, Jonathan1 aOmura, Chiaki1 aBraun, Rosemary1 aLee, Choogon1 aBrenner, Charles1 aPeek, Clara Bien1 aBas, Yosef,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1602-86010 tMolecular cell.g2020 June 04, v. 78, no. 5 p.835-849.e7dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05391naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011800167300001200285500001900297520348900316592002803805596007503833650002103908650004003929650002103969650002803990650001504018650001404033650002104047650001804068650001004086650002204096650001504118650001804133650001404151650003004165650001404195650003704209650001904246650002204265651001004287651002304297653001704320653001504337653002804352700001904380700001604399700001204415700001904427700001804446700001604464700002004480700005504500773013004555856008304685852000904768655001204777IND60728824420221121190854.0210224e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072882442DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1312-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Yao-Yao10aFirst Report of Xanthomonas albilineans Causing Leaf Scald on Two Chewing Cane Clones in Zhejiang Province, China  ap. 485.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, outbreaks of leaf scald have been reported in two chewing cane clones, ‘Guangdong Huangpi’ and ‘Taoshang Guozhe’, in Zhejiang province, China. From May to July 2019, we collected symptomatic samples from Guangdong Huangpi (eight leaves and three stalks) from four farms in Wenling and Taoshang Guozhe (eight leaves and five stalks) from three farms in Ruian, Zhejiang province. Leaves in young plants exhibited white pencil-line streaks as well as partial or complete chlorosis of the leaf blade. Internal symptoms included an orange-red discoloration of the vascular bundles at the basal nodes of the stalk and discoloration extension into the internodes. Leaf and stalk tissues were used for bacterial isolation and purification on XAS medium, which is selective for Xanthomonas albilineans (Davis et al. 1994), using the streak plate method to obtain 24 isolates (Lin et al. 2018). Circular, convex, smooth, shiny, and yellow colonies were isolated from all the samples. The pathogenicity of two isolates, XaCN30 from Guangdong Huangpi and XaCN43 from Taoshang Guozhe, was confirmed with Koch’s postulates according to the protocol reported by Lin et al. (2018). The incidences of diseased plants (56 and 63%) were observed in individual host clones at 28 days postinoculation with isolates XaCN30 and XaCN43, respectively. Furthermore, all isolates were confirmed as X. albilineans via molecular methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was conducted for all 24 isolates using the primer pairs XgyrB1F/XgyrB1R2 (Ntambo et al. 2019) and XAF1/XAR1 (Wang et al. 1999), which target the gyrB (encoding the b subunit of the DNA gyrase) and abc (encoding an ABC transporter) genes, and generate 904- and 608-bp amplicons, respectively. The PCR fragments were cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). For each isolate, three single colonies of transformed Escherichia coli DH5α carrying the targeted fragment were sequenced. These sequences were deposited into GenBank with accession numbers MT776053 to MT776059 and MT776061 to MT776077 for gyrB gene and MT776098 to MT776104 and MT776106 to MT776122 for abc gene. Based on the two concatenated DNA sequences of our 24 isolates, compared with 27 previously reported X. albilineans isolates obtained from the GenBank database, pairwise sequence identity analysis revealed that all 24 isolates from Zhejiang province had 99.4 to 100% identity with each other, 99.6 to 100% identity with 14 published domestic isolates, and 98.3 to 100% identity with 13 foreign isolates. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis with MEGA 7.0 (Kumar et al. 2016) showed that the isolates from Zhejiang province clustered into two distinct groups. One group consisted of 25 Chinese isolates (including all 11 isolates from Wenling) along with four isolates from the French West Indies (GPE PC73, GPE PC17, GPE PC86, and MTQ032) and one isolate from the United States (XaFL07-1), which were assigned to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis group B (Davis et al. 1997; Pieretti et al. 2012). A putative group was also proposed, which included all 13 isolates from Ruian, indicating that isolates from Ruian are distinct from the isolates isolated from other Chinese sugarcane-planting areas including Wenling. We conclude that leaf scald disease in local clones of chewing cane are caused by X. albilineans in Zhejiang province in China, which will be helpful for leaf scald management in chewing cane, a cash crop.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-170302cEarmarked Fund from the China Agriculture Research System 3aABC transporters 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aEscherichia coli 3aXanthomonas albilineans 3acash crops 3achlorosis 3aconcatenated DNA 3adiscoloration 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3aleaf blade 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotocols 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3ascald diseases 3asequence analysis 3aChina 3aFrench West Indies 0achewing cane 0aleaf scald 0apathogen identification1 aZhang, Yu-Qing1 aXu, Zhe-Xin1 aLin, Yi1 aMao, Ling-Rong1 aWang, Wen-Hua1 aDeng, Zu-Hu1 aHuang, Mei-Ting1 aGao, San-Ji1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3442-84700 tPlant disease.g2021 Feb., v. 105, no. 2 p.485-485dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1312-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245003300165300001800198520093700216592002801153650000801181650001501189650001801204650001001222650003101232650001801263650001201281650001801293650001901311650000701330650002601337650001501363700002901378773014201407856007401549852000901623655001201632IND60670958620221122004042.0191002e20140611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095862DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb00171k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaminade, Anne-Marie10aDendrimers for drug delivery  ap. 4055-4066.  aDue to their nanometric size, dendrimers have been considered as potentially suitable as new vehicles for drug delivery since their infancy. The association of a dendrimer and a drug may occur in different ways, either through covalent or non-covalent interactions. A non-covalent interaction can be the simple encapsulation inside dendrimers that enhances the solubility of lipophilic drugs in water, or electrostatic interactions between the surface and charged drugs (or DNA, RNA, or siRNA). The covalent association may occur through stable bonds, in particular for dendrimers that are considered as active per se, or through cleavable bonds that should be cleaved only when reaching the target (often cancerous cells). In addition, the full structure of the dendrimer can be disassembled under the influence of a trigger such as pH variations. This review will present these strategies and their consequences for drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adendrimers 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3ainfancy 3alipophilicity 3aneoplasm cells 3apH 3asmall interfering RNA 3asolubility1 aTurrin, Cédric-Olivier,0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 June 11, v. 2, no. 26 p.4055-4066dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb00171k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245016500164500001400329520141700343592002801760650002501788650002601813650002301839650001101862650000901873650002101882650001001903650001901913650001101932650001401943650000901957650001901966650001201985650002201997650001802019650002402037700002402061700001802085700001802103700002202121773012202143856008002265852000902345655001202354IND60711814520221121030720.0200928e20200823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071181452DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens90906912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoser, Sarah 10aCampylobacter jejuni from Canine and Bovine Cases of Campylobacteriosis Express High Antimicrobial Resistance Rates against (Fluoro)quinolones and Tetracyclines  aNAL-light  aCampylobacter (C.) spp. from poultry is the main source of foodborne human campylobacteriosis, but diseased pets and cattle shedding Campylobacter spp. may contribute sporadically as a source of human infection. As fluoroquinolones are one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe human campylobacteriosis, the resistance rates of C. jejuni and C. coli from poultry against antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, are monitored within the European program on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in livestock. However, much less is published on the AMR rates of C.jejuni and C. coli from pets and cattle. Therefore, C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from diseased animals were tested phenotypically for AMR, and associated AMR genes or mutations were identified by whole genome sequencing. High rates of resistance to (fluoro)quinolones (41%) and tetracyclines (61.1%) were found in C. jejuni (n = 29/66). (Fluoro)quinolone resistance was associated with the known point mutation in the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of gyrA, and tetracycline resistance was mostly caused by the tet(O) gene. These high rates of resistance, especially to critically important antibiotics in C. jejuni and C. coli, are worrisome not only in veterinary medicine. Efforts to preserve the efficacy of important antimicrobial treatment options in human and veterinary medicine have to be strengthened in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aantibiotic resistance 3acampylobacteriosis 3acattle 3adogs 3afluoroquinolones 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3apathogens 3apets 3apoint mutation 3apoultry 3asequence analysis 3atetracyclines 3aveterinary medicine1 aSeth-Smith, Helena 1 aEgli, Adrian 1 aKittl, Sonja 1 aOveresch, Gudrun 0 tPathogens.g2020 Aug. 23, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens90906913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245007700161300001800238520086300256592002801119650001401147650001101161650003301172650000901205650002101214650002001235650002301255700002101278700001901299700002501318773014201343856007401485852000901559655001201568IND60670958920221121232846.0191002e20140319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095892DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb00176a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Choonghyun10aTemperature-triggered shape-transformations in layer-by-layer microtubes  ap. 2088-2092.  aOne-dimensional layer-by-layer (LbL) nano- and microtubes have been extensively studied for energy and biomedical applications. Here, we report a temperature-triggered transformation in shape for LbL microtubes consisting of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). PAH/PAA microtubes were assembled onto porous sacrificial templates. Released microtubes transform to closed ellipsoids upon heating in water. On the other hand, unreleased microtubes (remaining within the template) exhibit a completely different behavior in which periodic perforations appear, suggestive of Rayleigh instabilities. In both cases, the transformations occurred near and above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the hydrated PAH/PAA LbL assembly, suggesting that the transformation in shape is tied to the thermal properties of the LbL assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aenergy 3aglass transition temperature 3aheat 3apolyacrylic acid 3apolyallylamines 3athermal properties1 aVidyasagar, Ajay1 aHearn, Katelin1 aLutkenhaus, Jodie L.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Mar. 19, v. 2, no. 15 p.2088-2092dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb00176a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245014000160500001400300520158700314592002801901650002001929650002101949650001901970650001401989650001402003650001402017650001602031650001702047650001902064650002802083650002102111650001402132650002202146650002602168650002302194650001702217650002702234650001102261650001402272650001402286650001102300650001702311650002202328650002802350650003702378650001702415700001502432700001602447700001702463700001702480700001302497773012202510856008002632852000902712655001202721IND60711814720221121030705.0200928e20200823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071181472DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens90906932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Lin 10aGiardia duodenalis Induces Apoptosis in Intestinal Epithelial Cells via Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Mitochondrial Pathway In Vitro  aNAL-light  aThe intestinal protozoan parasite, Giardia duodenalis, infects a large number of people in the world annually. Giardia infection has been considered a negative effect on intestinal epithelial cell growth, while the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. Here we evaluated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptotic events in Giardia trophozoites-stimulated Caco-2 cells via fluorescence microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry, western blot, and cell counting kit-8 analyses. The results showed that Giardia trophozoite treatment could induce lactate dehydrogenase release and Caco-2 cell apoptosis. The ROS levels were increased post treatment. The observed typical characteristics of mitochondria damage include significant swelling and degeneration of matrix and cristae. After trophozoite treatment, the level of Bax protein expression was increased, while Bcl-2 protein decreased. Trophozoite stimulation also led to reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and this process was accompanied by activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 cleavage. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS inhibitor, reversed G. duodenalis-induced Caco-2 cell apoptosis. Taken together, we indicated that G. duodenalis could induce Caco-2 cell apoptosis through a ROS- and mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent pathway. This study furthers our understanding of the cellular mechanism of the interaction between Giardia trophozoites and host cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGiardia lamblia 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylcysteine 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-9 3acell growth 3acytochrome c 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahuman cell lines 3ainfection 3aintestinal mucosa 3alactate dehydrogenase 3amembrane potential 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxygen 3aparasites 3apathogens 3apeople 3apretreatment 3aprotein synthesis 3areactive oxygen species 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atrophozoites1 aFang, Rui 1 aWei, Ziyan 1 aWu, Jingxue 1 aLi, Xiaoyun 1 aLi, Wei 0 tPathogens.g2020 Aug. 23, v. 9, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens90906933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008900166300001600255520158700271592002801858650002401886650001301910650001601923650001301939650001001952650001501962650001501977650001601992650001002008650001502018650001002033650001402043650001502057650001402072650001102086650001102097653001402108653001702122653001502139653002302154653001102177700002602188700002102214700001502235773014102250856007802391852000902469655001202478IND60563552420221118004559.0170224e20161110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056355242DNAL7 a10.1139/apnm-2016-04452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBargh, Melissa J.10aWhy do team-sport athletes drink fluid in excess when exercising in cool conditions?  ap. 271-277.  aThis study assessed the potential physiological and perceptual drivers of fluid intake and thirst sensation during intermittent exercise.

Fluid intake displayed a relationship with pre-POsm (r = –0.640, p = 0.046), prethermal comfort (r = 0.651; p = –0.041), ΔS[Na⁺] (r = 0.816, p = 0.004), and ΔPV (r = 0.740; p = 0.014). ΔThirst sensation displayed a relationship with premouth dryness (r = 0.861, p = 0.006) and Δmouth dryness (r = 0.878, p = 0.004). Yet a weak positive relationship between Δthirst sensation and fluid intake was observed (r = 0.085, p = 0.841). These data observed in an ambient temperature of 13.6 ± 0.9 °C, suggest team-sport athletes drink in excess of fluid homeostasis requirements and thirst sensation in cool conditions; however, this was not influenced by thermal discomfort.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aathletes 3ablood serum 3aexercise 3agames 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3ahomeostasis 3amales 3ametabolism 3amouth 3anutrition 3aosmolality 3asensation 3asodium 3athirst 0ahydration 0ahyponatremia 0ateam sport 0athermal discomfort 0athirst1 aKing, Roderick F.G.J.1 aGray, Michael P.1 aJones, Ben0 tApplied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism.g2016 Nov. 10, v. 42, no. 3 p.271-277dNRC Research PresswJournal:23115x1715-53207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2016-04453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245014400202300001800346520166600364592002802030650002502058650001002083650001402093650001702107650002202124650001102146650002002157650001002177650002802187650001102215650001702226650001802243650002102261650001302282650002102295650001802316650002202334650001302356650001402369650002002383650001302403653002502416653002502441653001302466653001002479653001502489700002202504700001902526700001902545700001302564773014802577856008002725852000902805655001202814IND60604267520221118062024.0180716e20180327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060426752DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b003832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jing-yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8888-423112aA Comparative Proteome Approach Reveals Metabolic Changes Associated with Flammulina velutipes Mycelia in Response to Cold and Light Stress  ap. 3716-3725.  aIn some industrial processes, cold and light stresses are recognized as two important environmental triggers for the transformation of mycelia into fruit-bodies via intermediate primordia in Flammulina velutipes cultivation. To gain insights into the mechanism of regulation of F. velutipes mycelia in response to cold and light stress, proteins expressed abundantly and characteristically at particular stress states were investigated by using the isobaric tags for the relative and absolute quantitation labeling technique. Among the 1046 nonredundant proteins identified with a high degree of confidence, 264 proteins, which were detected as differentially expressed proteins, were associated with 176 specific KEGG pathways. In-depth data analysis revealed that the regulatory network underlying the cold and light response mechanisms of F. velutipes mycelia was complex and multifaceted, as it included varied functions such as rapid energy supply, the biosynthesis of lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and γ-aminobutyric acid, the calcium signal transduction process, dynein-dependent actin and microtubule cytoskeleton formation, autolysis, oxidative stress adaptation, pigment secretion, tissue and organ morphogenesis, and other interesting stress-related processes. Insights into the proteins might shed light on an intuitive understanding of the cold and light stress response mechanism underlying the fruiting processes of F. velutipes. Furthermore, the data might also provide further insights into the stress response mechanism of macro-fungi and valuable information for scientific improvement of some mushroom cultivation techniques in practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlammulina velutipes 3aactin 3aautolysis 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium signaling 3aenergy 3afruiting bodies 3afungi 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3alysine 3amicrotubules 3amorphogenesis 3amushroom growing 3amycelium 3aoxidative stress 3aphenylalanine 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteome 3asecretion 3astress response 3atyrosine 0aFlammulina velutipes 0aenvironmental stress 0aproteome 0aiTRAQ 0aLC−MS/MS1 aChang, Ming-chang1 aMeng, Jun-long1 aFeng, Cui-ping1 aWang, Yu0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Mar. 27, v. 66, no. 14 p.3716-3725dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b003833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009900165300001500264520037400279592002800653650001300681650002000694650001600714650001900730651001000749653001900759653001400778653001800792653000800810653001700818700001700835773009500852856008400947852000901031655001201040IND60123069720221121051357.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012306972DNAL7 a10.1080/00305316.2014.9597862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Wanqi14aThe Helina guadrum group (Diptera: Muscidae) from China with descriptions of three new species  ap. 92-101.  aThree new species of muscids belonging to the Helina guadrum group from China, namely Helina exigua Xue and Wang, Helina ningxiaensis Xue and Sun and Helina spinisurstyla Xue and Sun are described.

RESULTS: Combination of precursor-feeding and altered growth conditions were used to mine new biomolecules. Strain JA2 utilised L-phenylalanine as sole source of nitrogen and showed pigments production only under phenylalanine-amended aerobic cultures. Stable isotope based precursor feeding studies indicated the blue pigment consists of 4-phenyl rings derived from L-phenylalanine. The purified blue pigment displayed characteristic visible-absorption and pH-dependent color variations. Precursor-feeding under altered growth conditions activated the plausible novel aromatic pigment production in strain JA2. CONCLUSION: Our approach unraveled the previously unknown pigment synthesis in strain JA2 and demonstrated the potential of mining strategy in discovering the hidden secondary metabolite repertoire in microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data  a(09/414(1160/2018-EMR-I) Govt. of INIDAcCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research  aTATA-Innovative (BT/HRD/35/01/02/2015)cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology  aGovernment of INDIAcDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology 3aRubrivivax 3abiosynthesis 3acolor 3amicroorganisms 3amining 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphenylalanine 3apigments 3asecondary metabolites 3astable isotopes1 aMohammed, Mujahid1 aChintalapati, Sasikala1 aChintalapati, Venkata Ramana0 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 6-7 p.813-822dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-019-02682-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013400166300001400300520133500314592002801649650001301677650001701690650002301707650001001730650001101740650001601751650001801767650001401785650001301799650001401812650002001826650001001846653001301856653002101869653001601890653001001906653002001916653001701936700002201953700001801975773011501993856008502108852000902193655001202202IND60087127020221120073548.0190416e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008712702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranke, Jan10aExploring gaps in our knowledge on Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes – Updates on complex heterogeneity, ecology, and pathogenicity  ap. 11-25.  aThe Lyme borreliosis complex is a heterogeneous group of tick-borne spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) that are distributed all over the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. Due to the usage of new methods for phylogenetic analysis, this group has expanded rapidly during the past 5 years. Along with this development, the number of Borrelia spp. regarded as pathogenic to humans also increased. Distribution areas as well as host and vector ranges of Lyme borreliosis agents turned out to be much wider than previously thought. Furthermore, there is evidence that ticks, reservoir hosts, and patients can be coinfected with multiple Borrelia spp. or other tick-borne pathogens, which indicates a need to establish new and well-defined diagnostic and therapeutic standards for Lyme borreliosis. This review gives a broad overview on the occurrence of Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes worldwide with particular emphasis on their vectors and vertebrate hosts as well as their pathogenic potential and resultant problems in diagnosis and treatment. Against the background that many issues regarding distribution, species identity, ecology, pathogenicity, and coinfections are still unsolved, the purpose of this article is to reveal directions for future research on the Lyme borreliosis complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBorrelia 3aLyme disease 3adisease reservoirs 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amethodology 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3atemperate zones 3aticks 0aBorrelia 0aLyme borreliosis 0aGenospecies 0aTicks 0aReservoir hosts 0aCoinfections1 aHildebrandt, Anke1 aDorn, Wolfram0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2013 Feb., v. 4, no. 1-2 p.11-25dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245010500211300001400316520128000330592002801610650001601638650002401654650001101678650002101689650001801710650001201728650001501740650001401755650003101769650001301800650001701813650003101830650001301861650001401874700001801888700005801906700006301964700002802027700001902055700002102074700001802095773008502113856008402198852000902282655001202291IND60591575320221120064852.0180320e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059157532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.03.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFelix, Lindsey C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7335-979210aPhysicochemical properties of functionalized carbon-based nanomaterials and their toxicity to fishes  ap. 78-89.  aChemical functionalization to tailor surface properties of nanomaterials (NMs) is expected to broaden their scope of potential applications but may also be used to modify NM toxicity. We have examined the physicochemical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with varying degrees of carboxylic acid group functionalization, two types of lignin-wrapped SWCNTs, as well as nonfunctionalized SWCNTs. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to 1, 10, 50, 100 or 200 mg/L functionalized and nonfunctionalized SWCNTs for up to 72 h; measured endpoints included survival, hatching success, and alteration in gene expression. We have also characterized carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and examined their effects both in vivo using zebrafish and in vitro using three channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) cell lines. While nonfunctionalized SWCNTs did not affect survival or hatch of embryos, carboxylic acid functionalized SWCNTs accelerated hatching and lignin-wrapped SWCNTs both decreased survival and delayed hatch at all time points tested. Carboxylated CNC exposure decreased the viability of 1G8 and 28S.3 catfish cells. We suggest that surface functionality affects SWCNT characteristics and plays a key role in determining their toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aIctalurus punctatus 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarboxylation 3acatfish 3acell lines 3acellulose 3agene expression regulation 3ahatching 3ananocrystals 3aphysicochemical properties 3atoxicity 3aviability1 aEde, James D.1 aSnell, Dana A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7796-35211 aOliveira, Taiane M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5276-08941 aMartinez-Rubi, Yadienka1 aSimard, Benoit1 aLuong, John H.T.1 aGoss, Greg G.0 tCarbon.g2016 Aug., v. 104 p.78-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2016.03.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245014300158300002000301500001900321520111400340592002801454650001501482650001401497650001401511650002301525650002701548650002201575650001501597650001601612700002601628700002501654700002001679700002101699773012401720856007401844852000901918655001201927IND60696003720221120223340.0200521e20200519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069600372DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra03557b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUegaki, Kaoru10aDonor–acceptor random regioregular π-conjugated copolymers based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) with unsymmetrical monothienoisoindigo units  ap. 19034-19040.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDonor–acceptor π-conjugated random copolymers based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene), rr-P3HT, with unsymmetrical monothienoisoindigo moieties were obtained by direct arylation polycondensation of 2-bromo-3-hexylthiophene with unsymmetrical monothienoisoindigo motifs under the optimized conditions [palladium-immobilized on thiol-modified silica gel with chloride counter anions, PITS-Cl (2.5 mol%), PivOH (1.0 equiv.), K₂CO₃ (3.0 equiv.), DMAc, 100 °C, 24 h]. Incorporation of unsymmetrical monothienoisoindigo electron-acceptor units into the polymers tuned their highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, which were close to those of the hole transport material (PEDOT) and electron transport material (PCBM), respectively, in thin-film organic solar cells. Alkyl chains of the unsymmetrical monothienoisoindigo units in the polymers tuned their macrostructural order, resulting in the observation of crystalline patterns and specific absorption peaks in thin films. An organic solar cell containing the most crystalline random copolymer showed an efficiency of 1.91%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aarylation 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3acondensation reactions 3aelectron transfer 3asilica gel 3asolar cells1 aNakabayashi, Kazuhiro1 aYamamoto, Shin'ichi,1 aKoizumi, Toshio1 aHayashi, Shotaro0 tRSC advances.g2020 May 19, v. 10, no. 32 p.19034-19040dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra03557b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04035naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245021200177300001600389500001500405520257700420592002802997650001803025650001903043650002303062650001603085650001303101650001103114650001803125650001003143650001203153651001403165651001003179651001003189651001003199651001203209653001803221653003603239653003203275653001403307653001503321653001003336700001803346773009603364856008403460852000903544655001203553IND60123069920221121063319.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012306992DNAL7 a10.1080/00305316.2014.9597882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaman, Anantanarayanan10aRemarkable gall-inducing Beesonia dipterocarpi (Hemiptera: Beesoniidae) and their equally remarkable galls on Dipterocarpus tuberculatus (Dipterocarpaceae) described from the Indian subcontinent in the 1920s  ap. 108-122.  a2019-12-04  aCyril Beeson in his volume Ecology and control of forest insects of India and neighbouring countries , published in 1941, refers to the remarkable galls developing on the shoots of Dipterocarpus tuberculatus . These galls were found in Burma (Myanmar) in the 1920s and sent to the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun (FRI-D), India for determining the inducing agents. The entomology division staff, FRI-D, determined that the agents were coccoids (then referred to as ‘coccids’) of Insecta, Hemiptera. Edward Green who knew the coccoids of the Indian subcontinent well, because of his studies of the insects of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) earlier, determined the inducing coccids as Beesonia dipterocarpi in 1926 publishing his paper in the Bulletin of Entomological Research (BER) (London) in 1926. He named the coccoid B. dipterocarpi after Beeson and the host plant Dipterocarpus . Due to the complexity in the morphology of the coccoid, Green published his amended notes on B. dipterocarpi in BER in 1928. Green did not assign B. dipterocarpi to any family of the Coccoidea (‘Coccidae’ then). Gordon Ferris, Stanford, California, erected Beesoniidae in 1950, as a distinct family based on his finding of a novelty Beesonia napiformis from Quercus acutissima in China. From the 1980s, the Beesoniidae, a family of remarkable coccoids, has been in the limelight, thanks to the work of Sadao Takagi, Sapporo, Japan. Several species of the Beesoniidae, both suspected due to their affinity to the tropical Dipterocarpaceae and confirmed, are known today. In such a context, we, the authors of this paper, got access to the correspondence between the forest officials of Burma in the 1920s and the staff of the entomology division of FRI-D, then led by Beeson, pertaining to the finding of the Chrysanthemum flower-like galls on the shoots of D. tuberulatus . In this paper, we have chronicled the events that led to the description of these galls and the inducing insects, using copies of letters archived at FRI-D in the context of this material. At appropriate points, we have inserted our remarks, in the light of the present understanding of galls in general and those induced by the Beesoniidae in particular, to explain the complex morphology of the galls of D. tuberculatus induced by B. dipterocarpi . Host relationships of the Beesoniidae are equally complex and confusing. This paper, hopefully, will trigger interest in entomologists, so that this group of insects will be investigated more closely and their biological details are clarified in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum 3aforest insects 3aQuercus acutissima 3ahost plants 3aCoccidae 3ashoots 3aDipterocarpus 3agalls 3aforests 3aSri Lanka 3aChina 3aIndia 3aJapan 3aMyanmar 0aC.F.C.

As such, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of hDPSCs toward the neuronal fate. Notch signaling plays key roles in neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) maintenance and prevention of their differentiation. The aim of this study was to address the effects of Notch signaling inhibition on neurosphere formation of hDPSCs and neuronal differentiation of hDPSCs-neurospheres. RESULTS: hDPSCs were isolated from third molar teeth. The cultivated hDPSCs highly expressed CD90 and CD44 and minimally presented CD34 and CD45 surface markers. The osteo/adipogenic differentiation of hDPSCs was documented. hDPSCs were cultured in neural induction medium and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-Sphenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was applied to impede Notch signaling during transformation into spheres or on the formed neurospheres. Our results showed that the size and number of neurospheres decreased and the expression profile of nestin, sox1 and pax6 genes reduced provided DAPT. Treatment of the formed neurospheres with DAPT resulted in the cleaved Notch1 reduction, G0/G1 arrest and a decline in L-lactate production. DAPT significantly reduced hes1 and hey1 genes, while ascl1 and neurogenin2 expressions augmented. The number of MAP2 positive cells improved in the DAPT-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated the Notch activity in hDPSCs-neurospheres. DAPT treatment positively regulated proneural genes expression and increased neuronal-like differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data  a9223cArdabil University of Medical Sciences 3aadipogenesis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3agenes 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3aneurons 3astem cells 3atooth pulp1 aGhasemi Hamidabadi, Hatef1 aNiapour, Nazila1 aMohammadi, Perham1 aSharifi Pasandi, Marzieh1 aMalekzadeh, Vadoud0 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 6-7 p.873-887dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-019-02687-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245005300178300001600231500000900247520108600256592002801342650001601370650001301386650001801399650001001417650001701427650001501444650002101459650001501480650001301495650001301508650002101521650000901542650002401551650001101575700001701586773014701603856009601750852000901846655001201855IND60668772820221121232714.0191125e196305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066877282DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1963.03615995002700030029x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, H.

Three lysimeter soils, previously fertilized with N¹⁵-enriched N, were studied. Methods of fractionating soil N were modified to permit estimation of the isotopic ratio as well as the N content of the different fractions. Soil N was fractionated into: exchangeable NH₄⁺ plus NO₃⁻, fixed NH₄⁺, N in acid hydrolyzate, and acid-insoluble humin N. The N in acid hydrolyzate was further separated into the alkali-labile N and the alkali-stable N. The alkali-labile N consisted of hydrolyzed NH₄⁺ and amino sugar N. The alkali-stable N was divided into soluble N, which included the amino acid N, and acid-soluble but alkali-insoluble humin N. Validity of the classification was discussed. Usefulness of N¹⁵ data was also evaluated. Estimation of the distribution of added N showed that over 90% of added N in soils was found in the hydrolytic products of soil organic matter, mainly as amino acid N, amino sugar N, and other soluble N.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aammonium 3afractionation 3ahumin 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3aisotope labeling 3alysimeters 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3asugars1 aKurtz, L.

Four composites were studied, EVA with aluminum hydroxide (ATH), EVA with ATH and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), EVA with ATH and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and EVA with all three components. Tensile testing showed nearly identical results for the EVA/ATH and EVA/ATH/MoS2 compounds, while the EVA/ATH/GNPs compound had higher mechanical properties. The compound containing all three components showed further enhanced mechanical properties, indicating that a synergy was established. This was further confirmed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) where GNPs were seen to increase the dispersion of the MoS2 and ATH components within the polymer matrix. Cone calorimetry test clearly showed a large decrease in heat release rate when GNPs were added, which was further enhanced by adding GNPs and MoS2 together. Application of the UL-94 test showed that only the compound containing 36 wt% of ATH and 2 wt% each of MoS2 and GNPs can achieve the UL-94 V0 rating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum hydroxide 3acalorimetry 3aethylene-vinyl acetate 3aflame retardants 3agraphene 3aheat 3amechanical properties 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananocomposites 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aMolybdenum disulfide 0aGraphene nanoplatelets 0aFlame retardant 0aMechanical properties1 aXue, Yuan1 aZuo, Xianghao1 aZhang, Linxi1 aYang, Zhenhua1 aZhou, Yuchen1 aMarmorat, Clement1 aHe, Shan1 aRafailovich, Miriam0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2017.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010100169300001400270520125600284592002801540650001601568650001601584650001701600650001901617650001701636650001401653650001401667650001601681650001301697650001901710650001401729650001801743650002101761650001801782650001601800650001901816650001701835650001001852650002101862650001601883650001901899650001701918650001501935700001701950700005601967700002602023700001302049773011302062856008202175852000902257655001202266IND60543554920221118173415.0190411e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054355492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2014.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Luca, Vincenzo10aMaking iridoids/secoiridoids and monoterpenoid indole alkaloids: progress on pathway elucidation  ap. 35-42.  aMembers of the Acanthaceae, Apocynaceae, Bignoniaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Gentianaceae, Labiatae, Lamiaceae, Loasaceae, Loganiaceae, Oleaceae, Plantaginaceae, Rubiaceae, Saxifragaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Valerianaceae, and Verbenaceae plant families are well known to accumulate thousands of bioactive iridoids/secoiridoids while the Apocynaceae, Loganiaceae and Rubiaceae families also accumulate thousands of bioactive monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), mostly derived from the secologanin and tryptamine precursors. Several large-scale RNA-sequencing projects have greatly advanced the tools available for identifying candidate genes whose gene products are involved in the biosynthesis of iridoids/MIAs. This has led to the rapid comparative bioinformatics guided elucidation of several key remaining steps in secologanin biosynthesis as well as other steps in MIA biosynthesis. The availability of these tools will permit broad scale biochemical and molecular description of the reactions required for making thousands of iridoid/MIAs.

Thus, a negative impact of contaminants in these organisms may endanger the rest of the system. Although some international documents have been released in order to regulate the use of compounds, additives and materials that include nanomaterials, it has been difficult to clearly define the impacts on human health after ingestion of organisms with bioaccumulated engineered nanomaterials (ENMs); the time after effects can be observed (short, medium and long time) and factors (age, health status, habits, etc.) that can affect the transport, accumulation, transformation of NMs in the final receptor. Thus, a more systemic approach is needed in order to properly define regulations related to ENMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3ahealth status 3ahuman health 3aingestion 3ananomaterials 3aterrestrial ecosystems 0aEconanotoxicology 0aCitotoxicology 0aBioaccumulation 0aTrophic transfer 0aHealth risk1 ade la Rosa-Álvarez, Guadalupe0 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2018 Dec., v. 6 p.42-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2018.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001500189245009200204300001600296506007600312520114100388592002801529506003701557650001401594650001901608650001401627650001001641650001201651650002601663650001701689700001701706700001401723700001501737700005601752773012101808856008301929852000902012655001202021IND60646325920221207125234.0190823e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064632592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-019-02685-32doi7 aPMC65513462pmcid7 a310769922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Yujie10aMiR-499 inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cardiomyocytes injury by targeting SOX6  ap. 837-847.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: MiR-499 has been reported to be expressed only in cardiomyocytes, and its expression would increase after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). miR-499 plays a role in the process of cardiomyocytes injury induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), however, it still remains unclear. RESULTS: Hypoxia inhibited miR-499-5p expression and H/R induced apoptosis. SOX6 was a target gene of miR-499-5p, and high expression of miR-499-5p inhibited the expression of SOX6. MiR-499-5p reduced H9c2 cells injury by inhibiting the expression of SOX6, overexpression of which could reverse the effect of miR-499-5p on H9c2 cells. MiR-499-5p inhibited the levels of LDH and MDA, while overexpression of miR-499-5p inhibited H/R-induced cell apoptosis. MiR-499-5p could up-regulate the level of Bcl-2 and down-regulate the expression levels of Bax and caspase-3. However, SOX6 partially reversed these effects of miR-499-5p. CONCLUSION: We proved that miR-499-5p inhibited H/R-induced cardiomyocytes injury by targeting SOX6. Our results suggested that miR-499-5p/SOX6 pathway may present a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AMI.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3acardiomyocytes 3acaspase-3 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3amyocardial infarction 3atherapeutics1 aHan, Yunfeng1 aNiu, Lili1 aLi, Junxia1 aChen, Yundai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7689-27520 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 6-7 p.837-847dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-019-02685-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009500169300001600264520148600280592002801766650003301794650002101827650001501848650001601863650001301879650001001892650002201902650002001924650001401944650001201958650002001970650002001990650001102010650002102021650002402042650001502066650001702081650001302098650001202111650005202123650002002175650002202195650001702217650002402234650001002258650001602268650001302284653002202297653001302319653003302332700001902365700001902384700002102403700002102424700002502445700002002470700002302490773011702513856008502630852000902715655001202724IND60087127520221120073603.0190416e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008712752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImamura, Saiki10aIdentification and partial characterization of a gut Rhipicephalus appendiculatus cystatin  ap. 138-144.  aVaccines are among the alternative tick control methods expected to replace at least in part the volumes of chemical acaricides currently used worldwide. However, a vaccination approach depends on a host immune response against proteins that are essential to tick physiology. The cystatin family is a protein class recently investigated to compose an effective antigen in a tick vaccine. In this study, a cDNA from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus with high sequence similarity to cystatins type 2 was identified by random sequencing analysis and called R. appendiculatus cystatin 1 (Ra-cyst-1). DNA sequence analysis showed that the cloned Ra-cyst-1 has a 423-bp open reading frame and codified to a 140-amino acid polypeptide. The putative mature protein consists of 115 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular weight of 12.8kDa. The highly conserved G (P-I), QxVxG (P-II), and PW (P-III) type 2 cystatins motifs are present in Ra-cyst-1 cDNA. RT-PCR analysis showed that the Ra-cyst-1 gene is expressed in nymph, male, and female midgut following blood feeding, but not in the salivary glands of fed females. In addition, Western blot revealed that recombinant Ra-cyst-1 was not recognized by sera derived from rabbits infested with ticks, suggesting that this cystatin is not secreted into the host during infestation. We hypothesize that Ra-cyst-1 may play a role in the tick feeding process and could be a concealed antigen candidate in further anti-tick vaccination trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhipicephalus appendiculatus 3aWestern blotting 3aacaricides 3aamino acids 3aantigens 3ablood 3acomplementary DNA 3acontrol methods 3acystatins 3afemales 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3amidgut 3amolecular weight 3aopen reading frames 3aphysiology 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3arabbits 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asalivary glands 3asequence homology 3atick control 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aAnti-tick vaccine 0aCystatin 0aRhipicephalus appendiculatus1 aKonnai, Satoru1 aYamada, Shinji1 aParizi, Luís F.1 aGithaka, Naftaly1 aVaz, Itabajara da S.1 aMurata, Shirō,1 aŌhashi, Kazuhiko,0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2013 Feb., v. 4, no. 1-2 p.138-144dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245017500169300001600344520131600360592002801676650001501704650001601719650001401735650001501749650002201764650000901786650002601795650001501821650001801836650001401854650001101868650001801879650001401897650002901911653001501940653001501955653002201970653002001992653002102012700001802033700005702051700005802108773011402166856008602280852000902366655001202375IND60633849820221119132409.0190725e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063384982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yiping,10aElectrospun spongy zero-valent iron as excellent electro-Fenton catalyst for enhanced sulfathiazole removal by a combination of adsorption and electro-catalytic oxidation  ap. 576-585.  aIn this study, a highly active electro-Fenton catalyst, spongy zero-valent iron (ZVI), has been developed at first via in-situ synthesis of ZVI nanoparticles (NPs) on an electrospun three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber network. The spongy ZVI effectively overcame the defects of easy aggregation of ZVI NPs and ferric sludge accumulation during the electro-catalytic process. Then, a three-dimensional electro-Fenton (3D-EF) system using the as-fabricated spongy ZVI as particle catalytic electrodes was designed, which presented a significant synergistic effect of adsorption and electro-catalytic oxidation on the enhanced removal of a widely used antibiotic, sulfathiazole (STZ) from water. Adsorption experiments demonstrated that the spongy ZVI had a relative high adsorption affinity towards STZ with about 50% of the total removal within 240 min, and the adsorption equilibrium was reached in 570 min. Hydroxyl radical (OH) was produced in the 3D-EF system with spongy ZVI catalyst, and almost 100% STZ was removed within 5 min. Reactive oxygen species analysis verified that OH was mainly responsible for the STZ degradation. Based on intermediates identified by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), three pathways for the electro-Fenton oxidative degradation of STZ were proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3acatalysts 3aelectrodes 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airon 3aliquid chromatography 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3asludge 3asulfathiazole 3asynergism 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aAdsorption 0aAntibiotic 0aElectro-catalysis 0aElectrospinning 0aZero-valent iron1 aYang, Liming,1 aPaul Chen, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9964-293X1 aZheng, Yu-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3858-10370 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 June 05, v. 371 p.576-585dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009600168300001300264520109200277592002801369650001901397650002901416650001501445650003101460650001701491650002101508650002001529650001801549653004801567653002901615653001901644653001801663653002101681773012601702856008401828852000901912655001201921IND60616824020221116142507.0190613e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061682402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.coesh.2018.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDauchy, Xavier10aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in drinking water: Current state of the science  ap. 8-12.  aPerfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are ubiquitous emerging contaminants that have been used in many applications since the 1950s. They have been detected in many drinking water sources, sometimes at μg/L level in water impacted by point sources. Following growing concerns on adverse ecological and human health effects, in the early 2000s several countries established regulations on the PFASs of most concern. Fluorinated alternatives were consequently developed by manufacturers, resulting in the release of novel PFASs that have recently been detected in water resources. Like legacy PFASs, most of them are recalcitrant to conventional drinking water treatments. Governments face the challenge of defining guideline values for water often containing a mixture of several PFASs with little conclusive toxicological and epidemiological evidence. Around 3000 PFASs have been available on the global market, so the other key challenge is to identify the main ones in contaminated water resources, and to detect novel PFASs quicker than was the case for legacy PFASs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrinking water 3adrinking water treatment 3aguidelines 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3aperfluorocarbons 3awater pollution 3aworld markets 0aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) 0aDrinking water treatment 0aHuman exposure 0aPoint sources 0aGuideline values0 tCurrent opinion in environmental science & health.g2019 Feb., v. 7 p.8-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:26761x2468-58447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2018.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01481naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245004000181300001600221500000900237520061100246592002800857650002600885650000900911650001200920700001700932773014900949856009601098852000901194655001201203IND60668773120221122004035.0191125e197509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066877312DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1975.03615995003900050013x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParlange, J.-Y.10aLinear Dispersion in Finite Columns  ap. 817-819.  aepub  aThe effect of the finite length of a soil column on the miscible displacement of a solute is analyzed.

We report for the first time the use of random copolymers with cocrystallizable monomeric units for the preparation of such polymer networks. Homopolymers and random copolymers of ε-caprolactone and ω-pentadecalactone were designed and made by ring-opening polymerization with Candida antarctica lipase B as catalyst. The melting temperatures of these prepolymers may be adjusted by the use of various molar ratios of the comonomers. Upon thiol–ene cross-linking, the polymer network exhibited two-way reversible shape memory effects under both stress-free and stress conditions. The actuation temperature (TA) of the 2W-SMP under stress-free condition can be tuned in a broad range using a selected mixture of prepolymers followed by photo-cross-linking with a multifunctional cross-linker. Increasing the initial stretching stress amplitude led to an increased absolute strain change under both stress-free and stress condition; it led to a reduced relative strain change under stress-free condition, but almost no change under stress condition. The evolution of the microstructure of 2W-SMPs under stress-free condition cycle was studied by the use of X-ray diffraction (2D-WAXD and SAXS). This is the first report on the tuning of TA of 2W-SMPs under stress-free condition by the use of one or two prepolymers to form a chemically cross-linked network. We have also eliminated the use of toxic metal catalysts in the synthesis of polymeric biomaterials. The materials are shown to be capable of performing reversible bending–unbending and coiling–uncoiling motions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudozyma antarctica 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiocompatible materials 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalysts 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3amicrostructure 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aJia, Yong-Guang1 aZhu, X.

However, existing data does not provide the necessary level of information to allow for predictive models to be generated. One avenue to reverse engineer the necessary information is to study the genetic control of natural variation in plant primary and secondary metabolism. These studies are showing that any engineering model will have to incorporate information about 1000s of genes in both the nuclear and organellar genome to optimize the function of the introduced pathway. Further, these genes may interact in an unpredictable fashion complicating any engineering approach as it moves from the one or two gene manipulation to higher order stacking efforts. Finally, metabolic engineering may be influenced by a previously unrecognized potential for a plant to measure the metabolites within it. In combination, these observations from natural variation provide a beginning to help improve current efforts at metabolic engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amodels 3asynthetic biology0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2014 June, v. 19 p.20-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl58157x1369-52667nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2014.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245005900172300001800231520119300249592002801442650001701470650001301487650000901500650002201509650001201531650000901543650001901552650002501571650001501596650001301611650002501624650001201649653001401661653002101675653001301696653002001709653002301729700002101752700001901773773013301792856008501925852000902010655001202019IND60580265120221119145922.0170914e20171202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058026512DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2017.13166972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGnanauthayan, G.10aHeat insulation characteristics of high bulk nonwovens  ap. 2173-2179.  aThe insulation layer is a vital component in cold weather clothing. Majority of the heat loss from the body is restricted by the insulation layer. Hence, the design of insulation layer is critical for the performance of extreme cold weather clothing. The factors which influence the thermal resistance of nonwovens’ layer are fibre denier, fibre cross-section and bulk density, porosity and thickness of nonwovens. In this study, we try to optimize these parameters for high-bulk thermal bonded nonwovens using solid and hollow polyester fibres of different deniers. The effect of these parameters and their interdependency has been evaluated by suitable statistical analysis with the help of Design expert software. Contribution analysis has been carried out to ascertain the importance of thickness, areal density and fibre denier and shape. Finer and hollow fibres give better thermal insulation than the coarser and solid fibres. Nonwovens have very high porosity, especially the lighter and thinner ones have poor thermal resistance. Finer and hollow fibres due to their superior thermal insulation are ideal choice for making thinner and lightweight extreme cold weather clothing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3aclothing 3acold 3acomputer software 3afabrics 3aheat 3aheat tolerance 3ainsulating materials 3apolyesters 3aporosity 3astatistical analysis 3aweather 0aHigh-bulk 0ainsulation layer 0aporosity 0athermal bonding 0athermal resistance1 aRengasamy, R.

However, most of the MOFs and the polymers used are not pharmaceutically acceptable. For the first time, this study successfully conducted the rapid synthesis of cyclodextrin metal–organic frameworks (CD-MOFs) through a facile and green seed-mediated method. The size control, crystal structure, and thermal properties of CD-MOFs with and without seeds were investigated. When 1 mg/mL seed was added, the size of γ-CD-MOF crystals decreased from 6.2 ± 0.8 to 1.8 ± 0.4 μm. The CD-MOFs synthesized though the seed-mediated method had higher crystallinity and thermal stability than those that were not. Furthermore, the CD-MOFs could encapsulate hydrophobic molecules, such as Nile red (NR), which was chosen as a model, and the interaction mechanism between γ-CD-MOFs and NR was investigated. Results showed the formation of a 1:1 complex between NR and CD-MOFs, demonstrating the potential of these polymers as carriers for hydrophobic drug delivery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoordination polymers 3acrystal structure 3acrystals 3acyclodextrins 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3aseeds 3asurface area 3athermal stability 3atopology 0aγ-cyclodextrin 0adelivery 0ainteraction 0acytotoxicity 0athermal stability1 aWang, Jinpeng1 aQin, Yang1 aFan, Haoran1 aXu, Xueming1 aJin, Zhengyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6880-99550 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Apr. 05, v. 66, no. 16 p.4244-4250dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b004003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016500168520149500333592002801828650001201856650002001868650002701888650002101915650001101936650001201947650001401959650001801973650001701991650001102008650001002019650001702029650001502046653002602061653001102087653002702098653002002125653002602145700005402171700001602225700001602241700001202257700001402269700001402283700001502297700001402312700001802326773011502344856008602459852000902545655001202554IND60736925220221122002459.0220110e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073692522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jiaming10aRecovering chemical sludge from the zero liquid discharge system of ﬂue gas desulfurization wastewater as flame retardants by a stepwise precipitation process  aIn this study, a five-stage stepwise precipitation process, including pre-sedimentation, magnesium removal, gypsum precipitation, ettringite precipitation and calcium removal, was proposed as a softening pretreatment for zero liquid discharge system for ﬂue gas desulfurization wastewater. Batch tests and long-term bench-scale experiment showed that magnesium, sulfate and calcium were efficiently removed with efficiencies all above 98.0%, leaving a clean effluent majorly containing NaCl and NaOH. The precipitated CaSO₄, CaCO₃, Mg(OH)₂ and ettringite were completely separated by stepwise precipitation, and the purity of Mg(OH)₂ and ettringite were further enhanced by washing and soaking treatment. CaSO₄ and CaCO₃ can be directly recycled as gypsum product and desulfurizing agent within the power plant, while Mg(OH)₂ and ettringite presented proper particle size and excellent thermal properties as a synergistic flame retardant. The flame retardancy of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer were greatly improved when blended with recovered Mg(OH)₂ and ettringite, and possessed better performance by blending them together because ettringite could act as a dispersing and compatible agent of Mg(OH)₂, and relieve the intensity of smoke releasing. Chemical sludge recovery compensates the total cost of the five-stage process by 45.0%, and makes the process technically versatile, economically beneficial and environmentally friendly without solid waste production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adesulfurization 3aethylene-vinyl acetate 3aflame retardants 3agypsum 3aliquids 3amagnesium 3aparticle size 3apower plants 3asludge 3asmoke 3asolid wastes 3awastewater 0aZero liquid discharge 0aSludge 0aChemical precipitation 0aFlame retardant 0aLimiting oxygen index1 aZhou, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2953-70931 aMing, Qiang1 aSun, Dongqi1 aLi, Fei1 aXi, Jiafu1 aWu, Qiong1 aYang, Jian1 aXia, Qing1 aZhao, Xiaodan0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.126054-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008900166300001500255520100400270592002801274650001301302650001101315650002101326650002201347650003301369650001001402650001901412650001601431650001901447700001401466700001801480700001801498700001601516700001601532700001601548700001801564773008601582856008401668852000901752655001201761IND60591576120221120095741.0180320e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059157612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2016.03.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiulong10aOpen-cell phenolic carbon foam and electromagnetic interference shielding properties  ap. 90-105.  aIn this study, phenolic foam composites (PFC2Fs) with closed-cell structure consisting of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and nano-Fe3O4 were prepared via in-situ polymerization.

The sample with 2 wt% MWCNTs and 7 wt% Fe3O4 (PFC2F7) with thickness of 2 mm exhibited the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) with ∼34 dB at 8–12 GHz.

Such metabolites often comprise small lipophilic molecules (SLMs), and can be similar also in terms of activity to currently used insecticides, for example, the pyrethroids, neonicotinoids and butenolides, which provide more effective pest management than the resistance traits exploited by breeding. Crop plants mostly lack the SLMs that provide their wild ancestors with resistance to pests. However, resistance traits based on the biosynthesis of SLMs present promising new opportunities for crop resistance to pests. Advances in genetic engineering of secondary metabolite pathways that produce insecticidal compounds and, more recently, SLMs involved in plant colonisation and development, for example, insect pheromones, offer specific new approaches but which are more demanding than the genetic engineering approaches adopted so far. In addition, nature also offers various opportunities for exploiting induction or priming for resistance metabolite generation. Thus, use of non-constitutively expressed resistance traits delivered via the seed is a more sustainable approach than previously achieved, and could underpin development of perennial arable crops protected by sentinel plant technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aancestry 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding 3acrops 3agenetic engineering 3ainsect pests 3ainsect pheromones 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3apyrethrins 3asecondary metabolites1 aPickett, J.

Planting of chestnuts has focused on a few species, including Castanea dentata, Castanea sativa, Castanea mollissima, and Castanea crenata, although others species are also edible. Castanea species are members of the beech family (Fagaceae) and are native to tropical and temperate areas. In this study, the yield and nut quality of Castanopsis piriformis in natural forests of the Central Highlands of Vietnam were investigated to provide evidence that C. piriformis is worth growing as a food species. Data were collected from 12 plots of 50 m × 50 m size located in four altitude zones. Nuts were collected from three to five chestnut trees in each plot judged to be of typical sized based on diameter at breast height and crown diameter. Average dry yield of nuts was found to be elevation-dependent, being highest at 500–1000 m (1152 kg/ha/year), decreasing to 815 kg/ha/year below 500 m, and to 770 kg/ha/year at 1000–1500 m. The lowest yield was observed at above 1500 m (252 kg/ha/year). Protein and lipid contents in the kernels of C. piriformis chestnut were 4.4 and 0.1 %, respectively. Glucose accounted for 73.1 % and was significantly higher than that of commercially grown Castanopsis boisii chestnuts in Northern Vietnam. With the current price of 0.6 US$/kg nuts, collecting nuts growing in natural forest can bring at least 480 US$/ha/year to local people. These results indicate the possibility of growing and consuming C. piriformis chestnut as a crop to decrease poverty.

The dynamics of capillary imbibition within AAO followed the t¹/² prediction but is slower than predicted by the classical Lucas–Washburn equation. The most prominent effect of confinement is the change in nucleation mechanismfrom heterogeneous nucleation in bulk to homogeneous nucleation inside AAO. The homogeneous nucleation temperatures for the hyperbranched PEOs agree with those of linear ones provided that the branch molecular weight is used instead of the total molecular weight. Confinement and interfacial effects further suppress the degree of crystallinity and speed up the segmental dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acopolymerization 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3aequations 3aglycidol 3aimbibition 3amolecular weight 3ananopores 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aSuzuki, Yasuhito1 aSeiwert, Jan1 aSteinhart, Martin1 aFrey, Holger1 aButt, Hans-Jürgen,1 aFloudas, George0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 50, no. 21 p.8755-8764dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b018433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245012800159300001800287520106500305592002801370650002101398650001501419650001801434650001601452650001301468650002401481650002101505650002101526650002001547650001501567650000901582650002101591650002301612650001201635650002401647650002101671650002101692653001601713653002101729653002001750653001201770653002601782700001701808700001401825700001801839700005601857700002001913773014801933856008002081852000902161655001202170IND60604268220221118062155.0180716e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060426822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b004042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yan10aHypoglycemic Effects of Pyrodextrins with Different Molecular Weights and Digestibilities in Mice with Diet-Induced Obesity  ap. 2988-2995.  aPyrodextrin shares some properties of resistant starch, which is metabolically beneficial, and has potential applications as a functional food. In this study, we report that the oral administration of pyrodextrin (50 mg/kg/d for 7 weeks) decreased blood glucose (from 9.18 ± 1.47 to 7.67 ± 0.42 mmol/L), serum HbA1c, triglycerides, adipocyte size, and body weight (from 24.4 ± 1.2 to 22.5 ± 1.2 g) in mice with high-fat-diet-induced obesity. Western-blotting analysis suggested that pyrodextrins decreased intestinal SGLT-1 and GLUT-2 expression to ∼70 and ∼60% of the obese control, respectively, which slowed down glucose transportation from the gut into the blood and tentatively improved hepatic metabolism. Moreover, the pyrodextrin with a lower molecular weight of 44 kDa, a more branched structure, and increased nondigestible starch of 46.2 ± 0.3% showed stronger hypoglycemic activity. This work provides important information for developing pyrodextrins as a functional food and dietary supplement for the management of obesity and diabetes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadipocytes 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3adigestive system 3afunctional foods 3aglycemic effect 3ametabolism 3amice 3amolecular weight 3anutrient transport 3aobesity 3aoral administration 3aresistant starch 3atriacylglycerols 0apyrodextrin 0amolecular weight 0adigestibilities 0aobesity 0ahypoglycemic activity1 aChen, Xiaoli1 aSun, Ying1 aShi, Jialiang1 aXu, Xiaojuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1404-50881 aShi, Yong-Cheng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 66, no. 11 p.2988-2995dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b004043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006300168300001800231520073900249592002800988650002301016650001201039650001501051650002301066650001001089653001201099653001601111653001501127653001301142653000901155653001601164653001901180653001001199653001201209700002301221773013301244856008501377852000901462655001201471IND60580265420221119145729.0170914e20171202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058026542DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2017.13184322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEldeeb, Moaz10aPrediction of spun yarn strength at different gage lengths  ap. 2191-2196.  aIn this article, the influence of tensile tester gage length on ring, rotor and air-jet spun yarns tenacity and its coefficient of variation have been investigated.

Research has established that both primary ENPs and the dissolved ions (from metallic ENPs) can be directly taken up by plants, including ENPs with diameters larger than the size exclusion limits (SELs) of plant roots. Plant ENP uptake is subjected to significant impacts of a range of biotic and abiotic environmental factors.

Since 1950, the sea surface temperature has been gradually increasing, although non-significant cooling occurred in the last decade. In contrast, in the 50–200m depth range, the temperature has been cooling. During the last 60 years, the salinity decreased by 0.30, 0.06–0.10 and 0.04 at the sea surface, at the 100–200m layer and at the depth of 500m, respectively, resulting in a strengthening of the vertical stability and weakening of the vertical water exchange. As a consequence, the oxygen concentrations at depths down to 1000m decreased during this period. Phosphate and silicate concentrations increased during the last 40 years. The water exchange with the North Pacific (based on the discharge through the Kamchatka Strait) from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s was 2-3-fold higher than in the 1950s or from the mid-1990s to 2010. During the periods of weakened water exchange, the herring population sharply increased, while during periods of strengthened water exchange, pollock biomass increased. The increase of codfishes, flounders and sculpin biomass at the sea shelf during the second half of the 20th century coincided with sea surface warming. Since 2007, the westward water transport from the Aleutian Basin was almost half that during 2002–06, while the northward stream from Near Strait noticeably increased. The populations of immature chum, sockeye and chinook in the REZ declined because of their weakened input from the US zone, and these species were distributed mainly in the northern and eastern Russian waters. Taking into account the cooling since the middle of the last decade, the change in the intensity and direction of the Aleutian Low and Siberian High trends, and the westward shift of the Aleutian Low, one can hypothesize the possible return of the Bering Sea climate to the conditions of the 1960–80s and the corresponding response observed in ichthyofauna.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCottidae 3abasins 3abiomass 3aclimate 3acooling 3adissolved oxygen 3aflounder 3aherring 3ahydrology 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3apollock 3asalinity 3asurface water temperature 3aBering Sea 3aUnited States1 aBasyuk, E.O.1 aVanin, N.S.1 aMatveev, V.I.0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 94 p.106-120dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.03.0343Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007100170300001800241520122300259592002801482650002101510650002601531650001501557650002901572650001201601650002101613650002101634650001201655650001201667650002601679650001501705650001301720650001501733650001101748650002001759650002001779650000901799650001501808653001301823653002701836653001101863653001701874653001401891700001801905700001801923700002101941700002801962773013301990856008502123852000902208655001202217IND60580265520221119150010.0170914e20171202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058026552DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2017.13186542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiaz, Shagufta10aDevelopment of functional alginate fibers for medical applications  ap. 2197-2204.  aIn this study, antibacterial alginate fibers were developed by using two approaches for fiber development. Firstly, replacing the sodium ions of sodium alginates with metal ions like zinc. Secondly, replacing the sodium ions of sodium alginate with biologically inactive ions like calcium and loading the fibers with ZnO nanorods. Fibers were characterized by liquid absorption and ion release measurements, by placing them separately in distilled water, solution A (0.8298% NaCl & 0.0368% CaCl2) and normal saline solution. Results showed that release of ions from fibers was affected by liquid absorption, physiology of solution and contact time with solution. More ions were released from fibers with higher absorption and longer contact time. Calcium alginate fibers containing zinc ions showed greater absorbency as well as the greater metal ions release. Fibers containing zinc ions, and ZnO nanorods were also tested for their mechanical properties and antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli . Alginate fibers containing ZnO nanorods were stronger than alginate fibers containing zinc ions. However, calcium fibers containing zinc ions exhibited more antibacterial activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aabsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3acalcium 3acalcium alginate 3acalcium chloride 3afabrics 3aliquids 3amechanical properties 3ametal ions 3ananorods 3aphysiology 3asodium 3asodium alginate 3asodium chloride 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aAlginate 0aantibacterial activity 0afibers 0aZnO nanorods 0azinc ions1 aRehman, Abdur1 aAshraf, Munir1 aHussain, Tanveer1 aHussain, Muhammad Tahir0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2017 Dec. 2, v. 108, no. 12 p.2197-2204dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2017.13186543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002400142245007700166300001600243520132500259592002801584650001701612650001701629650001701646650001101663653003101674653002901705653002801734653002901762653001601791653002201807700002101829700001901850700002001869773011601889856007602005852000902081655001202090IND60563553520221118004637.0170224e20161004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056355352DNAL7 a10.1139/er-2016-00452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWerkowska, Wioletta12aA practical overview of transferability in species distribution modeling  ap. 127-133.  aSpecies distribution models (SDMs) are basic tools in ecology, biogeography, and biodiversity. The usefulness of SDMs has expanded beyond the realm of ecological sciences, and their application in other research areas is currently frequent, e.g., spatial epidemiology. In any research area, the principal interest in these models resides in their capacity to predict species response in new scenarios, i.e., the models’ transferability. Although the transferability of SDMs has been the subject of interest for many years, only in the 2000s did this topic gain particular attention. This article reviews the concept of the transferability of SDMs to new spatial scenarios, temporal periods, and (or) spatial resolutions, along with the potential constraints of the model’s transferability, and more specifically: (i) the type of predictors and multicollinearity, (ii) the model complexity, and (iii) the species’ intrinsic traits. Finally, we describe a practicable analytical protocol to be assessed before transferring a model to a new scenario. This protocol is based on three fundamental pillars: the environmental equilibrium of the species with the environment, the environmental similarity between the new scenario, and the areas used to model parametrisation and the correlation structure among predictors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aepidemiology 3amodels 0aspecies distribution model 0aspatially explicit model 0aspatial transferability 0atemporal transferability 0adownscaling 0amulticollinearity1 aMárquez, Ana L.1 aReal, Raimundo1 aAcevedo, Pelayo0 tEnvironmental reviews.g2016 Oct. 4, v. 25, no. 1 p.127-133dNRC Research PresswJournal:18950x1208-60537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/er-2016-00453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245006600178300001600244500001500260520228500275592002802560650001302588650001202601650002402613650001202637650002202649650001102671650001402682650001502696650001502711650002402726650001102750651001502761653002602776700001902802700002202821700002102843700003602864700002002900700002402920773009202944856008203036990002303118852000903141655001203150IND60094511420221121005333.0141104e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009451142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.04.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker-Stetter, Sandra L.10aSummer distributions of forage fish in the eastern Bering Sea  ap. 211-230.  a2019-12-06  aJuvenile and small adult fish, typically called forage fish, are an important but poorly studied part of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) ecosystem. Acoustic and trawl data from a non-target survey were used to evaluate distributions of capelin (Mallotus villosus), age-0 Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), and age-0 walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma, herein pollock) in 2006–2010. Within the surface zone (15m to ~35m, evaluated 2006–2010), capelin occurred throughout the EBS but primarily in the middle shelf. Capelin were also present in the midwater zone (~35m to 0.5m off-bottom) in both 2009 and 2010 (evaluated 2009–2010), and resulted in water column zone (15m to 0.5m off-bottom) distributions that differed from surface zone characterizations. Age-0 Pacific cod occurred primarily in the surface zone of the middle and outer shelf regions in all years. As midwater and surface zone age-0 Pacific cod were often coincident, water column zone distributions in 2009–2010 were similar to surface zone distributions. Age-0 pollock were found in the EBS surface zone in all years, primarily in the middle and outer shelf regions. High densities of age-0 pollock occurred in the midwater zone in 2006–2007 and 2009–2010. Water column zone distributions of age-0 pollock were similar to surface zone distributions in 2006–2007, but differed in 2009–2010 due to low numbers of age-0 pollock in the surface zone and presence of high densities in the midwater zone of the outer shelf region. While general patterns in capelin distribution in the surface zone were similar between the present and the previous studies, the acoustic–trawl characterization suggested that capelin densities were high in the middle shelf region. As expected, surface zone distributions of age-0 Pacific cod and age-0 pollock were similar to previous characterizations. Observed high densities of midwater age-0 pollock have not been described by previous studies. Annual abundance indices based on bottom or surface trawl data alone will not be sufficient in all years. Data and conclusions from non-target surveys may be constrained compared to dedicated survey efforts, but can provide baseline distributions, potential abundance indices, and insight for planning future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanning 3asurveys 3aGadus macrocephalus 3apollock 3aMallotus villosus 3aforage 3aacoustics 3aecosystems 3acod (fish) 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3aadults 3aBering Sea 0aTheragra chalcogramma1 aHorne, John K.1 aFarley, Edward V.1 aBarbee, David H.1 aAndrews, Alexander G., IIIcIII1 aEisner, Lisa B.1 aNomura, Jennifer M.0 tDeep-Sea Research Part II.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 94 p.211-230dElsevier Ltdx0967-06457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.04.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100003400161245009500195300001600290500000900306520067400315592002800989650002301017650000901040650001601049650001401065650000901079773014701088856009601235852000901331655001201340IND60668773620221121232809.0191125e197505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066877362DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1975.03615995003900030019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParlange, J.-Y.q(Jean-Yves),10aOn Solving the Flow Equation in Unsaturated Soils by Optimization: Horizontal Infiltration  ap. 415-418.  aepub  aRecently, integral methods have been developed that provide accurate approximations to the diffusion equation with rapidly varying diffusivity, but require in general some numerical iteration. In the present paper, a new analytical approach is developed which yields optimal approximations without any numerical iteration. The method is applied to the problem of one-dimensional horizontal infiltration of water in soils. In that case it is shown that the sorptivity is an invariant, which can be expressed in terms of the sum of two integrals involving the diffusivity. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical calculations for Yolo light clay.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aclay 3adiffusivity 3aequations 3asoil0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1975 May, v. 39, no. 3 p.415-418dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1975.03615995003900030019x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011000164300001600274520114100290592002801431596008801459650001801547650002301565650002301588650001601611650002001627650003801647650001001685650001901695650002101714650002101735650000901756650002501765650002801790650002101818650001901839700001801858700001401876700001301890700001601903773012101919856008302040852000902123655001202132IND60646326720221118044236.0190823e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064632672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-019-02695-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Pengwei10aRecombinant lactococcus lactis secreting viral protein 1 of enterovirus 71 and its immunogenicity in mice  ap. 867-872.  aOBJECTIVE: To construct recombinant Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) expressing viral protein 1 (VP1) of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and evaluate its immunogenicity to be used as an oral vaccine in BALB/c mice. RESULTS: Recombinant L. lactis competent in secreting VP1 (~ 30 kDa) into the extracellular environment with the aid of the signal peptide Usp45 was produced. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that significant VP1-specific antibody response including the production of both serum IgG and fecal IgA (p < 0.05) was elicited in BALB/c mice upon oral immunization with recombinant L. lactis. Moreover, in contrast to negative control, recombinant L. lactis induced adequate neutralizing antibodies in mouse sera (p < 0.05) as demonstrated in virus neutralization assay, whereas the presence of neutralizing antibodies in fecal samples was obvious but not significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant L. lactis expressing VP1 of EV71 has the potential to be used as an oral vaccine candidate. The findings may provide some preliminary evidences for further development of effective and needle-free EV71 vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data  a19A330004cKey Scientific Research Project of Universities of Henan Province, China 3aEnterovirus A 3aLactococcus lactis 3aantibody formation 3ablood serum 3aedible vaccines 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3aneutralization tests 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aoral vaccination 3asignal peptide1 aWang, Yinbiao1 aTao, Ling1 aWu, Xuan1 aWu, Weidong0 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 6-7 p.867-872dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-019-02695-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008600160300001800246500001900264520150000283592002801783650003001811650002101841650001501862650001401877650002601891650001801917650001101935650001401946650001801960650001701978650001101995650001702006700002602023700002102049773014102070856007402211852000902285655001202294IND60696004920221120211141.0200521e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069600492DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb00217h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJat, Sanjeev K.10aNanomaterial based gene delivery: a promising method for plant genome engineering  ap. 4165-4175.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNanomaterials have attracted considerable attention from researchers in recent years due to their unique architecture and small dimensions. Significant progress has been made in the therapeutics, diagnostics, and delivery of biomolecules in animal cells. However, nanotechnology is still in its infancy in plant science. Nanotechnology offers tremendous opportunities for crop improvement and would make significant contributions to increase agricultural productivity. There are several reports where nanomaterial-induced improvement of the agronomic traits has been successfully achieved. However, very little is known about the interactions of nanomaterials with plant cells and the mechanism of internalization and delivery of biomolecules using nanoparticles as a carrier. Due to the presence of the cell wall, the delivery of biomolecules such as nucleic acids is a major challenge, which limits the application of nanomaterials in genetic engineering-mediated crop improvement. However, in recent years, the use of various nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes, magnetic nanoparticles, mesoporous silica nanoparticles, etc. for nucleic acid delivery in plant cells has been reported as proof of concept. Here, we intend to update researchers about the use of various nanomaterials as a novel gene delivery tool for plant genetic engineering. This review also explores the progress made in nanoparticle-mediated nucleic acid delivery in plant cells and their role in plant genome engineering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural productivity 3acarbon nanotubes 3acell walls 3achemistry 3adiagnostic techniques 3agene transfer 3agenome 3amagnetism 3anucleic acids 3aporous media 3asilica 3atherapeutics1 aBhattacharya, Jaydeep1 aSharma, Manoj K.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 May 20, v. 8, no. 19 p.4165-4175dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb00217h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03755naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001900169245011400188300001800302520181200320592002802132650002102160650002202181650001602203650001202219650002102231650000902252650001302261650003902274650001002313650001402323650001902337650002002356650001102376650001502387650002102402650001902423650002402442650001202466650001802478650002402496650002302520650002302543650002902566650002202595650002602617650004302643650002802686650004102714650002102755650005602776650003802832700001902870700001802889773010302907856008603010961001203096852000903108655001203117IND4462237720221119175850.0141110e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446223772DNAL7 a218677082pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Sony10aPGE₂ induces oenocytoid cell lysis via a G protein-coupled receptor in the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua  ap. 1568-1576.  aEicosanoids mediate cellular and humoral immune responses in the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, including activation of prophenoloxidase (PPO). PPO activation begins with release of its inactive zymogen, PPO, from oenocytoids in response to prostaglandins (PGs). Based on the biomedical literature, we hypothesized that PGs exert their actions via specific G protein-coupled receptor(s) in S. exigua. This study reports a G protein-coupled receptor (Se-hcPGGPCR1) gene, which is expressed in the hemocytes of S. exigua. The Se-hcPGGPCR1 consists of 420 amino acids and belongs to rhodopsin-type GPCRs. The high content of hydrophobic amino acid residues within the Se-hcPGGPCR1 protein is explained by prediction of seven-transmembrane domains that are characteristic of these GPCRs. Except for the eggs, Se-hcPGGPCR1 was expressed in all life stages. During the larval stage, it was expressed in hemocytes and gut, but not in fat body nor in epidermis. Real time quantitative RT-PCR showed that bacterial challenge induced more than 20-fold increases in its expression level. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that Se-hcPGGPCR1 was expressed in a specific hemocyte type, the oenocytoids. A specific eicosanoid, PGE₂, significantly induced oenocytoid lysis and increased PO activity in the plasma. In contrast, when Se-hcPGGPCR1 expression was suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi), the oenocytoid lysis and the PO activation in response to PGE₂ were not elevated above basal levels. A binding assay using intracellular calcium mobilization showed that the RNAi-treated hemocytes were significantly less responsive to PGE₂ than the control hemocytes. These results support our hypothesis with the specific finding that PGE₂ acts through Se-hcPGGPCR1 to activate PPO by lysing oenocytoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aamino acids 3acalcium 3adigestive system 3aeggs 3afat body 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3ahemocytes 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmune response 3alarvae 3aprediction 3aprophenoloxidase 3aprostaglandins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDinoprostonexmetabolism 2aEnzyme Activation 2aHemocytesxmetabolism 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMonophenol Monooxygenasexmetabolism 2aRNA Interference 2aReceptors, G-Protein-Coupledxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpodopteraxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aStanley, David1 aKim, Yonggyun0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2011 Nov., v. 57, no. 11 p.1568-1576dElsevier Ltdx0022-19107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2011.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/RD  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011400166300001600280520125900296592002801555650002101583650002201604650001901626650002001645650003001665650001101695650001801706650002501724650001501749700001401764700001901778700001901797773012101816856008301937852000902020655001202029IND60646326820221118045606.0190823e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064632682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-019-02673-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Yan-Long10aHuman genome-derived TOP1 matrix attachment region enhances transgene expression in the transfected CHO cells  ap. 701-709.  aOBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of full-length fragment of DNA topoisomerase I gene (TOP1) matrix attachment regions (MARs) originating from the human genome on transgene expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and explore the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Results showed that TOP1 MAR cannot only enhance the transient and stable transgenic expression of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) but also increase long-term stability and ratio of positive colonies in transfected CHO cells with TOP1 MAR at the 5′ or 3′ ends of the EGFP expression cassette. Interestingly, the CHO cells were transfected with the 5′,3′ TOP1 MAR-containing vector featured the highest transient and stable expression, whereas those with the 3′ TOP1 MAR-containing vector exhibited the most effective stability and ratio of positive colonies. We also observed that transgene copy numbers and mRNA of egfp gene were correlated with the expression levels of EGFP protein in polyclonal CHO cells. However, the heterogeneity of expression in monoclonal CHO cells was unaffected by transgene copy number. CONCLUSIONS: The findings may aid in the potential application of TOP1 MAR in expression enhancement of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese hamsters 3aDNA topoisomerase 3aanimal ovaries 3agene expression 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3arecombinant proteins 3atransgenes1 aGuo, Xiao1 aWang, Xi-Cheng1 aWang, Tian-Yun0 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 6-7 p.701-709dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-019-02673-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245019300203300001800396520108300414592002801497650002501525650001301550650001601563650001101579650001101590650001701601650001301618650001301631650001501644650001701659650002201676650001301698650001501711650002501726650001101751653002701762653003101789653002801820653001701848653002401865653002801889700001401917700003501931700003001966700002101996700002402017700006602041700002202107700002802129773014702157856008002304852000902384655001202393IND60604268720180918000000.0180716e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060426872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b004242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchmon, Yigal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2120-309610aEffects of Short-Term Biosolarization Using Mature Compost and Industrial Tomato Waste Amendments on the Generation and Persistence of Biocidal Soil Conditions and Subsequent Tomato Growth  ap. 5451-5461.  aConventional solarization and biosolarization with mature compost and tomato processing residue amendments were compared with respect to generation of pesticidal conditions and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plant growth in treated soils. Soil oxygen depletion was examined as a response that has previously not been measured across multiple depths during biosolarization. For biosolarized soil, volatile fatty acids were found to accumulate concurrent with oxygen depletion, and the magnitude of these changes varied by soil depth. Two consecutive years of experimentation showed varying dissipation of volatile fatty acids from biosolarized soils post-treatment. When residual volatile fatty acids were detected in the biosolarized soil, fruit yield did not significantly differ from plants grown in solarized soil. However, when there was no residual volatile fatty acids in the soil at the time of planting, plants grown in biosolarized soil showed a significantly greater vegetation amount, fruit quantity, and fruit ripening than those of plants grown in solarized soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acomposts 3afruit yield 3afruits 3aoxygen 3aplant growth 3aplanting 3aripening 3asoil depth 3asoil quality 3asoil solarization 3atomatoes 3avegetation 3avolatile fatty acids 3awastes 0afumigation alternative 0aintegrated pest management 0afood waste valorization 0atomato waste 0asoil oxygen content 0atomato plant physiology1 aSade, Nir1 aWilhelmi, María del Mar Rubio1 aFernández-Bayo, Jesus D.1 aHarrold, Duff R.1 aStapleton, James J.1 aVanderGheynst, Jean S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1455-82541 aBlumwald, Eduardo1 aSimmons, Christopher W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 May 15, v. 66, no. 22 p.5451-5461dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b004243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009000167300001800257500001100275520172300286592002802009650002202037650001302059650001002072650002102082650001602103650001302119650001402132650002802146650001602174650001802190650001702208650001202225650003002237650002102267650002302288650001602311650001502327650003102342650001202373650002202385650001202407650002102419650001302440650001502453700001802468700001802486700001702504700002402521700001902545773013202564856008102696852000902777655001202786IND60580265820221119145915.0170914e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058026582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-017-2550-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestfall, Susan10aMicrobiome, probiotics and neurodegenerative diseases: deciphering the gut brain axis  ap. 3769-3787.  aReview  aThe gut microbiota is essential to health and has recently become a target for live bacterial cell biotherapies for various chronic diseases including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity and neurodegenerative disease. Probiotic biotherapies are known to create a healthy gut environment by balancing bacterial populations and promoting their favorable metabolic action. The microbiota and its respective metabolites communicate to the host through a series of biochemical and functional links thereby affecting host homeostasis and health. In particular, the gastrointestinal tract communicates with the central nervous system through the gut–brain axis to support neuronal development and maintenance while gut dysbiosis manifests in neurological disease. There are three basic mechanisms that mediate the communication between the gut and the brain: direct neuronal communication, endocrine signaling mediators and the immune system. Together, these systems create a highly integrated molecular communication network that link systemic imbalances with the development of neurodegeneration including insulin regulation, fat metabolism, oxidative markers and immune signaling. Age is a common factor in the development of neurodegenerative disease and probiotics prevent many harmful effects of aging such as decreased neurotransmitter levels, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis—all factors that are proven aggravators of neurodegenerative disease. Indeed patients with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases have a high rate of gastrointestinal comorbidities and it has be proposed by some the management of the gut microbiota may prevent or alleviate the symptoms of these chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3abacteria 3abrain 3achronic diseases 3acomorbidity 3adiabetes 3adysbiosis 3agastrointestinal system 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3ametabolic syndrome 3ametabolites 3amicrobiome 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aneurotransmitters 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aprobiotics1 aLomis, Nikita1 aKahouli, Imen1 aDia, Si Yuan1 aSingh, Surya Pratap1 aPrakash, Satya0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2017 Oct., v. 74, no. 20 p.3769-3787dSpringer International Publishingx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-017-2550-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245011400177300001600291520124700307592002801554596007401582596007501656650002901731650001801760650001201778650002301790650001701813650001201830650001501842650001101857650002001868650001101888700001901899700002401918700002201942700002501964700002201989700002002011700006302031773012102094856008302215852000902298655001202307IND60646326920221118045505.0190823e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064632692DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-019-02674-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonan, Carolina I.

Experiments were performed using a mixture of xylose and glucose as the substrates. RESULTS: Microaerophilic condition (kLa = 4.9 h⁻¹) have shown to be suitable when compared to complete anaerobiosis (kLa = 0), providing an ethanol yield and a productivity after 48 h of 64.3% and 0.45 g ethanol L⁻¹ h⁻¹, respectively; the maximum ethanol titer obtained was 21.50 g ethanol L⁻¹. Values of ORP varying from − 270 to − 330 mV resulted in high ethanol production from xylose by S. stipitis. CONCLUSIONS: Different ORP values were found in anaerobiosis and kLa 4.9 h⁻¹, suggesting that for ethanol production by S. stipitis, values from − 270 to − 330 mV are favorable under the studied circumstances. In this ORP range, the greatest rates of xylose consumption and ethanol production were registered. ORP monitoring was demonstrated to be a suitable option for online control throughout the fermentation processes, which may provide a more efficient bioprocess operation with a very low O₂ concentration.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017/049970cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2016/06142-0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3abioprocessing 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3aglucose 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3aredox potential 3axylose1 aBiazi, Luiz E.1 aSantos, Samantha C.1 aSoares, Lauren B.1 aDionísio, Suzane R.1 aHoffmam, Zaira B.1 aCosta, Aline C.1 aIenczak, Jaciane L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4087-83390 tBiotechnology letters.g2019 July, v. 41, no. 6-7 p.753-761dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl31090x0141-54927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-019-02674-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011600170520137500286592002801661650001501689650001301704650001701717650001301734650001301747650001501760653001701775653001701792653001401809653001901823653001701842700005601859700001501915773011501930856008602045852000902131655001202140IND60736926020221121231231.0220110e20210905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073692602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Chenwei10aMn-incorporated ferrihydrite for Cr(VI) immobilization: Adsorption behavior and the fate of Cr(VI) during aging  aChromium(VI) (Cr(VI)) is an environmental priority pollutant, and its mobility in natural environment is strongly controlled by ferrihydrite. Ferrihydrite always contains various ions, which may change the properties of ferrihydrite, thereby affecting the behavior of pollutants. This study aims to investigate the adsorption of Cr(VI) by Mn-incorporated ferrihydrite and the mobility behavior of Cr(VI) during aging. Results showed that the incorporation of Mn enhanced the adsorption of Cr(VI) on ferrihydrite, and the adsorption performance increased with the increase of Mn content. The maximum adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) reached to 48.5 mg/g with molar ratio of Mn/Fe 5%, while it was 36.1 mg/g for pure ferrihydrite. After aging for 7 days, ferrihydrite transformed into goethite and hematite. The adsorbed Cr(VI) on the surface of ferrihydrite was released into the solution during aging. The incorporation of Mn retarded the transformation of ferrihydrite, which inhibited the migration of adsorbed Cr(VI). Nevertheless, the incorporation of Mn resulted in the transformation of adsorbed Cr(VI) to non-desorbed Cr(VI), thereby enhancing the retention of Cr(VI). Our results suggest that the incorporation of Mn into ferrihydrite has an important role on the mobility of Cr(VI), which enhances our understanding of the behavior of Cr(VI) in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achromium 3aferrihydrite 3agoethite 3ahematite 3apollutants 0aChromium(VI) 0aFerrihydrite 0aManganese 0aTransformation 0aMobilization1 aFu, Fenglian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7495-54031 aTang, Bing0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Sept. 05, v. 417 p.126073-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1260733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010000170300001800270520096300288592002801251596007901279650003401358650002201392650002501414650002101439650002201460650002401482650001401506650001501520650001501535650001101550650002101561650000701582650001401589650001601603653001901619653001701638653002201655653001401677653003301691653001601724700002201740700002401762700002401786700002101810773012601831856008501957852000902042655001202051IND60615296320221120125841.0181009e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061529632DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2017.14135692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdella, Asmaa10aBiotransformation of soy flour isoflavones by Aspergillus niger NRRL 3122 β-glucosidase enzyme  ap. 2382-2391.  aβ-glucosidase enzyme produced from Aspergillus niger NRRL 3122 has been partially purified and characterised.

Two-level Plackett–Burman design was applied and effective variables for genistein production were determined. Reaction time had a significant positive effect, and pH had a significant negative effect. They were further evaluated using Box–Behnken model.

N.10aPhase Behavior of Pyrene and Vinyl Polymers with Aromatic Side Groups  ap. 8678-8687.  aThe phase behavior and thermodynamic properties of mixtures of pyrene and model vinyl polymers with and without aromatic side groups are investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. The melting temperature and associated heat of melting of the pyrene crystals in the mixtures are utilized to extract the effective interaction parameters χ and the composition of polymer-rich phases, respectively. The χ of pyrene mixed with polymers with aromatic side groups investigated in this study, polystyrene, poly(2-vinylpyridine), and poly(3-vinylanisole), is less than 0.5 at the melting point of the pyrene crystals, suggesting that pyrene and the polymers with aromatic sides groups are enthalpically compatible, likely due to aromatic π–π interactions. In contrast, the χ of pyrene mixed with poly(1,4-isoprene) or poly(ethylene-alt-propylene) is larger than 0.5. The DSC measurements also enable characterization of the composition of polymer-rich phases. Interestingly, the polymers with aromatic side groups are found to have more pronounced miscibility with pyrene at symmetric compositions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aheat 3amelting 3amelting point 3amodels 3apolystyrenes1 aLee, Sangwoo0 tMacromolecules.g2017 Nov. 14, v. 50, no. 21 p.8678-8687dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.7b018933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245011400184300001600298520120400314592002801518650002501546650001301571650002501584650001901609650001701628650001801645650001901663650001601682650001301698650001201711650001601723650000901739650004401748650002101792650002001813650001101833650001201844650002001856651001401876651001801890653001101908653002501919653003901944700002601983700003002009700002302039700003002062700003002092700002802122773013202150856008702282852000902369655001202378IND60582004420221120125218.0200503e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058200442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.08.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlosterhoff, Rafael Roberto10aStructure and intracellular antioxidant activity of pectic polysaccharide from acerola (Malpighia emarginata)  ap. 473-480.  aMalpighia emarginata is a tropical fruit plant, found naturally in the Caribbean islands and South America that produces an edible fruit known as acerola or Barbados Cherry. Its polysaccharides were obtained by aqueous extraction, subjected to a freezing and thawing process and ultrafiltration. A homogeneous fraction (ACWS-01E) was analyzed by sugar composition, HPSEC, methylation and NMR spectroscopy analyses. The results showed an arabinan-rich pectic polysaccharide, with 6.1×10⁴g/mol and formed mainly by a high methyl esterified (DM=86%) homogalacturonan and branched arabinan. This latter is anchored in type I rhamnogalacturonan regions. The main chain of arabinan consisted of (1→5)-linked α-Araf, branched only at O-3. The potential ACWS-01E intracellular antioxidant activity against H₂O₂-induced oxidative stress in murine fibroblast cell line (3T3) was determined by DCFH-DA assay. The treatment with ACWS-01E significantly reduced H₂O₂-induced cytotoxic effect and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These findings suggested that ACWS-01E protected and improved NIH 3T3 cell viability from H₂O₂-induced toxicity by decreasing intracellular levels of ROS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalpighia emarginata 3aacerolas 3aantioxidant activity 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3aedible fruits 3aesterification 3afibroblasts 3afreezing 3aislands 3amethylation 3amice 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidative stress 3apolysaccharides 3asugars 3athawing 3aultrafiltration 3aCaribbean 3aSouth America 0aPectin 0aMalpighia emarginata 0aIntracellular antioxidant activity1 aBark, Juliana Müller1 aGlänzel, Nícolas Manzke1 aIacomini, Marcello1 aMartinez, Gláucia Regina1 aWinnischofer, Sheila M.B.1 aCordeiro, Lucimara M.C.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Jan., v. 106 p.473-480dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.08.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003100166245008800197300001400285520088600299592002801185650002001213650001201233650002501245650001001270650000901280650001201289650002301301650001501324650002301339650001901362650001901381650004401400650001301444650003701457650003001494650001201524650003701536650002301573650003801596650003701634650003201671650004001703650005601743650005801799651001101857651001101868700003001879700002701909700001801936700002101954700001901975700002201994700002702016700002202043773012302065856008102188852000902269655001202278IND50071546120221118021322.0151123e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007154612DNAL7 a241899952pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-013-1137-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurussi, Camila Rebellatto10aToxic Effects of Penoxsulam Herbicide in Two Fish Species Reared in Southern Brazil  ap. 81-84.  aToxic effects of penoxsulam herbicide on acetylcholinesterase, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and protein carbonyl were studied in silver catfish (Rhamdia sp.) and carp (Cyprinus carpio). Acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited in both brain and muscle tissue, with the inhibition being greater in carp than in silver catfish. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of lipid peroxidation, decreased in silver catfish brain tissue, but increased in the carp brain. MDA also increased significantly in muscle tissue of silver catfish. The levels of protein carbonyl, another measure of oxidative damage, increased in the brain of both fish species, and in the muscle of carp. However, silver catfish exhibited a decrease in muscle protein carbonyl. It appears that silver catfish may possess better mechanisms of defense against penoxsulam toxicity than carp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aRhamdia 3aacetylcholinesterase 3abrain 3acarp 3acatfish 3adefense mechanisms 3aherbicides 3alipid peroxidation 3amuscle protein 3amuscle tissues 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atoxicity 2aAcetylcholinesterasexmetabolism 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBrainxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFishesxmetabolism 2aHerbicidesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aSulfonamidesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substancesxmetabolism 2aUridinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aThorstenberg, Maria Luiza1 aLeitemperger, Jossiele1 aCosta, Maiara1 aClasen, Bárbara1 aSanti, Adriana1 aMenezes, Charlene1 aEngers, Vanessa Kruger1 aLoro, Vania Lucia0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2014 Jan., v. 92, no. 1 p.81-84dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-013-1137-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010700159300001800266520111100284592002801395650001601423650001801439650001901457650001601476650002001492650001601512650001801528650001401546650000701560650002401567650002001591650002301611650002001634650001301654650002101667700001701688700002001705700001801725773014001743856007401883852000901957655001201966IND60670955420221121223222.0191002e20140507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095542DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb00084f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Kyung Mo10aSynthesis of water well-dispersed PEGylated iron oxide nanoparticles for MR/optical lymph node imaging  ap. 3355-3364.  aWe reported the synthesis of highly water-stable iron oxide nanoparticles by a simple one-pot reaction. Non-toxic polyethylene glycol MW 600 (PEG) acted as a solvent, capping agent and reducing agent in the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles. As a result of the synthesis, PEGylated small-size (4.2 ± 0.39 nm average diameter and 7.2 ± 1.9 nm hydrodynamic sizes measuring by DLS) iron oxide nanoparticles (USPIO) were obtained, which show great colloidal stability in water and tolerate high salt concentration (0.75 M sodium chloride) and a wide pH range of 4 to 12. Oxidation of PEG was observed during the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles, which makes USPIO easy to functionalize with other molecules. Functionalization of the USPIO surface with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was conducted for investigating the possibility for multimodal imaging. Also the cytotoxicity test and lymph node imaging were performed by using the FITC labelled USPIO (FITC@USPIO). According to these results, the stable water dispersed USPIO and FITC@USPIO are expected to apply for multimodal in vivo imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescein 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3aisothiocyanates 3alymph nodes 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3areducing agents 3asalt concentration 3asodium chloride 3asolvents 3atoxicity testing1 aCho, Hong-Il1 aChoi, Hyuck Jae1 aPiao, Yuanzhe0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 May 7, v. 2, no. 21 p.3355-3364dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb00084f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245015300174300001600327520078900343592002801132650003401160650002201194650001601216650002501232650001801257650001801275650001701293650003101310650002201341650001101363650001601374650001701390650001801407650001901425650001301444650001701457650002101474773013501495856008201630852000901712655001201721IND60592528520221121032405.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059252852DNAL7 a10.1007/s13562-017-0428-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajihashemi, Shokoofeh10aPhysiological, biochemical, antioxidant and growth characterizations of gibberellin and paclobutrazol-treated sweet leaf (Stevia rebaudiana B.) herb  ap. 237-240.  aA greenhouse experiment was designed to study the responses of Stevia rebaudiana herb to paclobutrazol (PBZ) and gibberellin (GA) treatments.

To achieve this goal, the regulations need to be reassessed in light of the development of new technologies. A currently rapidly growing new technology is nanotechnology, and engineered nanomaterials (ENM) are already produced and used in commercial products. The aim of this work was therefore to evaluate the current knowledge on human and ecotoxicology of ENM and their release and behavior in the environment in the context of major accident prevention. Nano-specific release paths are not to be expected. The established safety standards in the chemical industry are also applicable to ENM, especially the separate storage of flammable solvents and detention reservoirs. The potential of a release to the environment of ENM in powder form is larger than for suspensions; however, it can be minimized by safety measures established for conventional dusts. The considered human toxicology studies show that to date not conclusive enough answers regarding the toxicity of ENM can be made. The effects are dependent not only on the material itself but more on the functionalization, surface reactivity, size, and form. The acute ecotoxicity of ENM seems to be similar to the one of the corresponding microparticles (TiO₂) or the respective dissolved ions (Ag, Zn) with the exception of photocatalytically active nano-TiO₂, which has an increased toxicity. In order to guarantee that all ENM are included in the existing major accident regulations, different classification options are possible and the advantages and disadvantages are discussed. An important step will be the compulsory inclusion of nano-specific data in the Material Safety Data Sheets that serve as the basic medium to transfer information from the manufacturer to downstream users and authorities. We also call for a regular monitoring of the production and uses for ‘high production volume ENM’ that could have the largest implications for major accident regulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccident prevention 3achemical industry 3aecotoxicology 3ahumans 3ainformation exchange 3aions 3amonitoring 3ananomaterials 3asafety standards 3asolvents 3asuspensions 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aMueller, Nicole C1 aKrug, H.

While parents can compensate for the cost of parasitism by increasing their current reproductive investment, such change in resource allocation is expected to carry‐over costs on future reproduction. 2 Life history theory predicts that because long‐lived organisms have a high residual reproductive value, they should be more reluctant to increase parental effort in response to parasites. Also, when rearing successive infested broods, the cost of parasitism can cumulate over the years and hence be exacerbated by past infestations. 3 We tested these two predictions in the alpine swift Apus melba, a long‐lived colonial bird that is infested intensely by the nest‐based blood sucking louse‐fly Crataerina melbae. For this purpose, we manipulated ectoparasite load over 3 consecutive years and measured reproductive parameters in successive breeding attempts of adults assigned randomly to ‘parasitized’ and ‘deparasitized’ treatments. 4 In current reproduction, fathers of experimentally parasitized broods produced a similar number of offspring as fathers from the deparasitized treatment, but the rearing period was prolonged by 4 days. Fathers that were assigned to the parasitized treatment in year x produced significantly fewer fledglings the following year x + 1 than those of the deparasitized treatment. The number of young produced by fathers in year x + 1 was correlated negatively with the number of days they cared for their brood in the previous year x. We also found a significant interaction between treatments performed over 2 successive years, with fathers of parasitized broods suffering a larger fitness loss if in the past they had already cared for a parasitized brood rather than for a deparasitized one. Similar effects of parasitism, although partly non‐significant (0·05 < P‐values > 0·10), were found in mothers. 5 Altogether, our results show that parasites can modify resource allocation between current and future reproduction in long‐lived hosts, and that the cost of parasitism can cumulate over the years. It emphasizes the fact that effects of parasites can depend on past infestations and become apparent in future reproduction only.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApus 3aCrataerina 3aanimal ecology 3ablood 3aectoparasites 3alife history 3aparasitism 3aprogeny 3aresource allocation1 aROULIN, ALEXANDRE1 aTELLA, JOSÉ L.1 aBERSIER, LOUIS‐FÉLIX1 aRICHNER, HEINZ0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2004 Nov., v. 73, no. 6 p.1080-1088dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl16424x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00880.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01196naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245015100205300001100356520025400367592002800621650001500649650001500664650001500679650001600694650000900710773010800719856008200827852000900909655001200918IND60592528620221121032337.0190314e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059252862DNAL7 a10.1186/s13570-018-0119-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurnett, Tracy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3991-823310aReview of Pastoralist Livelihoods in Asian Drylands: Environment, Governance and Risk edited by Ariell Ahearn and Troy Sternberg with Allison Hahn  ap. 12.  aBOOK DETAILS: Ahearn, A, Sternberg, T with Hahn, A (eds.)

Their small mass and developing systems, including brain development may show adverse health effects from even low levels of contamination on a chronic or single dose case. In this paper one extraction method and two chromatographic techniques for the determination of pesticide residues in baby food were evaluated. A liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry technique combined with electrospray ionization (ESI), (LCâMS/MS) and gas chromatographyâmass spectrometry detection (GCâMSD) technique were applied in the detection of 50 pesticides in baby food. So-called QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method was used as a sample preparation procedure. The recoveries were investigated at three levels (5, 10 and 50Â Î¼g/kg) and the results obtained showed compliance with the contemporary EU requirements with a few exceptions. LOQs for most of the tested pesticides were below the EU MRLs (10Â Î¼g/kg), except deltamethrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, phosalone and beta-cyfluthrin (LOQs were 10Â Î¼g/kg). Both techniques were applied in the analysis of 50 samples of baby food manufactured in Serbia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aadverse effects 3aat-risk population 3abrain 3achildren 3acompliance 3acypermethrin 3adeltamethrin 3aenvironmental exposure 3afenvalerate 3afood industry 3afood marketing 3agas chromatography 3ainfant foods 3ainfants 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3amaximum residue limits 3apesticide residues 3aphosalone 3apollution 3aSerbia1 aShtereva, Deyana1 aBursiÄ, Vojislava1 aMladenova, Rositsa1 aLaziÄ, Sanja0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 Dec., v. 49, no. 2 p.312-319dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245011900189300001600308500001500324520093000339592002801269650002401297650001001321650001501331650001601346650001901362650002401381650001101405650001101416650001201427650007901439650003001518650002201548650002901570650002401599650003601623650002901659653002401688653001501712653001601727653001901743653002801762700001701790700001901807700001901826700001901845700001601864773010601880856008701986852000902073655001202082IND50062731220221122140811.0190409e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006273122DNAL7 a233479292pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.12.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Si-Kyung10aDry anaerobic digestion of food waste under mesophilic conditions: Performance and methanogenic community analysis  ap. 210-217.  a2019-12-06  aThe performance of dry anaerobic digestion (AD) of food waste was investigated under mesophilic conditions and the methanogenic community was investigated using 454 pyrosequencing. Stable dry AD was achieved by hydraulic retention time (HRT) control without the addition of alkali agents. The average CH4 production rate, CH4 content, and volatile solid reduction rate were 2.51±0.17m3/m3/d, 66±2.1%, and 65.8±1.22%, respectively, at an HRT of 40d. The methanogenic community of the seed sludge experienced a significant reduction in genus diversity from 18 to 4 and a dominant methanogenic shift from hydrogenotrophic to acetoclastic groups after the acclimation under dry condition. Almost all sequences of the dry anaerobic digester were closely related with those of Methanosarcina thermophila with similarity of 96.4–99.1%. The experimental results would serve as useful information to understand the dry AD system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aseeds 3afood waste 3aacclimation 3aMethanosarcina 3aanaerobic digestion 3asludge 3adrying 3aalkalis 2aBacteria, Anaerobicxclassificationxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood-Processing Industry 2aMethanexmetabolism 2aMicrobial Consortiaxphysiology 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 0aMicrobial community 0aFood waste 0afood wastes 0aPyrosequencing 0aDry anaerobic digestion1 aIm, Wan-Taek1 aKim, Dong-Hoon1 aKim, Moon-Hwan1 aShin, Hang-Sik1 aOh, Sae-Eun0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Mar., v. 131 p.210-217dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.12.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003600152245014200188300001600330520111100346592002801457650002501485650002501510650001701535650001001552650001801562650001201580650001701592650001801609650001601627650001501643650002601658650001301684650002001697650001601717650003301733650001001766650001301776650001601789650001101805653002701816653001601843653001501859653002101874653001701895700002601912700002801938700003101966773010001997856008702097852000902184655001202193IND60570297320221120043940.0190725e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057029732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.1412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeón-González, María Eugenia10aResidual brewing yeast as a source of polyphenols: Extraction, identification and quantification by chromatographic and chemometric tools  ap. 246-254.  aA method combining aqueous extraction, reversed-phase high-performance capillary liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (cLC-DAD) and chemometric tools, was developed to determine phenolic compounds in residual brewing yeast. The effect of temperature, nature of extraction solvent and method for separation of extract solution were studied to optimize the extraction conditions on the basis of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids content (TFC) and antioxidant capacity. Polyphenols were determined by cLC-DAD. Flavonols as rutin and kaempferol, flavonoids as naringin, phenolic acids as gallic acid and antioxidants as trans-ferulic and p-coumaric acids were found and quantified in the brewing residue. Data were subjected to evaluation using multifactor ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA), both showing that lyophilization pretreatment affects the content of individual polyphenols and that residual brewing yeast contains higher polyphenol amounts than the liquid beer waste. The obtained results suggest that residual brewing yeast could be a source of polyphenols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeers 3abrewers yeast 3abrewing 3achemometrics 3afreeze drying 3agallic acid 3akaempferol 3aliquid chromatography 3anaringin 3ap-coumaric acid 3apolyphenols 3aprincipal component analysis 3arutin 3asolvents 3atemperature 3awastes 0aResidual brewing yeast 0aPolyphenols 0aExtraction 0acLC-DAD analysis 0aChemometrics1 aGómez-Mejía, Esther1 aRosales-Conrado, Noelia1 aMadrid Albarrán, Yolanda,0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Nov. 30, v. 267 p.246-254dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.1413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014000165300001600305520138300321592002801704650001501732650001901747650002001766650002401786650002001810650001201830650001201842650001201854650001401866650001001880650002001890650001601910650001001926650002201936650002601958650001501984650001001999650001402009650001502023650001602038650001002054653001702064653001602081653002102097653001602118653001902134700001902153700001702172773012602189856008302315852000902398655001202407IND60697965120221122092636.0210305e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069796512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japr.2019.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimi, Z.S.14aThe effect of enzymatic feed pretreatment on bioavailability of phytate phosphorous, performance, and bone indices of tibia in broilers  ap. 372-382.  aAs production of cost-effective feed with minimal side effects on the environment is the main challenge in the feed industry, improving the bioavailability of nutrients, particularly phosphorous (P) is one way to approach these goals. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of feed pretreatment with commercial exogenous enzymes on P releasing from phytate and assessing the bioavailability of P in feed under in vivo conditions. Three hundred and sixty-one-day-old male Ross 308 broilers were kept for 18 D. For pretreating, feeds were supplemented with one of three commercial enzymes and HCl 0.5% and heated at 40°C for 2 h. Body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, bone indices, and phosphorus bioavailability were assayed. The results indicated that using commercial enzymes for pretreatment of feed had significant effects on feed intake, calcium (Ca), and P percentage of bone (P < 0.001); pretreatment also improved the bioavailability and absorption of P in intestinal digesta and feces. Therefore, it could be concluded that pretreatment of feed with 0.5% HCl and commercial enzymes is effective for increasing absorption and bioavailability of P, which could decrease excretion of phosphorous and, therefore, environmental pollution. In addition, feeding broilers with this treated feed might improve body weight and feed conversion ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacid treatment 3abioavailability 3abody weight changes 3abroiler feeding 3acalcium 3adigesta 3aenzymes 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3ahydrochloric acid 3aintestinal absorption 3aintestines 3amales 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3atibia 0apretreatment 0aphosphorous 0aRovabio Excel AP 0aBio-phytase 0aRovabio Max AP1 aModirsanei, M.1 aMansoori, B.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2020 June, v. 29, no. 2 p.372-382dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japr.2019.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011200169300001600281520146400297592002801761650001101789650002201800650001201822650002701834650001701861650001601878650002101894650001201915650001901927650001501946650000901961650001301970650002101983650001302004651001002017653002002027653001202047653001702059653001402076653002602090700001802116700001602134700001802150773010702168856008502275852000902360655001202369IND60537096420221118045111.0160807e20160703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053709642DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2016.11661752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yongxiang10aDistribution, Speciation and Bioaccumulation of Hg and As in Mariculture Sediments from Dongshan Bay, China  ap. 489-504.  aHg and As are the major hazardous pollutants in marine sediments due to their high toxicity to benthonic organisms. Understanding the spatial distribution, speciation and bioaccumulation of these toxic elements in sediments is therefore of high environmental importance for identifying their potential risks. Sediments and bivalves Paphia undulata were collected from the mariculture area of Dongshan Bay, China, for characterizing geochemistry (by using the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction procedure) and bioaccumulation of Hg and As [by calculating the biota sediment accumulation factor (BSAF)]. Both elements in sediments were mostly associated with the residual fraction (69.52–95.06% and 88.22–91.12% of the total concentration, respectively), followed by the oxidizable (bound to sulfides and organic matter) fraction (1.25–25.32% and 3.62–6.00%, respectively). However, Hg presented a higher bioaccumulation than As. Correlation analysis indicated that As in residual fraction and Hg in oxidizable fraction exert positive contributions (R = 0.927, P < 0.01 and R = 0.869, P < 0.05, respectively) on their own bioaccumulation factor. This indicated that P. undulata could adsorb both Hg in organic fraction and As in residual fraction from the sediments. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the potential dissolution and release of metals bound to sediments in the digestive tracts of marine organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPaphia 3aaquatic organisms 3aarsenic 3abioaccumulation factor 3ageochemistry 3amariculture 3amarine sediments 3amercury 3aorganic matter 3apollutants 3arisk 3asulfides 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3aChina 0aBioaccumulation 0abivalve 0aheavy metals 0asediments 0asequential extraction1 aMeng, Fanping1 aFu, Wenchao1 aWang, Zhifeng0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2016 July 3, v. 25, no. 5 p.489-504dTaylor & Francisx1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2016.11661753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012600157300002000283520104300303592002801346650002301374650002201397650003701419650000801456650001701464650001401481650002301495650001601518650001101534650002701545650001201572650001301584650001401597650001101611650001801622650001401640650001701654650003701671700001701708700001301725700001801738700001801756773012401774856007401898852000901972655001201981IND60642038020221118025722.0190506e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064203802DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06028a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanmin14aThe ethanol mediated-CeO₂-supported low loading ruthenium catalysts for the catalytic wet air oxidation of butyric acid  ap. 39796-39802.  aTwo kinds of nano-CeO₂-supported low loading Ru catalysts were prepared by ultrasonic-assisted incipient wetness impregnation method and their applications in catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) of butyric acid (BA) were investigated. Both of the catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, TEM, N₂ adsorption–desorption, Raman and H₂-TPR. According to the characterization results, compared to Ru/CeO₂ catalyst, the active component was well dispersed on the support and the particle sizes were smaller for the Ru/CeO₂-A catalyst which was added to some absolute ethanol in the process of preparation. Meanwhile, Ru/CeO₂-A catalysts possessed a high active surface area and had a higher Ce³⁺ and oxygen vacancy content due to the strong interaction between Ru species and CeO₂. Therefore, the Ru/CeO₂-A catalyst presented higher catalytic activity and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal can increase up to 64.05% after 2 h. It had excellent stability and can be reused many times without obvious loss of activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aair 3abutyric acid 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aceric oxide 3acerium 3achemical oxygen demand 3aethanol 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3aruthenium 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aYu, Chaoying1 aMeng, Xu1 aZhao, Peiqing1 aChou, Lingjun0 tRSC advances.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 7, no. 63 p.39796-39802dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06028a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02437naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002600181245007900207300001800286506007600304520116100380592002801541506003701569650002501606650001401631650001001645650001901655650001401674650001701688650002301705650002401728700001801752700002201770700002201792773014201814856007401956852000902030655001202039IND60670955820221207135217.0191002e20140423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095582DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb00094c2doi7 aPMC40487492pmcid7 a249210492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaczynski, Dominik J.10aRare earth nanoprobes for functional biomolecular imaging and theranostics  ap. 2958-2973.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aContrast agents designed to visualize the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer pathogenesis and progression have deepened our understanding of disease complexity and accelerated the development of enhanced drug strategies targeted to specific biochemical pathways. For the next generation probes and imaging systems to be viable, they must exhibit enhanced sensitivity and robust quantitation of morphologic and contrast features, while offering the ability to resolve the disease-specific molecular signatures that may be critical to reconstitute a more comprehensive portrait of pathobiology. This feature article provides an overview on the design and advancements of emerging biomedical optical probes in general and evaluates the promise of rare earth nanoprobes, in particular, for molecular imaging and theranostics. Combined with new breakthroughs in nanoscale probe configurations, and improved dopant compositions, and multimodal infrared optical imaging, rare-earth nanoprobes can be used to address a wide variety of biomedical challenges, including deep tissue imaging, real-time drug delivery tracking and multispectral molecular profiling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiochemical pathways 3achemistry 3adrugs 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3aprecision medicine 3arare earth elements1 aTan, Mei Chee1 aRiman, Richard E.1 aMoghe, Prabhas V.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Apr. 23, v. 2, no. 20 p.2958-2973dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb00094c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245018000166300001400346520161100360536012001971592002802091650001402119650000902133650001802142650001902160650002002179650001702199650001202216650001202228700002102240700002202261700002102283700001902304700001802323700002302341773013102364856008002495852000902575655001202584IND60645343020221122042254.0190528e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064534302DNAL7 a10.1177/1098612X187588832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Federica10aComparison of definitive-intent finely fractionated and palliative-intent coarsely fractionated radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment of feline microscopic injection-site sarcoma  ap. 65-72.  aThe aim of this retrospective, bi-institutional study was to evaluate the progression-free interval in a cohort of cats with postoperative microscopic injection-site sarcoma (ISS) treated with two different radiotherapy protocols. Included in the study were cats with ISSs undergoing macroscopic surgical removal and subsequent electron beam radiotherapy treatment with either a finely fractionated protocol (48 or 52.8 Gy over 4 weeks delivered in 12 or 16 fractions) or a coarsely fractionated protocol (36 Gy over 3 weeks administered in six fractions). Medical records were reviewed and follow-up information was collected. The Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test were used to compare the progression-free interval (PFI) between the two protocols and to test the influence of many clinical variables. Fifty-nine cats were included; 38 underwent a finely fractionated protocol and 21 a coarsely fractionated protocol. PFI was not significantly different between the two groups. Overall PFI was 2000 days (2000 vs 540 days; P = 0.449). When only first-occurrence cases were included, median PFI was significantly longer in the finely fractionated group compared with the coarsely fractionated group (1430 vs 540 days; P = 0.007). In cats that underwent multiple surgeries PFI was not different between protocols (233 vs 395 days; P = 0.353). Cats with first-occurrence ISSs appear to benefit from postoperative finely fractionated radiotherapy. The same benefit was not evident in cats that underwent multiple surgeries and we think a coarsely fractionated protocol would be indicated in these cases.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadjuvants 3acats 3afractionation 3ainjection site 3amedical records 3aradiotherapy 3asarcoma 3asurgery1 aMarconato, Laura1 aSabattini, Silvia1 aCancedda, Simona1 aLaganga, Paola1 aLeone, Vito F1 aRohrer Bley, Carla0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g2019 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.65-72dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1532-27507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1098612X187588833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245012100206300001600327520100200343592002801345650001901373650002701392650002201419650002401441650002201465650001901487650001601506650001501522650001401537650001201551651001601563651001301579700001601592700002201608700002401630700002201654773009801676856008201774852000901856655001201865IND60592528920221121032357.0181114e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059252892DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-017-0549-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFung, Elisabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0933-822X10aCo-occurrence of RNA viruses in Tasmanian-introduced bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) and honey bees (Apis mellifera)  ap. 243-251.  aA number of bee RNA viruses, including Deformed wing virus (DWV), are so far unreported from Australia. These viruses can be introduced together with imported live honey bees (Apis mellifera) and their products, with other bee species, and bee parasites. Given that bee viruses have a profound impact on bee health, it is surprising that since the introduction of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) onto Tasmania in 1992 from New Zealand, no work has been done to investigate which RNA viruses are associated with these bees. Consequently, we investigate the current prevalence of RNA viruses in B. terrestris and A. mellifera collected in south-eastern Tasmania. We did not find DWV in either A. mellifera and B. terrestris. However, both bee species shared Kashmir bee virus (KBV) and Sacbrood virus (SBV), but Black queen cell virus (BQCV) was detected only in A. mellifera. This reinforces the importance of ongoing strong regulation of the anthropogenic movement of live bees and their products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aBlack queen cell virus 3aBombus terrestris 3aDeformed wing virus 3aKashmir bee virus 3aSacbrood virus 3abee viruses 3ahoney bees 3aparasites 3aviruses 3aNew Zealand 3aTasmania1 aHill, Kelly1 aHogendoorn, Katja1 aHingston, Andrew B.1 aGlatz, Richard V.0 tApidologie.g2018 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.243-251dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-017-0549-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011500170300001600285520140900301592002801710650002001738650001101758650001401769650001701783650001101800650001101811650002201822651001201844651001601856700003001872700001401902773009701916856008102013852000902094655001202103IND50072587420221120234229.0150212e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007258742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-013-9201-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarbonnel, Vincent10aSilica Mass-Balance and Retention in the Riverine and Estuarine Scheldt Tidal System (Belgium/The Netherlands)  ap. 501-516.  aAn annual budget for dissolved silica (DSi) and biogenic silica (BSi) was constructed for the Scheldt estuary and for the entire riverine and estuarine Scheldt tidal system (Belgium/The Netherlands) using previously published silica concentrations and fluxes for the period 2003–2005. The annual estuarine DSi mass-balance was established, based on seasonal fluxes estimated using measured DSi concentrations and (fully transient) model simulations of conservative transport. The annual BSi mass-balance was deduced from measured BSi contents in the suspended particulate matter and annual mud fluxes taken from the literature. The Scheldt estuary acted as a net sink not only for the BSi carried by the tidal river as well as that produced by diatoms in the estuary, but also for large amounts of BSi imported from the coastal zone. This results in the retention of dissolved and biogenic silica higher than that of DSi alone, which is in contrast with the classical consideration that rivers act as a source of BSi for the coastal zone. DSi and silica (DSi + BSi) retentions amounted to, respectively, 28 and 64 % in the estuary, and 33 and 66 % in the entire tidal system. This study highlights thus the predominant role of the estuary in the entire Scheldt tidal system when dealing with silica dynamics, as well as the importance of including BSi when investigating estuarine silica retention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyta 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aparticulates 3arivers 3asilica 3asimulation models 3aBelgium 3aNetherlands1 aVanderborght, Jean-Pierre1 aChou, Lei0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 19, no. 5-6 p.501-516dSpringer-Verlagx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-013-9201-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245009900177300001600276520122500292592002801517650001701545650001601562650002301578650000901601650001401610650001201624650001001636650001901646650001001665650001601675650001601691650001201707650001301719700002001732700003201752700002101784773011001805856005501915852000901970655001201979IND4467409620221123044017.0120727e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446740962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00507.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTentelier, CÃ©dric10aMale antagonistic behaviour after spawning suggests paternal care in brown trout, Salmo trutta  ap. 580-587.  aâ The evolution of parental care depends on the sexâdependent resolution of a tradeâoff between present and future reproduction. In salmonids, the mating systems are often characterised by fierce maleâmale competition, and the absence of paternal care is widely admitted in these species. However, the fact that brown trout eggs can be cannibalised by peripheral individuals just after spawning suggests that dominant males would benefit from protecting their offspring by keeping cannibals away from the nest. We used 77 field observations of brown trout spawning to document the defensive behaviour of dominant males towards peripheral individuals before and after spawning, and test whether this behaviour was related to the probability of the clutch being cannibalised. We showed that dominant males stayed on the nest and chased peripherals even after the eggs were laid and fertilised. The number of chases performed by dominant males during the 2âmin following spawning was negatively correlated to the probability of egg cannibalism. This result indicates that brown trout males can provide direct benefits to females through protection against egg cannibalism by peripheral individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3acannibalism 3adefensive behavior 3aeggs 3aevolution 3afemales 3amales 3amating systems 3anests 3aoviposition 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3aspawning1 aLarrieu, Maider1 aAymes, JeanâChristophe1 aLabonne, Jacques0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2011 Dec., v. 20, no. 4 p.580-587dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-66917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00507.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011000173300001600283520178400299592002802083650001802111650002902129650002402158650002202182650001902204650001502223650001602238650002402254650001302278650001102291650000702302650001502309650001302324651001902337651001202356651001502368700002302383700002502406700001802431700002202449700002002471700001802491700002302509773009702532856004802629852000902677655001202686IND50072587620221120222212.0140201e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007258762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-013-9210-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, Andreas J.10aClues from Current High CO₂ Environments on the Effects of Ocean Acidification on CaCO₃ Preservation   ap. 353-369.  aAcidification of surface seawater owing to anthropogenic activities has raised serious concerns on its consequences for marine calcifying organisms and ecosystems. To acquire knowledge concerning the future consequences of ocean acidification (OA), researchers have relied on incubation experiments with organisms exposed to future seawater conditions, numerical models, evidence from the geological record, and recently, observations from aquatic environments exposed to naturally high CO₂ and low pH, e.g., owing to volcanic CO₂ vents, upwelling, and groundwater input. In the present study, we briefly evaluate the distribution of dissolved CO₂–carbonic acid parameters at (1) two locations in the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean as a function of depth, (2) a mangrove environment in Bermuda, (3) a seasonally stratified body of water in a semi-enclosed sound in Bermuda, and (4) in temporarily isolated tide pools in Southern California. We demonstrate that current in situ conditions of seawater pCO₂, pH, and CaCO₃ saturation state (Ω) in these environments are similar or even exceed the anticipated changes to these parameters in the open ocean over the next century as a result of OA. The observed differences between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans with respect to seawater CO₂–carbonic acid chemistry, preservation of CaCO₃ minerals, and the occurrence and distribution of deep-sea marine calcifiers, support the hypothesized negative effects of OA on the production and preservation of CaCO₃ in surface seawater. Clues provided from shallow near-shore environments in Bermuda and Southern California support these predictions, but also highlight that many marine calcifiers already experience relatively high seawater pCO₂ and low pH conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic environment 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3amathematical models 3aminerals 3aoceans 3apH 3aprediction 3aseawater 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBermuda 3aCalifornia1 aBates, Nicholas R.1 aJeffries, Marlene A.1 aFreeman, Kyra1 aDavidson, Charles1 aStringer, Shaun1 aBetzler, Evan1 aMackenzie, Fred T.0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 19, no. 5-6 p.353-369dSpringer-Verlagx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-013-9210-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012000166300001600286520073000302592002801032650002401060650001001084650001101094650001401105650001201119650001801131650002601149650001201175650001401187650002101201650001401222650003901236650001401275653001201289653001201301653002401313700001801337700001601355700001601371700003301387773010001420856008701520852000901607655001201616IND60570297620221120060106.0190402e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057029762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Rui14aThe functional properties and application of gelatin derived from the skin of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)  ap. 464-469.  aThe objective of this work was to extract gelatin from skin of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and to study its functional properties and application in ice-cream and beer. SDS-PAGE patterns showed that channel catfish gelatin (CCG) had more high molecular weight components (β and γ chains) than had calf bone gelatin (CBG). The viscosity of CCG was 42mPa.s at 10°C, which was three times more than that of CBG. Compared to CBG, CCG presented higher emulsion capacity and stability, as well as higher foaming stability. CCG conferred the ice-cream samples and beer with better mouth feel and clarification effect, respectively. The results indicated that CCG had great potential to be utilized in the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIctalurus punctatus 3abeers 3acalves 3aemulsions 3afoaming 3afood industry 3afunctional properties 3agelatin 3aice cream 3amolecular weight 3amouthfeel 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aviscosity 0aCatfish 0aGelatin 0aFunctional property1 aZhang, Junjie1 aLiu, Liping1 aCui, Wenzhe1 aRegenstein, J.

Honey is usually harvested and replaced by sugar syrup. We hypothesized that replacing honey may change the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and therefore compromise pathogen resilience. Fifteen colonies were fed with wheat starch syrup, sucrose syrup, or blossom honey. 16S-based bacterial community analysis was performed on three individuals per hive in summer and winter, and Nosema ceranae and Crithidia/Lotmaria levels were assessed by qPCR. Seasonal differences in the intestinal microbiota and N. ceranae were found; however, microbiota and parasite levels were very similar between the feed types. Rhizobiales and Bifidobacteria were found to be increased in the bees that had received honey or wheat starch syrup, as compared to sucrose syrup. In conclusion, intestinal microbiota and parasites were found to be largely unaffected by the winter feed type.  aPublisher supplied data  aMicroBee ProjectcMinisterium für ländlichen Raum und Verbraucherschutz Baden-Württemberg 3aBifidobacterium 3aCrithidia 3aNosema ceranae 3aRhizobiales 3abacterial communities 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseasonal variation 3asucrose 3asummer 3asyrups 3awheat starch 3awinter1 aBöhme, Franziska1 aCodrea, Marius Cosmin1 aSeitz, Alexander1 aNahnsen, Sven1 aBinzer, Mieke1 aRosenkranz, Peter1 aHasselmann, Martin0 tApidologie.g2018 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.252-264dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-017-0551-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013500157300002000292520182300312592002802135650001902163650002602182650002302208650001102231650001902242650001902261650002302280650001502303650001202318650003502330650001402365700001802379700001302397700001702410700001702427700001702444700001802461773012402479856007402603852000902677655001202686IND60642038520221118025842.0190506e20170710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064203852DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra06041f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Wenchao10aMicrocosmic understanding on thickening capability of copolymers in supercritical carbon dioxide: the key role of π–π stacking  ap. 34567-34573.  aIn this study, styrene/heptadecafluorodecyl acrylate (St–HFDA) copolymers of different compositions were synthetized for the purpose of thickening supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO₂). The cloud point pressures of the copolymer–CO₂ mixtures and the thickening effects of these copolymers for SC-CO₂ were measured. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to evaluate the intermolecular interactions and microstructures of polymer–CO₂ systems, the copolymer–CO₂ interaction energy, cohesive energy density (CED), solubility parameter, equilibrium conformations and radial distribution functions (RDFs) were obtained, which provided useful information for microscopic understanding on the thickening capability of copolymers in SC-CO₂. It was found that all the synthesized St–HFDA copolymers induced greater viscosity enhancements of SC-CO₂ compared to poly(Heptadecafluorodecyl acrylate) (PHFDA), and π–π stacking of the Styrene (St) groups played a key role in thickening SC-CO₂. On one hand, the introduction of the St groups into PHFDA weakened the CO₂-philicity of the polymers by reducing the polymer–CO₂ interaction and increasing polymer–polymer interactions, resulting in higher cloud point pressure in SC-CO₂ compared to PHFDA. On the other hand, the increase of the polymer–polymer interaction via π–π stacking provided an associative force to thicken SC-CO₂. The subtle relationship between the copolymer composition and thickening abilities of the copolymers in SC-CO₂ were evaluated and the optimum styrene molar ratio was determined. It can be concluded that the content of the CO₂-philic HFDA groups and the CO₂-phobic St groups in the copolymers should be optimized to achieve the balance between the solubility and the thickening capability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical interactions 3acomposite polymers 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3amicrostructure 3amolecular dynamics 3asolubility 3astyrene 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3aviscosity1 aSun, Baojiang1 aLi, Ying1 aFan, Haiming1 aGao, Yonghai1 aSun, Haoyang1 aLi, Guangchao0 tRSC advances.g2017 July 10, v. 7, no. 55 p.34567-34573dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra06041f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245016800157300001800325520175900343592002802102650002302130650003702153650001502190650001102205650002002216650002102236650003102257650002802288650001302316650001702329650002402346650001502370650001302385650001902398650001502417650002002432650002002452650002402472650002302496650002202519650003702541650003702578700001702615700001702632700001302649700001702662700001702679773014202696856007402838852000902912655001202921IND60670956320221117165915.0191002e20140326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067095632DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb00104d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hailing10aLayered graphene nanostructures functionalized with NH₂-rich polyelectrolytes through self-assembly: construction and their application in trace Cu(ii) detection  ap. 2212-2219.  aLayer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembled graphene nanosheets, noncovalently functionalized with evenly spread-NH₂ groups attached on the linear polyelectrolyte of polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH), were produced successfully. The fabrication process consisted of two steps. At first, completely exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) species were highly stacked on the surface of a pretreated glassy carbon electrode as a result of the sequential adsorption of the cationic layer of PAH and the anionic layer of oxygen-containing GO through electrostatic and/or hydrophobic interactions. Then, the GO species were chemically reduced by a strong reducing agent, NaBH₄. The structural morphology and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared graphene-based multilayer LBL composite electrodes were thoroughly characterized by techniques such as ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Combined with differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV), the obtained –NH₂ functional group modified nanocomposite electrodes with highly ordered multilayer superconductive graphene showed improved performance for trace detection of heavy metal ions such as Cu(ii), resulting in sensitive electrochemical sensors. A linear dynamic range from 0.5 to 50 μM for Cu(ii) was obtained under optimized conditions with a relatively low detection limit (S/N = 3) of around 0.35 μM. Our results provide valuable insight for the facile design of highly ordered graphene nanostructures with specific functionality of interest in a vast range, leading to a versatile nanoplatform for environmental or biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene 3aheavy metals 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3apolyallylamines 3areducing agents 3asensors (equipment) 3asodium borohydride 3asuperconductivity 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aLi, Shangwei1 aSun, Dongmei1 aChen, Yu1 aZhou, Yiming1 aLu, Tianhong0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Mar. 26, v. 2, no. 16 p.2212-2219dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb00104d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006100169300001600230520203000246592002802276650001002304650001102314650001802325650001802343650001502361650002102376650002702397650002702424650001402451650001202465650001402477650000902491650001902500653001902519653003102538653003402569653002302603700002202626700002202648700002202670700002002692700002202712773012002734856008202854852000902936655001202945IND60636204920221121042557.0190405e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063620492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2018.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdoon, Ahmed S.10aIn Vitro Maturation and Fertilization of Donkey Oocytes  ap. 118-122.  aMany wild and domestic donkey breeds are now at risk of extinction, therefore there is an urgent need for genetic conservation of these breeds. The development of in vitro conditions that support oocyte maturation, fertilization, and embryo development may improve in vitro production of donkey embryos. This work was designed to identify the optimal condition for in vitro production of donkey embryos. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, grade 1 and 2 cumulus-oocyte complexes were subjected to in vitro maturation in the following media: tissue culture medium 199 (TCM199), Christopher Rozenkrans 1aa medium (CR1aa), Christopher Rozenkrans 2aa medium (CR2aa), potassium simplex optimized medium (KSOMaa), centrifuged follicular fluid (CFF), or non-CFF from preovulatory follicles. In experiment 2, in vitro–matured donkey oocytes were subjected to in vitro fertilization (IVF) in Fert-TALP medium supplemented with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% CFF. After fertilization, the cleavage rates and embryo development were assessed across groups. The results of experiment 1 revealed that non-CFF and KSOMaa significantly increase cumulus cell expansion. The percentage of oocytes reaching the metaphase II stage nuclear maturation was significantly higher for donkey oocytes matured in non-CFF. Also, the percentage of degenerated oocytes was lower for donkey oocytes matured in vitro in non-CFF compared with those in TCM199, CR1aa, CR2aa, KSOMaa, or CFF. In experiment 2, IVF of in vitro–matured donkey oocytes using 100% CFF as IVF medium produced a significantly higher fertilization rate with respect to the number of fertilized oocytes extruding the second polar body. In conclusion, non-CFF from preovulatory follicles gave the highest cumulus cell expansion and nuclear maturation rates for in vitro–matured donkey oocytes. Hundred percent CFF was the best medium for IVF of matured donkey oocytes; however, cleavage rate and embryo development are still very low and need further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasses 3abreeds 3aculture media 3aembryogenesis 3aextinction 3afollicular fluid 3agermplasm conservation 3ain vitro fertilization 3ametaphase 3aoocytes 3apotassium 3arisk 3atissue culture 0aDonkey oocytes 0aIn vitro maturation media 0aIn vitro fertilization media 0aEmbryo development1 aFathalla, Said I.1 aShawky, Sherif M.1 aKandil, Omaima M.1 aKishta, Afaf A.1 aMasoud, Shimaa R.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2018 June, v. 65 p.118-122dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2018.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245013400179300001600313500001500329520147900344592002801823650002201851650002601873650001101899650001701910650001701927650001601944650002001960650002401980650002902004650002202033650001402055650001702069650001402086650002302100650001702123650003002140650002102170650004402191650001102235650002002246650004802266650004402314650004902358653001302407700001802420700001902438700001902457700001702476773011502493856004802608852000902656655001202665IND4474149620221123032738.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447414962DNAL7 a214686322pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-011-9237-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJo, Bo Bae14aThe Binding of Hepatitis B Virus X Protein to Glioma-Associated Oncogene Homologue 1 and its Biological Characterization In vitro  ap. 109-122.  a2019-12-06  aHepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) is a 17-kDa transcriptional coactivator that plays a significant role in the regulation of genes involved in inflammation and cell survival. It has been known to be involved in the development of liver cancer and alteration of the cellular HBx level may influence the pathogenesis of HBV-induced liver diseases. The transcription factor GLI1, a member of the glioma-associated oncogene homologue (GLI) subfamily of Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins is involved in signal transduction within the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is involved in the development of many human malignancies. GLI activation is important for cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in various cancers. To investigate whether the transcriptional coactivator HBx binds to the zinc finger transcription factor GLI1, recombinant HBx and GLI1 were isolated. Expression and purification of the HBx and GLI1 proteins were successfully performed in Escherichia coli. The binding of HBx to GLI1 was detected by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIAcore), fluorescence measurement, and a His-tagged pull-down experiment. After measuring the fluorescence emission spectra of purified HBx and GLI1, it was found that the interaction of these proteins is accompanied by significant conformational changes in one or both. This study provides important clues for the structural identification of signal transduction pathways involving the HBx and GLI1 proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis B virus 3atranscription factors 3ahumans 3afluorescence 3ainflammation 3aErinaceidae 3aliver neoplasms 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3azinc finger motif 3aemissions 3apathogenesis 3aoncogenes 3acell proliferation 3aspectroscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance 3aEscherichia coli 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aProtein Binding 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTrans-Activatorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aproteins1 aJeong, Mi Suk1 aPak, So-yŏng,1 aCheong, JaeHun1 aJang, Se Bok0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 Sept., v. 165, no. 1 p.109-122dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-011-9237-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001500148245011500163300001400278520121800292592002801510650001101538650001101549650001101560650002401571650001701595650001201612650001401624650002301638650001001661650001001671650001101681650002001692650001201712650001901724650000901743650001401752700001601766700001801782700001701800773008901817856008401906852000901990655001201999IND4446671920221118043142.0141112e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444667192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2010.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWuliji, T.10aSelection response to fleece weight, wool characteristics, and heritability estimates in yearling Romney sheep  ap. 26-31.  aThe juvenile live weights, yearling fleece weight and wool characteristics of 2987 Romney progeny of 114 sires born over 9 breeding seasons in a fleece-weight-selected and a random control line were analysed. The high fleece weight-selected flock performance was higher (P<0.001) for weaning weight and spring weight (6.9 and 8.4%), higher (P<0.001) for greasy and clean fleece weight (23.8 and 24.3%), and also higher (P<0.001) for FD by 1μm, staple length by 6mm, and wool yellowness by 0.3 unit than random control yearling sheep. Heritability estimates for weaning and spring live weight, greasy fleece weight, clean fleece weight, yield, fibre diameter, staple length, staple strength, loose wool bulk, brightness and yellowness were 0.15, 0.51, 0.35, 0.36, 0.40, 0.57, 0.41, 0.24, 0.46, 0.12 and 0.14 respectively. The heritability estimates are within the range of the long wool sheep breeds studied previously. The high selection differential achieved in the initial screening commercial flocks however facilitated to approach a selection response peak in a shorter selection duration and thus resulted in a non-significant genetic gain in greasy fleece weight when averaged over the 9years of selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRomney 3afleece 3aflocks 3agenetic improvement 3aheritability 3aprogeny 3ascreening 3aselection response 3asheep 3asires 3aspring 3astaple (fibers) 3aweaning 3aweaning weight 3awool 3ayearlings1 aDodds, K.G.1 aAndrews, R.N.1 aTurner, P.R.0 tLivestock science.g2011 Jan., v. 135, no. 1 p.26-31dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2010.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03631naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010000169300001800269500002000287500001900307500000900326520226800335592002802603596003902631650001302670650002902683650001102712650001502723650002002738650001202758650000802770650002602778650001502804650002302819650001902842650001702861651001302878651001002891700002202901700002302923773013502946856008303081852000903164655001203173IND60663518220221120082409.0220803e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066351822DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2018.09.05582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrueger, Erik S.10aDevelopment and Evaluation of Soil Moisture‐Based Indices for Agricultural Drought Monitoring  ap. 1392-1406.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: In situ soil moisture data were used to develop agricultural‐drought indices. Promising indices were directly linked to drought impacts (i.e., lower crop yield). Preferred indices, formulated as anomalies, were comparable across time and space. These can be derived from in situ soil moisture data common to networks worldwide. Our methodology is transferrable to other regions with in situ soil moisture data. ABSTRACT: Agricultural drought is characterized by low soil moisture levels that negatively affect agricultural production, but in situ soil moisture measurements are largely absent from indices commonly used to describe agricultural drought. Instead, many indices incorporate weather‐derived soil moisture estimates, which is necessary, in part, because the relationships between in situ soil moisture and agricultural‐drought impacts are not well quantified. Our objective was to use in situ soil moisture data from monitoring networks in Oklahoma and West Texas to identify a soil moisture‐based agricultural drought index that is (i) strongly related to crop‐yield anomaly across networks, (ii) comparable across time and space, and (iii) readily understandable. Candidate indices included soil matric potential (MP), soil water storage (SWS), and fraction of available water capacity (FAW), with indices assessed in their raw form and after climatological (i.e., anomalies) or statistical standardization. At the county level, indices related similarly to crop‐yield anomaly, with soil moisture‐yield anomaly correlation coefficients averaging 0.63, 0.76, and 0.76 for winter wheat, hay, and cotton, respectively. However, standardization was essential to maximize temporal and spatial comparability, and at the regional level, standardized indices were more highly correlated with crop‐yield anomaly than non‐standardized indices. Our findings show that existing in situ soil moisture datasets can underpin regional drought‐monitoring systems. The SWS‐anomaly may be the preferred index because it is comparable across space and time, has units that are readily understandable (e.g., mm or inches), and can be broadly applied using data from the many in situ soil‐moisture monitoring networks across the world.  aPublisher supplied data  aG15AP00151cDepartment of Interior 3aagronomy 3aavailable water capacity 3acotton 3acrop yield 3adata collection 3adrought 3ahay 3asoil matric potential 3asoil water 3asoil water storage 3aspace and time 3awinter wheat 3aOklahoma 3aTexas1 aOchsner, Tyson E.1 aQuiring, Steven M.0 tAgronomy journal.g2019 Mar., v. 111, no. 3 p.1392-1406dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2018.09.05583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245025500168500001900423500002000442520109000462592002801552596006401580650002201644650001601666650001101682650001501693650002401708700002001732700005901752773011401811856007801925852000902003655001202012IND60708526020221117224338.0200826e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070852602DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2020000922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Amico, Rebecca N.10aDriving Protein Conformational Cycles in Physiology and Disease: “Frustrated” Amino Acid Interaction Networks Define Dynamic Energy Landscapes: Amino Acid Interaction Networks Change Progressively Along Alpha Tryptophan Synthase's Catalytic Cycle  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA general framework by which dynamic interactions within a protein will promote the necessary series of structural changes, or “conformational cycle,” required for function is proposed. It is suggested that the free‐energy landscape of a protein is biased toward this conformational cycle. Fluctuations into higher energy, although thermally accessible, conformations drive the conformational cycle forward. The amino acid interaction network is defined as those intraprotein interactions that contribute most to the free‐energy landscape. Some network connections are consistent in every structural state, while others periodically change their interaction strength according to the conformational cycle. It is reviewed here that structural transitions change these periodic network connections, which then predisposes the protein toward the next set of network changes, and hence the next structural change. These concepts are illustrated by recent work on tryptophan synthase. Disruption of these dynamic connections may lead to aberrant protein function and disease states.  aPublisher supplied data  aMCB 1615032cDivision of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences 3aGibbs free energy 3aamino acids 3aenergy 3aphysiology 3atryptophan synthase1 aMurray, Alec M.1 aBoehr, David D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8886-28730 tBioEssays.g2020 Sept., v. 42, no. 9 p.e2000092-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2020000923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245005800168300001600226520182900242592002802071650002302099650001802122650003802140650001402178650002202192650003002214650001102244653001002255653004002265653001902305653002602324653002502350653000902375700002202384773009602406856008402502852000902586655001202595IND60570124520221121060712.0170708e20170804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057012452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.06.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchick, Dinah10aLogit-log evaluation of planar yeast estrogen screens  ap. 147-152.  aReceptor assays like the yeast estrogen screen (YES) performed in microtiter plates normally provide dose-response curves with a sigmoidal shape in semi-log plots. Such sigmoidal plots can be linearized by the logit function resulting in logit-log plots, as mainly known for the evaluation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and radioimmunoassays. Since the planar yeast estrogen screen (pYES) represents the transfer of the receptor assay YES to high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), it was assumed to obtain sigmoidal shaped dose-response curves from the measured signals, which subsequently could be used to generate logit-log plots. However, it was observed that typical sigmoidal curves were not obtained, when peak areas were plotted against the applied amount on a logarithmic scale (log amount). Therefore, peak heights were examined in the present study, which revealed proper dose-response curves when plotted against the log amount. The presence of sigmoidal dose-response curves from HPTLC-pYES made it possible to transform the signals into logits and, therefore, to create logit-log plots with linear correlations. The logit-log plots for the estrogen active compounds (EAC) 17β-estradiol (E2) and 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) provided a working range up to 500pg/zone. Applying logit-log plots, mean recovery rates for E2 and EE2 from spiked water samples (2–20ng/L) were determined to 90% and 108%, respectively, with ≤24% RSD. Moreover, the linear graphs allowed an easy determination of the half maximal effect dose (ED50) of EAC, since the intersection of the graph with the abscissa represents the ED50. Additionally, with the knowledge of the ED50 values, the estrogenic potential of EAC in terms of estradiol equivalent factors (EEF) could be determined, resulting in 0.64 for EE2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3adose response 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aestradiol 3aradioimmunoassays 3athin layer chromatography 3ayeasts 0aHPTLC 0aPlanar yeast estrogen screen (pYES) 0aLogit-log plot 0aEstradiol equivalents 0aDose-response curves 0aED501 aSchwack, Wolfgang0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Aug. 04, v. 1509 p.147-152dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.06.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02467naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014300171520127000314592002801584650001901612650000901631650001401640650003301654653002201687653001601709653001301725653002501738653001701763653000801780700002601788700006001814700002301874773011301897856008602010852000902096655001202105IND60756554820221118030552.0211213e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075655482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1296462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Amar Kumar10aStudy on the performance and emission characteristics of pyrolytic waste plastic oil operated CI engine using response surface methodology  aDepletion of fossil fuels, strict pollution rules, and potential generation of waste plastics strive to focus another facet of value addition by conversion of plastic wastes into alternate fuel for a diesel engine. The current study is intended to optimize the combined influences of engine load, fuel blend, and compression ratio on the performance and emission of a normal diesel engine fueled with waste plastic oil diesel (WPO) blend by using response surface methodology (RSM). Optimum engine performance i.e.maximum brake thermal efficiency and minimum NOₓ emissions are established using the technique of response surface methodology concerning three different engine input parameters engine load, compression ratios, and fuel blend ratio. The compression ratio of 17, 10% of WPO-diesel blending at full load conditions are found to be optimum input parameters. And accordingly, the brake thermal efficiency of 28.8% and NOₓ emission of 162.45 ppm are obtained under multi-response optimization techniques. A sensitivity analysis has also been accomplished to clarify the significant contribution of different parameters and their orders of importance. The compression ratio has resulted as the most significant factor followed by load and % fuel blend.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiesel engines 3aoils 3apollution 3aresponse surface methodology 0aWaste plastic oil 0aPerformance 0aEmission 0aSensitivity analysis 0aOptimization 0aRSM1 aMohapatra, Taraprasad1 aPanda, Achyut K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3479-40081 aSahoo, Sudhansu S.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 328 p.129646-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1296463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245012900158300001800287520150800305592002801813650000801841650002101849650002201870650001101892650001901903650000901922650001501931650003501946650001001981650001001991650002202001650001502023650000902038650002702047650002002074650001802094650001102112653001302123653002202136653001502158653001002173653000802183653002402191700001702215700001302232700002002245700001502265700001602280700001602296700002402312700001802336700005802354773014802412856008002560852000902640655001202649IND60642715020221119024037.0190508e20190422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064271502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b011142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yu10aFluoride Interferes with the Sperm Fertilizing Ability via Downregulated SPAM1, ACR, and PRSS21 Expression in Rat Epididymis  ap. 5240-5249.  aFluoride is a widespread environmental pollutant that can induce low sperm quality and fertilizing ability; however, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. Hence, we aimed to investigate the influence of fluoride on the sperm fertilizing ability via some key proteins in the epididymis. For this, 40 adult rats were assigned randomly into four groups. The control group was given distilled water, while the other three groups were given 25, 50, and 100 mg of NaF/L via drinking water for 56 days, respectively. After 1 day, epididymides were processed for sperm–egg binding, RNA extraction, western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis. Fluoride exposure reduced the ability of sperm to break down the egg cumulus cell layer. A further study revealed that fluoride altered the expression levels of genes and proteins related to acrosome reaction in vivo, including SPAM1, ACR, and PRSS21. However, fluoride only affected the expression of the ACR protein only in the epididymis but not in the testis. Fluoride also affected the expression levels of the membrane proteins CD9 and CD81 of epididymosomes in the epididymis. From the results, it can be concluded that fluoride exposure reduced the ability of sperm to break down the egg cumulus cell layer, which could be one of the reasons for decreased fertility ability in males treated with fluoride. These results provide some theoretical guidance and new ideas for treatments of low fertility, infertility, and other reproductive diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aacrosome reaction 3aadults 3adrinking water 3aeggs 3aepididymis 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3amales 3amembrane proteins 3apollutants 3arats 3areproductive disorders 3asodium fluoride 3asperm quality 3atestes 0afluoride 0aacrosome reaction 0aepididymis 0asperm 0arat 0afertilizing ability1 aLiang, Zhen,1 aGao, Yan1 aJiang, Shanshan1 aHe, Yuyang1 aHan, Yongli1 aOlfati, Ali1 aManthari, Ram Kumar1 aWang, Jundong1 aZhang, Jianhai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6005-83760 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Apr. 22, v. 67, no. 18 p.5240-5249dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b011143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008500162300001600247520123400263592002801497650001701525650003001542650001901572650001101591650001101602650001301613650002401626650001201650650003701662650001201699651001001711700001701721773010301738856004801841852000901889655001201898IND50068374820221116191847.0130807e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006837482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-013-0616-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ying10aResidents’ activity-travel behavior variation by communities in Beijing, China  ap. 492-505.  aChina’s transition from a planned economy to a market economy has resulted in many changes in its urban structure and society and provided an opportunity for a quasi-longitudinal case study on the relationship between the built environment and activity-travel behavior. This paper draws upon data from an activity diary survey conducted in Beijing in 2007. The survey sample comprised 652 residents living in Danwei (work unit), commodity housing, and affordable housing neighborhoods. On the basis of the three-dimensional geo-visualization analysis of the space-time path and statistical multivariate regression models of daily travel and leisure time, it was found that both residential spatial factors and socio-demographics influence residents’ daily behaviors. The findings show that Danwei residents have less daily travel time than those who live in commodity housing, but people living in affordable housing endure the longest travel time. Daily leisure time is associated more with individual attributes. We argue that although China’s transition is currently gradual, the Danwei system may continue to play significant roles in daily life, and it might provide a valuable model for neighborhood spatial planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acentrally planned economy 3amarket economy 3amodels 3apeople 3aplanning 3aregression analysis 3asociety 3asociodemographic characteristics 3asurveys 3aChina1 aChai, Yanwei0 tChinese geographical science.g2013 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.492-505dSpringer-Verlagx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-013-0616-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009700174300001400271520121900285592002801504650001501532650002001547650002001567650001301587650001901600650002301619653001101642653002301653653003201676653002301708653000901731700001601740700002801756773021101784856008301995852000902078655001202087IND60773606320221119144421.0220523e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077360632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jher.2022.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelih Koşucu, Mehmet10aExtending EPANET hydraulic solver capacity with rigid water column global gradient algorithm  ap. 31-43.  aEPANET is one of the most commonly used open-source programs in hydraulic modelling water distribution networks (WDNs), based on steady-state and extended period simulation approaches. These approaches effectively estimate flow capacity and average pressures in networks; however, EPANET is not yet fully effective in modelling incompressible unsteady flows in WDNs. In this study, the hydraulic solver capacity of EPANET 3 is extended with the Rigid Water Column Global Gradient Algorithm (RWC-GGA) to model incompressible unsteady flow hydraulics in WDNs. Moreover, we incorporated dynamically more accurate valve expressions than the existing ones in the default EPANET code and introduced a new global convergence algorithm, Convergence Tracking Control Method (CTCM), in the solver code. The RWC-GGA, CTCM, and valve expressions are tested and validated in three different WDNs varying from simple to sophisticated set-ups. The results show that incompressible unsteady flows can be modelled with RWC-CGA and dynamic valve representations. Finally, the convergence problem due to the valve motion and the pressure-dependent algorithm (PDA) is solved by the implemented global convergence algorithm, i.e. CTCM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acontrol methods 3afluid mechanics 3aresearch 3atransient flow 3awater distribution 0aEPANET 0aHydraulic Modeling 0aWater Distribution Networks 0aRigid Water Column 0aCTCM1 aAlbay, Enes1 aCüneyd Demirel, Mehmet0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2022 May, v. 42 p.31-43dElsevier B.V.aInternational Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific DivisionwJournal:2188x1570-64437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2022.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014400168300001600312520084800328592002801176650001701204650001601221650001101237650001401248650001201262650002201274650000901296650001701305653000801322653002101330653000801351653001201359653001701371700001801388773010701406856008401513852000901597655001201606IND60723827420221122055101.0210117e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072382742DNAL7 a10.5958/j.2229-4473.26.1.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamole, Sweta10aInsilico SSR Mining And Analysis of BAC/PAC Sequences Present Within The Putative Root Related Drought Tolerant QTL Marker Interval of Rice  ap. 111-115.  aRice (Oryza sativa L.) is used as staple food for more than 50% of the world's population.

The root morphology and physical characteristics are reported to associate them with drought tolerance. This study focuses on analysis of BAC/PAC sequences of root related drought tolerant QTLs of rice. The marker interval sequences were taken from Gramene Marker Database and the BAC/PAC sequences were taken from Pseudomolecule Build 5 available at International Rice Genome Sequencing Project (IRGSP). The sequences were analysed using Batch Primer 3 and were mined for putative primers, classified based on length variation, analyzed for frequency of motifs and aligned to respective Amino Acid Codons.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aamino acids 3acodons 3adatabases 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3arice 3astaple foods 0aQTL 0aMolecular Marker 0aSSR 0aBAC/PAC 0aBatchPrimer31 aChouhan, Usha0 tVegetos.g2013 June, v. 26, no. 1 p.111-115dSociety for Plant ResearchwJournal:2073x2229-44737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/j.2229-4473.26.1.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01142naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245004000162300001600202520027400218592002800492650002000520650003000540650001700570650001600587650001300603700002100616773008900637856008200726990002300808852000900831655001200840IND60092869920221120092615.0141103e20120406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009286992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2012.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Hui10aIn Epigenetic Therapy, Less Is More  ap. 353-354.  aHow DNA methylation inhibitors exert their anticancer effects in patients is not well understood.

However, NZP is difficult to fabricate into monoliths because it requires both high temperatures and long sintering times. An alternative low temperature route to obtain a tungsten (IV) and tin (IV) containing NZP crystalline phase uses a process of glass reactive sintering of a phosphate glass. Using a microwave oven, a glass with the appropriate composition in the NaPO3–Sn(II)O–W(VI)O3 ternary diagram is prepared by a conventional melting and casting technique. After crushing, the glass powder is pressed at room temperature. The green pellet is cured during various times at temperatures where glass reactive sintering takes place. From XRD and DTA experiments, we have shown that different parameters influence the achievement of NZP phase. Consequently, specific conditions, such as (i) initial glass composition, (ii) equimolar quantities of SnO and WO3, (iii) glass particle size lower than 100 μm, and (iv) curing conducted under air, are required to obtain a glass–ceramic with a single crystalline phase with the NZP-type crystal structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acrystal structure 3aglass 3amicrowave ovens 3aparticle size 3aphosphates 3athermal expansion 3atin 3atungsten oxide1 aLebullenger, Ronan1 aBénard-Rocherullé, Patricia1 aCalvez, Guillaume1 aGuillou, Olivier1 aRocherullé, Jean1 aKidari, Abdessamad1 aPomeroy, Mickael J.1 aHampshire, Stuart0 tJournal of materials science.g2012 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.486-492dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-011-5824-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011900170300001600289500001900305520127700324592002801601650001301629650003001642650001401672650001201686650001101698650002501709650001201734650001301746650001101759650002901770650002001799650002501819650000901844650000901853650000901862651000901871653003401880653001301914653002401927700002201951700002401973700001501997773011002012856008502122852000902207655001202216IND60693146320221118161446.0200505e20151102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069314632DNAL7 a10.1080/17583004.2015.11091792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Joana10aGreenhouse gas emission timing in life cycle assessment and the global warming potential of perennial energy crops  ap. 185-195.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPresently, climate metrics in life-cycle assessment (LCA) aggregate the emission of greenhouse gases in one impact-triggering instant, rather than accommodating its distribution along a timeline.

In this article, we test the use of dynamic LCA on bioenergy production from Jatropha oil in Mali, which offers temporary carbon sequestration in biomass and soil. We built a life-cycle inventory for land conversion to jatropha after cropland and fallow land. The assessment was made for one and for 10 consecutive rotations, and yielded dynamic emission profiles over the years. We found that dynamic LCA is sensitive to variations in emission over time, and that it resulted in lower GWP compared to the conventional static approach following IPCC rules, except for early times of analysis. But the largest variation occurs within dynamic LCA between readings at different times of analysis. The choice of time of analysis in the dynamic LCA methodology has no theoretical grounds and is therefore subjective. In the particular case of this short-lived product, we did not find an added value for the provoked increase in complexity of LCA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha 3aadministrative management 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3acropland 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aland use change 3alife cycle inventory 3aoils 3asoil 3awood 3aMali 0adynamic life cycle assessment 0abiofuels 0asoil organic carbon1 aDegerickx, Jeroen1 aAchten, Wouter M.J.1 aMuys, Bart0 tCarbon management.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 6, no. 5-6 p.185-195dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2218x1758-30127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2015.11091793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010100170300001400271520123500285592002801520650002101548650000901569650001601578650001201594650002301606650001901629650001701648650001901665650002401684650001001708650001501718650002501733650001301758650001101771651002101782653001401803653002101817653002101838653000901859653002401868700001901892700002701911700002701938700001601965773010601981856008502087852000902172655001202181IND60582907020221121042934.0200110e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058290702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.08.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShekhar, Mayank10aTree-ring based reconstruction of winter drought since 1767 CE from Uttarkashi, Western Himalaya  ap. 58-69.  aThis article presents a reconstruction of winter (November–March) drought by using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) based on the tree-ring width data of Pinus roxburghii (Chir pine) growing near Uttarkashi, Garhwal region, western Himalaya. This is based on a significant negative correlation between growth of Chir pine and SPEI of November–March (N-M) months. This relationship might be linked with the low rate of photosynthesis during low or freezing temperature when roots unable to take soil moisture, an analogous to drought situation as in the cold desert. The reconstructed winter SPEI record extends from 1767 to 2013 CE. It explains 30.5% of the variance for the calibration period (1903–2013 CE). The regression model was tested using Correlation Coefficient (r), Coefficient of Determination (R²), Reduction of Error (RE), Coefficient of efficiency (CE) and Durbin-Watson test (DW). The extended SPEI time series has revealed several intervals of high and low intensity drought since the 17th century. There is also a linkage between (N-M) months SPEI and Western Disturbance (WD). This connection indicates that the WD may have a role in modulating droughts in the Indian region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus roxburghii 3acold 3acorrelation 3adrought 3aevapotranspiration 3afreezing point 3agrowth rings 3aphotosynthesis 3aregression analysis 3aroots 3asoil water 3atime series analysis 3avariance 3awinter 3aHimalayan region 0aTree-ring 0aPinus roxburghii 0aWestern Himalaya 0aSPEI 0aWestern disturbance1 aPal, Ashish K.1 aBhattacharyya, Amalava1 aRanhotra, Parminder S.1 aRoy, Ipsita0 tQuaternary international.g2018 June 20, v. 479 p.58-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.08.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001600188245008500204300001600289506007600305520127800381592002801659506003701687650002401724650003501748650001401783650001201797650001101809650001101820650001101831650001401842650001201856650001901868650001501887650000901902700005501911700001801966700001801984773012302002856008202125852000902207655001202216IND60593680220221207110226.0200305e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059368022DNAL7 a288668202pmid7 aPMC59383112pmcid7 a10.1007/s12011-017-1140-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodwika, W.10aCopper, Manganese, Zinc, and Cadmium in Tea Leaves of Different Types and Origin  ap. 389-395.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConcentrations of selected metals (Cu, Mn, Zn, Cd) in tea leaves were investigated. Samples included black, green, and other (red, white, yellow, and oolong) teas. They were purchased on a local market but they covered different countries of origin. Beverages like yerba mate, rooibos, and fruit teas were also included in the discussion. Metal determinations were performed using atomic absorption spectrometry. In black teas, Mn/Cd ratio was found to be significantly higher (48,091 ± 35,436) vs. green (21,319 ± 16,396) or other teas (15,692 ± 8393), while Cd concentration was lower (31.4 ± 18.3 μg/kg) vs. other teas 67.0 (67.0 ± 24.4). Moreover, Zn/Cu and Cu/Cd ratios were, respectively, lower (1.1 ± 0.2 vs. 2.2 ± 0.5) and higher (1086 ± 978 vs. 261 ± 128) when comparing black teas with other teas. Intake of each metal from drinking tea was estimated based on the extraction levels reported by other authors. Contributions to recommended daily intake for Cu, Mn, and Zn were estimated based on the recommendations of international authorities. Except for manganese, tea is not a major dietary source of the studied elements. From the total number of 27 samples, three have shown exceeded cadmium level, according to local regulations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspalathus linearis 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3ablack tea 3acadmium 3acopper 3afruits 3aleaves 3amanganese 3amarkets 3atea (beverage) 3ayerba mate 3azinc1 aKleszcz, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1157-10741 aKrośniak, M.1 aZagrodzki, P.0 tBiological trace element research.g2018 June, v. 183, no. 2 p.389-395dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-017-1140-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009200157300002000249520140400269592002801673650001501701650001401716650001601730650001101746650001101757650002201768700001501790700001601805700001501821700002001836700001701856773012501873856007401998852000902072655001202081IND60745764020221122051952.0210727e20210719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074576402DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra04739f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChai, Jixing10aHigh responsivity and high speed InGaN-based blue-light photodetectors on Si substrates  ap. 25079-25083.  aDue to the adjustable band gap, the excellent radiation stability, and the high electron mobility of InGaN, the InGaN-based blue-light photodetectors (PDs) show great potential in visible light communication (VLC) systems. However, the applications of InGaN-based blue-light PDs in VLC systems are limited by the poor performance caused by the poor crystalline quality of InGaN materials. Herein, we report on the fabrication of high responsivity and high response speed InGaN-based metal–semiconductor metal (MSM) blue-light PDs using high-quality InGaN epitaxial films grown on Si substrates by the combination of low-temperature pulsed laser deposition (LT-PLD) and high-temperature metal organic chemical deposition (HT-MOCVD). The technology can not only suppress the interfacial reactions between films and substrates by LT-PLD growth, but also promote the lateral overgrowth of InGaN and improve the crystalline quality of InGaN-based epitaxial films by HT-MOCVD growth. Based on the high-quality InGaN-based materials, high-performance InGaN-based blue-light PDs are fabricated accordingly with a high responsivity of 0.49 A W⁻¹ and a short rise/fall response time of 1.25/1.74 ms at an applied bias of −3 V. The performance is better than the results for the InGaN-based PDs previously reported. The InGaN-based blue-light PDs shed light on the potential for VLC system applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue light 3aelectrons 3aexhibitions 3alasers 3ametals 3aorganic compounds1 aKong, Deqi1 aChen, Sheng1 aMa, Yukun,1 aWang, Wengliang1 aLi, Guoqiang0 tRSC advances.g2021 July 19, v. 11, no. 40 p.25079-25083dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra04739f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01703naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245009900171300001600270520058100286592002800867650002000895650001200915650001300927650002100940650001300961650001100974650001800985653002201003653001201025653002301037700001701060700001401077700001301091700001301104773010701117856008401224852000901308655001201317IND60723827920221122055202.0210117e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072382792DNAL7 a10.5958/j.2229-4473.26.1.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfroza, Baseerat10aGraphical Analysis For Yield And Yield Attributing Traits in Sweet Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.)  ap. 158-162.  aIn a study carried out with ten diverse genotypes of Sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and forty five F1 crosses generated from them through 10 x 10 diallel mating design, it was found that a lot of diversity was present with respect to most of the traits as depicted by scattered positions of parental arrays in the Wr-Vr graphs.

After 30 days of specific diets, each group was injected with 500 μg kg⁻¹of Cd. The control group was the one fed with normal diet and not injected with Cd. Liver Cd, Zn, and Se loads was assessed after 1 and 3 days of Cd injections. Moreover, antioxidant enzymes activities termed as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxydase as well as their gene expression levels were monitored. Finally, metallothionein protein accumulation and its gene expression regulation (MTa) were determined. In fish fed with 2 and 6% garlic powder, the amounts of Cd, Zn, and Se significantly increase in liver tissues. Two percent garlic powder specific diet reversed the Cd-induced inhibition of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and gluthathione peroxydase (GPx) and restored the Cd-induced lipid peroxidation (MDA). The increase of liver metallothionein proteins as well as the MTa gene expression level under Cd influence was more pronounced in animals maintained for 30 days under garlic power 2% diet. Our data must be carefully considered in view of the garlic powder introduction in sea bass food composition at 2% since it is an efficient prevention against Cd-induced alterations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abass 3acadmium 3acatalase 3adiet 3aenzyme inhibition 3afood composition 3agarlic 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglutathione 3ajuveniles 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3ametallothionein 3aprotective effect 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics 3azinc1 aGuerbej, Hamadi1 aBoussetta, Hamadi1 aBouraoui, Zied1 aBanni, Mohamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9764-03430 tBiological trace element research.g2018 June, v. 183, no. 2 p.370-378dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-017-1146-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008600168300001800254520216800272592002802440650002302468650001602491650002602507650002002533650000902553650001302562650001402575650001402589650001402603650000902617700002302626700002402649700002102673700002202694700002402716700001602740773010702756856007902863852000902942655001202951IND60479007920221119073905.0160116e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047900792DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.124832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, Maud C.O.14aThe effects of background risk on behavioural lateralization in a coral reef fish  ap. 1553-1559.  aBehavioural lateralization – the preferential use of one side of the body or either of the bilateral organs or limbs – has been well documented in many species, in a number of contexts. While the benefits reported are numerous, existing latent variability in the degree of lateralization within and across populations, species and taxa indicates that existing costs may modulate its expression. Few studies have reported changes in the degree of lateralization at the individual level, in response to long‐term changes in environmental conditions, but not in response to short‐term changes in environmental conditions. Predation is highly variable both temporally and spatially and hence is a good candidate for testing lateralization effects based on short‐term changes in environmental conditions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the degree of behavioural lateralization changes following short‐term exposure to different levels of risk. We tested whether wild‐caught juvenile damselfish exposed to a high or low background level of risk for 4 days would subsequently differ in their turning bias, a trait that has been linked to predator escape behaviour in fishes. We found that 4 days is enough to induce a difference in the absolute lateralization scores of the fish, with high‐risk fish being more strongly lateralized than low‐risk fish. Practically, this difference stemmed from decreasing lateralization scores for newly recruiting coral reef fishes that were kept in low‐risk environments, with the concurrent maintenance of higher lateralization scores for fish maintained under high‐risk conditions. Fish from the high‐risk background had higher survival than those from the low‐risk background upon release into mesocosms containing reef predators. Our study highlights how early exposure to differential predation risk affects the degree of behavioural lateralization. Given the profound effects of lateralization on many aspects of an animal's life from its ability to discriminate conspecifics to how it forages and interacts during agonistic interactions, predation risk may be a key driver of animal development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal development 3acoral reefs 3aenvironmental factors 3aescape behavior 3afish 3aforaging 3ajuveniles 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk1 aMcCormick, Mark I.1 aAllan, Bridie J.

According to the high abundance of alkenones, the thick mud sequence was deposited under marine conditions. The high TOC and n-alkanes concentrations (as normalized to TOC) suggest this was a period of high organic matter (OM) production, and the majority of OM came from terrestrial vascular plant sources. Comparatively, short chain n-alkanes (C₁₈₋₂₂) and proportion of aquatic plant index (Paq) in the lower sub-unit appear higher than those in the middle and upper sub-units, suggesting a gradual increase in terrestrial OM supply throughout MIS 5e. The carbon preference index in long-chain n-alkanes (CPI₂₅₋₃₃) implies high precipitation and/or temperature in this interval, whilst the average carbon length index in long-chain n-alkanes (ACL₂₅₋₃₃) indicates a warm climate during MIS 5e.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aaquatic plants 3acarbon 3acoasts 3aenvironmental factors 3aisotopes 3aorganic matter 3asediments 3atemperature 3aChina 3aSouth China Sea 0aMarine isotope stage 5 0aEemian interglacial 0an-alkane indices 0aAlkenones 0aThe northern South China Sea1 aZheng, Zhuo1 aGao, Quanzhou1 aZong, Yongqiang1 aHuang, Kangyou1 aShi, Suhua0 tQuaternary international.g2018 June 20, v. 479 p.70-78dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010200164300001600266520124500282592002801527650002101555650002101576650002101597650001401618650000901632650002201641650002101663650001701684650001001701650001801711650001401729650004301743650002601786650003301812650002001845650005201865650001301917650002201930700001701952700001601969700001701985700001902002700001602021700001302037700001402050700001502064773012302079856008202202852000902284655001202293IND60593680420221119143159.0200305e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059368042DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-017-1145-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Changyu10aInflammatory Response Occurs in Veins of Broiler Chickens Treated with a Selenium Deficiency Diet  ap. 361-369.  aSelenium (Se) has been indicated to prevent chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. However, a few studies have indicated that Se deficiency can induce vascular diseases. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effect of Se deficiency on vascular pathology. A total of 60 male broiler chickens were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 30). The control group (C group) was fed a basic diet, and the Se-deficient group (L group) was fed a Se-deficient, corn-soy-based diet. Changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of inflammatory factors and inflammation-related cytokines were examined by both RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Our results indicate that the mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory factors and inflammation-related cytokines in the L group were significantly changed in the vein. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to define the most important parameters that could be used as key factors. The in vitro experiments also demonstrated that Se can enhance the anti-inflammatory ability of vein endothelial cells. In conclusion, Se deficiency induces an inflammatory response by modulating inflammatory factors and inflammation-related cytokines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3abroiler chickens 3achronic diseases 3acytokines 3adiet 3aendothelial cells 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasms 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrient deficiencies 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotein content 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aselenium 3avascular diseases1 aFan, Ruifeng1 aMeng, Qiao,1 aLi, Xiaojing1 aXing, Mengyuan1 aZhu, Fating1 aXue, Hua1 aWang, Kai1 aXu, Shiwen0 tBiological trace element research.g2018 June, v. 183, no. 2 p.361-369dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-017-1145-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245008700176300001800263520152600281592002801807650001301835650001701848650001501865650001301880650000901893650001301902650001301915650001501928700002701943700002101970700002201991700002102013700001502034700002602049700002202075700002702097700002102124773008802145856009002233852000902323655001202332IND60090436920221119111628.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009043692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Rylie A.10aSubstrate dependent stability of conducting polymer coatings on medical electrodes  ap. 5875-5886.  aConducting polymer (CP) coatings on medical electrodes have the potential to provide superior performance when compared to conventional metallic electrodes, but their stability is strongly dependant on the substrate properties. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of laser roughening of underlying platinum (Pt) electrode surfaces on the mechanical, electrical and biological performance of CP coatings. In addition, the impact of dopant type on electrical performance and stability was assessed. The CP poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was coated on Pt microelectrode arrays, with three conventional dopant ions. The in vitro electrical characteristics were assessed by cyclic voltammetry and biphasic stimulation. Results showed that laser roughening of the underlying substrate did not affect the charge injection limit of the coated material, but significantly improved the passive stability and chronic stimulation lifetime without failure of the coating. Accelerated material ageing and long-term biphasic stimulus studies determined that some PEDOT variants experienced delamination within as little as 10 days when the underlying Pt was smooth, but laser roughening to produce a surface index of 2.5 improved stability, such that more than 1.3 billion stimulation cycles could be applied without evidence of failure. PEDOT doped with paratoluene sulfonate (PEDOT/pTS) was found to be the most stable CP on roughened Pt, and presented a surface topography which encouraged neural cell attachment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adelamination 3aelectrodes 3aethylene 3aions 3aplatinum 3apolymers 3atopography1 aHassarati, Rachelle T.1 aBouchinet, Lucie1 aLee, Chaekyung S.1 aCheong, Gin L.M.1 aYu, Jin F.1 aDodds, Christopher W.1 aSuaning, Gregg J.1 aPoole-Warren, Laura A.1 aLovell, Nigel H.0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Sept., v. 33, no. 25 p.5875-5886dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012100168500002200289520157500311592002801886650002301914650001101937650005301948650001702001650002402018650001802042650001502060650001702075650001102092650001502103650002502118650000902143650001402152650001402166650001602180650001002196653007002206653003202276653004002308700001502348700001602363700001502379773007102394856008402465852000902549655001202558IND60570125120221116151753.0170708s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057012512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2017.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotgieter, H.10aAnalysis of oxidised heavy paraffininc products by high temperature comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography  aPre-press version  aHeavy petroleum fractions are produced during crude and synthetic crude oil refining processes and they need to be upgraded to useable products to increase their market value. Usually these fractions are upgraded to fuel products by hydrocracking, hydroisomerization and hydrogenation processes. These fractions are also upgraded to other high value commercial products like lubricant oils and waxes by distillation, hydrogenation, and oxidation and/or blending. Oxidation of hydrogenated heavy paraffinic fractions produces high value products that contain a variety of oxygenates and the characterization of these heavy oxygenates is very important for the control of oxidation processes. Traditionally titrimetric procedures are used to monitor oxygenate formation, however, these titrimetric procedures are tedious and lack selectivity toward specific oxygenate classes in complex matrices. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) is a way of increasing peak capacity for the comprehensive analysis of complex samples. Other groups have used HT-GC×GC to extend the carbon number range attainable by GC×GC and have optimised HT-GC×GC parameters for the separation of aromatics, nitrogen-containing compounds as well as sulphur-containing compounds in heavy petroleum fractions. HT-GC×GC column combinations for the separation of oxygenates in oxidised heavy paraffinic fractions are optimised in this study. The advantages of the HT-GC×GC method in the monitoring of the oxidation reactions of heavy paraffinic fraction samples are illustrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon 3acomprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 3adistillation 3ahigh-value products 3ahydrogenation 3alubricants 3amarket value 3amixing 3amonitoring 3aoil and gas industry 3aoils 3aoxidation 3apetroleum 3atemperature 3awaxes 0aHigh temperature comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography 0aOxygen-containing compounds 0aOxidised heavy paraffinic fractions1 aBekker, R.1 aBeigley, J.1 aRohwer, E.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010800175300001300283500001900296520098000315592002801295650003001323650001101353650001901364650001101383650001401394650002701408650002501435653001801460653001601478653001801494653001801512700002401530700002201554700001901576773010701595856008501702852000901787655001201796IND60693146720221118161523.0200505e20160303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069314672DNAL7 a10.1080/17583004.2016.11515022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobalino-López, A.10aCO₂ emissions convergence among 10 South American countries.

This work tries to find out whether a set of countries of a given region share common convergence patterns in CO₂ emission per capita and in its driving forces. First, a descriptive statistical analysis is carried out, and then Phillips and Sul methodology is applied to test the existence of convergence clubs in the pathway of evolution of each Kaya component. An analysis of inequality was also performed, considering three exogenous groups of countries. The results show that the region, as a whole, does not present a global convergence pattern regarding CO₂ emissions per capita; however, the evidence suggests the formation of various convergence clubs for each Kaya component and even for the Kaya identity as a whole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aevolution 3agross domestic product 3astatistical analysis 0aCO2 emissions 0aconvergence 0aKaya identity 0aSouth America1 aGarcía-Ramos, J.E.1 aGolpe, Antonio A.1 aMena-Nieto, A.0 tCarbon management.g2016 Mar. 3, v. 7, no. 1-2 p.1-12dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2218x1758-30127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2016.11515023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245019100167300001800358520205400376592002802430650001702458650000802475650001302483650001102496650001102507650002402518650001202542650002202554650001502576650001502591650001302606650001102619650001402630650001902644650001602663650001702679650001202696650002002708650001502728650001802743650001702761650001502778651001102793700002602804700002602830700002402856700002202880700002402902700002802926773010702954856007903061852000903140655001203149IND60479008120221119074035.0160116e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047900812DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.124622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcantara, Suzana10aCarbon assimilation and habitat segregation in resurrection plants: a comparison between desiccation‐ and non‐desiccation‐tolerant species of Neotropical Velloziaceae (Pandanales)  ap. 1499-1512.  aDesiccation tolerance is the ability that some organisms show to equilibrate their water content with that of dry air and recover when water supplies are re‐established. This is a widespread although rare strategy in angiosperms, and most desiccation‐tolerant (DT) species are restricted to tropical rock outcrops. Such restricted ecological range is attributed to weak competitive potential caused by low productivity, due to the temporal limitation in carbon assimilation that occurs when plants desiccate. However, few studies addressing this question in angiosperms have been conducted. We investigate 20 species of Velloziaceae of campos rupestres that differ in their desiccation tolerance. Campos rupestres is an ecoregion characterized by particular vegetation growing on rocky substrates that occurs along mountains in central/south‐eastern Brazil, above 900 m a.s.l. It is considered a Neotropical hotspot and the main centre of diversity for DT vascular plants and the Velloziaceae. Here, we tested whether carbon assimilation rates, functional traits and species habitats corroborate the hypothesized trade‐off between productivity and desiccation tolerance. All species showed similar photosynthetic rates during the wet season; in the dry season, only DT species showed drastic decrease in their metabolism. Non‐desiccation‐tolerant (NT) species are larger than DT ones (i.e. greater maximum plant height; stem volume). Relative canopy area and stem dry‐matter content were lower in DT compared to NT, while leaf phosphorous concentration was higher in DT. The remaining morphofunctional traits evaluated did not vary between these groups. DT species occupied mainly exposed rock soils, while NT species occurred in deep, sandy soil habitats. Our results support the hypothesis of a trade‐off between desiccation tolerance and productivity in angiosperms and suggest that DT strategy may only evolve and persist in habitats where severe growth limitations due to drought limit competition from more productive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVelloziaceae 3aair 3aaltitude 3acanopy 3acarbon 3acenter of diversity 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3adry season 3aecoregions 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3amountains 3aphotosynthesis 3asandy soils 3asoil ecology 3atropics 3avascular plants 3avegetation 3awater content 3awater supply 3awet season 3aBrazil1 aMello‐Silva, Renato1 aTeodoro, Grazielle S.1 aDrequeceler, Kamila1 aAckerly, David D.1 aOliveira, Rafael S.1 aPoorter, L.q(Lourens),0 tFunctional ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 29, no. 12 p.1499-1512dBritish Ecological Societyx0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.124623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245007900159300001600238520117400254592002801428650002501456650002101481650001801502650001201520650001901532650001901551650000901570650001801579700001601597700001701613773012501630856008101755852000901836655001201845IND60121293920221116171943.0151123e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012129392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00128-015-1468-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Lan10aEffects of Metal-Soil Contact Time on the Extraction of Mercury from Soils  ap. 399-406.  aTo investigate the mercury aging process in soils, soil samples were spiked with inorganic mercury (Hg(II)) or methylated mercury (MeHg) and incubated for 2, 7, 14 or 28 days in the laboratory. Potential availability of mercury, assessed by bovine serum albumin (BSA) or calcium chloride (CaCl₂) extraction, decreased by 2–19 times for Hg(II) or 2–6 times for MeHg, when the contact time increased from 2 to 28 days. Decreased Hg(II) extraction could be explained by Hg(II) geochemical fractionation, i.e., Hg(II) migrated from more mobile fractions (water soluble and stomach acid soluble fractions) to refractory ones (organo-complexed, strongly complexed and residual fractions) over time, resulting in more stable association of Hg(II) with soils. In addition, decrease of mercury extraction was more evident in soils with lower organic content in most treatments, suggesting that organic matter may potentially play an important role in mercury aging process. In view of the significant decreased Hg(II) or MeHg extraction with prolonged contact time, mercury aging process should be taken into account when assessing risk of mercury in contaminated soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3acalcium chloride 3afractionation 3amercury 3aorganic matter 3apolluted soils 3arisk 3asoil sampling1 aZhong, Huan1 aWu, Yong-Gui0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2015 Mar., v. 94, no. 3 p.399-406dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-015-1468-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012300173520162000296592002801916650003101944650002501975650002302000650002502023650002302048650002002071650002602091650002002117650002502137650004002162650002602202650001302228650002602241650001702267650001302284650001602297650001602313650002002329650001802349650001502367650001302382650001702395650001002412650001402422650002402436650001602460650001102476650001702487650001702504650001502521650002102536651001002557653002902567653002002596653002002616653001302636653001402649700002502663700002702688700002102715773010302736856008602839852000902925655001202934IND60686608620221116211804.0200607e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068660862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1041212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadhi, Laxmipriya10aAntibiotic susceptibility of cultivable aerobic microbiota from the oral cavity of Echis carinatus from Odisha (India)  aDuring a snake bite, the microbes may get transferred to the bite site and may cause secondary infection along with envenomation. The knowledge on the oral bacterial flora of snakes constitutes information important for snake bite management. The inadequately studied oral microflora of snakes differ geographically, temporally and among the members of the same species. The objective of this study is to determine the pattern of oral bacterial flora of Saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) and their susceptibility to antibiotics. Oral swabs were collected from nine healthy Saw-scaled vipers, subjected to microbiological, biochemical and molecular characterization. Additionally, these isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using ICOSA-20-Plus and ICOSA-20-Minus. A wide range of pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella arizonae, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Proteus penneri, Alcaligenes faecalis; Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus sciuri and Achromobacter xylosoxidans were isolated as new additions to the floral diversity of saw scale viper. Most of the isolates were sensitive towards amikacin, azithromycin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, tobramycin, levofloxacin, kanamycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol while resistant to amoxyclav, cephalothin, cefpodoxime, Co-Trimoxazole, oxacillin and penicillin. The present study revealed that the bacterial flora of the oral cavity of Saw-scaled viper is resistant to many common antibiotics, which are often used for the treatment of snake-bite victims.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchromobacter xylosoxidans 3aAlcaligenes faecalis 3aBacillus anthracis 3aCitrobacter freundii 3aCitrobacter koseri 3aEchis carinatus 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aProteus penneri 3aPseudomonas stutzeri 3aSalmonella enterica subsp. arizonae 3aStaphylococcus sciuri 3aamikacin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aazithromycin 3abacteria 3acefpodoxime 3acephalothin 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3agentamicin 3aimipenem 3alevofloxacin 3amouth 3aoxacillin 3asecondary infection 3asnake bites 3asnakes 3asparfloxacin 3atetracycline 3atobramycin 3avirulent strains 3aIndia 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aEchis carinatus 0aOral microflora 0aZoonoses 0aSnakebite1 aPanda, Sujogya Kumar1 aMohapatra, Pratyush P.1 aSahoo, Gunanidhi0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 June, v. 143 p.104121-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1041213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245010500180300001600285520160700301592002801908596007701936650001702013650001202030650001302042650001102055650001402066650001902080650002002099650001402119650001602133650001002149650001602159650001402175650001002189650001802199650002002217650000902237650001102246650002002257650002002277650002502297650000902322700002702331700004002358700002702398773012302425856008202548852000902630655001202639IND60593680620221119143305.0200305e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059368062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-017-1147-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Ana Cláudia Ferreira10aEffects of Arsenic Compounds on Microminerals Content and Antioxidant Enzyme Activities in Rat Liver  ap. 305-313.  aInteractions of arsenic with essential trace elements may result in disturbances on body homeostasis. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of different arsenic compounds on micromineral content and antioxidant enzyme activities in rat liver. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups and exposed to sodium arsenite and sodium arsenate at 0.01 and 10 mg/L for 8 weeks in drinking water. The concentration of arsenic increased in the liver of all arsenic-exposed animals. The proportion of zinc and copper increased in animals exposed to 0.01 mg/L sodium arsenite. In addition, these animals presented a reduction in magnesium and sodium content. Superoxide dismutase activity decreased mainly in arsenite-exposed animals, whereas catalase activity decreased in animals exposed to 10 mg/L sodium arsenate. Further, exposure to sodium arsenate at 10 mg/L altered copper and magnesium content in the liver, and reduced total protein levels. Overall, both arsenic compounds altered the liver histology, with reduction in the proportion of cytoplasm and hepatocyte, and increased the percentage of sinusoidal capillaries and macrophages. In conclusion, our findings showed that oral exposure to arsenic compounds disturbs the trace elements balance in the liver, especially at low concentration, altering enzymatic and stereological parameters. We concluded that despite the increase in trace elements content, the antioxidant enzyme activities were downregulated and did not prevent morphological alterations in the liver of animals exposed to both arsenic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPQ-04083-10cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais 3aantioxidants 3aarsenic 3acatalase 3acopper 3acytoplasm 3adrinking water 3aenzyme activity 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amagnesium 3amales 3aoral exposure 3aprotein content 3arats 3asodium 3asodium arsenate 3asodium arsenite 3asuperoxide dismutase 3azinc1 aMarchesi, Sarah Cozzer1 ade Almeida Lima, Graziela Domingues1 aMachado-Neves, Mariana0 tBiological trace element research.g2018 June, v. 183, no. 2 p.305-313dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-017-1147-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017000170520152200340592002801862650003501890650001601925650001801941650001901959650002601978650001202004650001302016650002702029650001502056650001602071650001502087650002302102650001202125650001902137650001702156650001602173650000902189650001902198650002002217650001502237650001002252653002002262653003602282653002202318653001902340653002702359700001802386700001502404700001402419700001302433700001902446700001702465700001402482773011302496856008602609852000902695655001202704IND60786216320221119075856.0220921e20221010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078621632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1333282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yongjing10aPreparation of liquid bacteria fertilizer with phosphate-solubilizing bacteria cultured by food wastewater and the promotion on the soil fertility and plants biomass  aFood waste treatment produced a large amount of food wastewater (FWW), containing a significant quantity of organic matter, which could benefit the growth of microorganisms. In this study, Kosakonia cowanii (T3) isolated from the wheat rhizosphere, was inoculated into the FWW to prepare phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) liquid fertilizer, and the effects of PSB fertilizer on soil fertility and Pakchoi growth were investigated. It was found that the concentration of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and reducing sugar was reduced by 70.4% and 72.2% in the period of PSB culture. The PSB fertilizer increased the fresh weight, leaf length, and leaf width of Pakchoi by 62.10%, 36.74%, and 27.93%, respectively (P < 0.05), attributed to the escalation of available P concentration and catalase activity, which were closely related to plant growth. The biomass of Pakchoi and soil fertility were also enhanced by raising the activity of soil phosphatase and catalase. By analyzing the rhizosphere bacterial community after inoculating the fertilizer, it was found that the dominant phyla with relative abundance were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Cyanobacteria, which were positively associated with phosphatase, catalase, and the growth indices of Pakchoi. Among them, the most abundance increment of bacteria occurred in Proteobacteria (39.72%). The results would provide strong support for the preparation of PSB liquid fertilizer by FWW and the potential effects on soil fertility and plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aChloroflexi 3aCyanobacteria 3aProteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiomass 3acatalase 3achemical oxygen demand 3afood waste 3aleaf length 3aleaf width 3aliquid fertilizers 3aliquids 3aorganic matter 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3awaste treatment 3awastewater 3awheat 0aFood wastewater 0aPhosphate-solubilizing bacteria 0aLiquid fertilizer 0aSoil fertility 0aPlant growth promotion1 aWang, Songtao1 aYan, Xinyu1 aGao, Song1 aMan, Tao1 aYang, Zhenbing1 aRen, Lianhai1 aWang, Pan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Oct. 10, v. 370 p.133328-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1333283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245012100155300001700276500002000293520134200313592002801655650003001683650001801713650001501731650003101746650001801777650001301795650003701808650002001845650001701865650000901882650001101891650002401902650002301926650001401949650002601963650001401989700002302003773010402026856007202130852000902202655001202211IND60522417720221120222831.0160602e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052241772DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.56062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrira, Riadh10aSakuranetin Induces Melanogenesis in B16BL6 Melanoma Cells through Inhibition of ERK and PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathways  ap. 997-1002.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSakuranetin (Sak) is considered one of the most important flavanone phytoalexins in regard to antimicrobial activity, and accumulation, in the rice plant. The current study determined that Sak strongly stimulates melanogenesis in B16BL6 melanoma cells in a dose‐dependent manner. This flavonoid upregulates the expression of microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) and reaches its maximum after 24 h. In addition, Sak was found to increase in vitro tyrosinase (Tyr) activity, along with time‐dependent upregulation of Tyr, tyrosinase‐related protein 1 (TRP1), and tyrosinase‐related protein 2 (TRP2). Sakuranetin also decreased the proliferation rate in these cells without directly affecting their viability, as revealed by MTT and trypan blue assays. Further, Sak was shown to inhibit phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 from 12 h, without significantly affecting p38 and JNK phosphorylation. Sakuranetin was also found to inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT at threonine 308 and serine 473 and leads to activation of GSK3β via decreased phosphorylation at serine 9. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Sak stimulates melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells via inhibition of ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which lead to upregulation of Tyr, TRP1, and TRP2.

Herein, on the basis of natural corncob as substrates, Fe/N co-doped porous carbon spheres were designed via a consecutive FeCl₃-mediated hydrothermal reaction and mild KHCO₃ activation route for supercapacitor electrode materials. Owing to the low hydrolysis temperature of hemicellulose and hydrolysis promotion of Fe³⁺, the corncob-derived hydrochar exhibited special carbon sphere morphology. Interestingly, the carbon sphere morphology was well-preserved upon the melamine-mediated KHCO₃ activation. As a result of the short ion diffusion distance, unique packing architecture, and developed micro–mesoporous structure of the carbon spheres, optimized CCAC-Fe-M-50% manifested superior ion transfer kinetics and rate performances (87% up to 20 A g–¹). Meanwhile, the electrochemical investigation of CCAC-Fe-M-50% in a three-electrode setup illustrated high capacitance (338 F g–¹ at 1 A g–¹). In a two-electrode setup, the CCAC-Fe-M-50%||CCAC-Fe-M-50% device revealed supreme cyclability (102.7% retention after 5000 cycles) and extremely low Rcₜ (0.59 Ω) and Rₛ (4.54 Ω). These superior properties were attributed to the large SBET (2305.7 m² g–¹), the multiple redox possibilities (Fe³⁺, Fe²⁺, and N functional groups), and the carbon sphere morphology with a micro–mesoporous structure, which enhanced ion physisorption, pseudocapacitance, and electrolyte/ion diffusion, respectively. Besides, the fabricated CCAC-Fe-M-50%||CCAC-Fe-M-50% device in a neutral electrolyte demonstrated a superb energy density (ED) of 18.60 Wh kg–¹ at the power density (PD) of 455 W kg–¹. The currently presented strategy with superior results might lead to the novel development of biomass-based ultraperformance electrode materials for supercapacitors and other high-tech applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acorn cobs 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrochars 3ahydrolysis 3atemperature 3awastes1 aZhang, Ximing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4889-87911 aYang, Xufeng1 aYu, Youfang1 aLin, Hongjian1 aSheng, Kuichuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0693-97510 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Aug. 24, v. 35, no. 17 p.14157-14168dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c019223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04108naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002300175245007300198300001400271520258000285592002802865650001502893650001302908650001802921650002202939650002102961650000902982650001702991650001603008650001903024650001903043650001103062650001003073650000903083650001503092650001303107650000903120700001703129700001803146700002303164700002403187700002603211773014903237856006803386856010403454990002303558852000903581655001203590IND60643389420221116150230.0190510e20130308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064338942DNAL7 a10.3791/43262doi7 aPMC36221052pmcid7 a235246582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Holly A.10aNon-invasive optical imaging of the lymphatic vasculature of a mouse  ap. e4326.  aThe lymphatic vascular system is an important component of the circulatory system that maintains fluid homeostasis, provides immune surveillance, and mediates fat absorption in the gut. Yet despite its critical function, there is comparatively little understanding of how the lymphatic system adapts to serve these functions in health and disease1. Recently, we have demonstrated the ability to dynamically image lymphatic architecture and lymph "pumping" action in normal human subjects as well as in persons suffering lymphatic dysfunction using trace administration of a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye and a custom, Gen III-intensified imaging system2-4. NIRF imaging showed dramatic changes in lymphatic architecture and function with human disease. It remains unclear how these changes occur and new animal models are being developed to elucidate their genetic and molecular basis. In this protocol, we present NIRF lymphatic, small animal imaging5,6 using indocyanine green (ICG), a dye that has been used for 50 years in humans7, and a NIRF dye-labeled cyclic albumin binding domain (cABD-IRDye800) peptide that preferentially binds mouse and human albumin8. Approximately 5.5 times brighter than ICG, cABD-IRDye800 has a similar lymphatic clearance profile and can be injected in smaller doses than ICG to achieve sufficient NIRF signals for imaging8. Because both cABD-IRDye800 and ICG bind to albumin in the interstitial space8, they both may depict active protein transport into and within the lymphatics. Intradermal (ID) injections (5-50 μl) of ICG (645 μM) or cABD-IRDye800 (200 μM) in saline are administered to the dorsal aspect of each hind paw and/or the left and right side of the base of the tail of an isoflurane-anesthetized mouse. The resulting dye concentration in the animal is 83-1,250 μg/kg for ICG or 113-1,700 μg/kg for cABD-IRDye800. Immediately following injections, functional lymphatic imaging is conducted for up to 1 hr using a customized, small animal NIRF imaging system. Whole animal spatial resolution can depict fluorescent lymphatic vessels of 100 microns or less, and images of structures up to 3 cm in depth can be acquired9. Images are acquired using V++ software and analyzed using ImageJ or MATLAB software. During analysis, consecutive regions of interest (ROIs) encompassing the entire vessel diameter are drawn along a given lymph vessel. The dimensions for each ROI are kept constant for a given vessel and NIRF intensity is measured for each ROI to quantitatively assess "packets" of lymph moving through vessels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalbumins 3aanimal models 3acomputer software 3adigestive system 3adyes 3afluorescence 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman diseases 3aimage analysis 3alipids 3alymph 3amice 3amonitoring 3apeptides 3atail1 aKwon, SunKuk1 aHall, Mary A.1 aRasmussen, John C.1 aAldrich, Melissa B.1 aSevick-Muraca, Eva M.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 Mar. 08, , no. 73 p.e4326-e4326dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/43263Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/4326/non-invasive-optical-imaging-of-the-lymphatic-vasculature-of-a-mouse  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245014100184520181000325592002802135650001602163650001202179650001402191650001002205650001802215650001102233650001902244650001102263650001502274650001402289650003302303650001202336650001702348650000902365653002502374653003302399653001402432653001902446653001102465653001602476700002002492700002102512700002902533700002002562773010702582856008702689852000902776655001202785IND60682413820221117220033.0210415e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068241382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1054742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález Martínez, María10aAssessing the impact of woody and agricultural biomass variability on its behaviour in torrefaction through Principal Component Analysis  aThe influence of biomass macromolecular composition on its behaviour in torrefaction was statistically assessed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), both in terms of solid conversion kinetics and volatile species released, in function of the operating conditions. The experimental data obtained in the torrefaction of 14 woody and agricultural biomass samples at lab-scale was analysed. Main biomass macromolecular composition on cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin was shown to acceptably represent biomass diversity, which can be complemented by the extractives and ash content. Similitudes were found in deciduous and coniferous wood families, respectively, while agricultural and herbaceous crops were shown as more heterogeneous, both in terms of characterization and behaviour in torrefaction. Cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin content strongly influenced solid and volatile species yields in torrefaction, while biomass family exhibited a lower impact. Ash content in potassium, phosphorous and silicon did not show any influence on the extent of solid degradation through torrefaction. A lower variability was found in solid degradation profiles from woods, while agricultural crop behaviour was more heterogeneous. Different volatile species were released from biomass samples from the same family. Furthermore, different production profiles were found for volatile species chemically close, except for deciduous wood. These results indicate that, when modelling biomass torrefaction, solid mass loss can be represented by an exemplar of deciduous and coniferous wood, while several species would be required for the agricultural family. The variability of the volatile species release would require the consideration of several volatile species and several biomass samples per family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acrops 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alignin content 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3aprincipal component analysis 3asilicon 3atorrefaction 3awood 0aBiomass torrefaction 0aPrincipal Component Analysis 0aCellulose 0aHemicelluloses 0aLignin 0aAsh content1 aFloquet, Pascal1 aDupont, Capucine1 ada Silva Perez, Denilson1 aMeyer, Xuân-mi0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Mar., v. 134 p.105474-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1054743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01730naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007600169300001600245520068600261592002800947650002300975650001900998650001701017650001701034650002101051650003201072650001001104650001701114700001601131700001301147700001901160773010801179856008401287852000901371655001201380IND60086968120221119003557.0141102e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008696812DNAL7 a10.3724/SP.J.1009.2012.002182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHANG, Jing-Yu10aTwo new cassane diterpenoids from the seeds of Caesalpinia sappan Linn.  ap. 218-221.  aAIM: To study the chemical components of the seeds of Caesalpinia sappan.

The optomotor response is a valuable tool to track changes in spatial frequency (SF) and contrast sensitivity (CS) thresholds over time in a number of retinal disease models, including diabetic retinopathy. Similarly, the Y-maze can be used to monitor spatial cognition (as measured by spontaneous alternation) and exploratory behavior (as measured by a number of entries) in a number of disease models that affect the central nervous system. Advantages of the optomotor response and the Y-maze include sensitivity, speed of testing, the use of innate responses (training is not needed), and the ability to be performed on awake (non-anesthetized) animals. Here, protocols are described for both the optomotor response and the Y-maze and examples of their use shown in models of Type I and Type II diabetes. Methods include preparation of rodents and equipment, performance of the optomotor response and the Y-maze, and post-test data analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentral nervous system 3acognition 3adiabetic retinopathy 3aequipment1 aSingh, Anayesha1 aClarkson-Townsend, Danielle1 aPhillips, Stephen Q.1 aDouglass, Amber1 aFeola, Andrew J.1 aAllen, Rachael S.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Oct. 23, , no. 164 p.e61806-e61806dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/618063Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61806/behavioral-assessment-visual-function-via-optomotor-response  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013500165300001400300520127200314592002801586650001501614650002401629650002101653650001501674650001801689650001101707650002201718650001101740653001101751653003001762653001501792653002501807700001501832700001301847700001501860773008801875856008501963852000902048655001202057IND60619650120221119005721.0190214e20190101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061965012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarmim, A.10aSimulation and experimentation of an integrated collector storage solar water heater designed for integration into building facade  ap. 59-71.  aThis paper relates to design, construction and experimentation of an innovative Integrated Collector Storage Solar Water heater (ICSSWH) equipped with a linear parabolic reflector. The device is designed for integration into a building facade in Algerian Sahara to meet hot water needs of households in winter. Its reflector is made of small rectangular and pivoting mirrors assembled on a wooden framework. During summer period the solar water heater is not used; when pivoting the small mirrors of the reflector towards the horizontal position, we can use the device to ventilate the interior of the building according to the principle of the venetian blind. The numerical model of the device was developed and a prototype was constructed and experimentally tested. Experimental tests demonstrated that the device is effective only during winter period. Its mean daily efficiency varies between 36.4 and 51.6% and its thermal losses coefficient during night-time varies between 2.17 and 3.12 W K-1. Under a clear sky with an initial temperature of 22 °C, water temperature increases to reach a maximum at 49 °C. The numerical model was validated by comparison with experimental results and then used to investigate the influence of some design parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahouseholds 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3aprototypes 3asolar heaters 3asummer 3awater temperature 3awinter 0aICSSWH 0aIntegration into building 0aSimulation 0aExperimental testing1 aBoukar, M.1 aAmar, M.1 aHaida, Aek0 tEnergy.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 166 p.59-71dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245012600185520152600311592002801837650002201865650003601887650001701923650001401940650001101954650001401965650002301979650001102002650001602013650001602029650001502045650001702060650002802077650002002105650001702125650002602142650001202168650001102180650001302191650001402204650001802218650001302236650003702249650001102286653001702297653003102314653002202345653001802367653001102385653001302396700002402409700006002433773010702493856008702600852000902687655001202696IND60682414020221117220903.0210415e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068241402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1054762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamaruzaman, Muhammad Fadhli10aGreen diesel production from palm fatty acid distillate over SBA-15-supported nickel, cobalt, and nickel/cobalt catalysts  aThe utilization of non-edible and low-cost feedstock in bioenergy research is getting more attention in recent decades. Catalytic deoxygenation of fatty acids from waste oil feedstocks is a promising route to produce diesel-like hydrocarbons. Here we report the conversion of palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD), a low-value side product of physical refining of crude palm oil, into green diesel using a solventless and hydrogen-free deoxygenation (DO) reaction using catalytic deoxygenation over solid acid catalysts (Co/SBA-15, Ni/SBA-15, and Ni–Co/SBA-15) with total metal loadings of 5 wt%. Metal precursors (Ni, Co, Ni–Co) were doped on the mesostructured catalyst supporter, SBA-15 by wet impregnation. The catalysts were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy with elemental mapping. The DO reaction was carried out in a semi-batch reactor with a catalyst loading of 10 wt% at 350 °C for 3 h. The use of both Ni/SBA-15 and Ni–Co/SBA-15 afforded products with high contents of liquid hydrocarbons (C8–C17) with yields of 85.8% and 88.1%, respectively, and selectivity for diesel-range hydrocarbons (C13–C17) above 85% were achieved. Cobalt seems to have a larger particle size, then associates with the carbon formation and introduces coke formation. It blocks some pores and deactivates the active sites of the catalyst, thus reducing the catalytic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3abioenergy 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3adiesel fuel 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afuel production 3ahydrocarbons 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aliquids 3anickel 3anitrogen 3apalm oils 3aparticle size 3arefining 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastes 0aGreen diesel 0aPalm fatty acid distillate 0aAdvanced biofuels 0aDeoxygenation 0aSBA-15 0aPalm oil1 aTaufiq-Yap, Yun Hin1 aDerawi, Darfizzi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4967-81220 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Mar., v. 134 p.105476-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1054763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04820naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002400175245016800199300001400367520324400381592002803625650002203653650001503675650001503690650002703705650000903732650001703741650001203758650001503770650002203785650002803807650001603835650000903851650001203860650001703872650001003889650001003899700002203909700002503931700002003956773014903976856006804125856010104193990002304294852000904317655001204326IND60643389620221116150243.0190510e20121219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064338962DNAL7 a10.3791/43282doi7 aPMC35764212pmcid7 a232714282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClegern, William C.10aSimultaneous electroencephalography, real-time measurement of lactate concentration and optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity in the rodent cerebral cortex  ap. e4328.  aAlthough the brain represents less than 5% of the body by mass, it utilizes approximately one quarter of the glucose used by the body at rest1. The function of non rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), the largest portion of sleep by time, is uncertain. However, one salient feature of NREMS is a significant reduction in the rate of cerebral glucose utilization relative to wakefulness2-4. This and other findings have led to the widely held belief that sleep serves a function related to cerebral metabolism. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism during NREMS remain to be elucidated. One phenomenon associated with NREMS that might impact cerebral metabolic rate is the occurrence of slow waves, oscillations at frequencies less than 4 Hz, in the electroencephalogram5,6. These slow waves detected at the level of the skull or cerebral cortical surface reflect the oscillations of underlying neurons between a depolarized/up state and a hyperpolarized/down state7. During the down state, cells do not undergo action potentials for intervals of up to several hundred milliseconds. Restoration of ionic concentration gradients subsequent to action potentials represents a significant metabolic load on the cell8; absence of action potentials during down states associated with NREMS may contribute to reduced metabolism relative to wake. Two technical challenges had to be addressed in order for this hypothetical relationship to be tested. First, it was necessary to measure cerebral glycolytic metabolism with a temporal resolution reflective of the dynamics of the cerebral EEG (that is, over seconds rather than minutes). To do so, we measured the concentration of lactate, the product of aerobic glycolysis, and therefore a readout of the rate of glucose metabolism in the brains of mice. Lactate was measured using a lactate oxidase based real time sensor embedded in the frontal cortex. The sensing mechanism consists of a platinum-iridium electrode surrounded by a layer of lactate oxidase molecules. Metabolism of lactate by lactate oxidase produces hydrogen peroxide, which produces a current in the platinum-iridium electrode. So a ramping up of cerebral glycolysis provides an increase in the concentration of substrate for lactate oxidase, which then is reflected in increased current at the sensing electrode. It was additionally necessary to measure these variables while manipulating the excitability of the cerebral cortex, in order to isolate this variable from other facets of NREMS. We devised an experimental system for simultaneous measurement of neuronal activity via the elecetroencephalogram, measurement of glycolytic flux via a lactate biosensor, and manipulation of cerebral cortical neuronal activity via optogenetic activation of pyramidal neurons. We have utilized this system to document the relationship between sleep-related electroencephalographic waveforms and the moment-to-moment dynamics of lactate concentration in the cerebral cortex. The protocol may be useful for any individual interested in studying, in freely behaving rodents, the relationship between neuronal activity measured at the electroencephalographic level and cellular energetics within the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaction potentials 3abiosensors 3aelectrodes 3aelectroencephalography 3aeyes 3afrontal lobe 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alactate 2-monooxygenase 3alactic acid 3amice 3aneurons 3aoptogenetics 3askull 3asleep1 aMoore, Michele E.1 aSchmidt, Michelle A.1 aWisor, Jonathan0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2012 Dec. 19, , no. 70 p.e4328-e4328dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/43283Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/4328/simultaneous-electroencephalography-real-time-measurement-lactate  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010800171300001800279520211800297592002802415650002702443650001102470650002402481650001402505650003602519650001402555650001902569650002202588650001202610650001602622650001302638651001802651653002202669653002602691653002502717653001402742653002902756700002202785700002102807700001902828773009902847856008602946852000903032655001203041IND60535107620221117180240.0190319e20151125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053510762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.08.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Rose J.10aUnderstanding factors influencing vaccination acceptance during pregnancy globally: A literature review  ap. 6420-6429.  aMaternal vaccination has been evaluated and found to be extremely effective at preventing illness in pregnant women and new-borns; however, uptake of such programmes has been low in some areas.To analyse factors contributing to uptake of vaccines globally, a systematic review on vaccine hesitancy was carried out by The Vaccine Confidence Project in 2012. In order to further analyse factors contributing to uptake of maternal immunisation, a further search within the broader systematic review was conducted using the terms ‘Pregnan*’ or ‘Matern*’. Forty-two articles were identified. Pregnancy-related articles were further screened to identify those focused on concerns, trust and access issues regarding maternal vaccination reported by pregnant women and healthcare workers. Thirty-five relevant articles were included which were then searched using the snowballing technique to identify additional relevant references cited in these articles. A search alert was also conducted from February to April 2015 in PubMed to ensure that no new relevant articles were missed. A total of 155 relevant articles were included.Most of the literature which was identified on hesitancy surrounding vaccination during pregnancy reports on determinants of influenza vaccine uptake in North America. Research conducted in low-income countries focused primarily on tetanus vaccine acceptance. The main barriers cited were related to vaccine safety, belief that vaccine not needed or effective, not recommended by healthcare worker, low knowledge about vaacines, access issues, cost, conflicting advice. From the point of view of healthcare workers, barriers included inadequate training, inadequate reimbursement and increased workload. Twenty-seven out of 46 (59%) articles mentioning ethnicity reported lower rates of coverage among ethnic minorities.Barriers to vaccination in pregnancy are complex and vary depending on context and population. There are wide gaps in knowledge regarding the attitudes of healthcare workers and how ethnicity and gender dynamics influence a pregnant woman's decision to vaccinate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3agender 3ahealth care workers 3ainfluenza 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3asystematic review 3atetanus 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aNorth America 0aVaccine hesitancy 0aMaternal immunisation 0aMaternal vaccination 0aPregnancy 0aRacial/ethnic minorities1 aPaterson, Pauline1 aJarrett, Caitlin1 aLarson, Heidi,0 tVaccine.g2015 Nov. 25, v. 33, no. 47 p.6420-6429dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.08.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100002700159245009100186300001800277500000900295500001500304520162100319592002801940650002401968650001301992650001302005650002202018650002302040650002402063650002002087650001902107650001102126650002402137650001202161650001802173650002002191651001402211653002402225653000902249653001102258700002802269700002302297773015102320852000902471856009602480655001202576IND2090555320221119184340.0191125e199709  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209055532DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100050026x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStuddert, Guillermo A.10aCrop-Pasture Rotation for Sustaining the Quality and Productivity of a Typic Argiudoll  ap. 1466-1472.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aInclusion of pastures in a rotation may reverse the effects of conventional cropping and tillage on soil degradation. We hypothesized that crop-pasture rotations could be defined with a minimum pasture component and a maximum conventional cropping component to accomplish sustainable management. Soil organic carbon (SOC), light-fraction carbon (LFC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and aggregate stability index (ASI) were measured in the surface 0 to 0.15 m of a fine, mixed, thermic Typic Argiudoll with 2% slope under a long-term crop rotation experiment at Balcarce, Argentina. Treatments were continuous cropping and crop-pasture (50:50 and 75:25) rotations. All seedbeds were prepared with conventional tillage. All soil quality indicators decreased with cropping and increased with pasture. Data for each variable were fitted to an exponential model to describe their variation in time. Soil organic C decreased 4.4 g kg⁻¹ in 6 to 7 yr under cropping and rose to the original level (37.2 g kg⁻¹) after 3 to 4 yr under pasture. Light-fraction C, MBN, and ASI fell 0.9 g kg⁻¹, 39.0 mg kg⁻¹, and 43.9, respectively (97–100% of the estimated decline), after 7 yr under cropping, while they recovered to the values at the beginning of the cropping period (1.8 g kg⁻¹, 99.5 mg kg⁻¹, and 76.7, respectively) in a few years under pasture. Rotations including a maximum of 7 yr of conventional cropping alternated with a minimum of 3 yr of pasture would maintain soil properties within acceptable limits and meet the goals of sustainable agriculture under conditions similar to this experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3apastures 3anitrogen 3aland productivity 3aintensive cropping 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil management 3asoil fertility 3aUdolls 3acontinuous cropping 3abiomass 3acrop rotation 3asoil aggregates 3aArgentina 0asoil organic matter 0asoil 0acarbon1 aEcheverría, Hernán E.1 aCasanovas, Elda M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1997 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.1466-1472dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100050026x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03407naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013400171520209400305592002802399650002002427650001102447650001802458650001602476650003002492650002702522650001402549650001402563650001502577650000902592650001402601653001902615653002002634653002202654653002202676653003302698653002702731700001902758773011302777856008602890852000902976655001202985IND60786217020221119080116.0220914e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078621702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1333392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahesh Babu, N.10aEffect of salt permeants on the consolidation and hydraulic behaviour of fibre treated black cotton soil for landfill application  aClay liner functions as an impermeable barrier between leachate and groundwater in landfills. In this work, naturally available black cotton (BC) soil is adopted as a liner material due to its high swelling and low hydraulic conductivity, which helps to eliminate the risk of groundwater pollution by preventing pollutant mobility. The liner's potential is threatened by two issues: shrinkage cracks and chemical attacks. BC soil induces desiccation cracks and high compressibility due to its high shrinkage potential upon drying, which severely impacts its hydraulic conductivity behaviour. In recent years, fibres have been used as reinforcing materials to control compressibility and shrinkage cracks of the liner. In this investigation, waste tire fibres, which were used as a reinforcing material, mixed with BC soil in the proportion of 5, 10 and 15% by their dry weight. Since the essential parameters of liner would change due to the interaction of chemicals in leachate, hence, this study examined the consolidation and hydraulic properties of fibre mixed BC soil in the presence of two inorganic salt permeants (NaCl and CaCl₂) of two concentrations (0.1 and 1N) to mimic the leachate effect. The results revealed that when salt solutions were utilised as saturating pore liquids, the time to achieve the 90% of consolidation (t₉₀) of fibre-treated BC soil was decreased, thereby increasing the coefficient of consolidation (cᵥ). These changes were more significant at higher concentrations of pore liquids. The t₉₀ value for 15% fibre-treated soil with DI water is 27.0 min, and it decreased drastically to 0.8 min (97.0% reduction) for 1N NaCl solution and 0.6 min (97.8% reduction) for 1N CaCl₂ solution at the higher consolidation pressure of 784.5 kPa. Compression index (Cc) and void ratio (e) were reduced with the salt permeants irrespective of the fibre content. Finally, it was shown that salts substantially impact the hydraulic conductivity values of fibre-treated soil and that up to 10% fibre content is appropriate for landfill liner application.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompressibility 3acotton 3afiber content 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alandfills 3aleachates 3apollutants 3arisk 3ashrinkage 0aLandfill liner 0aInorganic salts 0aWaste tire fibres 0aBlack cotton soil 0aCoefficient of consolidation 0aHydraulic conductivity1 aMiśra, Anila,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 369 p.133339-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1333393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245008200177520142600259592002801685650001301713650002101726650001901747650002001766650004101786650001701827650001301844650001701857650001501874650003501889650001301924650001201937650001001949650001901959653001601978653001301994653001702007653000802024700001702032773010702049856008702156852000902243655001202252IND60682414320221117220907.0210415e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068241432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1054802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiryaki, Ozge Nayman10aEvaluation of various corn variety kernels for hydrogen gas production by APR  aThe present study was designed to evaluate gasification performances of various corn kernel varieties (field corn, non-genetically modified (non-GMO) field corn, yellow field corn, white field corn and popcorn) for hydrogen gas production by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) using activated carbon supported platinum catalyst.Corn kernels were solubilized in 200°C-subcritical water medium under 13.79 MPa CO₂ pressure before use. The hydrolysates obtained from hydrolysis process were rich in total organic carbons (TOC) with a 5200–5850 mg/L concentration range. There were significant differences among varieties in terms of overall solubilization. However, hydrolysates from different corn varieties produced the same amount of hydrogen gas with a yield of 130 mL/g corn on average. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of corn hydrolysates showed considerable decreases in the peak areas after APR compared to initial hydrolysates. These decreases indicate consuming most of the corresponding organics in the gasification process. Evaluation of gasification results based on carbon balance showed that only small fractions of organic carbons converted to carbon-containing gaseous products (CO and CO₂) and remaining carbons were precipitated as ungasified solid residue. Thus, gas mixtures produced from corn kernel hydrolysates were mostly composed of hydrogen as found in gas analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aactivated carbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3anon-genetically modified foods 3aplatinum 3apopcorn 3aseeds 3asolubilization 0aCorn kernel 0aHydrogen 0aGasification 0aAPR1 aIrmak, Sibel0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Mar., v. 134 p.105480-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1054803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245022900160300001600389500002000405520178900425592002802214650001602242650003002258650002002288650001602308650001702324650001702341650002002358650001902378650001102397650001102408650001602419650002302435700001102458700001802469700001502487700001802502700001402520773009902534856007802633852000902711655001202720IND60571668420221120100827.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057166842DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2016003642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Hongyun10aSensitive determination of sulfonamides in environmental water by capillary electrophoresis coupled with both silvering detection window and in‐capillary optical fiber light‐emitting diode‐induced fluorescence detector  ap. 452-459.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA new detector, silvering detection window and in‐capillary optical fiber light‐emitting diode‐induced fluorescence detector (SDW‐ICOF‐LED‐IFD), is introduced for capillary electrophoresis (CE). The strategy of the work was that half surface of the detection window was coated with silver mirror, which could reflect the undetected fluorescence to the photomultiplier tube to be detected, consequently enhancing the detection sensitivity. Sulfonamides (SAs) are important antibiotics that achieved great applications in many fields. However, they pose a serious threat on the environment and human health when they enter into the environment. The SDW‐ICOF‐LED‐IFD‐CE system was used to determine fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)‐labeled sulfadoxine (SDM), sulfaguanidine (SGD) and sulfamonomethoxine sodium (SMM‐Na) in environmental water. The detection results obtained by the SDW‐ICOF‐LED‐IFD‐CE system were compared to those acquired by the CE with in‐capillary optical fiber light‐emitting diode‐induced fluorescence detection (ICOF‐LED‐IFD‐CE). The limits of detection (LODs) of SDW‐ICOF‐LED‐IFD‐CE and ICOF‐LED‐IFD‐CE were 1.0–2.0 nM and 2.5–7.7 nM (S/N = 3), respectively. The intraday (n = 6) and interday (n = 6) precision of migration time and corresponding peak area for both types of CE were all less than 0.86% and 3.68%, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was judged by employing standard addition method, and recoveries obtained were in the range of 92.5–102.9%. The results indicated that the sensitivity of the SDW‐ICOF‐LED‐IFD‐CE system was improved, and that its reproducibility and accuracy were satisfactory. It was successfully applied to analyze SAs in environmental water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adetection limit 3afluorescein 3afluorescence 3ahuman health 3aisothiocyanates 3aoptical fibers 3asilver 3asodium 3asulfadoxine 3asulfamonomethoxine1 aWu, Yu1 aDuan, Zhijuan1 aYang, Feng1 aYuan, Hongyan1 aXiao, Dan0 tElectrophoresis.g2017 Feb., v. 38, no. 3-4 p.452-459dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2016003643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245008500161300002000246520100700266592002801273650002601301650002201327650001801349650001601367650001401383650001701397650001901414650002801433650001201461650001601473650001301489650002301502650001201525650002601537653002201563653001501585653001101600653001701611700001801628700001101646700005301657700005701710773015001767856008101917852000901998655001202007IND60761410120221122131120.0211229e20211216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076141012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c050362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yaoyao10aAzobenzene-Avermectin B1a Derivatives for Optical Modulation of Insect Behaviors  ap. 15530-15537.  aNaturally occurring avermectins are allosteric modulators of glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) and possess exceptionally potent anthelmintic, acaricidal, and insecticidal activities. Here, we develop photoswitchable azobenzene-avermectin (ABAVM) derivatives, which can be photoactivated upon ultraviolet irradiation. After illumination, the best compound p-AB4″AVM had a 1.88-fold and 2.74-fold insecticidal activity enhancement toward Culex pipiens pallens and Mythimna separata larvae, respectively. p-AB4″AVM allows for optical regulation of dorsal unpaired median neuron membrane potential with a 2.15-fold fluorescence intensity decrease after illumination. p-AB4″AVM and p-AB5AVM enable optical modulation of the behavioral response of Culex pipiens pallens larvae with 1- and 4-fold reduced mobility upon irradiation, respectively.

The strategy makes use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the generation of molecular conformations in the presence of a solvent. A clustering of the conformations from the MD trajectories was carried out based on principal component analysis of their dihedral angles. Representative conformations thus selected were then used in the conductor-like screening model for realistic solvents (COSMO-RS). Each conformation has been assigned a weight using an equation derived on the basis of its probability of occurrence in the MD trajectory. Experimental partition coefficients were reproduced within conformation-independent accuracy of COSMO-RS despite the size and flexibility of the ethoxy chain otherwise posing a challenge on their solvation modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aequations 3amodels 3amolecular conformation 3amolecular dynamics 3aoctanol 3apartition coefficients 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprobability 3ascreening 3asolvents 3asurfactants1 aIsele-Holder, Rolf1 aLeonhard, Kai0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Apr. 27, v. 55, no. 16 p.4782-4789dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.5b049553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009300171300001600264520126100280592002801541650002501569650002201594650001701616650001401633650001601647650002001663650002501683650001701708650002501725650002101750650001901771650001201790650002301802650001301825650003101838650002201869650001201891650001301903650001101916700001901927700001801946700001801964700001601982700001401998700001602012700002102028700001602049773010902065856008502174852000902259655001202268IND60086968520221119003703.0141102e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008696852DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(12)60060-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHOU, Gui-Sheng10aChemical constituents from the aerial parts of Angelica sinensis and their bioactivities  ap. 295-298.  aAIM: To investigate the chemical constituents from the aerial parts of Angelica sinensis and their anticoagulative and antibiotic activities. METHODS: The constituents of the 80% ethanol extract were isolated and purified by various chromatographic methods. Their structures were identified by the physicochemical characteristic and spectral data. The anticoagulative activity of the isolated compounds were tested using the thrombin time method assay, and the antibiotic activity were tested using the serial two-fold dilution method. RESULTS: Thirteen known compounds were isolated and identified as 24, 24-dimethyl-9,19-cyclolanostan-3β-ol (1), β-sitosterol (2), 2, 3, 6-trimethylbenzoic acid (3), uracil (4), daucosterol (5), hyperoside (6), allantoin (7), D-mannitol (8), 1S-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-1, 2-ethanediol (9), caffeic acid (10), chlorogenic acid (11), sucrose (12) and D-glucose (13). Compounds 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 moderately prolonged thrombin time. Compounds 1, 4, 6, 7 and 9 significantly inhibited the growth of Aeromonas hydrophila. CONCLUSION: Compounds 1, 3, 6-9 were isolated from this plant for the first time. Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11 are the important active constituents of the aerial parts of Angelica sinensis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aAngelica sinensis 3aaerial parts 3aallantoin 3aantibiotics 3abeta-sitosterol 3abioactive properties 3acaffeic acid 3achemical composition 3achlorogenic acid 3achromatography 3aethanol 3agrowth retardation 3amannitol 3aphysicochemical properties 3aspectral analysis 3asucrose 3athrombin 3auracil1 aYANG, Nian-Yun1 aTANG, Yu-Ping1 aDuan, Jin'ao,1 aJiang, Shu,1 aYan, Hui,1 aGuo, Sheng,1 aSONG, Bing-Sheng1 aHE, Zi-Qing0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2012 July, v. 10, no. 4 p.295-298dElsevier B.V.x1875-53647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(12)60060-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100002100159245008200180300001800262500000900280500001500289520184600304592002802150650001502178650002502193650002302218650001402241650001302255650002302268650001502291650002002306650002202326650001302348650003102361650002702392651001102419653000902430653001802439700001502457700001502472700001702487700001702504700001602521773015102537852000902688856009602697655001202793IND2090558320221119184301.0191125e199709  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209055832DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100050027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuld Mohamed, S.10aEstimating Long-Term Drainage at a Regional Scale Using a Deterministic Model  ap. 1473-1482.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThis study discusses the use of a deterministic model, at a regional scale, when the soils have small heterogeneity. Long-term soil drainage was simulated on 3500 ha in Beauce (France), taking into account variation in soil thickness, agricultural practices, and climate characteristics for a 32-yr period. The model was based on a numerical solution of Richards' equation, using a finite element method. Hydraulic properties were determined at four sites that are 4 km apart. The results show a small variability of hydraulic parameters, with coefficient of variation (CV) ranges from 1 to 16% for the α parameter, the empirical constant n, the saturated water content θₛ, and the residual water content θᵣ, and from 60 to 75% for the saturated hydraulic conductivity Kₛ. Hence, the spatial and temporal variability of drainage are mainly related to soil thickness, agricultural practices, and climate characteristics. Assigning small spatial variability to hydraulic properties, we analyzed the role of soil thickness and initial water content (IWC), induced by agricultural practices and climate characteristics, on drainage prediction. Five IWC were defined: 100, 90, 80, 70, and 55% of field capacity (FC). Four soil thicknesses were studied: 30, 60, 100, and 150 cm. The IWC appeared as a significant factor in drainage prediction for 60% of the 32 yr, regardless of soil thickness. Soil thickness became the most significant factor (20% of the 32 yr) for low IWC. The model was spatially extrapolated by combining the calculated drainage (which varied with soil thickness and IWC) and the spatial distribution of crops and soil thickness classes. Simulated drainage was closely related (r = 0.90) to groundwater recharge during the 32 yr, indicating that the model could be applied to other areas with appropriate parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestimation 3agroundwater recharge 3asoil water content 3athickness 3aporosity 3asoil heterogeneity 3awater flow 3acrop management 3aspatial variation 3adrainage 3aparticle size distribution 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aFrance 0asoil 0awater balance1 aBruand, A.1 aRaison, L.1 aBruckler, L.1 aBertuzzi, P.1 aGuillet, B.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1997 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.1473-1482dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100050027x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02114naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010200155300002000257520088200277592002801159650002101187650001501208650000901223650002401232650000901256650001201265650002201277650001401299650001701313650001301330700001501343700001601358700001601374700001501390700001701405700001801422700001901440700001501459773012301474856007401597852000901671655001201680IND60667336920221119221109.0190919e20150512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066733692DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra01102g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yunhe10aNovel aligned sodium vanadate nanowire arrays for high-performance lithium-ion battery electrodes  ap. 42955-42960.  aSodium vanadate (Na₅V₁₂O₃₂ or Na₁.₂₅V₃O₈) nanowire arrays were successfully prepared using a facile hydrothermal method with subsequent calcination.

Therefore, it is crucial to determine trace STX in seafood samples in order to ensure the safety of seafood consumption. In this study, we developed a novel indirect method for ultrasensitively determining trace STX in seafood by using CE‐ICP‐MS together with Eu³⁺ chelate labeling. We demonstrated that diethylenetriamine‐N,N,N′,N″,N″‐pentaacetic acid (DTPA) can couple with STX and simultaneously chelate with Eu³⁺ to realize metallic labeling of STX, and thus realize the ultrasensitive quantification of trace STX with CE‐ICP‐MS. The proposed method has strong antiinterference ability, good stability, and extremely high sensitivity. It could be used to determine trace STX in seafood samples with an extremely low detection limit of 0.38 fmol (3.8×10⁻⁹ M, 100 nL sample injection) and a relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 5) <7%. The success of this study provides an alternative to precise quantification of ultra‐trace STX in seafood samples, and further expands the application of ICP‐MS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aeuropium 3afood chain 3ahuman health 3aseafood consumption 3aseafoods 3ashellfish 3astatistical analysis 3atoxins1 aMo, Fan1 aChen, Danlong1 aXu, LiangJun1 aWu, Yongning1 aFu, FengFu0 tElectrophoresis.g2017 Feb., v. 38, no. 3-4 p.469-476dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2016004113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245015400159300001600313500002000329520151100349592002801860650001601888650002501904650002501929650001701954650002701971650001501998650001802013650001302031650002402044650001702068650003002085650001602115650002802131650004102159650001602200650001702216650002202233650001002255650001902265650002802284650001402312650001302326650001102339650002102350700002102371700002202392700002202414700002602436700002302462773010302485856007202588852000902660655001202669IND60522418320221120110243.0160602e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052241832DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.55972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeretta, Alberto10aEfficacy of a Standardized Extract of Prunus mume in Liver Protection and Redox Homeostasis: A Randomized, Double‐Blind, Placebo‐Controlled Study  ap. 949-955.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects of Prunus mume (PM) have previously been demonstrated. This double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study was designed to evaluate the influence of two doses of a food supplement, made of 150 mg of a standardized PM extract on liver transaminases, lipid profile, glycemia, neopterin and reduced and oxidized thiols in plasma and erythrocytes, during a 3‐month treatment period, in healthy subjects with transaminases levels between 20 and 40 UI/L. Forty‐five subjects (56.0 ± 11.6 years) were enrolled. The results showed a beneficial and statistically significant effect versus placebo of PM extract on liver function, with a decrease versus baseline in alanine aminotransferase (47%), aspartate aminotransferase (7%), gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase (15%) and glycemia (11%). The lipid profile modification was also positive with an increase versus baseline in HDL cholesterol (13%), and a decrease in LDL/HDL ratio (12%) and triglycerides (8%). The antioxidant action of PM translated into a decrease in oxidized glutathione, reduced/oxidized cysteine‐glycine, oxidized cysteine (intracellular pro‐oxidant) and neopterin (inflammation biomarker), was associated with an increase in reduced glutathione. These results are in favor of the use of a standardized extract of P. mume for the support of liver health and prevention of common metabolic and inflammation‐based diseases.

The type and amount of dispersant, adsorbent, and eluting solvent were optimized by a single-factor experiment and Box–Behnken design. Under the optimal conditions with 2.5 g of Florisil as a dispersant, 500 mg of C₁₈ as an adsorbent, and 5 mL of acetonitrile as an eluting solvent, the recoveries ranged from 70.4 to 99.9% with relative standard deviations less than 10.5%, and the limits of quantitation ranged from 0.13 to 1.01 μg/kg. The developed method was successfully applied to detect PPCPs in marketed fish, and five PPCPs, including triclocarban, sulfadiazine, sulfadimidine, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine, were detected at trace levels. The proposed method, which has the advantages of short analysis time, less solvent consumption, and high sensitivity, can be used for the determination of trace PPCPs in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aadsorbents 3adispersants 3aexperimental design 3afish 3afood chemistry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asulfadiazine 3asulfamethazine 3asulfamethoxazole 3atandem mass spectrometry 0apharmaceutical and personal care products 0amatrix solid-phase dispersion 0aBox−Behnken design1 aLv, Shengchen1 aTei, Sei,1 aHu, Caiwei1 aLi, Pengxi1 aNan, Fang1 aLiu, Xueke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0135-09291 aLiu, Donghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7121-23641 aZhou, Zhiqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0816-62031 aWang, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7854-11630 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Dec. 20, v. 69, no. 51 p.15738-15745dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c052323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03142naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013700174520156800311592002801879650001501907650001201922650001601934650002301950650002201973650001701995650001502012650001202027650001302039650001102052650001102063650000902074650001402083650002302097650003102120650001902151650002502170650001902195650001602214650002502230653002102255653001902276653001402295653001402309653001902323700001602342700002202358700001702380773010702397856008702504852000902591655001202600IND60682414620221117220918.0210415e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068241462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1054842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueirêdo, M.B.10aCatalytic hydrotreatment of pyrolytic lignins from different sources to biobased chemicals: Identification of feed-product relations  aThe pyrolysis liquid biorefinery concept involves separation of pyrolysis liquids in various fractions followed by conversion of the fractions to value-added products. Pyrolytic lignins (PLs), the water-insoluble fractions of pyrolysis liquids, are heterogeneous, cross linked oligomers composed of substituted phenolics whose structure and physicochemical properties vary significantly depending on the biomass source. The catalytic hydrotreatment of six PLs from different biomass sources (pine, prunings, verge grass, miscanthus and sunflower seed peel) was investigated to determine the effect of different feedstocks on the final product composition and particularly the amount of alkylphenolics and aromatics, the latter being important building blocks for the chemical industry. Hydrotreatment was performed with Pd/C, 100 bar of hydrogen pressure and temperatures in the range of 350–435 °C, resulting in depolymerized product mixtures with monomer yields up to 39.1 wt% (based on PL intake). The molecular composition of the hydrotreated oils was shown to be a strong function of the PL feed and reaction conditions. Statistical analyses provided the identification of specific structural drivers on the formation of aromatics and phenolics, and a simple model able to accurately predict the yields of such monomers after catalytic hydrotreatment was obtained (R² = 0.9944) and cross-validated (R² = 0.9326). These feed-product relations will support future selections of PL feeds to obtain the highest amounts of valuable biobased chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMiscanthus 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acatalytic activity 3achemical industry 3acrosslinking 3afeedstocks 3agrasses 3ahydrogen 3alignin 3amodels 3aoils 3apalladium 3aphenolic compounds 3aphysicochemical properties 3apyrolysis oils 3astatistical analysis 3asunflower seed 3atemperature 3avalue-added products 0aPyrolytic lignin 0aHydrotreatment 0aCatalysis 0aAromatics 0aAlkylphenolics1 aDeuss, P.J.1 aVenderbosch, R.H.1 aHeeres, H.J.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2020 Mar., v. 134 p.105484-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2020.1054843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001800159245009100177300001800268500000900286500001500295520179300310592002802103650001202131650001602143650001502159650001902174650002502193650002302218650003102241650002202272650001602294650001302310650001302323653002002336653002502356700001702381700001802398773015102416852000902567856009602576655001202672IND2090558520221119184320.0191125e199709  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND209055852DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100050028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobermann, A.10aScale-Dependent Correlations among Soil Properties in Two Tropical Lowland Rice Fields  ap. 1483-1496.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aLong-term irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivation is an important yet unstudied source of soil variation in tropical lowland rice fields. A field study was conducted to quantify spatial soil variability and to analyze correlations among soil properties at different spatial scales. Soil samples from the 0- to 20-cm depth were collected from adjacent rice fields consisting of Typic Tropaquepts and Typic Tropaqualfs. Structural variogram analysis and factorial kriging (FKA) were used to describe the coregionalization of 14 soil properties. Coregionalization was described by a model comprising (i) a nugget effect, (ii) a spherical model with a range of 12 m, and (iii) a Gaussian model with a range of 36 m. Correlations among soil properties varied depending on spatial scale. Short-range soil variation was caused by irrigation and land leveling, but results were not consistent for both fields. Similar autovariograms and high correlations between depth to the Cg horizon and extractable K in the Gaussian structure (ρ²ᵤᵥ = −0.95 to −0.99) revealed a strong influence of weathering of volcanic tuff on long-range trends in K. Electrical conductivity (EC), Na, and B were spatially trended and correlated with depth to the Cg horizon (ρ²ᵤᵥ = 0.59–0.97) in the Gaussian structure. Subsurface water flow through cracks above an impermeable layer and surface water flow along the gentle field slope were sources of long-range variation in EC, Na, and B caused by irrigation. The FKA provides quantitative measures of complex spatial process results and offers new ways for generating hypotheses about the phenomenon itself. This research was funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ) through the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ).  aPublisher supplied data 3akriging 3acorrelation 3arice soils 3atropical soils 3airrigated conditions 3asoil heterogeneity 3aphysicochemical properties 3aspatial variation 3aInceptisols 3alowlands 3aAlfisols 0asoil properties 0astatistical analysis1 aNeue, H.-U.,1 aGoovaerts, P.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1997 Sept., v. 61, no. 5 p.1483-1496dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1997.03615995006100050028x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02538naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011300159300002000272520113200292592002801424650002201452650001101474650001201485650001301497650001901510650001901529650001801548650001901566650001901585650001301604650002201617650001301639650002101652650003701673700002001710700002201730700002201752700002501774700002201799700001501821700002501836773012401861856007401985852000902059655001202068IND60667337220221119221029.0190919e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066733722DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra01114k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrivtsov, Igor10aExceptional thermal stability of undoped anatase TiO₂ photocatalysts prepared by a solvent-exchange method  ap. 36634-36641.  aA new solvent-exchange technique to prepare anatase nanoparticles with exceptional thermal stability and photocatalytic activity is described here. The process of preparation is accomplished by using organic solvents to precipitate hydrous titania particles from a basic aqueous medium containing a titanium peroxo complex. Undoped titanium dioxide formed via a solvent exchange method has unprecedented thermal stability against transformation to the rutile phase, as opposed to TiO₂ prepared by the common method of the gelation of an aqueous titanium peroxo complex. On the basis of X-ray thermodiffraction experiments, it has been established that the thermal treatment at 1000 °C of the titania prepared by ethanol precipitation contains 100% pure anatase phase. The stabilization of anatase is induced by the high defectiveness of the TiO₂ nanostructure, which is evidenced from band-gap energy estimation, PXRD and HRTEM studies. The prepared TiO₂ nanoparticles show an outstanding photocatalytic activity comparable to the commercial Aeroxide P25 photocatalyst in the UV-assisted decomposition of methylene blue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aenergy 3aethanol 3agelation 3aheat treatment 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asolvents 3athermal stability 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aIlkaeva, Marina1 aAvdin, Viacheslav1 aAmghouz, Zakariae1 aKhainakov, Sergei A.1 aGarcía, José R.1 aDiaz, Eva,1 aOrdóñez, Salvador,0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 22, v. 5, no. 46 p.36634-36641dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra01114k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245010500161300001800266520131900284592002801603650001501631650002301646650001401669650001601683650001001699650001301709650001401722650001201736650000701748650001201755650001901767650001801786650001101804700001701815700001701832700001601849773013401865856008201999852000902081655001202090IND60538404420221118042554.0160815e20160427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053840442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b000392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Tao10aAssembled Block Copolymer Stabilized High Internal Phase Emulsion Hydrogels for Enhancing Oil Safety  ap. 4499-4505.  aAccidental spills and subsequent fires during oil storage and transportation periods cause serious damage to environments. Herein, we present a novel route to enhance oil safety by transforming oils into high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) hydrogels. These HIPE hydrogels are stabilized by solvent- or pH-driven assembled block copolymer (BCP), namely poly(4-vinylpyridine)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (4VPₘ-EGₙ-4VPₘ). The assembled BCP shows high efficiency to stabilize HIPE hydrogels with a low concentration of 1.0 (w/v) % relative to the continuous aqueous phase. The volume fraction of the dispersed organic phase can be as high as 89% with a variety of oils, including toluene, xylene, blended vegetable oil, canola oil, gasoline, diesel, and engine oil. These smelly and flammable liquids were formed into HIPE hydrogels and thus their safety was enhanced. As the assembly is pH sensitive, oils trapped in the HIPE hydrogels can be released by simply tuning pH values of the continuous aqueous phase. The aqueous phase containing BCP can be reused to stabilize HIPE hydrogels after naturalization. These assembled BCP stabilized HIPE hydrogels offer a novel and safe approach to preserve and transport these smelly and flammable liquid oils, avoiding environmental damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola oil 3acomposite polymers 3aemulsions 3aengineering 3afires 3agasoline 3ahydrogels 3aliquids 3apH 3atoluene 3atransportation 3avegetable oil 3axylene1 aXu, Zhiguang1 aWu, Yuanpeng1 aGuo, Qipeng0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Apr. 27, v. 55, no. 16 p.4499-4505dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b000393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245004900159300001600208500002000224520103200244592002801276650001501304650001101319650002201330650001301352650000901365650002201374650001401396700002001410700002401430700002301454700002201477700002101499700001901520700002301539700002001562700002301582700002101605700002301626700002201649700002501671700002601696700002301722700002301745700002501768700003001793700002301823700002401846700002001870700002201890773012201912856007202034961001202106852000902118655001202127IND60522418720221120200723.0160602e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052241872DNAL7 a10.1002/fee.12832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, A Paige10aWildfire risk as a socioecological pathology  ap. 276-284.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWildfire risk in temperate forests has become a nearly intractable problem that can be characterized as a socioecological “pathology”: that is, a set of complex and problematic interactions among social and ecological systems across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Assessments of wildfire risk could benefit from recognizing and accounting for these interactions in terms of socioecological systems, also known as coupled natural and human systems (CNHS). We characterize the primary social and ecological dimensions of the wildfire risk pathology, paying particular attention to the governance system around wildfire risk, and suggest strategies to mitigate the pathology through innovative planning approaches, analytical tools, and policies. We caution that even with a clear understanding of the problem and possible solutions, the system by which human actors govern fire‐prone forests may evolve incrementally in imperfect ways and can be expected to resist change even as we learn better ways to manage CNHS.  aPublisher supplied data 3agovernance 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3arisk 3atemperate forests 3awildfires1 aSpies, Thomas A1 aSteelman, Toddi A.,1 aMoseley, Cassandra1 aJohnson, Bart R.,1 aBailey, John D.,1 aAger, Alan A.,1 aBourgeron, Patrick1 aCharnley, Susan1 aCollins, Brandon M1 aKline, Jeffrey D1 aLeahy, Jessica E.,1 aLittell, Jeremy S1 aMillington, James DA1 aNielsen‐Pincus, Max1 aOlsen, Christine S1 aPaveglio, Travis B1 aRoos, Christopher I1 aSteen‐Adams, Michelle M1 aStevens, Forrest R1 aVukomanovic, Jelena1 aWhite, Eric M.,1 aBowman, David MJS0 tFrontiers in ecology and the environment.g2016 June, v. 14, no. 5 p.276-284dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1540-92957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fee.12833Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245006700160500002000227520115500247592002801402650001501430650001101445650001901456650003101475650001501506650002101521650001601542650001301558651001901571651002201590651002401612700001501636700002001651700002201671773012601693856007701819852000901896655001201905IND60781236020221117194452.0220626e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078123602DNAL7 a10.1029/2010JC0061712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, A.10aHigh anthropogenic carbon content in the eastern Mediterranean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis work presents data of dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC‐12), dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity from a cruise to the Mediterranean Sea during October–November 2001, with the main focus on the CFC‐12 data and on the eastern basin.

The brookite nanocubes have a mean size of ∼50 nm, and the anatase microspheres with ∼3 μm diameter display hierarchical structures composed of secondary TiO₂ nanoribbons and nanoparticles. An optimal efficiency of 7.09% is obtained from the solar cell fabricated with a composite TiO₂ electrode containing 30 wt% nanocubes and 70 wt% microspheres, with 81% or 30% improvement in the efficiency as compared to the single nanocube or microsphere film-based cell. Those brookite nanocubes in the microsphere film can fill the interspaces of the hierarchical microspheres, which can not only enhance the dye-loading, but also reduce the charge recombination. All these lead to a higher voltage and current, leading to the improved performance of the anatase TiO₂ film-based solar cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3asolar cells 3atitanium dioxide1 aJin, Jingpeng1 aYing, Zihao1 aShi, Wenye1 aPeng, Tianyou0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 08, v. 5, no. 41 p.32536-32545dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra01122a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245009900161300001800260520132200278592002801600650001501628650001401643650001601657650001301673650002801686650001101714650002101725650001301746650001201759650002401771700001501795700001501810700001401825773013401839856008201973852000902055655001202064IND60538404720221118042440.0160815e20160427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053840472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.6b001212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Kaixun10aImproved Integrated Optimization Method of Gasoline Blend Planning and Real-Time Blend Recipes  ap. 4632-4645.  aAn innovative integrated optimization strategy for gasoline blend planning is proposed, and an improved method to achieve online optimization of real-time blend recipes is described. The proposed strategy can calculate a rough blend and delivery sequence of gasoline and then adapt to process changes by using a three-level discrete-time algorithm. Only one blender is considered in this study. A single-period nonlinear model (NLP) is solved at the top level of the algorithm to check the feasibility of a long-term production plan. A multi-period mixed-integer nonlinear model is formulated and solved at the middle level of the algorithm to compute a short-term blend plan. Finally, a single-period NLP is solved circularly at the lowest level of the algorithm to optimize blend recipes to consider the changes in the quality of blend components. The initial plan is modified if the top-level model is not feasible. The middle-level model is resolved if an unexpected event occurs during blending. The proposed approach is advantageous because the initial planning and blending recipes can be modified online, remarkably minimizing quality giveaway and increasing the blending success rate. The performance of the proposed strategy is illustrated through its industrial application in real-world gasoline blending.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemistry 3aengineering 3agasoline 3aindustrial applications 3amixing 3anonlinear models 3aplanning 3arecipes 3asystem optimization1 aQian, Feng1 aCheng, Hui1 aDu, Wenli0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2016 Apr. 27, v. 55, no. 16 p.4632-4645dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.iecr.6b001213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003000148245013200178300001600310520121000326592002801536650002001564650002501584650001801609650001001627650001601637650002201653650002401675650000901699650001701708650000901725650001401734650001601748700007701764700003501841700003001876700003601906700002901942700002201971773013301993856008202126852000902208655001202217IND60681834820221119155701.0200120e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068183482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-019-02008-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira Santos, Dimas10aGenetic parameters for tonic immobility, body weight, and morphological traits of the red-winged tinamou (Rhynchotus rufescens)  ap. 243-247.  aThis study was carried out to estimate genetic parameters for morphology, body weight, and tonic immobility traits in the red-winged tinamou (Rhynchotus rufescens). Information on 690 birds was used and genetic parameters were estimated using Bayesian methods under a multi-trait animal model. The following traits were considered in this study: tarsal length (TL), bill length (BL), wing length (WL), head width (HW), bill width (BW), mature weight (MW), weight at 90 days (W90), and tonic immobility (TI). The heritability showed estimates between 0.15 for wing length and 0.56 for bill length. Positive and negative genetic correlations were estimated, ranging from − 0.33 to 0.81. All the morphological, production, and behavioral traits studied will have moderate to high response to selection. The body weight at 90 days is a better alternative for use in breeding programs and its selection would not lead to an increase in the time of tonic immobility. Both the selection for weight gain and for reduction of tonic immobility time would lead to an increase in the size of the legs of the red-winged tinamou, which could be advantageous for thermal control of these birds in tropical systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aRhynchotus rufescens 3aanimal models 3abirds 3abody weight 3abreeding programs 3agenetic correlation 3ahead 3aheritability 3alegs 3aparalysis 3aweight gain1 ade Araujo Neto, Francisco Ribeiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1064-56141 ade Abreu Santos, Daniel Jordan1 ados Santos, Fabiana Ramos1 aAspilcueta-Borquis, Rusbel Raul1 ade Queiroz, Sandra Aidar1 aTonhati, Humberto0 tTropical animal health and production.g2020 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.243-247dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-019-02008-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03554naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245012400212300001600336500001900352520188800371592002802259650002002287650001802307650002802325650001502353650001602368650002102384650001302405650002802418650001802446650002502464650001702489650001302506650004302519650002202562650002402584650002402608650001102632650001802643650002002661700002102681700002402702700001702726700002202743700001702765700003002782773012102812856008202933852000903015655001203024IND60731038020221122235729.0210315e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073103802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-020-00690-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Jagesh Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3936-145810aMethylome and transcriptome analysis reveals candidate genes for tuber shape variation in tissue culture-derived potato  ap. 319-332.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe investigated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome (RNA-seq) profiling for tuber shape variation in potato. Mother plant (M1, round) and tissue culture-derived clonal variant plant (M2, elongated) were used. Total number of DNA methylation sites at cytosine contexts (CpG, CHG and CHH) was higher in M2 than M1, where CHH was the highest followed by CHG and CpG. Differential methylation regions (DMRs) analysis in M1 (control) and M2 revealed maximum DMRs number on chromosome 5 in CHG context and hypo-methylation was higher than hyper-methylation. Further, transcriptome analysis revealed that a total of 20,747 genes were differentially expressed between M1 (control) and M2, of which 280 (over-expressed) and 612 (under-expressed) genes were statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05). The gene ontology (GO) annotation showed predominance of molecular function, whereas signal transduction and carbohydrate metabolism were major KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathways. RNA-seq gene expression was validated for the ten selected genes by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Based on the comparative analysis, we observed a few candidate genes associated with tuber developmental processes such as phytohormones-related (e.g. SAUR family protein, abscisic acid environmental stress-inducible protein TAS14), sugar metabolism (e.g. UDP-glucosyltransferase, glycosyltransferase family GT8 protein), transcription factors (e.g. F-box family protein, MYB, WRKY, MADS-box), stress-responsive proteins (e.g. early-responsive to dehydration 3, cytochrome P450, proline-rich protein) and cell wall modifying genes (e.g. endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, glycine-rich cell wall structural protein 1.8, 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 10). Our study suggests that these candidate genes probably play key roles in tuber shape variation in potato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aabscisic acid 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acell walls 3achromosomes 3acytochrome P-450 3acytosine 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agene ontology 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aplant growth 3apotatoes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3astructural proteins 3asugars 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aBuckseth, Tanuja1 aSingh, Rajesh Kumar1 aZinta, Rasna1 aSaraswati, Aastha1 aKumar, Manoj1 aChakrabarti, Swarup Kumar0 tPlant growth regulation.g2021 Apr., v. 93, no. 3 p.319-332dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34166x0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-020-00690-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014800167300001800315520157200333592002801905650002101933650001901954650001401973650001101987650000901998650001302007650001602020650001402036650001102050650001902061650002402080650001002104650001102114650001702125650002102142650000902163650001902172650002802191650002002219650001202239650001302251650001302264650001402277650001202291653002102303653001902324653001902343653001602362653001402378653002902392653002402421700002902445700003302474700002502507700003702532773009902569856008602668852000902754655001202763IND60535108520221120025640.0190319e20151005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053510852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.08.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Amit10aStructural analysis and immunogenicity of recombinant major envelope protein (rA27L) of buffalopox virus, a zoonotic Indian vaccinia-like virus  ap. 5396-5405.  aBuffalopox virus (BPXV), an Indian variant of vaccinia virus (VACV), is a zoonotic agent and affects buffaloes, cattle and humans. A27L is one of the conserved major immuno-dominant envelope proteins of orthopox viruses (OPVs) involved in viral entry/maturation and elicits neutralizing antibodies. In this study, the A27L gene of BPXV-Vij/96 strain encoding recombinant mature A27L (21S to E110) and C-terminal truncated A27L-LZD (21S to N84aa) proteins were cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins. Structurally, A27L of BPXV was similar to that of VACV and found to contain four regions including a potential coiled-coil motif (CCM) in the centre (43 to 84aa). Oligomerization of recombinant A27L fusion protein (∼30kDa) leads to the formation of dimer/trimers/tetramers under non-reducing conditions. Further, the purified rA27L protein was used for active immunization of rabbit (250μg/rabbit) and adult mice (10μg and 50μg/mice) with or without adjuvants (FCA, alum and CpG). Immune response measured by using indirect-ELISA and SNT revealed a gradual increase in antigen specific serum IgG as well as neutralization antibody titers. Upon challenge with virulent BPXV strain, a protection of 60% was observed in suckling mice passively administered with anti-rA27L sera. No cross-reactivity of rA27L protein with hyperimmune sera against ORFV, GTPV, SPPV, PPRV, FMDV and BTV was noticed in indirect-ELISA. The study indicated that the rA27L protein is a safe and potential prophylactic as well as diagnostic antigen for buffalopox.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aVaccinia virus 3aadjuvants 3aadults 3aalum 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3across reaction 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aoligomerization 3arabbits 3asuckling 3avaccines 3avirulence 3aviruses 0aBuffalopox virus 0aImmunogenicity 0aIndirect-ELISA 0aMouse model 0aOligomers 0aRecombinant A27L protein 0aStructural analysis1 aYogisharadhya, Revanaiah1 aBhanuprakash, Veerakyathappa1 aVenkatesan, Gnanavel1 aShivachandra, Sathish Bhadravati0 tVaccine.g2015 Oct. 05, v. 33, no. 41 p.5396-5405dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.08.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01751naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245010400152300002000256520075500276592002801031650001201059650001601071650001101087650001401098650002101112700001501133700001401148700001201162700001501174700001601189773012501205856007401330852000901404655001201413IND60669396220221122080605.0190920e20151020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066939622DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra18564e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Y.10aVariation of exchange energy in δ-(Ga,Mn)As films under tensile strain: PBE and LDA+U calculations  ap. 89139-89143.  aPBE and LDA+U calculations were both used to clarify the variation of exchange energy in three kinds of δ-(Ga,Mn)As films under tensile strain. All configurations were strong FM types regardless of which of the two methods was used under strain. Tensile strain could affect the exchange energy and the thickness of three kinds of films. In some configurations, the exchange energy could be enhanced by shape deformation. The thickness of δ-(Ga,Mn)As from LDA+U calculations was greater than from PBE with the same lattice constant in each structure. PBE showed strong double exchange, while LDA+U resulted in a p–d exchange between Mn atoms in the DOS structure. All such films could be grown layer-by-layer based on the formation energy thereof.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3adeformation 3aenergy 3amanganese 3atensile strength1 aWei, X.

Entrainment ratio is reported as one of the global performance parameters which is affected sensitively by the nozzle position and converging angle of the mixing section. Furthermore, the effect of the geometric parameters is also explained using Mach number distributions throughout the ejector. Mach contours and the shadowgraphs of the ejector as well are displayed comparatively. The influence of the secondary flow effective area is discussed for better comprehension of the ejector performance by means of the aforecited geometrical parameters. The importance of this study is that the results can lead to the design of the mixing chamber of the ejector for the heat-driven ejector refrigeration systems. ANSYS Fluent software package is used for computational fluid dynamics simulations taking real gas thermodynamic properties into account and the numerical model was validated using the experimental data from the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3afluid mechanics 3amathematical models 3amixing 3amodel validation 3arefrigeration 3athermodynamics 3avapors 0aVapor jet ejector 0aShadowgraph 0aOblique shocks 0aEffective area 0aNozzle exit position 0aConverging duct angle1 aGök, Okan1 aAtmaca, Ayşe Uğurcan1 aErek, Aytunç0 tEnergy.g2019 Jan. 01, v. 166 p.1216-1228dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.10.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005800153245005800211300002000269520227200289592002802561650001602589650002802605650001902633650001102652650001402663650001302677650002202690650001502712650000902727650001402736650002302750650002002773650001902793700002002812700001302832700005302845700006102898700006402959700002103023700001303044700006203057773012203119856008703241852000903328655001203337IND60749441820221121020320.0210903e20210817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074944182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c022222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Linzhou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8354-784X10aStructure–Dynamic Function Relations of Asphaltenes  ap. 13610-13632.  aAsphaltene molecular and nanocolloidal structures have largely been resolved enabling development of structure–function relations of asphaltenes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) have provided the first direct molecular structures of many asphaltenes with extension into broader distributions of petroleum pitch. These studies confirmed previous findings of dominant island architecture, moderate-sized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with significant variability in the number and geometry of these rings. The Yen–Mullins model of centroids of molecular and nanocolloidal species of asphaltenes continues to provide foundations for thermodynamic treatment of crude oils, for both bulk and surface. Herein, these asphaltene structures are subject to the stringent test of modeling dynamic function along with static function. Recent results impact evaluation of the molecular management of heavy oil refining for the hydrotreatment process. Roughly, 25,000 reactions were considered acting on ∼17,000 molecules. Reactants and products are probed with ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. In modeling, consistency is required with AFM molecular imaging results of asphaltenes. Excellent agreement is obtained between modeling and experiment, increasing accuracy and robustness. Thermodynamic treatments of asphaltenes in bulk and surface are shown within a structure–dynamic function setting. Two oilfield reservoirs are reviewed which are undergoing different diffusive processes in geologic time. The dynamic model to evaluate both reservoirs couples the simplest solution of the diffusion equation with a quasi-equilibrium state employing the Yen–Mullins model in parts distant from the diffusive process, and excellent agreement between modeling and measurement is obtained. For interfacial tension (IFT), a static model employing the simple Langmuir equation successfully treats solutions of moderate asphaltene concentrations and is consistent with AFM images of asphaltenes. A first-order dynamic correction of time evolution of the IFT can be accounted for considering some molecular polydispersity. Structure–dynamic function relations are established for asphaltenes in three very different arenas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasphaltenes 3aatomic force microscopy 3adynamic models 3aenergy 3aequations 3ageometry 3amass spectrometry 3aoil fields 3aoils 3apetroleum 3asorption isotherms 3asurface tension 3athermodynamics1 aChen, Pengcheng1 aPan, Shu1 aLiu, Fang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7382-62151 aPauchard, Vincent1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1027-45261 aPomerantz, Andrew E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2639-26821 aBanerjee, Sanjoy1 aYao, Nan1 aMullins, Oliver C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6951-94150 tEnergy & fuels.g2021 Aug. 17, v. 35, no. 17 p.13610-13632dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c022223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010600174520177500280592002802055650002202083650001902105650001902124650001602143650002702159650001502186650002402201650002102225650002402246650002502270650001602295650001802311651001002329653002502339653002702364653003202391653001702423653001102440773011302451856008602564852000902650655001202659IND60786218320221119080018.0220914e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078621832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1333762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBansal, Ajay Kumar10aSizing and forecasting techniques in photovoltaic-wind based hybrid renewable energy system: A review  aWith increasing awareness towards environmental concern, efforts are made to reduce harmful effects of conventional electricity generation methods and uses of renewable sources of energy to generate electricity. India has enormous potential of renewable energy resources to meet its power generation requirements. India can meet with global footsteps in the economic and social advances through the advancement in field of renewable sources. In remote area applications, where grid approach is either not feasible or very costly, hybrid energy systems are recommended to supply electric power needs of single or multiple user utility for household or irrigation applications. In the areas where grids are not connected, electrical power can be generated by solar cells, wind turbine generators, hydro power plants or diesel engine generators. Multiple sources can be combined for generating the desired electrical energy for remote areas. When majority of the sources are renewable generating sources, then the combination is known as Hybrid Energy System. The purpose of this study is to provide a conceptual framework for hybrid system setup, modeling, renewable energy sources, criteria for hybrid system optimization and control strategies, and software utilized for optimal sizing. In addition, this paper gives a mathematical model of the hybrid system components, highlighting the significance of power reliability and system cost, and discusses a comparison of the most popular topologies utilized for the implementation and sizing of HRES. This article concludes with a comprehensive review of the various algorithms and software programmes utilized for size optimization.

To obtain the lipid microparticles, the FHAMF was sprayed in a double fluid atomizer at 1 bar pressure, in a chilled chamber (2 °C). After atomization, the microparticles were divided into three batches and stored for 90 days at three different temperatures (5, 15 and 25 °C). During storage, samples were periodically removed (7, 15, 30, 60 and 90 days) for evaluation of particle size, melting behavior, morphology, and polymorphic habit. The microparticles presented spherical shaped, with a smooth surface and wide size variation. When stored at 5 °C, the microparticles showed the smaller size and smaller agglomeration, due to the lower liquid fat content in the system, which that makes it difficult the adhesion of one particle to another. The lipid microparticles presented β′ crystals immediately after processing and at all temperatures during the storage. This study demonstrated the potential of FHAMF as an appropriate lipid phase for the production of lipid microparticles, and may contribute to further studies on the delivery of active compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aadhesion 3aanhydrous milk fat 3aatomization 3acrystals 3alipid content 3alipids 3aliquids 3amicroparticles 3aparticle size 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3athermal properties 0aFully hydrogenated milk fat 0aSpray chilling 0aPhysical stability 0aPolymorphism1 aViriato, Rodolfo Lázaro Soares1 aRibeiro, Ana Paula Badan1 aGigante, Mirna Lúcia0 tFood research international.g2020 May, v. 131 p.109009-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.1090093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245008100208300001600289520158900305592002801894650002101922650001301943650002001956650002001976650001501996650001602011650000902027650001902036650001602055650002202071650001002093650001502103650001302118650002402131650001602155650001302171651001402184651001502198651001802213651001702231651001802248653002102266653001502287653002302302653001602325653001702341653002702358700002302385700006002408700002302468700002002491700002102511700002102532773011802553856008302671852000902754655001202763IND60686605720221116154829.0200601e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068660572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jglr.2020.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebert, Craig E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8216-834610aTrends in herring gull egg quality over four decades reflect ecosystem state  ap. 538-548.  aEgg quality (size, energy density) is important in determining early survival of birds. Here, we examine temporal (1981–2019) trends in herring gull (Larus argentatus) egg volume and energy density at breeding colonies on all five Laurentian Great Lakes. Temporal declines in egg volume were observed at 4/6 colonies on the upper Great Lakes (Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron). On the lower Great Lakes (Lakes Erie, Ontario, and connecting channels) egg volume declined at 3/8 colonies and increased at one site. Egg energy density (kJ/g of egg contents) declined at 4/6 upper Great Lakes colonies and at 2/8 lower Great Lakes colonies. All of the upper Great Lakes colonies showed declines in either egg volume or energy density, or both, and these declines were related to dietary markers in eggs (fatty acids, stable nitrogen and carbon isotopes). On the lower Great Lakes and connecting channels, declines in egg volume or energy density were related to dietary endpoints in 3/5 instances. An information-theoretic approach indicated that trends in egg volume were best explained at the colony level while egg energy density trends were best explained by lake of origin. Diet-related declines in herring gull egg quality are likely a reflection of broad-scale ecosystem changes limiting aquatic food availability for gulls, particularly on the upper Great Lakes. These changes may be contributing to population declines in herring gulls and other surface-feeding aquatic birds. This study highlights the value of long-term monitoring of wildlife for identifying ecosystem change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus argentatus 3abreeding 3acarbon isotopes 3adietary markers 3aecosystems 3aegg quality 3aeggs 3aenergy density 3afatty acids 3afood availability 3alakes 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3apopulation dynamics 3awater birds 3awildlife 3aLake Erie 3aLake Huron 3aLake Michigan 3aLake Ontario 3aLake Superior 0aEcosystem change 0aEgg volume 0aEgg energy density 0aFood stress 0aHerring gull 0aLaurentian Great Lakes1 aWeseloh, D.V.

Understanding processes affecting habitat selection also is critically important for guiding conservation initiatives. Northern pintails (Anas acuta) are migratory, temperate-nesting birds that breed in greatest concentrations in the prairies of North America and their population remains below conservation goals. Habitat loss and changing land use practices may have decoupled formerly reliable fitness cues with respect to nest habitat choices. We used data from 62 waterfowl nesting study sites across prairie Canada (1997–2009) to examine nest survival, a primary fitness metric, at multiple scales, in combination with estimates of habitat selection (i.e., nests versus random points), to test for evidence of adaptive habitat choices. We used the same habitat covariates in both analyses. Pintail nest survival varied with nest initiation date, nest habitat, pintail breeding pair density, landscape composition and annual moisture. Selection of nesting habitat reflected patterns in nest survival in some cases, indicating adaptive selection, but strength of habitat selection varied seasonally and depended on population density and landscape composition. Adaptive selection was most evident late in the breeding season, at low breeding densities and in cropland-dominated landscapes. Strikingly, at high breeding density, habitat choice appears to become maladaptive relative to nest predation. At larger spatial scales, the relative availability of habitats with low versus high nest survival, and changing land use practices, may limit the reproductive potential of pintails.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas acuta 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amigratory behavior 3anesting 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aprairies 3apredation 3areproductive success 3awaterfowl 3aCanada1 aClark, R.G.1 aArmstrong, L.M.0 tOecologia.g2018 May, v. 187, no. 1 p.305-318dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4134-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007300170300001400243520131000257592002801567650001601595650001801611650001901629650002601648650001301674650001801687650000901705650001701714650001501731650001801746653002601764653001301790653001301803653002301816653002301839700001801862700002501880700001601905700002201921700002401943700002001967700001701987700001802004700002002022773010502042856008102147852000902228655001202237IND60599340720221118215124.0180702e20140417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059934072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2014.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsutsumi, Yasuo M.10aGeranylgeranylacetone protects the heart via caveolae and caveolin-3  ap. 43-48.  aGeranylgeranylacetone (GGA) is commonly utilized to protect the gastric mucosa in peptic ulcer disease. Recently GGA has been shown to protect the myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion by activating heat shock proteins. However, the exact mechanism as to how GGA activates these protective proteins is unknown. Caveolae and caveolin-3 (Cav-3) have been implicated in ischemia, anesthetic, and opioid induced cardiac protection. Given the lipophilic nature of GGA it is our hypothesis that GGA induced cardiac protection requires caveolae and Cav-3.We used an in vivo mouse model of ischemia–reperfusion injury and performed biochemical assays in excised hearts.GGA treated control mice revealed increased caveolae formation and caveolin-3 in buoyant fractions, mediating heat shock protein 70 activation. Furthermore, control mice treated with GGA were protected against ischemia/reperfusion injury whereas Cav-3 knockout (Cav-3 KO) mice were not. Troponin levels confirmed myocardial damage. Finally, Cav-3 KO mice treated with GGA were not protected against mitochondrial swelling whereas control mice had significant protection.This study showed that caveolae and caveolin-3 are essential in facilitating GGA induced cardiac protection by optimizing spatial and temporal signaling to the mitochondria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthetics 3aanimal models 3agastric mucosa 3aheat-shock protein 70 3aischemia 3alipophilicity 3amice 3amitochondria 3amyocardium 3apeptic ulcers 0aGeranylgeranylacetone 0aCaveolin 0aCaveolae 0aCardiac protection 0aHeat shock protein1 aTsutsumi, Rie1 aHorikawa, Yousuke T.1 aSakai, Yoko1 aHamaguchi, Eisuke1 aIshikawa, Yoshihiro1 aYokoyama, Utako1 aKasai, Asuka1 aKambe, Noriko1 aTanaka, Katsuya0 tLife sciences.g2014 Apr. 17, v. 101, no. 1-2 p.43-48dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2014.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01407naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006000170300001700230520059300247592002800840650001600868650001500884650001300899651001800912773012100930856008101051852000901132655001201141IND60621010220221119084047.0181114e199903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062101022DNAL7 a10.1177/000276499219547142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchudson, Michael,10aSocial Origins of Press Cynicism in Portraying Politics  ap. 998-1008.  aScholars and journalists both confirm that the U.S. news media have grown increasingly cynical in portraying politics over the past generation.

Two DMF oxygen atoms bridge three lead iodides to form a set of lead iodides, {[PbI₄/₂I(ODMF)₁/₂][PbI₄/₂(ODMF)₂/₂][PbI₄/₂I(ODMF)₁/₂]}²⁻, and these sets of lead iodide share edges to form a 1D lead iodide chain, [Pb₃I₈(DMF)₂]²⁻ which has never been reported before and is different from the typical edge sharing of octahedral PbI₆ units. 1D lead iodide chains are stacked along the a axis, and [Re₆S₈(PzH)₆]²⁺ cations with H-bonded DMF molecules to pyrazole N–H reside between 1D lead iodide chains. This 1D lead iodide hybrid shows strong broad-band emission with a peak at 634 nm. The excellent photoluminescent properties of the new lead iodide hybrid exhibit great potential for optoelectronic applications in photonic devices with broad-band emission and stability. This study introduces a new class of lead iodide hybrid compounds having new inorganic cluster cations rather than the organic amine cations that have been used in numerous studies to date. This work opens a promising path to overcome the instability of perovskites including of organic amine cations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3ahydrogen bonding 3aiodides 3alead 3aoxygen 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotons1 aChoi, Jun1 aKim, Youngmee1 aKim, Yuna1 aKim, SuJin,1 aYang, So-Hyeon1 aKim, Sŭng-jin,0 tRSC advances.g2021 July 13, v. 11, no. 40 p.24580-24587dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra04170c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245020100171300001400372520171100386592002802097650001502125650001302140650001102153650001502164650002002179650002802199650001902227650001202246650002002258650002002278650001102298650001802309650001502327650001302342650001302355650001302368653003802381653002702419653002202446653003302468653001902501653001502520700002202535700002702557700002102584773011202605856008402717852000902801655001202810IND60599223220221123020910.0180702e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059922322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenedé, Juan L.10aDevelopment of stir bar sorptive-dispersive microextraction mediated by magnetic nanoparticles and its analytical application to the determination of hydrophobic organic compounds in aqueous media  ap. 25-33.  aA novel microextraction technique combining the principles of stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and dispersive micro-solid phase extraction (DμSPE) is presented. The main feature of the method is the use of a neodymium-core stirring bar physically coated with a hydrophobic magnetic nanosorbent. Depending on stirring speed, the magnetic sorbent either acts as a coating material to the stir bar, thus affording extraction alike SBSE, or as a dispersed nanosorbent medium for the collection and extraction of the target analytes, in close analogy to DμSPE. Once the stirring process is finished, the strong magnetic field of the stir bar prevails again and rapidly retrieves the dispersed MNPs. Alike SBSE, the stir bar is collected and the analytes are back-extracted by liquid desorption into an appropriate organic solvent, which is used for analysis. This enrichment technique is easy to prepare since it does not require special surface modification procedures, uses low volumes of non-toxic organic solvents and most importantly imbues SBSE with additional functionalities against a wide range of analytes (since nanosorbents with various coatings can be employed) while it affords additional merits to DμSPE in terms of extraction and post-extraction treatment. As proof-of-concept this new approach was applied to the determination of organic UV filters in seawater samples using oleic acid-coated cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4@oleic acid) magnetic nanoparticles as sorbent material. The method showed good analytical features in terms of linearity, enrichment factors (11–148), limits of detection (low ngmL⁻¹), intra- and inter-day repeatability (RSD<11%) and relative recoveries (87–120%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3acoatings 3acobalt 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3aferrimagnetic materials 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amagnetic fields 3amicroextraction 3amixing 3ananoparticles 3aoleic acid 3aseawater 3asolvents 3asorbents 0aDispersive solid phase extraction 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aSeawater analysis 0aStir bar sorptive extraction 0aTrace analysis 0aUV filters1 aChisvert, Alberto1 aGiokas, Dimosthenis L.1 aSalvador, Amparo0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Oct. 03, v. 1362 p.25-33dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013600173300001600309500001900325520114000344592002801484650003001512650001101542650001401553650001201567650001101579650002501590650002401615650001301639700001701652700002001669773010801689856008501797852000901882655001201891IND60693144120221118161452.0200505e20140704xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069314412DNAL7 a10.1080/17583004.2015.10215632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamberlin, Shaun10aReconciling scientific reality with realpolitik: moving beyond carbon pricing to TEQs – an integrated, economy-wide emissions cap  ap. 411-427.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article considers why price-based frameworks may be inherently unsuitable for delivering unprecedented global emissions reductions while retaining the necessary public and political support, and argues that it is time to instead draw on quantity-based mechanisms such as TEQs (tradable energy quotas). TEQs is a climate policy framework combining a hard cap on emissions with the use of market mechanisms to distribute quotas beneath that cap. The significant international research into TEQs is summarized, including a 2008 UK government feasibility study, which concluded that the scheme was “ahead of its time.” TEQs would cover all sectors within a national economy, including households, and findings suggest it could act as a catalyst for the socio-technical transitions required to maximize wellbeing under a tightening cap, while generating national common purpose toward innovative energy demand reductions. Finally, there are reflections on the role that the carbon management community can play in further developing TEQs and reducing the rift between what climate science calls for and what politics is delivering.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aclimate 3aenergy 3aenvironmental policy 3afeasibility studies 3apolitics1 aMaxey, Larch1 aHurth, Victoria0 tCarbon management.g2014 July 4, v. 5, no. 4 p.411-427dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2218x1758-30127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2015.10215633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016700166300001600333520158800349592002801937650002701965650001501992650001502007650003602022650001802058650001602076650001102092650002902103650001602132650001502148650002402163650001502187650001802202650001602220650001502236650002002251650000902271650002202280650001702302650001702319653003002336653000902366653003302375653004002408700001802448700001902466700002102485700001902506700002102525700002202546773010502568856008102673852000902754655001202763IND60599341220221118215045.0180702e20141124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059934122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2014.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomma, Satoshi10aCalcitonin gene-related peptide protects the myocardium from ischemia induced by endothelin-1: Intravital microscopic observation and 31P-MR spectroscopic studies  ap. 248-254.  aCalcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator neuropeptide. We investigated the ameliorating effect of CGRP in myocardial ischemia induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1), with special emphasis on myocardial microvascular hemodynamics and levels of energy-related metabolites.The Langendorff preparations of rat isolated heart were perfused at a constant flow rate. Microvascular blood flow was also visualized in the anterior epicardium of the left ventricle by means of an intravital fluorescence microscope system. Energy-related metabolite contents in the myocardium were measured by means of ³¹P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (³¹P-MRS).Intracoronary bolus injections of CGRP caused dose-dependent decreases in coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) in the hearts exposed to ET-1 (30pmol). The vasodilator potency of CGRP was about 10,000-fold greater than that of nitroglycerin and 1,000-fold greater than that of isobutylmethylxanthine. Vasodilation of the small-sized arterioles (10–40μm in diameter) in response to CGRP (100pmol) was confirmed by direct microscopic observation. After ET-1 (30pmol) plus vehicle administration, high energy phosphates (phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP) were markedly reduced (p<0.05). CGRP administration significantly (p<0.05) attenuated the anaerobic changes in the myocardium (decrease in PCr) and macrohemodynamic alterations (increase in CPP, decrease in dP/dt etc.) induced by ET-1.We conclude that CGRP effectively confers hemodynamic and metabolic protections to isolated beating hearts against ET-1-induced myocardial ischemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aarterioles 3ablood flow 3acalcitonin gene-related peptide 3adose response 3aendothelins 3aenergy 3afluorescence microscopes 3ametabolites 3amicroscopy 3amyocardial ischemia 3amyocardium 3anitroglycerin 3apericardium 3aphosphates 3aphosphocreatine 3arats 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3avasodilation 0aCoronary microcirculation 0aCGRP 0aMyocardial energy metabolism 0a31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aKimura, Taizo1 aSakai, Satoshi1 aYanagi, Ken-ichi1 aMiyauchi, Yumi1 aAonuma, Kazutaka1 aMiyauchi, Takashi0 tLife sciences.g2014 Nov. 24, v. 118, no. 2 p.248-254dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2014.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01813naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007200171300001800243520099600261592002801257650002401285650002001309700001901329773012101348856008101469852000901550655001201559IND60621010820221119084103.0181114e199905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062101082DNAL7 a10.1177/000276499219548862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Michael W.,10aSocial Psychological Obstacles in Environmental Conflict Resolution  ap. 1322-1349.  aAmong the factors contributing to the inability of environmental and economic interest groups to resolve conflicts are the processes of social perception and social decision making. This article identifies social psychological dynamics that cause opposing parties to misunderstand each other's interests and the facts presented to support them, thus hindering efficient conflict settlement. The authors review research elucidating the sources of these problems and potential remedies. They discuss how such dynamics arise within the contexts of procedures for settling environmental conflicts, governmental adjudication procedures, and alternative free-market-based procedures. The conclusion is that purely market-based procedures avoid the obstacles most endemic to governmental adjudication but exacerbate other problems. The authors conclude by analyzing emerging hybrid procedures that avoid the greatest obstacles associated with purely adjudicatory and purely market-based procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconflict management 3adecision making1 aSu, Steven K.,0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g1999 May, v. 42, no. 8 p.1322-1349dSage PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000276499219548863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02848naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245013500169300001800304520135800322592002801680650002401708650001901732650002501751650001401776650002501790650002301815650002001838650001801858650001801876650006601894650004401960650002102004650001102025650001802036650001102054700002702065700002202092700002002114700002002134700001902154700002102173773012002194856005502314852000902369655001202378IND4510129820221120185607.0150730e20010715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451012982DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02321.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeyer, Armin10aStructure and characterization of the glycan moiety of L‐amino‐acid oxidase from the Malayan pit viper Calloselasma rhodostoma  ap. 4044-4053.  aOphidian l‐amino‐acid oxidase (l‐amino‐acid oxygen:oxidoreductase, deaminating, EC 1.4.3.2) is found in the venom of many poisonous snakes (crotalids, elapids and viperids). This FAD‐dependent glycoprotein has been studied from several snake species (e.g. Crotalus adamanteus, Crotalus atrox and Calloselasma rhodostoma) in detail with regard to the biochemical and enzymatic properties. The nature of glycosylation, however, as well as the chemical structure(s) of the attached oligosaccharide(s) are unknown. In view of the putative involvement of the glycan moiety in the biological effects of ophidian l‐amino‐acid oxidase, notably the apoptotic activity of the enzyme, structural knowledge is needed to evaluate its exact function. In this study we report on the glycosylation of l‐amino‐acid oxidase from the venom of the Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma). Its glycosylation is remarkably homogenous with the major oligosaccharide accounting for approximately 90% of the total sugar content. Based on detailed analysis of the isolated oligosaccharide by 2D NMR spectroscopies and MALDI‐TOF mass spectrometry the glycan is identified as a bis‐sialylated, biantennary, core‐fucosylated dodecasaccharide. The biological significance of this finding is discussed in light of the biological activities of the enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrotalus adamanteus 3aCrotalus atrox 3aL-amino-acid oxidase 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3achemical structure 3aenzyme activity 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoligosaccharides 3asnakes 3asugar content 3avenoms1 aFitzpatrick, Teresa B.1 aPawelek, Peter D.1 aKitzing, Karina1 aVrielink, Alice1 aGhisla, Sandro1 aMacheroux, Peter0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 July 15, v. 268, no. 14 p.4044-4053dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02321.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024003700128040001800165100001900183245019900202300001800401520156500419592002801984596009902012596008302111650001602194650002202210650001602232650002502248650002002273650001302293650001302306650001402319650002402333650001902357650001802376650002102394650001902415650002102434650001502455650002102470650001802491650002102509650002002530650003302550650003702583650002102620653001502641653000902656653002602665653002302691700002202714700006802736700005802804700001402862773014802876856008103024852000903105655001203114IND60642713520221119024441.0190508e20190423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064271352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b069632doi7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b069632chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Chengzhen10aDesign of Astaxanthin-Loaded Core–Shell Nanoparticles Consisting of Chitosan Oligosaccharides and Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid): Enhancement of Water Solubility, Stability, and Bioavailability  ap. 5113-5121.  aAstaxanthin, a hydrophobic carotenoid found in marine plants and animals, is claimed to exhibit various beneficial biological activities. Its use as a nutraceutical in foods, however, is currently limited by its low water-solubility and poor bioavailability. The goal of this paper was to fabricate astaxanthin-loaded colloidal particles to overcome these challenges. Astaxanthin was encapsulated in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with chitosan oligosaccharides (COS). The properties of the loaded nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The influence of PLGA properties on the loading capacity, water solubility, stability, and release of the astaxanthin were determined. The nanoparticles were smooth spheres with mean particle diameters around 150 nm and positive surface potentials (ζ = +30 mV). The encapsulation efficiency (>85%) and loading capacity (>15%) of the astaxanthin in the nanoparticles was relatively high. X-ray analysis suggested that the encapsulated astaxanthin was in an amorphous form. The nanoparticles had good dispersibility and stability in aqueous solutions, as well as high cytocompatibility. In vitro studies showed that the astaxanthin was released from the nanoparticles under simulated gastric and small intestinal conditions. Overall, our results suggest the core–shell nanoparticles developed in this study may be suitable for encapsulating this important nutraceutical in functional foods and cosmetics.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002338  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825 3aX-radiation 3aaqueous solutions 3aastaxanthin 3abioactive properties 3abioavailability 3achitosan 3acolloids 3acosmetics 3adietary supplements 3adispersibility 3aencapsulation 3afunctional foods 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro studies 3aintestines 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3aoligosaccharides 3aplants (botany) 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater solubility 0acarotenoid 0aPLGA 0ananoparticle carriers 0acontrolled release1 aZhang, Shuaizhong1 aMcClements, David Julian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9016-12911 aWang, Dongfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1527-66541 aXu, Ying,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Apr. 23, v. 67, no. 18 p.5113-5121dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b069633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245020500164300001400369520160300383592002801986650001702014650001702031650001202048650001502060650002602075650001302101650002702114650001302141650001802154650002902172650002002201650001502221653001702236653003302253653003002286653001702316653001802333653001502351700001902366700002002385700001402405700001802419700001802437700001802455773011202473856008402585852000902669655001202678IND60599223420221123004614.0180702e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059922342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiofi, L.10aLiquid chromatographic–tandem mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of alkylphenols polyethoxylates, alkylphenoxy carboxylates and alkylphenols in wastewater and surface-water  ap. 75-88.  aFour different pellicular stationary phases (i.e. octadecylsilane, octasilane, Phenyl-Hexyl and pentafluorophenyl) were investigated for the chromatographic resolution of alkylphenols (APs), alkylphenols polyethoxylates (APnEOs) and alkylphenoxy carboxylates (APECs) using mixtures of water and organic solvents (i.e. methanol, acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran) as eluents, in order to obtain their determination by a single LC–MS/MS run. In fact, alkylphenols and alkylphenoxy carboxylates must be analysed in negative ion mode, whereas alkylphenols polyethoxylates undergo ionisation only in positive ion mode, and therefore, two distinct LC–MS/MS analysis are commonly adopted. The best resolution among the aforementioned target analytes was achieved on the pentafluorophenyl column, eluting with an acidified water–acetonitrile–tetrahydrofuran mixture and using the post column addition of an ammonia solution in methanol for the detection of positively ionisable compounds. Under these optimized chromatographic conditions the investigated compounds were determined via a single chromatographic run, with only one polarity switch, in 15min, achieving the following instrumental detection limits: 600pg for AP1EOs, 0.8–14pg for AP2EOs, 10.4–150pg for APs and 4.4–4.8pg for APECs. The chromatographic method was coupled with solid-phase extraction and clean-up procedures and successfully applied to the analysis of wastewater and surface water samples, highlighting mean concentration ranging from 6ng/L for 4-t-OP1EC to 1434ng/L for 4-NP1121EC, depending on the sample analysed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aalkylphenols 3aammonia 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amethanol 3asolid phase extraction 3asolvents 3asurface water 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atetrahydrofuran 3awastewater 0aHPLC–MS/MS 0aAlkylphenols polyethoxylates 0aAlkylphenoxy carboxylates 0aAlkylphenols 0aSurface water 0aWastewater1 aAncillotti, C.1 aChiuminatto, U.1 aFibbi, D.1 aChecchini, L.1 aOrlandini, S.1 aDel Bubba, M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2014 Oct. 03, v. 1362 p.75-88dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.08.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01436naa a2200229 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006000171300001800231520067500249592002800924650001500952650001600967773012100983856008101104852000901185655001201194IND60621010920221119084238.0181114e199905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062101092DNAL7 a10.1177/000276499219548952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTenbrunsel, Ann E.,10aTrust as an Obstacle in Environmental-Economic Disputes  ap. 1350-1367.  aAt the core of environmental-economic disputes is an inherent distrust of “the other side.” This article draws on past research to identify factors that contribute to and exacerbate these negative expectations.

Sprigging rates did not significantly affect the turf ground cover after a 5 to 6-month growing season. However, for a shorter growing season, the rate of establishment was increased with the higher rate (2.0 vs 0.5 or 1.0 m²/are) of sprigging. Nitrogen (490 g/are) applied at biweekly (eight applications) or monthly (four applications) intervals significantly increased turf ground cover and turf appearance as compared with turf not receiving N. Treatments of dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA) retarded early growth of Tifway bermudagrass. The plants had overcome this growth retardation by 11 weeks following sprigging. Postemergence treatments of monosodium methanearsonate + 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (MSMA + 2,4-D) were nonphytotoxic to the turfgrass. Sequential treatments of DCPA followed with MSMA + 2,4-D resulted in excellent season long weed control and the plots had 86% ground cover of turf at the end of the growing season. The turf ground cover was only 36% in plots not treated with any herbicide and 68% in plots treated with DCPA. Repeated postemergence treatments of MSMA + 2,4-D resulted in good to excellent weed control and these plots had 91 to 96% turfgrass ground cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aCynodon dactylon 3aMSMA (herbicide) 3achlorthal-dimethyl 3agrowing season 3agrowth retardation 3alawns and turf 3anitrogen 3aturf grasses 3aweed control 3aweeds0 tAgronomy journal.g1973 Nov., v. 65, no. 6 p.969-972dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1973.00021962006500060037x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02696naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245008500206300001600291520122900307592002801536650002001564650002801584650001401612650001701626650001101643650002401654650002201678650001901700650001201719653001901731653002601750653003201776653002101808700006601829700005901895700005901954773018102013856008302194852000902277655001202286IND60773604620221119144306.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077360462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2022.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnol, Linda L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7347-485410aDirect Yet Opposite Effects of Stress-related and Mindful Eating on Diet Quality  ap. 872-877.  aExamine the relationships among dietary quality, mindful eating, and constructs of the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping. In this cross-sectional study, women (n = 67) aged 25–50 years, with a body mass index of 25–40 kg/m² completed 3 days of 24-hour recalls and a survey that included the Perceived Stress Scale, Eating and Appraisal Due to Emotions and Stress Questionnaire, and the Mindful Eating Questionnaire.

Farooq12aA new peak shape analysis approach: detection and quantitation of concurrent fronting, tailing, and their effect on asymmetry measurements  aPre-press version  aMost peak shapes obtained in separation science depart from linearity for various reasons such as thermodynamic, kinetic, or flow based effects. An indication of the nature of asymmetry often helps in problem solving e.g. in column overloading, slurry packing, buffer mismatch, and extra-column band broadening. However, existing tests for symmetry/asymmetry only indicate the skewness in excess (tail or front) and not the presence of both. Two simple graphical approaches are presented to analyze peak shapes typically observed in gas, liquid, and supercritical fluid chromatography as well as capillary electrophoresis. The derivative test relies on the symmetry of the inflection points and the maximum and minimum values of the derivative. The Gaussian test is a constrained curve fitting approach and determines the residuals. The residual pattern graphically allows the user to assess the problematic regions in a given peak, e.g., concurrent tailing or fronting, something which cannot be easily done with other current methods. The template provided in MS Excel automates this process. The total peak shape analysis extracts the peak parameters from the upper sections (>80% height) of the peak rather than the half height as is done conventionally. A number of situations are presented and the utility of this approach in solving practical problems is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasymmetry 3acapillary electrophoresis 3aproblem solving 3aslurries 3astatistical analysis 3asupercritical fluid chromatography 3athermodynamics 0aPeak shape analysis 0aPeak asymmetry 0aUSP tailing factor 0aDerivative test 0aGaussian test 0aAutomated excel template1 aPatel, Darshan C.1 aArmstrong, Daniel W.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2017.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008600172300001600258520142700274592002801701650001601729650001901745650001401764650001201778650002101790650001301811650002001824650001301844650001101857650001801868650001501886650001601901650001201917650001301929650002101942650002201963650002801985650001002013650002002023650002502043650001302068650001202081653001902093653001402112653002402126653002502150653001202175653002102187653001202208653000802220653000802228653000802236653000802244653000902252653001002261653000802271653000802279653000802287653000702295653000702302653000802309653001002317653001202327653000802339653000802347653000702355653000802362700002502370773012402395856008502519852000902604655001202613IND60582905120221121012015.0190410e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058290512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNourimand, Maryam10aAllantoin contributes to the stress response in cadmium-treated Arabidopsis roots  ap. 103-109.  aUreides are nitrogen-rich compounds, derived from purine catabolism. A dual role for ureides, and for allantoin in particular, in both nitrogen recycling and the abiotic stress response has been recently identified. Previous work on the effect of allantoin on cadmium (Cd)-exposed Arabidopsis revealed that high concentration of allantoin in allantoinase-negative mutant (aln-3) leaves alleviates Cd toxicity via inducing antioxidant mechanisms in these plants. In the present study, we evaluate whether allantoin has a similar protective role in roots. Both wild type and aln-3 roots contain higher amounts of internal Cd compared to leaves. Likewise, aln-3 roots are more resistant to Cd, reflected in fresh and dry weight, and stimulated antioxidant enzyme activity, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), resulting in lower reactive oxygen species concentration. In contrast with wild-type leaves, high levels of Cd in Col-0 roots reduces transcript abundance of uricase, leading to a significant decline in allantoin level of treated roots at 1000 and 1500 μM CdCl2. This metabolite change is also accompanied by decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT). Additionally, contrary to wild-type leaves, root genotype has a significant effect on CAT activity under Cd treatment, suggesting the possible different sources of damage and oxidative stress response in these two tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aabiotic stress 3aallantoin 3acadmium 3acadmium chloride 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3agenotype 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amutants 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3aroots 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3aureides 0aAbiotic stress 0aAllantoin 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aCadmium 0aOxidative stress 0aUreides 0aAAH 0aAAS 0aABA 0aALN 0aALNS 0aANOVA 0aBG1 0aCAT 0aDAB 0aJA 0aMS 0aNBT 0aNCED3 0aqRT-PCR 0aROS 0aSOD 0aUO 0aXDH1 aTodd, Christopher D.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2017 Oct., v. 119 p.103-109dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001800197245010100215300001800316506007600334520178400410592002802194506003702222650000902259650002102268650001502289650001402304650001702318650000902335650001102344650001602355650001102371650002602382650002102408650001202429650002102441650001402462650001202476650001402488700002402502700001702526700002002543700002002563700002102583700001802604700001902622700002002641700002002661700001502681700002202696700002302718773008702741856009002828852000902918655001202927IND60090434720221207110935.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009043472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.0522doi7 aPMC33715922pmcid7 a225949752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Xiaojuan10aHigh refractive index polysiloxane as Injectable, in situ curable accommodating intraocular lens  ap. 5659-5671.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFunctionalised siloxane macromonomers, with properties designed for application as an injectable, in situ curable accommodating intraocular lens (A-IOL), were prepared via re-equilibration of a phenyl group-containing polysiloxane of very high molecular weight with octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D₄) and 2,4,6,8-tetra(n-propyl-3-methacrylate)-2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-cyclotetrasiloxane (D₄ ᴬᴹ) in toluene using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as a catalyst. Hexaethyldisiloxane was used as an end group to control the molecular weight of the polymer. The generated polymers had a consistency suitable for injection into the empty lens capsule. The polymers contained a low ratio of polymerisable groups so that, in the presence of a photo-initiator, they could be cured on demand in situ within 5 min under irradiation of blue light to form an intraocular lens within the lens capsule. All resulting polysiloxane soft gels had a low elastic modulus and thus should be able to restore accommodation. The pre-cure viscosity and post-cure modulus of the generated polysiloxanes were controlled by the end group and D₄ ᴬᴹ concentrations respectively in the re-equilibration reactions. The refractive index could be precisely controlled by adjusting the aromatic ratio in the polymer to suit such application as an artificial lens. Lens stretching experiments with both human and non-human primate cadaver lenses of different ages refilled with polysiloxane polymers provided a significant increase in amplitude of accommodation (up to 4 D more than that of the respective natural lens). Both in vitro cytotoxicity study using L929 cell lines and in vivo biocompatibility study in rabbit models demonstrated the non-cytotoxicity and ocular biocompatibility of the polymer.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLens 3abiocompatibility 3ablue light 3acatalysts 3acytotoxicity 3agels 3ahumans 3airradiation 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3amolecular weight 3arabbits 3arefractive index 3asiloxanes 3atoluene 3aviscosity1 aJeffery, Justine L.1 aLe, Tam P.T.1 aMcFarland, Gail1 aJohnson, Graham1 aMulder, Roger J.1 aGarrett, Qian1 aManns, Fabrice1 aNankivil, Derek1 aArrieta, Esdras1 aHo, Arthur1 aParel, Jean-Marie1 aHughes, Timothy C.0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Aug., v. 33, no. 23 p.5659-5671dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245010900134300001600243520111300259592002801372650002901400650002201429650001101451650001201462650001601474653002601490653001101516653001701527653001601544653001701560700001901577700001601596700002401612773010701636852000901743655001201752IND60723825320221122055123.0210117e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072382532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Kuldeep10aDifferential Reaction of Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) Genotypes to Pulse-beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus)  ap. 367-374.  aFifty two cowpea genotypes including two checks Pusa Komal and Local variety were evaluated for their differential reaction to pulse beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus under no-choice artificial infestation conditions. Significant differences were observed among the genotypes in terms of number of eggs laid, development period, adult emergence, number of emergence holes, weight loss and growth index of C. maculatus on cowpea. Based on growth indices of C. maculatus on cowpea, three genotypes (IC107466, IC106815 and Pusa Komal) were found resistant, nine as moderately resistant, 18 as moderately susceptible, 18 as susceptible and 4 were highly susceptible. Correlation between growth index and growth parameters of beetle on cowpea genotypes indicated that growth index had significant negative relationship with mean development period (r = -0.90) and significantly positive relation with adult emergence (r = 0.83). Adult emergence had a positive relationship with weight loss (r = 0.43) and number of eggs laid by C. maculatus had a significant negative relationship with adult emergence (r = -0.36).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCallosobruchus maculatus 3aVigna unguiculata 3aadults 3acowpeas 3aweight loss 0aHost plant resistance 0acowpea 0aC. maculatus 0aoviposition 0agrowth index1 aBhalla, Shashi1 aPrasad, T V1 aSriniwasan, Kalyani0 tVegetos.g2012 Dec., v. 25, no. 2 p.367-374dSociety for Plant ResearchwJournal:2073x2229-44737nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245007600184300001600260520099100276592002801267650002401295650001401319650001701333650001701350650002001367650001901387650001101406650001601417650001201433650002801445650001701473650001201490650001601502650001301518650000701531650001801538650001701556650000901573650001601582650003001598650002601628650002901654650002201683650002301705650003101728650002501759650003601784650002801820650003201848650001601880700001801896773014301914856008202057852000902139655001202148IND50072762620221117200829.0220213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007276262DNAL7 a241463082pmid7 a10.1007/s11274-013-1484-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRokade, Kedar10aBiodegradation of benzyl benzoate by Pseudomonas desmolyticum NCIM 2112  ap. 827-833.  aCommercial grade insecticides are supplemented with the chemical additives to enhance the insecticidal activity before the action of main insecticide commence. Benzyl benzoate is one of such additive used in the formulation of many insecticides. Due to deposition of such additive the soil and plant health get deteriorated. The present research work describes the biodegradation of benzyl benzoate by Pseudomonas desmolyticum NCIM 2112. The biodegradation was influenced by factors such as pH, temperature and other carbon and nitrogen sources. The optimum pH and temperature for biodegradation was found to be 7.0 and 30 °C respectively. It was more effective at 0.5 % glucose and lactose concentration and at 0.05 % NaNO₃ and peptone concentration. Pseudomonas desmolyticum NCIM 2112 degrades benzyl benzoate into compounds like benzaldehyde and benzoic acid which are nontoxic in nature. Phytotoxicity study shows no germination inhibition in presence of degraded metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDelftia acidovorans 3aadditives 3abenzaldehyde 3abenzoic acid 3abenzyl benzoate 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3agermination 3aglucose 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticides 3alactose 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant health 3asoil 3atemperature 2aBenzaldehydesxmetabolism 2aBenzoatesxmetabolism 2aBenzoic Acidxmetabolism 2aBiotransformation 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Developmentxdrug effects 2aPseudomonasxmetabolism 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 2aTemperature1 aMali, Gajanan0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2014 Mar., v. 30, no. 3 p.827-833dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44995x0959-39937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-013-1484-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009500162520129400257592002801551650002401579650002801603650002801631650001001659650001301669650001501682650004301697650001301740653003001753653002501783653002301808653001801831653002801849700002001877700001601897700001901913773010101932856008102033852000902114655001202123IND60686606620221116152431.0200427e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068660662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fm.2020.1034852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Eiseul10aNovel real-time PCR assay for Lactobacillus casei group species using comparative genomics  aThe Lactobacillus casei group, which includes the closely related species L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, and L. chiayiensis, has been under debate regarding its taxonomy because of the difficulty in distinguishing the species from each other. In the present study, we developed a novel real-time PCR assay for distinguishing the L. casei group species. The pan-genome, as determined by the genomes of 44 strains, comprised 6789 genes, comparative genomic analysis showed that L. casei group strains were classified by species. Based on these results, species-specific genes were identified, and primers were designed from those genes. Real-time PCR clearly distinguished each species of the L. casei group and specifically amplified only to the target species. The method was applied to 29 probiotic products, and the detected results and label claims were compared. Total 23 products were in accordance with the label claims, and the remaining products contained species different from those stated in the label claims. Our method can rapidly and accurately distinguish the L. casei group species in a single reaction. Hence, our assay can be applied to identify L. casei group species from food or environmental samples and to accurately determine the nomenclature of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3agenes 3agenomics 3aprobiotics 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ataxonomy 0aLactobacillus casei group 0aComparative genomics 0aProbiotic products 0aReal-time PCR 0aSpecies-specific primer1 aYang, Seung-Min1 aCho, Eun-Ji1 aKim, Hae-Yeong0 tFood microbiology.g2020 Sept., v. 90 p.103485-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2020.1034853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009700166300001400263520167600277592002801953650002101981650001902002650001202021650002202033650001702055650002402072650002402096650002702120650002402147650002002171650001802191650001502209650001702224650002002241650002202261650001702283650002002300650002502320650001602345650002902361650002602390650003102416650002202447650001802469650001702487653001902504653000902523653001302532653001502545700001702560700001602577700001702593700001702610700001602627773012202643856008502765852000902850655001202859IND60582905220221121012337.0190410e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058290522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Xianbin10aRdreB1BI enhances drought tolerance by activating AQP-related genes in transgenic strawberry  ap. 33-42.  aThe dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB) family of transcription factors is associated with abiotic stress responses during plant growth and development. This study focussed on the subfamily member DREB1B, which was initially described as highly and specifically responsive to low temperature. However, here it is shown that DREB1B is not only involved in cold tolerance but also other abiotic stress tolerances, such as that of drought. To further understand the genetic improvement effects of the drought tolerance provided by RdreB1BI in transgenic strawberry, drought stress responses of transgenic plants were evaluated at the morphological, physiological, and transcriptional levels. Transactivation assays revealed that RdreB1BI could activate the FvPIP2;1 like 1 promoter. RdreB1BI transgenic plants showed enhanced drought tolerance on the basis of lower rates of electrolyte leakage (EL), higher relative water content (RWC), and less stomatal aperture as well as increased peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and less malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. The transgenic plants also accumulated higher levels of drought-related regulatory genes and functional gene transcripts, including those of PIP, NAC, RD22, ABI, and NCED. Together, these results demonstrate that RdreB1BI plays an essential role in the regulation of the drought stress response. DREB1B transcription constitutes a useful strategy to exploit in transgenic plants for coping with abiotic stresses, at least cold and drought stresses. The approach may be helpful for genetic engineering horticultural plants to have increased environmental adaptations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3acold tolerance 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aelectrolytes 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic improvement 3agrowth and development 3ahorticultural crops 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3aperoxidase 3aplant growth 3aregulator genes 3astomatal movement 3astrawberries 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 3atransgenic plants 3awater content 3awater stress 0aDrought stress 0aPIPs 0aRdreB1BI 0aStrawberry1 aGao, Zhihong1 aYan, Yichao1 aWang, Xiuyun1 aQiao, Yushan1 aChen, Yahua0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2017 Oct., v. 119 p.33-42dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001200161245007200173300001200245520121300257592002801470650001501498650002801513650001701541650001501558650001101573650003901584650001701623650001301640650001201653650002301665650002001688650001001708650001501718650005601733650001101789650001301800650002101813650006801834650002901902700001701931700001701948700001601965700001701981700001701998700001302015700001302028773010302041856004502144852000902189655001202198IND4482678120221121034609.0120302e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448267812DNAL7 a221252952pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2011007812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Yu10aAffinity purification of urinary trypsin inhibitor from human urine  ap. 1-6.  aAffinity protocols for the purification of urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) were developed. To imitate the substrate/inhibitor‐binding domain (S1 domain) of trypsin and chymotrypsin, the key amino acid residues were composed to sorbents. The sorbents were then subjected to adsorption analysis with UTI. The purification process consisted of one step of affinity chromatography and another step of ultrafiltration. The purified enzyme was subjected to SDS‐PAGE, trypsin inhibitor activity and peptide map fingerprinting analysis. As calculated, the theoretical maximum adsorption (Qmax) of two affinity sorbents entitled as S‐D‐G and S‐S‐G were 31.7 and 30.1 mg/g, respectively; the desorption constants Kd of the two sorbents were 8.9 and 18.6 μg/mL, respectively. After the separation of UTI with S‐D‐G and S‐S‐G, reducing SDS‐PAGE analysis revealed that the protein was a single polypeptide with the mass of ∼66 kDa, and the purified proteins were ∼95 and 97% pure, respectively; the band on gel was further confirmed with peptide map fingerprinting analysis. Protein and bioactivity recoveries were 1.3 and 75.9% with S‐D‐G, 1.0 and 70.2% with S‐S‐G, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaffinity chromatography 3achymotrypsin 3adesorption 3ahumans 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3atrypsin 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aultrafiltration 3aurine 2aAdsorption 2aChromatography, Affinityxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Weight 2aTrypsin Inhibitorsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxurine. 2aUltrafiltrationxmethods1 aYang, Hailin1 aXiao, Xiaole1 aZhang, Ling1 aZhang, Yuran1 aTong, Yanjun1 aChen, Yi1 aWang, Wu0 tJournal of separation science.g2012 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.1-6dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.201100781  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008200171300001800253520080600271592002801077650001401105650002201119700002401141773012101165856008101286852000901367655001201376IND60621011020221119084203.0181114e199905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062101102DNAL7 a10.1177/000276499219549032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffman, Andrew J.,14aThe Institutional Framing of Policy DebatesbEconomics Versus the Environment  ap. 1368-1392.  aBy framing the economics versus environment debate as a mixed-motive situation, opportunities become visible that allow greater benefits to all interests in the debate. Yet, social, cultural, and institutional arrangements frame how these interests see these opportunities, creating a barrier to mixed-motive analyses. In this article, the authors use an institutional perspective to analyze how the economics versue environment debate emerges from institutions as presently structured. They present an analysis of its present framing based on three aspects of institutions—regulative, normative, and cognitive—and consider the prescriptive implications they expose at the managerial and organizational level of action. The authors conclude with an analysis of possible solutions to overcome them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3aissues and policy1 aVentresca, Marc J.,0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g1999 May, v. 42, no. 8 p.1368-1392dSage PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000276499219549033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006700163300001600230520087100246592002801117650002501145650002301170650001401193650001901207650001101226650001301237650001101250650002101261650002001282650002501302700002101327700001801348700001701366773011901383856008101502852000901583655001201592IND60748157320221120203122.0210820e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074815732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-011-5810-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourret, J.10aThermal conductivity of geomaterial foams based on silica fume  ap. 391-396.  aPorous materials have been prepared from a solution containing sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide with the addition of silica fume.

We previously demonstrated that endothelin-1 (ET-1) induces the expression of lymphangiogenic factors through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α. The stability of these transcriptional factors is essential for lymph/angiogenesis and tumor progression. Here we analyze the molecular mechanism through which ET-1 regulates HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein levels and how these transcriptional factors are implicated in controlling lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) behavior.Using Western blotting assay and a reporter gene containing the HIF-1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain we monitored the capacity of ET-1 to increase HIF-1α and HIF-2α stability and nuclear accumulation. In addition, using siRNA against HIF-1α or HIF-2α, we investigated the implication of these transcriptional factors in ET-1-mediated tube-like structure formation. As HIF-1α proteosomal degradation is controlled by site-specific hydroxylation carried out by HIF-prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes, we analyzed the expression of PHD-2 isoform.We show that ET-1 through its receptor, ETBR, controls HIF-α stability and nuclear accumulation by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylation and reduces PHD2 mRNA and protein levels. Transfection with HIF-1α or HIF-2α siRNA abrogated the capacity of ET-1 to induce tube-like structure formation.These results reveal a PHD2-mediated mechanism through which ET-1 stabilizes HIF-1α and HIF-2α pathway thereby regulating LEC behavior and lymphangiogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aangiogenesis 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelins 3ahumans 3ahydroxylation 3ahypoxia-inducible factor 1 3alymph 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aprocollagen-proline dioxygenase 3aprotein content 3areporter genes 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransfection 0aEndothelin-1 0aProlyl hydroxylases enzymes 0aLymphatic endothelial cells 0aHypoxia-inducible factor 1 0aEndothelin B receptor1 aScappa, Silvia1 aGarrafa, Emirena1 aDi Castro, Valeriana1 aRosano, Laura,1 aBagnato, Anna1 aSpinella, Francesca0 tLife sciences.g2014 Nov. 24, v. 118, no. 2 p.185-190dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2014.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03406naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007800169520178000247592002802027650001902055650001802074650001502092650001702107650001802124650001902142650001902161650001102180650001602191650001402207650001402221650001602235650001002251650001002261650001702271650003002288650002202318650002602340650001502366650001402381650001302395650001802408650001302426650002202439653001502461653001902476653001302495700001302508700001602521700001802537700001602555700001802571700001802589773010202607856008602709852000902795655001202804IND60686606920221116152410.0200503e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068660692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1041042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Hui-Ning10aMild changes in the mucosal microbiome during terminal ileum inflammation  aPatients with inflammation in the terminal ileum have high morbidity. In genetically susceptible hosts, chronic intestinal inflammation targeting the resident intestinal microbiota develops, but the microbial signature of the terminal ileum is poorly studied. To improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying the high prevalence of terminal ileum inflammation, we used 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse the mucosa-associated microbiota of the terminal ileum under intestinal homeostasis and inflammation conditions. Mucosal biopsy is the most commonly used sampling technique for assessing microbial communities associated with the intestinal mucosa. Thirty patients (15 with terminal ileum inflammation and 15 controls) underwent colonoscopy and biopsies were taken from the terminal ileum. Diagnosis depended on a combination of endoscopic and histological factors. To determine the composition and diversity of the microbiota, the 16S rRNA was analysed, and a variety of bioinformatics analyses were performed. Among the patients, composition analysis showed that the most abundant phyla identified in the terminal ileum samples were Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. At the phylum level, the relative proportion of Bacteroidetes was lower in patients with inflammation than in control patients. In addition, there was an increase in the abundance of the phyla Proteobacteria and Lentisphaerae in patients with inflammation. The abundances of the dominant microbes in the terminal ileum were not significantly different between patients in an inflammatory state and controls. These results confirm that partial dysbiosis of the intestinal mucosa-associated microbiota composition is associated with terminal ileum inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aFusobacteria 3aLentisphaerae 3aProteobacteria 3abioinformatics 3abiopsy 3acolonoscopy 3adysbiosis 3ahistology 3ahomeostasis 3ahosts 3aileum 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amorbidity 3apatients 3aribosomal RNA 3asampling 3asequence analysis 0aMicrobiota 0aTerminal ileum 0aBiopsies1 aZhu, Pei1 aLu, Yun-Min1 aGuo, Jing-Hui1 aZhang, Jing1 aQu, Guo-Qiang1 aZhu, Jin-Shui0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 May, v. 142 p.104104-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1041043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245015800203300001800361520144100379592002801820650001301848650002301861650001601884650002401900650001201924650002901936650004801965650001402013650002202027650003802049650002102087650002402108650001602132650001902148650002302167650001602190650002202206650002102228650001902249650000902268650001502277650001202292650002902304650001402333650001402347650000902361650001502370653001502385653001902400653001502419653002602434653002402460653002302484700002102507700002502528700001502553700005702568700001602625773014802641856008002789852000902869655001202878IND60642714020221119024002.0190508e20190422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064271402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b004462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Jinfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6229-376710aTryptophan Supplementation Increases Reproduction Performance, Milk Yield, and Milk Composition in Lactating Sows and Growth Performance of Their Piglets  ap. 5096-5104.  aTryptophan (Trp) can produce bioactive compounds for appetite regulation, calcium mobilization, and mammary gland homeostasis via a serotonin pathway. This study evaluated the effects of Trp supplementation on the reproduction performance, milk yield, and composition of lactating sows, growth performance of their piglets, and the secretion function of porcine mammary epithelial cells (PMECs). The infrared emulsion analyzer and ELISA analyses revealed that feeding sows with a 0.12% Trp addition increased (P < 0.05) sow average daily feed intake, milk yield, milk calcium concentration, average daily gain of piglets, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and lactose synthase (LS), β-casein secretion, intracellular Ca²⁺ level, the expression of calcium binding protein CaM, and the activity of CaMKII. In a cellular experiment of PMECs treated with Trp, ELISA and flow cytometry analyses revealed that the pretreatment of a Trp hydroxylase inhibitor reduced (P < 0.05) FAS and LS synthesis, the intracellular Ca²⁺ level, and the activity of CaMKII. In conclusion, Trp supplementation at 0.12% increased sows’ reproductive performance, milk yield, and calcium concentration and piglets’ growth performance. Milk yield increased by Trp was linked to 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated synthesis of FAS, LS, and β-casein in PMECs, while the increase in calcium concentration was attributed to increasing CaM expression and CAMKII activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3aaverage daily gain 3abeta-casein 3abioactive compounds 3acalcium 3acalcium-binding proteins 3acalcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 3aemulsions 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3afatty-acid synthase 3afeed intake 3aflow cytometry 3agrowth performance 3ahomeostasis 3alactating females 3alactose synthase 3amammary glands 3amilk 3amilk yield 3apiglets 3areproductive performance 3asecretion 3aserotonin 3asows 3atryptophan 0atryptophan 0alactating sows 0amilk yield 0acalcium concentration 0a5-hydroxytryptamine 0agrowth performance1 aAdewole, Deborah1 aLiu, Shangxi,d1964-1 aXi, Panpan1 aYang, Chengbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4449-51321 aYin, Yulong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Apr. 22, v. 67, no. 18 p.5096-5104dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b004463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02009naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010300172300001800275520095300293592002801246650001301274650002001287650002001307650001101327650001001338650001701348650001301365650001201378650001201390650001001402651001201412651001101424773012201435856008101557852000901638655001201647IND60621011320221119084242.0181114e199906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062101132DNAL7 a10.1177/000276499219549302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirsch, Jennifer S.,10aEn el Norte la Mujer MandabGender, Generation, and Geography in a Mexican Transnational Community  ap. 1332-1349.  aThis study explores generational and migration-related changes in gender and marriage in two locations of a transnational community of Mexicans: the sending community in western Mexico and the receiving community in Atlanta. The principal method was life histories, focusing on 13 women in Atlanta and their sisters or sisters-in-law in Mexico; life history informants' mothers and husbands were also interviewed. A generational paradigm shift in marital ideals has occurred, from an ideal of respeto (respect) to one of confianza (trust), characterized by cooperative decision making, heterosociality, a less gendered division of labor in social reproduction, and a new role for marital sexuality. Although women on both sides of the frontera (border) share this companionate ideal, economic opportunities, more privacy, and some legal protection from domestic violence gave women in Atlanta more leverage to push for these companionate marriages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMexicans 3adecision making 3afamily violence 3agender 3alabor 3alife history 3amarriage 3amothers 3asisters 3awomen 3aGeorgia 3aMexico0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g1999 June, v. 42, no. 9 p.1332-1349dSage PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000276499219549303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245010800176300001800284520115900302592002801461650001301489650001001502650001601512650001901528650001301547650001801560700001701578773008701595856009001682852000901772655001201781IND60090435220221119111608.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009043522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Hong-ming10aRole of physicochemical properties of coating ligands in receptor-mediated endocytosis of nanoparticles  ap. 5798-5802.  aA fundamental understanding of the receptor-mediated endocytosis is of great importance in biomedicine. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effect of the properties of coating ligands on the cellular uptake of nanoparticles by using dissipative particle dynamics, and find that the strength of the receptor-ligand interaction, the ligand density and length as well as its rigidity can strongly affect the final equilibrium in the receptor-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, it is found that the particle decorated with longer ligands is more likely to attach to the membrane, while it is harder to be totally engulfed. Increasing the ligand density and rigidity which enhances the uniform distribution of ligands on the particle may lead to the total engulfment. Further, we also show that the particle can be totally engulfed if one can reasonably design the hydrophobic/lipophobic properties of ligands. The present study shows that not only the chemical but also the physical parameters of ligands can govern the nanoparticle–cell interaction, which may give some significant insights into future nanoparticle design in drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3ahydrophobicity 3amedicine 3ananoparticles1 aMa, Yu-qiang0 tBiomaterials.g2012 Aug., v. 33, no. 23 p.5798-5802dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.04.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01251naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245008000211300001600291520032200307592002800629650002800657650002000685650001500705700002600720773008900746856008200835990002300917852000900940655001200949IND60092868620221122061056.0141103e20120302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009286862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.stem.2012.02.0092doi7 aPMC33000702pmcid7 a223856512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasut, Alessandra14aThe Long, the Short, and the Micro: A PolyA Tale of Pax3 in Satellite Cells  ap. 237-238.  aThe use of alternative polyadenylation sites is emerging as an important regulator of gene expression.

The disease leads to extensive losses in commercial aquaculture species, including farmed U.S. catfish. The type III secretion system (T3SS) often contributes to virulence of Gram-negative bacteria. The E. piscicida esaS gene encodes a predicted T3SS export apparatus protein. In the current study, an E. piscicida esaS mutant was constructed and characterized to increase our understanding of the role of T3SS in E. piscicida virulence. Deletion of esaS did not significantly affect biofilm formation and hemolytic activity of E. piscicida, but it had significant effects on expression of hemolysis and T3SS effector genes during biofilm growth. EpΔesaS showed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced virulence in catfish compared to the parent strain. No mortalities occurred in fish infected with EpΔesaS at 6.3 × 10⁵ and 1.26 × 10⁶ CFU/fish compared to 26% mortality in fish infected with wild-type E. piscicida at 7.5 × 10⁵ CFU/fish. Bioluminescence imaging indicated that EpΔesaS invades catfish and colonizes for a short period in the organs. Furthermore, catfish immunized with EpΔesaS at 6.3 × 10⁵ and 1.26 × 10⁶ CFU provided 47% and 87% relative percent survival, respectively. These findings demonstrated that esaS plays a role in E. piscicida virulence, and the deletion mutant has vaccine potential for protection against wild-type E. piscicida infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdwardsiella piscicida 3aGram-negative bacteria 3abiofilm 3abioluminescence 3acatfish 3afarmed fish 3afish diseases 3agenes 3ahemolysis 3aimage analysis 3amortality 3amutants 3atype III secretion system 3avaccines 3avirulence 0aEdwardsiella piscicida 0aVaccine 0aVirulence 0aType III secretion system 0aCatfish 0aAquaculture1 aAbdelhamed, Hossam1 aNho, Seong-Won1 aOzdemir, Ozan1 aKarsi, Attila1 aEssa, Manal1 aLawrence, Mark L.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2020 June, v. 143 p.104108-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.1041083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001800167245008800185300001800273500000900291520102000300592002801320650001901348650001801367650001201385650001101397650001201408650001901420650001101439650002001450650002001470650001201490773012401502852000901626856009701635655001201732991611126970742620221121105211.0191122e197311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490072012DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1973.00021962006500060050x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Glen M.10aUse of Energy-Absorbing Materials to Permit Turf Growth in Heavily Trafficked Areas  ap. 1004-1005.  aepub  aSoil compaction, with leaf abrasion of secondary importance, was concluded to be primarily responsible for the inability of grass to survive in heavily travelled footpaths. Several materials were used in the construction of a grassed walk designed to absorb traffic energy, eliminate compaction and afford wear protection to intermingled grasses. Inverted Coke bottles, bricks, and crushed stone were the experimental materials. The growth of the p i s s was best in the bottle area. However, the bottles were slippery when wet and presented some hazard. Orientation of the bricks to direction of traffic was found to be important. Bricks perpendicular to direction of travel were much more satisfactory than those placed parallel. ‘Manhattan’ perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and ‘Merion,’ ‘Pennstar,’ ‘Nugget,’ and Fylking' bluegrasses (Poa pratensis L.) were evaluated as a mixture in these trials. An excellent sod was maintained with the bricks and bottles but not with the crushed stone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aPoa pratensis 3abottles 3abricks 3agrasses 3alawns and turf 3aleaves 3aman-made trails 3asoil compaction 3atraffic0 tAgronomy journal.g1973 Nov., v. 65, no. 6 p.1004-1005dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1973.00021962006500060050x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle
