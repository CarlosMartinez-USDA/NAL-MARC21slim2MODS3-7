Our findings suggest that glaciation of the central mountains of the South Island during the last ice age have had a major impact on the evolution of the South Island cushion Raoulia species in New Zealand. However, simple hypotheses accounting for the effect of Pleistocene climate change are insufficient to explain patterns of endemism in the group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aglaciation 3aindigenous species 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amountains 3apopulation 3aNew Zealand1 aBreitwieser, I.1 aWard, J.

Notably, these xylanase and cellulase activities were enhanced by xylan (1.4 and 5.8-fold, respectively) and cellulose (1.1 and 3.5-fold, respectively), which indicated the hemicellulosic/cellulosic substrate-inducible lignocellulolytic activities of this strain. The complete genome of B. velezensis ZY-1-1 comprises of 3,899,251 bp in a circular chromosome with a G + C content of 46.6%. Among the predicted 3688 protein-coding genes, 24 genes are involved in the degradation of lignocellulose and other polysaccharides, including 8, 7 and 2 critical genes for the degradation of xylan, cellulose and lignin, respectively. This genome-based analysis will facilitate our understanding of the mechanism underlying the biodegradation of lignocellulose and the biotechnological application of this novel lignocellulolytic bacteria or related enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data  a31501634cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a30671404cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0202000cNational Key R&D Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aHolotrichia (Coleoptera) 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3acellulose 3achromosomes 3adigestive system 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme substrates 3agenes 3agenomics 3alarvae 3alignin 3alignocellulases 3alignocellulose 3anucleotide sequences 3axylan 3axylanases1 aRaza, Muhammad Fahim1 aZheng, Ziqiang1 aZhang, Xuhao1 aDong, Xinxin1 aZhang, Hongyu0 t3 Biotech.g2018 Nov., v. 8, no. 11 p.465-465dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-018-1490-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002600181245010700207300001800314506007600332520147700408592002801885506003701913650002201950650002601972650001701998650002702015650002002042650001002062650001102072650001102083650001202094650001602106650006402122650001402186650003002200650006202230650005702292650001702349650006002366650005602426650002402482651001202506651001002518651001202528653001602540653003602556653002302592653002002615653002602635700002102661773010202682856007402784852000902858655001202867IND60115106520221207084937.0150202e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011510652DNAL7 a228998292pmid7 aPMC34891492pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcs1822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilas, Julia Sánchez10aDo plants adjust their sex allocation and secondary sexual morphology in response to their neighbours?  ap. 1471-1478.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and aims Changes in the sex allocation (i.e. in pollen versus seed production) of hermaphroditic plants often occur in response to the environment. In some homosporous ferns, gametophytes choose their gender in response to chemical cues sent by neighbours, such that spores develop as male gametophytes if they perceive a female or hermaphrodite nearby. Here it is considered whether a similar process might occur in the androdioecious angiosperm species Mercurialis annua , in which males co-occur with hermaphrodites; previous work on a Spanish population of M. annua found that individuals were more likely to develop as males at high density. Methods Using a novel approach to treat plants with leachate from pots containing males or hermaphrodites of M. annua , the hypothesis that individuals assess their mating opportunities, and adjust their sex expression accordingly, was tested through an exchange of chemical cues through the soil. Key Results For the population under study, from Morocco, no evidence was found for soil-signal-dependent sex expression: neither sex ratios nor sex allocation differed among experimental treatments. Conclusions The results imply either that the Moroccan population under study behaves differently from that previously studied in Spain (pointing to potential geographical variation in plasticity for sex expression), or that our method failed to capture the signals used by M. annua for adjustment of sex expression.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMercurialis annua 3aferns and fern allies 3agametophytes 3ageographical variation 3ahermaphroditism 3amales 3apollen 3aspores 2aBiomass 2aEnvironment 2aEuphorbiaceaexchemistryxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Exudatesxchemistry 2aPlant Rootsxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPollenxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aReproduction 2aSeedlingsxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSeedsxchemistryxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSignal Transduction 3aMorocco 3aSpain 0aMorocco 0aAndrodioecy 0aenvironmental sex determination 0aenvironmental cues 0ahermaphroditism 0aphenotypic plasticity1 aPannell, John R.0 tAnnals of botany.g2012 Nov., v. 110, no. 7 p.1471-1478dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs1823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03829naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163100002900172245011500201300002000316500002400336500001500360520178400375650003002159650001402189650001102203650001702214650002502231650002002256650002502276650001702301650002502318650002302343650002602366650001902392650002002411650002002431650002402451650001102475650001202486650001702498650001602515650003102531650004402562650002302606650001602629650003002645650003702675650002202712651001502734651001502749653002602764700001902790700002302809700002302832773013302855852000902988856007502997930003303072945002503105946001303130655001203143IND4441420320221122034257.0100820e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444142032DNAL7 a221271732pmid7 a10.1603/EN092882doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aB2001 aStavrinides, Menelaos C.10aPlant Water Stress, Leaf Temperature, and Spider Mite (Acari: Tetranychidae) Outbreaks in California Vineyards  ap. 1232–1241.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe evaluated the relationships between plant water status and leaf temperature, and between leaf temperature and spider mite (Acari: Tetranychidae) and predatory mite (Acari: Phytoseiidae) populations in eight vineyards in California in 2006 and 2007. Temperature of south-facing leaves increased significantly by 0.8°C for every 1.0°C increase in ambient air temperature, and by 5.3°C for every one MPa drop in leaf water potential. Peak population densities of Pacific spider mite, Tetranychus pacificus McGregor, increased significantly with increasing frequency of leaf temperatures above 31°C. In contrast, peak population densities of Willamette spider mite, Eotetranychus willamettei (McGregor), showed no relationship with the frequency of leaf temperatures above 31°C. This differential relationship between the two mite species and high leaf temperatures is consistent with their upper thresholds for development, which are 40°C for T. pacificus and 31°C for E. willamettei, as identified in a previous study. Predatory mite population densities showed no relationship with peak population densities of either spider mite species during the analysis period, but decreased with the frequency of leaf temperatures above 31°C. In addition, predatory mite population densities were significantly higher on south-facing than interior leaves after adjusting for the effect of leaf temperature. These results help to explain why outbreaks of T. pacificus occur in warmer or water-stressed vineyards, whereas E. willamettei develops higher populations in cooler or well-irrigated vineyards. In addition, these results suggest that regulated deficit irrigation should be implemented with caution, especially in those vineyards with a high risk of T. pacificus outbreaks. 3aEotetranychus willamettei 3avineyards 3agrapes 3aPhytoseiidae 3adevelopmental stages 3aair temperature 3apredatory arthropods 3awater stress 3aleaf water potential 3adeficit irrigation 3aTetranychus pacificus 3aVitis vinifera 3anatural enemies 3aarthropod pests 3apopulation dynamics 3aleaves 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aDehydration 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aPlant Leavesxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aPopulation Density 2aTemperature 2aTetranychidaexphysiology 2aVitisxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aWaterxphysiology 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aplant-water relations1 aDaane, Kent M.1 aLampinen, Bruce D.1 aMills, Nicholas J.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2010 Aug., v. 39, no. 4 p.1232–1241-1232–1241dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN092883Available from publisher's Web site  a20101110b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/30  aOther US 7aarticle01646naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245010600166300001600272520064400288592002800932650001400960650001500974651002200989651001201011651001201023653001501035653001601050653002101066653002401087653001701111773009401128856007701222852000901299655001201308IND60520415020221121024821.0160520e20130731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052041502DNAL7 a10.2478/pbj-2013-00362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzeląg, Zbigniew,10aTaxonomic and Nomenclatural Notes on Hieracium Tomosense (Asteraceae), A Neglected Carpathian Endemic  ap. 359-362.  aHieracium tomosense Simk., a mountain forest species known to date only from the Piatra Mare Mts in the Southern Carpathians, Romania, has been found in other parts of the Southern and Eastern Carpathians.

The name H. tomosense is lectotypified by a specimen stored at the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest (BP).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHieracium 3alectotypes 3aCarpathian region 3aHungary 3aRomania 0aAsteraceae 0aCarpathians 0adistribution map 0aHieracium tomosense 0atypification0 tPolish Botanical Journal.g2013 July 31, v. 58, no. 1 p.359-362dVersitax2084-43527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/pbj-2013-00363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094024002200119024001900141040001800160100002200178245009100200300001600291506007600307520154200383592002801925506003701953650002001990650002702010650000902037650002702046650001702073650001402090650002002104650001302124650002202137650001602159700001602175700001902191700002402210773010502234856007102339852000902410655001202419IND60137839620221207134120.0150524e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013783962DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.39012doi7 aPMC44079242pmcid7 a251861052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinning, Rachel R10aSusceptibility to Bt proteins is not required for Agrotis ipsilon aversion to Bt maize  ap. 601-606.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Although Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize has been widely adopted in diverse regions around the world, relatively little is known about the susceptibility and behavioral response of certain insect pests to Bt maize in countries where this maize is not currently cultivated. These are important factors to consider as management plans are developed. These factors were investigated for Agrotis ipsilon, a global pest of maize, with Cry1F and Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1 maize. RESULTS: Agrotis ipsilon demonstrated an initial, post‐ingestive aversive response to Cry1F maize. Development and mortality were also affected – survival on Cry1F maize tissue was 40% and weight gain of survivors of Cry1F exposure was significantly reduced. A post‐ingestive aversive response was also seen for Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1 maize; however, longer‐term feeding, weight gain and survival were not affected. CONCLUSION: Agrotis ipsilon showed aversion to both Bt treatments. Aversion to Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1 maize was unexpected because these proteins have no known insecticidal effect against Lepidoptera; however, results confirm that this aversion was temporary and did not affect growth or development. The Cry1F results suggest that A. ipsilon will abandon Cry1F maize in the field before any selection for resistance. These data support the use of refuge to delay Cry1F resistance development in A. ipsilon populations. © 2014 The Authors.

The targeted alkylation sites were lysines, in which T1 lipase possessed 11 residues. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of both native and alkylated enzyme showed a similar broad minimum between 208 and 222 nm, thus suggesting a substantial amount of secondary structures in modified enzyme, as compared with the corresponding native enzyme. The hydrolytic activity of the modified enzymes dropped drastically by nearly 15-fold upon chemical modification, despite both the native and modified form showed distinctive α-helical bands at 208 and 222 nm in CD spectra, leading us to the hypothesis of formation of a molten globule (MG)-like structure. As cooperative unfolding transitions were observed, the modified lipase was distinguished from the native state, in which the former possessed a denaturation temperature (T m) in lower temperature range at 61 °C while the latter at 68 °C. This was further supported by 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) probed fluorescence which indicated higher exposure of hydrophobic residues, consequential of chemical modification. Based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis, a small number of lysine residues were confirmed to be alkylated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeobacillus 3aacids 3aalkylation 3adenaturation 3afluorescence 3ahydrophobicity 3aionization 3alasers 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atriacylglycerol lipase 2aCircular Dichroism 2aGeobacillusxenzymology 2aLipasexmetabolism1 aLeow, Thean Chor1 aRahman, Raja Noor Zaliha Raja Abd1 aMahiran Basri,1 aRahman, Mohd Basyaruddin Abdul1 aAbu Bakar Salleh,1 a, 0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 June, v. 164, no. 3 p.362-375dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-010-9140-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015400160500001900314500002000333520171100353592002802064596015502092650002202247650002502269650001702294650001602311650001302327650002402340650001502364650002102379650001602400650001802416650001802434650001202452650002202464650002102486650001902507700002402526700006202550773012702612856007402739852000902813655001202822IND60734759320221119065139.0210422e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073475932DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.136432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdhikary, Maria10aFlavonoid‐rich wheatgrass (Triticum aestivum L.) diet attenuates diabetes by modulating antioxidant genes in streptozotocin‐induced diabetic rats  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWheatgrass, young germinated shoots of Triticum aestivum L., is proclaimed as antidiabetic nutraceutical by traditional medicines across the world. In this study, the effects of the wheatgrass diet in ameliorating oxidative stress (OS) induced during diabetes were investigated. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) and in vitro antioxidant activity of wheatgrass extract were estimated at different days (5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15) after germination. Correlating the TPC and TFC with in vitro antioxidant activity, 9th DAG wheatgrass was found to possess maximum antioxidant potential. UHPLC‐MS/MS analysis also revealed the presence of nine flavonoids. For in vivo studies, diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in Wistar rats fed with a high‐fat diet. Concomitant administration of 9th‐day wheatgrass diet (200 and 400 mg/kg) for 60 days exhibited significant improvements in hyperglycemia, body weight, lipid profile, biochemical indices (AST, ALT, GSH, GPx), and restoration of tissue architectures equivalent to normal rats. Further, qRT‐PCR‐based expression profiling revealed a significant modulation of major antioxidant marker genes and insulin gene which substantiated that the wheatgrass diet is effective in reducing OS during diabetes. Therefore, flavonoid‐rich 9th‐day wheatgrass could be used as a functional food to control diabetes. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The present research supported that wheatgrass protects against oxidative stress and therefore could be utilized to ameliorate diabetes. The findings may contribute to the development and formulation of wheatgrass‐based functional food or dietary supplement for diabetes by nutraceutical industries.  aPublisher supplied data  a[F1‐17.1/2015‐16/MANF‐2015‐17‐JHA‐58235/(SA‐III)].cUniversity Grants Commission of India (UGC) through Maulana Azad National Fellowship 3aTriticum aestivum 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abody weight 3adiabetes 3adietary supplements 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3agermination 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperglycemia 3ainsulin 3alipid composition 3aoxidative stress 3astreptozotocin1 aMukhopadhyay, Kunal1 aSarkar, Biswatrish1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4268-301X0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.e13643-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.136433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245021300176300001400389520106300403592002801466650003101494650001201525650001201537650001701549650002001566650003101586650001501617650001701632650001801649650001601667650002801683650002201711650001901733650001101752650002101763650002901784650001601813653000801829653000701837653000701844653000801851653000701859653000901866653000901875653001901884653001201903653003101915653001901946653002901965700001501994700001902009700001802028700001802046700001802064700001702082700001402099700001402113773010402127856008702231852000902318655001202327IND60536670920221122133701.0190409e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053667092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Elaine,d1954-10aCombination of RNA sequencing and metabolite data to elucidate improved toxic compound tolerance and butanol fermentation of Clostridium acetobutylicum from wheat straw hydrolysate by supplying sodium sulfide  ap. 77-86.  aSodium sulfide (SS) was added to the non-detoxified wheat straw hydrolysate for ABE fermentation by Clostridium acetobutylicum CICC8012. Biochemical measurements demonstrated that supplementation with SS promoted earlier and enhanced conversion of acid to ABE and led to a 27.48% improvement in sugar consumption, a 20.48% improvement in the sugar-based ABE yield, a 47.63% improvement in the butanol titer, and a 53.50% improvement in the ABE concentration. The response of C. acetobutylicum CICC8012 at the mRNA level was examined by a transcriptional analysis performed with RNA sequencing. The expression of genes involved in the membrane transport of carbohydrates, glycolysis, and ABE formation increased following SS-supplemented fermentation, whereas the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in acid formation decreased, which indicates that supplemental SS affected the central fermentative pathway, down-regulated the metabolic flux toward the acid formation branches, and up-regulated the metabolic flux toward the ABE formation branches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3abutanol 3aenzymes 3afermentation 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aglycolysis 3ahydrolysates 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3aphysiological transport 3asequence analysis 3asodium sulfide 3asugars 3atoxic substances 3atranscription (genetics) 3awheat straw 0aABE 0aSS 0aCM 0aHMF 0aPE 0aFPKM 0aKEGG 0aSodium sulfide 0aButanol 0aClostridium acetobutylicum 0aRNA sequencing 0aTranscriptional analysis1 aFang, Yang1 aHuang, Mengjun1 aSun, Jiaolong1 aHuang, Yuhong1 aGao, Xiaofeng1 aLi, Renqiang1 aHe, Kaize1 aZhao, Hai0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Dec., v. 198 p.77-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245022000162300001600382500002000398520142300418592002801841650002701869650001401896650002501910650001601935650001401951650001301965650002001978650001001998650001802008650001202026650001302038650002102051650003202072650001802104650001402122650001602136700002002152700002002172700001902192700001902211700001602230773013302246856007402379852000902453655001202462IND60572005720221122155829.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057200572DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.123592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Myoung‐Sug10aEffects of Vitamin E with Different Levels or Sources of Dietary Lipid on the Growth and Expression of Inflammatory, Oxidative Stress, and Apoptotic Genes in the Head Kidney of Olive Flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus  ap. 518-530.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study has assessed the effects of vitamin E (−E, +LE, +HE; 0, 100, 1000 mg/kg, respectively) in fish diets containing high levels (HL; 10%) of fish oil (FO) or mixed vegetable oils (VO) on the growth and inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptotic gene expression in the head kidney of olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. Consequently, the highest weight gain was achieved in the FO group and the lowest in the HL‐VO + LE group. The gene expression levels of each group were compared to the 5% FO group. The 5% VO group showed higher expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, interleukin (IL)‐1β, and scinderin‐like (ScinL) genes. Although lysozyme gene expression was higher in the HL‐VO + LE group, the other gene expression levels of the HL‐FO/VO + LE groups were not different from those of the FO group. The HL‐FO/VO−E/+HE groups showed a higher TNFα gene expression, but the cytochrome oxidase subunit III gene expression was higher in the HL‐FO−E and HL‐VO + HE groups. Lysozyme gene expression was higher in the HL‐FO−E and HL‐VO−E/+HE groups. IL‐6 and ScinL gene expression were higher in the HL‐VO‐E and HL‐VO + HE groups, respectively. In conclusion, mixed VO and too high or too low vitamin E levels in fish diets may affect inflammatory, oxidative stress, and apoptotic gene expression in the head kidney of olive flounder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aapoptosis 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adietary fat 3afish oils 3aflounder 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3alysozyme 3aoxidative stress 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avegetable oil 3avitamin E 3aweight gain1 aHur, Deok‐Hwe1 aLee, Sang‐Min1 aJeoung, Eunhee1 aJeong, Hyun Do1 aHong, Suhee0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.518-530dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.123593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001300150245015000163300001400313520144900327592002801776650001501804650001901819650002301838650002601861650001201887650001601899650002201915650000901937650001901946650001501965650001101980700001901991773009802010856008602108852000902194655001202203IND4461893920221118040454.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446189392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2010.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVega, E.10aEffects of overgrazing and rainfall variability on the dynamics of semiarid banded vegetation patterns: A simulation study with cellular automata  ap. 70-77.  aThe effects of factors acting at small scale (grass/grass and grass/shrub biological interactions) and landscape scale (overgrazing and rainfall changes) on the development and permanence of banded vegetation patterns (VB) are assessed with a spatially explicit cellular automaton model. In particular, the influence of two environmental factors that are changing in many VB arid lands (rainfall and grazing pressures) is studied. Three rainfall regimes (representing 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 times the long-term rainfall average), five grazing intensities, two types (reversible and irreversible) of grazing disturbance, two grazing periodicities (chronic and pulse), two levels of grass colonization ability, positive and negative interactions between shrubs and grasses, and the efficiency of endozoochorous seed dispersal are simulated. The results show that the permanence of undisturbed VB depends on the interaction of two factors, rainfall regime and grass colonization ability. Type and intensity of grazing also modify VB cover and permanence; furthermore, long-term overgrazing may convert mixed grass/shrub plant communities to pure scrublands dominated by endozoochorous-dispersed shrubs due to competitive interactions between shrubs and grasses. Besides providing an adequate representation of the systemâs dynamics, the model is a useful tool that may be used to explore the consequences of climate change on management scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3acolonizing ability 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasses 3aovergrazing 3aplant communities 3arain 3aseed dispersal 3ashrublands 3ashrubs1 aMontaÃ±a, C.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2011 Jan., v. 75, no. 1 p.70-77dElsevier Ltdx0140-19637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2010.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010500179300001600284520160400300592002801904650003601932650002101968650001901989650001202008650001002020650001402030650002602044650003902070650001502109650001002124650001002134650002402144650001302168650001502181650001602196650003102212700001202243700002102255773009802276856008102374852000902455655001202464IND60572620820221122221143.0171006e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057262082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10886-017-0836-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiron-Calva, Patricia Sarai10aVolatile-Mediated Interactions between Cabbage Plants in the Field and the Impact of Ozone Pollution  ap. 339-350.  aPlants constitutively release volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but qualitatively and quantitatively alter their emission of VOCs in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The blend of VOCs emitted reflects the physiological status of the plant. Plants may be exposed to the VOC blend emitted by their near neighbors and gain information that allows them to adjust their own defenses. These plant-plant interactions may potentially be exploited to protect crops from pests, but they can be disturbed by abiotic factors making the process sensitive to environmental perturbation. Despite numerous studies describing plant-plant interactions, relatively few have been conducted with agriculturally significant cultivated plant varieties under field conditions. Here we studied plant-plant interactions in a conspecific association of Brassica oleracea var. capitata (cabbage) and show that undamaged plants exposed to neighbors damaged by the herbivore Pieris brassicae are primed for stronger volatile emissions upon subsequent herbivore attack. We conducted a field study in an ozone free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) facility with ambient and elevated ozone levels and found that elevated tropospheric ozone significantly alters the priming of VOCs in receiver plants. We conclude that plant-plant interactions may prime defensive attributes of receiver plants under field conditions, but are impaired by ozone pollution. Therefore, when planning the manipulation of plant-plant interactions for agricultural purposes, the potential effects of atmospheric pollutants should be considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica oleracea var. capitata 3aPieris brassicae 3aabiotic stress 3acabbage 3acrops 3aemissions 3aenvironmental factors 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3aherbivores 3aozone 3apests 3aphysiological state 3aplanning 3apollutants 3atroposphere 3avolatile organic compounds1 aLi, Tao1 aBlande, James D.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2017 Apr., v. 43, no. 4 p.339-350dSpringer USx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-017-0836-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03803naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245012200153500001900275500002000294520196500314592002802279596005302307596012702360596011402487650002002601650002802621650001902649650001402668650001902682650001702701650001102718650002102729650002002750650001202770650002002782650002202802650004302824650001502867650001002882650002202892650001702914700002102931700002202952700001902974700001202993700005803005773012703063856007403190852000903264655001203273IND60734759520221119065339.0210422e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073475952DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.136852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Hao10aProtective effect of fermented Diospyros lotus L. extracts against the high glucose‐induced apoptosis of MIN6 cells  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDate plum persimmon (Diospyros lotus L.) is a fruit crop from the Ebenaceae family. Its microorganism‐fermented extract (DPEML) was shown to exhibit a hypoglycemic effect in our previous work. Here, we investigated the effects of DPEML fermented by Microbacterium flavum YM18‐098 and Lactobacillus plantarum B7 on the high glucose‐induced apoptosis of MIN6 cells and explored its potential cell protective mechanisms. DPEML ameliorated the apoptosis of MIN6 cells cultured under high glucose conditions, thereby improving cell viability. DPEML upregulated the Bcl‐2/Bax mRNA ratio to obstruct an intrinsic apoptotic pathway and concomitantly downregulated the expression of the apoptosis‐linked proteins, AIF, and Cyt‐C, in high glucose‐induced MIN6 cells. Furthermore, DPEML promoted the insulin secretion of MIN6 cells grown under chronically high‐glucose conditions by upregulating Ins mRNA expression. In summary, our study suggested that DPEML is a promising functional food for the development of therapeutics for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

In this study, a single-atom iron electrocatalyst with exclusively Fe–N₄ moieties anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanorods (denoted as Fe–SA/NCS) is synthesized through a one-step pyrolysis of Fe-doped zeolitic imidazole framework-8 (ZIF8) nanorods that are synthesized in an aqueous system without acid leaching assistance. Profiting from the synergistic effect of the hierarchically porous carbon support with a rodlike structure and the large number of Fe–N₄ moieties, the newly prepared Fe–SA/NCS exhibits excellent ORR catalysis activities with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V vs RHE in 0.1 M KOH as well as 0.77 V vs RHE in 0.1 M HClO₄. Furthermore, better stability in alkaline or acid conditions was also observed for Fe–SA/NCS compared with Pt/C. The high open-circuit voltage of 1.53 V and high power density of 141.6 mW cm–² of a zinc–air battery (ZAB) with Fe–SA/NCS as the cathode material indicate excellent electrochemical performances. The ZAB with the Fe–SA/NCS catalysts exhibits a remarkable cycling performance for more than 300 h with a high voltaic efficiency of 78.6%. The present work could pave the way for the rational construction of highly efficient and stable single-atom electrocatalysts through green synthesis for sustainable energy technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3agreen chemistry 3aimidazole 3ananorods 3apyrolysis 3arenewable energy sources 3asynergism 0azeolitic imidazole framework 0acarbon nanorods 0agreen synthesis 0asingle-atom iron electrocatalyst 0aoxygen reduction reaction1 aYang, Chen1 aWang, Xiaogang1 aZhu, Hongwei1 aCao, Lijuan1 aChen, Anyong1 aGu, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7504-031X1 aZhang, Qinghua1 aZheng, Lirong1 aLiang, Han-Pu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5476-61970 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 30, v. 9, no. 1 p.137-146dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c055093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245014300163300001400306520153900320592002801859650002901887650002201916650002001938650002401958650001301982650001001995650002502005650001902030650001702049653002902066653002202095653002002117653002402137653001802161653001802179653002202197700001802219700002102237700002102258700001902279700001802298773012302316856008002439852000902519655001202528IND60520661420221118012558.0160522e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052066142DNAL7 a10.1515/prolas-2015-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrauda, Dace10aAmber Particles as Living Plant Cell Markers in Flow Cytometry / Dzintara Daļiņas Kā Dzīvu Augu Šūnu Marķieri Plūsmas Citometrijā  ap. 77-81.  aThe unique biological properties of amber are well known. Amber particles that penetrate into the cellular matrix can potentially be used as markers of plant cell biological activity by identification of living cells in flow cytometry. However, there have been no studies on effect of amber particles on plant cells. The aim of this study was to determine effect of amber nano- and micro- (5 nm⁻³ μm) particles on somatic and gametic cells and to assess the possibility to use amber particles as alive plant cells markers. To reach the aim, fluorescence of cells was determined in the presence of amber particles, and amber components - spirit of amber and sodium succinate dibasic hexahydrate. Cell fluorescence was measured using a BD FACSJazz® cell sorter for several plants species (Argyranthemum frutescens, Cyclamen persicum, Hordeum vulgare and Linum usitatissimum) with and without treatment of amber. Differences between a control cell group (without amber treatment) and treated cell group with amber particles depended on plant species. The presence of amber components (alcohol soluble amber fraction and sodium succinate) in cultivation media mostly had no influence on cell fluorescence. The study showed that amber particles (size 5 nm⁻³ μm) can be used as living plant cell markers, as the presence of amber particles in plant cell cultivation media resulted in substantially increased plant cell fluorescence in all investigated species, and there was no detrimental effect of amber particles on plant cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgyranthemum frutescens 3aCyclamen persicum 3aHordeum vulgare 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aalcohols 3aamber 3abioactive properties 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 0aArgyranthemum frutescens 0aCyclamen persicum 0aHordeum vulgare 0aLinum usitatissimum 0asomatic cells 0agametic cells 0acell fluorescence1 aBumbure, Lada1 aĻašenko, Inga,1 aKatashev, Alexei1 aDekhtyar, Yuri1 aRashal, Isaak0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 69, no. 3 p.77-81dDe Gruyter Openx1407-009X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/prolas-2015-00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04153naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009600165300001600261500001500277520267200292592002802964650001702992650001103009650001303020650002103033650001203054650001203066650003203078650001003110650002203120650002103142650001303163651001303176651001303189653002203202653001503224653001603239653002203255653001803277653002303295700002203318700003103340700002803371700002303399773013103422856008503553852000903638655001203647IND50070848920221123002557.0190403e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007084892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVlam, Mart10aUnderstanding recruitment failure in tropical tree species: Insights from a tree-ring study  ap. 108-116.  a2019-12-06  aMany tropical tree species have population structures that exhibit strong recruitment failure. While the presence of adult trees indicates that appropriate regeneration conditions occurred in the past, it is often unclear why small individuals are absent. Knowing how, when and where these tree species regenerate provides insights into their life history characteristics. Based on tree age distributions inferences can be made on past forest dynamics and information is obtained that is important for forest management. We used tree-ring analyses to obtain tree ages and reconstruct >200years of estimated establishment rates in a sparsely regenerating population of Afzelia xylocarpa (Fabaceae), a light-demanding and long-lived canopy tree species. We sampled all 85 Afzelia trees >5cm diameter at breast height (dbh) in a 297-ha plot in a seasonal tropical forest in the Huai Kha Khaeng (HKK) Wildlife Sanctuary, western Thailand. The age distribution of the sampled Afzelia trees revealed two distinct recruitment peaks centred around 1850 and 1950. The presence of distinct age cohorts provides a strong indication of disturbance-mediated recruitment. Additionally we found three lines of evidence supporting this interpretation. (1) Similarly aged trees were spatially aggregated up to ∼500m, a scale larger than single tree-fall gaps. (2) High juvenile growth rates (5–10mmdbhyear−1) of extant small and large trees indicate that recruitment took place under open conditions. (3) A significant positive correlation between tree age and local canopy height indicates that trees recruited in low-canopy forest patches. Likely causes of these severe canopy disturbances include windstorms and ground fires, which are common in the region. In addition, successful establishment seems to be favoured by wetter climate conditions, as the estimated establishment rate was correlated to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Thus, the co-occurrence of canopy disturbance and favourable climatic conditions may provide a window of opportunity for Afzelia establishment. Our results indicate that forest patches with occurrence of large Afzelia trees have undergone high-severity canopy disturbance prior to establishment, suggesting that these disturbances have shaped forests at HKK. Tree-ring analyses provide a powerful tool to understanding tropical tree establishment patterns. Rare, high-severity canopy disturbances may play a key role in the regeneration of long-lived tropical canopy tree species with recruitment failure, potentially in interaction with climate variability to determine variation in establishment success over decades or centuries.  aPublisher supplied data 3alife history 3acanopy 3atree age 3atropical forests 3aAfzelia 3adrought 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aforest management 3aclimatic factors 3awildlife 3aThailand 0aThailand 0aAfzelia xylocarpa 0aAge cohort 0arecruitment 0aTree regeneration 0aDendroecology 0aCanopy disturbance1 aBaker, Patrick J.1 aSarāyut Bunyawētchīwin,1 aMohren, Godefridus M.J.1 aZuidema, Pieter A.0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 312 p.108-116dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011900168300001600287520100800303592002801311650001401339650001001353650001401363650001201377650001101389650002001400650004401420650001101464650001301475650000901488650001501497650001501512650001501527650001101542650001501553653001801568653002301586653002201609653001101631653001601642700001601658700001201674700002001686700002001706700001801726700001901744773010601763856008701869852000901956655001201965IND60536671120221121053427.0190409e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053667112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Shunni10aLuxury uptake of phosphorus changes the accumulation of starch and lipid in Chlorella sp. under nitrogen depletion  ap. 165-171.  aThe aim of this research was to study the effect of phosphorus supply on starch and lipid production under nitrogen starvation using Chlorella sp. as a model. High phosphate level had marginal effect on cell density but increased biomass growth. Massive phosphorus was assimilated quickly and mainly stored in the form of polyphosphate. The algal cells ceased phosphorus uptake when intracellular phosphorus reached a certain level. 5mM phosphate in the culture rendered a 16.7% decrease of starch synthesis and a 22.4% increase of lipid synthesis relative to low phosphate (0.17mM). It is plausible that phosphate can regulate carbon partitioning between starch and lipid synthesis pathway by influencing ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity. Moreover, high phosphate concentration enhanced the abundance of oleic acid, improving oil quality for biodiesel production. It is a promising cultivation strategy by integration of phosphorus removal from wastewater with biodiesel production for this alga.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3aalgae 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acarbon 3afuel production 3aglucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3astarch 3awastewater 0aChlorella sp. 0aNitrogen depletion 0aPhosphorus uptake 0aStarch 0aFatty acids1 aWang, Yajie1 aXu, Jin1 aShang, Changhua1 aWang, Zhongming1 aXu, Jingliang1 aYuan, Zhenhong0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Dec., v. 198 p.165-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003200113040001800145100002700163245012000190300001500310520084400325592002801169650002201197650001601219650002401235650001901259650001901278650001401297650002101311650002001332650001601352650001501368650001901383650002701402773009401429852000901523856011201532856007901644961001301723655001201736IND4438963420221120043247.0200506e20100225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443896342DNAL7 a10113/426782hdl7 a10.3897/zookeys.37.3112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuffington, Matthew L.12aA revision of Ganaspidium Weld, 1952 (Hymenoptera, Figitidae, Eucoilinae): new species, bionomics, and distribution  ap. 81-101.  aThe New World eucoiline genus Ganaspidium is revised.

The following new species are described: Ganaspidium didionae, G. eldiablo, G. flemingi, G. kolmaci, and G. konzaensis. Ganaspidium navajoe (Miller), comb. n., is recognized as junior synonym of G. pusillae Weld (syn. n.). Ganaspidium nigrimanus (Kieffer) and G. utilis Beardsley are removed from synonymy, and together with G. hunteri (Crawford), are now in Banacuniculus Buffington. Species of Ganaspidium are recorded from a wide geographic area within North America, and several species appear to be adapted to arid environments. New distribution data, new host records, and a key to known species are provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsect morphology 3aparasitoids 3ataxonomic revisions 3aredescriptions 3ainsect ecology 3aFigitidae 3anew host records 3anew combination 3anew species 3aEucoilidae 3ataxonomic keys 3anew geographic records0 tZooKeys.g2010 Feb. 25, v. 37 p.81-101dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/426783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.37.3113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02761naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100006000154245011300214300001600327520137300343592002801716650001601744650001401760650001701774650002501791650001901816650001501835650001301850650001901863650001701882651001901899653002701918653001701945653002301962653001901985653002402004700002502028700002202053700005902075773009502134856008902229852000902318655001202327IND60622838220221122120820.0190410e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062283822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.11.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlusáček, Petr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3194-931010aRe-development of a former military training area—The case of Brdy told from a local actors’ perspective  ap. 147-157.  aMilitary training areas (MTAs) are special spatial units. Closed and inaccessible for the general public, they have been shaped by long-term military use of various potential type and intensity. Following the suspension of operation, some MTAs fell derelict and buildings and infrastructures on it become brownfields. Local municipalities will have strong interests and will care about the re-development options – either in utilising potentials or in preventing competitions. We take a Czech example and use in-depth semi-structured interviews to investigate the how local actors perceived and influenced the re-development perspectives of the former MTA Brdy, Czech Republic. This case is interesting, because international and national politics in as much as different groups of local stakeholders played significant roles in creating opportunities and for holding or pushing a re- or new development on the military brownfield land. Next to the results of the qualitative interviews with local stakeholders, we include analysis of available statistical data and information about the case study municipalities. Our contribution gives an insightful investigation about the role that local actors played in determining new uses of the former MTA in uncertain and unstable socio-economic and political conditions typical for post-communist and developing countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrownfields 3abuildings 3acase studies 3adeveloping countries 3ainfrastructure 3ainterviews 3apolitics 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3aCzech Republic 0aQualitative interviews 0aLocal actors 0aMilitary geography 0aCzech Republic 0aMilitary brownfield1 aMartinát, Stanislav1 aKrejčí, Tomáš1 aBartke, Stephan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1528-30500 tLand use policy.g2019 Mar., v. 82 p.147-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.11.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245025600163300001400419520113300433592002801566650001701594650002601611650001701637650001601654650001601670650001801686650002101704650002001725650001101745653003601756653002501792653003401817653001901851653002101870700002201891700002201913700001801935700001801953773012301971856008002094852000902174655001202183IND60520661520221118012625.0160522e20150930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052066152DNAL7 a10.1515/prolas-2015-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrauda, Dace10aCombined Effects of 50 Hz Electromagnetic Field and SiO2 Nanoparticles on Oxidative Stress in Plant’s Gametic Cells / Zemfrekvences (50 Hz) Elekromagnētiskā Lauka Un SiO2 Nanodaļiņu Kombinētā Ietekme Uz Augu Gametisko Šūnu Oksidatīvo Stresu  ap. 82-86.  aThe paper presents the results of combined effects of an extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (50 Hz) (ELF EMF) and SiO₂ nanoparticles on fluorescence of plant gametic cells (immature microspores). The data were recorded by a BD FACSJazz® cell sorter after cell irradiation by blue laser (488 nm). A significant difference of fluorescence was observed between gametic cells after 1 hour incubation in suspension of SiO₂ nanoparticles and the control gametic cells. It was observed that fluorescence intensity of gametic cell was higher with ELF EMF treatment in comparison to control cells, but it was statistically significant only for cells treated with electromagnetic radiation field with density 100 μT (ρ < 0.01) and 400 μT (ρ < 0.01). A different effect of ELF EMF were observed in cells incubated in SiO₂ nanoparticle suspension; interaction of the factors resulted in lower cell fluorescence in comparison to control cells. The present study showed that SiO₂ nanoparticles may be a source of oxidative stress, but jointly with 50 Hz electromagnetic field they can serve as an efficient antioxidant  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aelectromagnetic field 3afluorescence 3airradiation 3amicrospores 3ananoparticles 3aoxidative stress 3aplants (botany) 3asilica 0a50 Hz electromagnetic radiation 0aimmature microspores 0asilicon dioxide nanoparticles 0aflow cytometry 0aoxidative stress1 aKolodynski, Anton1 aBelogrudova, Inta1 aBumbure, Lada1 aRashal, Isaak0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 69, no. 3 p.82-86dDe Gruyter Openx1407-009X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/prolas-2015-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014100167300001600308520099500324592002801319650001301347650001101360650001201371650001201383650001301395650002801408650001001436650001601446650002201462650001101484653001701495653001501512653001101527653002801538653001101566653001701577653001701594653003201611653001001643653001501653700002301668700003301691700002301724700002601747773009601773856008501869852000901954655001201963IND60573695220221119144515.0170724e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057369522DNAL7 a10.1080/13235818.2017.12794742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaux, Felix10aGeometric morphometric analysis reveals that the shells of male and female siphon whelks Penion chathamensis are the same size and shape  ap. 194-201.  aSecondary sexual dimorphism can make the discrimination of intra and interspecific variation difficult, causing the identification of evolutionary lineages and classification of species to be challenging, particularly in palaeontology. Yet sexual dimorphism is an understudied research topic in dioecious marine snails. We use landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis to investigate whether there is sexual dimorphism in the shell morphology of the siphon whelk Penion chathamensis . In contrast to studies of other snails, results strongly indicate that there is no difference in the shape or size of shells between the sexes. A comparison of P. chathamensis and a related species demonstrates that this result is unlikely to reflect a limitation of the method. The possibility that sexual dimorphism is not exhibited by at least some species of Penion is advantageous from a palaeontological perspective as there is a rich fossil record for the genus across the Southern Hemisphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMollusca 3adioecy 3afemales 3afossils 3ageometry 3ainterspecific variation 3amales 3amorphometry 3asexual dimorphism 3asnails 0aBuccinulidae 0aconchology 0afossil 0ageometric morphometrics 0amating 0apaleontology 0areproduction 0asecondary sexual dimorphism 0asnail 0atrue whelk1 aCrampton, James S.1 aMarshall, B.

In this study, a large pilot-scale AnMBR was constructed and the microbial community development of the anaerobic digested sludge in the AnMBR was determined during the treatment of municipal wastewater. The AnMBR system was conducted for 217 days during a long-term operation with the feed of real municipal wastewater. The characterization and dynamics of the microorganisms revealed that a stable prokaryotic community was gradually achieved. In the community of methane-producing archaea (or methanogens), the acetotrophic methanogen Methanosaeta was significantly enriched at an ambient temperature of 25 °C with an overwhelming relative abundance in the entire community. The abundance of Methanosaeta was even higher than the most abundant bacterial phyla Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. This phenomenon is quite different from that found in other typical anaerobic systems. The massive enrichment of methanogens is the key to maintaining stable methane production in the treatment of municipal wastewater by the AnMBR. The interspecies cooperation of major functional bacterial groups including protein/carbohydrate/cellulose-degrading (genera Anaerovorax, Aminomonas, Levilinea, Flexilinea and Ruminococcus etc.), sulfate-reducing (Desulfovibrio and Desulfomicrobium etc.) and syntrophic (Syntrophorhabdus and Syntrophus etc.) bacteria with acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic archaea enhances the stability of reactor operation and help to acclimate the entire prokaryotic community to the characteristics of real municipal wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAminomonas 3aAnaerovorax 3aBacteroidetes 3aChloroflexi 3aDesulfomicrobium 3aDesulfovibrio 3aMethanosaeta 3aRuminococcus 3aSyntrophus 3aambient temperature 3acarbon 3acommunity development 3amembrane bioreactors 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3amunicipal wastewater 3asludge 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aAnMBR 0aMunicipal wastewater 0aMicrobial community 0aMethanogens 0aFunctional groups1 aLi, Lu1 aWu, Jiang1 aRong, Chao1 aWang, Tianjie1 aChen, Rong1 aSano, Daisuke1 aLi, Yu-You0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 20, v. 813 p.152643-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245016000163300001600323500002000339520171500359592002802074650001802102650002602120650002402146650001202170650001202182650001402194650002402208650001602232650000902248650001602257650001402273650001502287650001502302650001002317650001202327650001402339650001102353650001802364651001702382700002402399700002302423773013302446856007402579852000902653655001202662IND60572006220221122054719.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057200622DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.124042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, Fernanda S.10aPhosphorus Budget in Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture Systems with Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, and Amazon River Prawn, Macrobrachium amazonicum  ap. 402-414.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIntegrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems are designed mainly for efficient use of resources. Substrates added to aquaculture ponds provide space for periphyton to settle and recover nutrients, making these nutrients available to the species being reared. The present study is centered on the phosphorus budget, analyzing the main ecological compartments of IMTA systems in earthen ponds stocked with Amazon River prawn, Macrobrachium amazonicum, and Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, with or without different added substrates. The experimental design was completely randomized, with three treatments (without a substrate, with a geotextile fabric substrate, and with a bamboo substrate) and four replications. Phosphorus entered the systems mainly in tilapia feed (ca. 50–61%), inlet water (ca. 17–27%), and fertilizer (ca. 6–7%). Input of phosphorus from other compartments ranged from 1.5 to 1.9%. Most phosphorus was accumulated at the pond bottom as sediment (ca. 60–68%) and fish biomass (ca. 18–26%), or discharged in the outlet water (ca. 7–10%). Feeding is the main driver for the distribution of phosphorus in the ponds. Levels of phosphorus retained in reared animals (20–28%) were higher in these IMTA systems than in tilapia and prawn monocultures (reported as 10–20% and 10–13%, respectively). Nonetheless, the present data showed that the addition of different types of substrates might not improve the recovery of phosphorus in animal biomass as initially supposed. Even so, these IMTA systems decreased the amount of phosphorus released in effluents, and this decrease was enhanced by the addition of substrates, reducing the impact on the receiving waterbodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrobrachium 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquaculture systems 3abamboos 3abiomass 3aeffluents 3aexperimental design 3afertilizers 3afish 3ageotextiles 3anutrients 3aperiphyton 3aphosphorus 3aponds 3arearing 3asediments 3ashrimp 3asurface water 3aAmazon River1 aProença, Danilo C.1 aValenti, Wagner C.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.402-414dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.124043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03952naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001600158245012200174300001600296520210200312592002802414650002102442650001202463650000902475650002202484650001302506650001102519650001402530650001102544650003902555650002202594650001902616650002502635650004902660650001702709650001602726650003502742650002602777650001802803650003302821650000902854650001302863650002402876650002202900650004102922650003302963650003002996700001603026700001803042700001503060700001703075773018803092856007303280852000903353655001203362IND50089779220221120104653.0150206e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008977922DNAL7 a244948002pmid7 a10.1111/lam.122272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRebroš, M.10aBiocatalysis with Escherichia coli‐overexpressing cyclopentanone monooxygenase immobilized in polyvinyl alcohol gel  ap. 556-563.  aThis is the first reported study on the immobilization of living recombinant Escherichia coli cells that overexpress cyclopentanone monooxygenase in polyvinyl alcohol gel particles LentiKats®. Immobilized cells overexpressing cyclopentanone monooxygenase have been used as a model of biocatalyst for enantioselective Baeyer–Villiger biooxidation of rac‐bicyclo[3.2.0]hept‐2‐en‐6‐one into regioisomeric lactones. This process is useful for the syntheses of cytostatic sarkomycin, several prostaglandins and other biologically active compounds. The original technique for qualitative analysis of enzyme expression within free cells and cells entrapped in LentiKats®using SDS‐PAGE was developed and used for verification of optimal conditions for the induction of cyclopentanone monooxygenase. Here, we successfully performed six repeated batch Baeyer‐Villiger biooxidations utilizing entrapped cells using 40% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol gel particles in flasks with baffles. The latter conditions have been found to be the most appropriate achieving optimal oxygen transfer within LentiKats®. Moreover, immobilized cells retained their catalytic efficiency over six reaction cycles, while the catalytic efficiency of free cells decreased after three reaction cycles. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Immobilization in polyvinylalcohol gel particles is desirable technique with presumptive impact on industrial applications of recombinant whole‐cell Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases as biocatalysts for production of bioactive compounds and precursors of potentially new drugs. An original immobilization of cells E. coli with overproduced Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase improved their stability in repetitive batch biooxidations as compared to free cells. Detected autoinduction of recombinant enzyme in pET22b+ plays significant role in application of immobilized cells as it may increase specific activity of cells in repetitive use under growing reaction conditions. Original technique for qualitative analysis of enzyme expression within immobilized cells was developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aenzymes 3agels 3aimmobilized cells 3alactones 3amodels 3anew drugs 3aoxygen 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aprostaglandins 3aqualitative analysis 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aBiocatalysis 2aBioreactors 2aCells, Immobilizedxenzymology 2aComamonasxenzymology 2aCulture Media 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aGels 2aLactones 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygenxchemistry 2aOxygenasesxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aPolyvinyl Alcoholxchemistry 2aTransformation, Bacterial1 aLipták, L.1 aRosenberg, M.1 aBučko, M.1 aGemeiner, P.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2014 June, v. 58, no. 6 p.556-563dPublished for the Society for Applied Bacteriology by Blackwell Scientific Publications [c1985-]-x0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lam.122273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012500168300001600293500001900309520115700328592002801485650002101513650002501534650002001559650002001579650002001599650001901619650002601638650001901664650002101683650001601704653002101720653002201741653002101763653002301784700006101807700001601868700002201884700002001906773014101926856008502067852000902152655001202161IND60723050720221122202615.0210111e20201222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072305072DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c060592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkuda, Kohei10aNonbrittle Nanocomposite Materials Prepared by Coprecipitation of TEMPO-Oxidized Cellulose Nanofibers and Hydroxyapatite  ap. 158-167.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOrganic–inorganic nanocomposites were prepared by crystallization of hydroxyapatite in an aqueous dispersion of cellulose nanofibers. The addition of aqueous calcium chloride to an aqueous dispersion of cellulose nanofibers and disodium hydrogen phosphate yielded white precipitates, in which hydroxyapatite and cellulose nanofibers were hybridized in a weight ratio of ca. 70:30. Uniaxial pressing at 120 °C and 120 MPa of the nanocomposite powder afforded the compressed nanocomposite blocks. A three-point bending test revealed that the nanocomposite had a bending strength of up to 57 MPa and an elastic modulus of up to 4.1 GPa. The mechanical properties increased as the coprecipitation temperature was increased up to 70 °C. A further increase in temperature to 90 °C resulted in the reduction of bending strength. After the bending test, the compressed nanocomposites did not break in half. The fracture surface showed fibrous structures of ca. 140 μm long, indicating that cellulose nanofibers are aggregated to form a fibrous structure of submillimeter length, and the formation of the aggregates contributed to the nonbrittle fracture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium chloride 3acellulose nanofibers 3acoprecipitation 3acrystallization 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroxyapatite 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananocomposites 3asodium phosphate 3atemperature 0ahybrid materials 0abiomineralization 0abending strength 0afracture mechanism1 aMizutani, Tadashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4482-264X1 aHirota, Ken1 aHayashi, Takayuki1 aZinno, Kazuhito0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 22, v. 9, no. 1 p.158-167dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c060593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01971naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001800146245009200164300001600256520080600272592002801078650001101106650002101117650001101138650001701149650000901166650002801175650002001203650001201223650001701235650001301252650005201265700001501317700001501332700001601347700001601363773010301379856008201482852000901564655001201573IND4471768320221120113845.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447176832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2011.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, R.10aExpression of Nephrin, Podocin, α-Actinin-4 and α3-Integrin in Canine Renal Glomeruli  ap. 220-225.  aThe biological features of podocytes that contribute to the pathogenesis of proteinuria have not been investigated in dogs.

These species were summer cultivated and autumn incorporated in experiment 1; in experiment 2, overwintered brassicaceous cover crops were spring incorporated. Experiment 3 involved determination of effects of metconazole application on biomass/glucosinolate production by B. juncea and R. sativus and on PCN pre‐ and post‐incorporation. Glucosinolate contents were determined before incorporation. Following cover crop incorporation, field plots were planted with susceptible potatoes to evaluate the biofumigation effects on PCN reproduction. RESULTS: In experiment 1, PCN population post‐potato harvest was reduced (P = 0.03) in B. juncea‐treated plots, while R. sativus prevented further multiplication, but in experiment 2 there were no significant effects on PCN reproduction. In experiment 3, B. juncea or R. sativus either untreated or treated with metconazole reduced PCN populations. Glucosinolate concentrations varied significantly between different plant regions and cultivation seasons. Metconazole application increased the sinigrin concentration in B. juncea tissues. Glucosinolate concentrations correlated positively with PCN mortality for summer‐cultivated brassicaceous plants. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that B. juncea and R. sativus green manures can play an important role in PCN management, particularly if included in an integrated pest management scheme. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aEruca vesicaria subsp. sativa 3aGlobodera pallida 3aRaphanus sativus 3aautumn 3abiofumigation 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3acover crops 3acyst nematodes 3afield experimentation 3agreen manures 3aintegrated pest management 3amortality 3aplanting 3apotatoes 3areproduction 3asinigrin 3aspring 3asummer 3atissues 3aviability1 aHaydock, Patrick PJ1 aWoods, Simon1 aBack, Matthew A0 tPest management science.g2015 May, v. 71, no. 5 p.759-769dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.38493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245018700172300001400359520102200373592002801395650001301423650001101436650002901447650001701476650001701493650002601510650001401536650001801550650000901568650002001577650001801597650002001615650001301635650000901648653001401657653001701671653001601688653002001704653001101724700002001735700001701755700001801772700001801790700001401808700001901822700002001841773010401861856008701965852000902052655001202061IND60536671520221121052616.0190409e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053667152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Jianguang14aThe comparison of the migration and transformation behavior of heavy metals during pyrolysis and liquefaction of municipal sewage sludge, paper mill sludge, and slaughterhouse sludge  ap. 16-22.  aMunicipal sewage sludge, paper mill sludge, and slaughterhouse sludge were pyrolyzed and liquefied for the production of bio-char. The migration and transformation behavior of Cu, Cr, and Zn during pyrolysis and liquefaction of these sludges were studied. Pyrolysis and liquefaction promoted mobile fraction (F1 and F2) to stable fraction (F3 and F4). The results showed that pyrolysis and liquefaction largely affected the redistribution of Cu and Zn in raw materials. The environmental risk assessment results indicated that the environmental risk levels of Cu and Zn were significantly reduced in bio-char, and risk level of Cr was slightly decreased after pyrolysis or liquefaction. Both pyrolysis and liquefaction were promising detoxification technologies for the three sludges in terms of the mitigation of heavy metals toxicity. It was suggested that dewatered sludge could be reduced toxicity/risk before utilization by pyrolysis or liquefaction technology, especially for Cu and Zn in slaughterhouse sludge.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3acopper 3aenvironmental assessment 3aheavy metals 3aliquefaction 3apulp and paper sludge 3apyrolysis 3araw materials 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asewage sludge 3aslaughterhouses 3atoxicity 3azinc 0aPyrolysis 0aLiquefaction 0aHeavy metal 0aRisk assessment 0aSludge1 aYuan, Xingzhong1 aLeng, Lijian1 aHuang, Huajun1 aJiang, Longbo1 aWang, Hou1 aChen, Xiaohong1 aZeng, Guangming0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Dec., v. 198 p.16-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245016500161300001600326520134800342592002801690650002801718650001601746650001001762650001601772650001001788650001801798650001101816650001801827650001901845650002801864650003001892650001401922650001201936700001601948700001201964700001801976700001701994773008202011856008102093852000902174655001202183IND60556259020221121023225.0161031e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055625902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-016-1382-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Xiue10aAmino acid mutations in the env gp90 protein that modify N-linked glycosylation of the Chinese EIAV vaccine strain enhance resistance to neutralizing antibodies  ap. 814-822.  aThe Chinese EIAV vaccine is an attenuated live virus vaccine obtained by serial passage of a virulent horse isolate (EIAVL) in donkeys (EIAVD) and, subsequently, in donkey cells in vitro. In this study, we compare the env gene of the original horse virulent virus (EIAVL) with attenuated strains serially passaged in donkey MDM (EIAVDLV) and donkey dermal cells (EIAVFDDV). Genetic comparisons among parental and attenuated strains found that vaccine strains contained amino acid substitutions/deletions in gp90 that resulted in a loss of three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, designated g5, g9, and g10. To investigate the biological significance of these changes, reverse-mutated viruses were constructed in the backbone of the EIAVFDDV infectious molecular clone (pLGFD3). The resulting virus stocks were characterized for replication efficiency in donkey dermal cells and donkey MDM, and were tested for sensitivity to neutralization using sera from two ponies experimentally infected with EIAVFDDV. Results clearly show that these mutations generated by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in cloned viruses with enhanced resistance to serum neutralizing antibodies that were also able to recognize parental viruses. This study indicates that these mutations played an important role in the attenuation of the EIAV vaccine strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid substitution 3aamino acids 3aasses 3ablood serum 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3ahorses 3alive vaccines 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3avirulence 3aviruses1 aZhang, Ping1 aYu, Wei1 aXiang, Wenhua1 aLi, Xiaodong0 tVirus genes.g2016 Dec., v. 52, no. 6 p.814-822dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1382-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245012600157300001600283500001500299520172300314592002802037650002002065650001202085650001802097650003202115650001002147650002002157650002502177650002102202650001602223650003102239650001202270650002502282650001502307650001302322650001302335650001102348650002302359650001202382650002002394653001702414700001802431700002102449773010402470856007102574852000902645655001202654IND60137840420221122145210.0150524e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013784042DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.38512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, Rimaljeet10aInduced resistance by oxidative shifts in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) following Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) herbivory  ap. 770-782.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND: Oxidative responses in leaves, developing seeds and the pod wall of nine pigeonpea genotypes were investigated against Helicoverpa armigera feeding. Out of nine genotypes, four were moderately resistant, three were intermediate and two were moderately susceptible genotypes. RESULTS: A significant shift in the oxidative status of pigeonpea following herbivory was depicted by the upregulation of diamine oxidase (DAO), polyamine oxidase (PAO) and lipoxygenase 2 (LOX 2) activities. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity was significantly higher in the infested pod wall and leaves of moderately resistant genotypes than in those of moderately susceptible genotypes. H. armigera infestation markedly enhanced phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activities in wounded tissues. The decline in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and ascorbate content was lower in moderately resistant genotypes than in moderately susceptible genotypes. A significant decrease in LOX 3 activity was also observed in the infested pod wall of moderately resistant and intermediate genotypes. A lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline content of the infested pod wall and developing seeds was observed. Higher activities of PPO, PAL and proline content in leaves of uninfested moderately resistant genotypes could either be an unrelated observation or alternatively could help in identifying H. armigera‐resistant genotypes. CONCLUSION: The increase in activities of PPO, DAO, PAO, PAL and TAL and higher proline and lower MDA content upon herbivory suggested their integrated contribution in providing resistance to pigeonpea against H. armigera. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3apest management 3aammonia 3aCajanus cajan 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aseeds 3amalondialdehyde 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatechol oxidase 3apigeon peas 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aproline 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aherbivores 3atyrosine 3agenotype 3aleaves 3ainduced resistance 3atissues 3adiamine oxidase 0alipoxygenase1 aGupta, Anil K1 aTaggar, Gaurav K0 tPest management science.g2015 May, v. 71, no. 5 p.770-782dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.38513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011100163300001600274520117200290592002801462650002201490650002101512650002501533650001001558650001001568650001101578650001401589650001201603650001901615650001401634650001201648650002201660650002901682650001501711650002201726700001301748700001601761700001301777700001601790700001701806773008201823856008101905852000901986655001201995IND60556259120221121023332.0161031e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055625912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-016-1366-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQu, Hongren10aInfluenza A Virus-induced expression of ISG20 inhibits viral replication by interacting with nucleoprotein  ap. 759-767.  aInfluenza A virus (IAV) is an important pathogen that has a wide range of hosts and represents a threat to the health of humans and several animal species. IAV infection can induce the transcription of many genes in the host. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that three different strains of H1N1 IAV induce the expression of an IFN-stimulated gene, ISG20. We determined the antiviral activity of ISG20 against IAV because ISG20 inhibited viral protein expression and reduced the progeny viral titer dependent upon its exonuclease activity. To elucidate the detailed mechanism of ISG20, we further demonstrated that ISG20 impairs the polymerase activity and inhibits both the replication and transcription levels of the M1 and NP genes. Notably, we identified that ISG20 colocalizes and interacts with NP during IAV infection, while exonuclease-inactive mutant ISG20 lacked association with NP, indicating that ISG20 inhibits IAV replication by interacting with NP. Together, these data provide a detailed explanation for the specific antiviral action of ISG20 and suggest that ISG20 may act as a promising antiviral drug candidate against IAV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3agenes 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3amutants 3anucleoproteins 3apathogens 3aprogeny 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviral load 3avirus replication1 aLi, Jing1 aYang, Limin1 aSun, Lei1 aLiu, Wenjun1 aHe, Hongxuan0 tVirus genes.g2016 Dec., v. 52, no. 6 p.759-767dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1366-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245018000154300001600334520145600350592002801806650003001834650001401864650001701878650002101895650001701916650002701933650001101960650001401971650002601985650001202011650001702023651001102040700001902051700002202070773010402092856007102196852000902267655001202276IND60137840520221122145222.0150524e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013784052DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.38332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScott, Ian M10aInsecticide resistance and cross‐resistance development in Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) populations in Canada 2008–2011  ap. 712-721.  aBACKGROUND: A survey of insecticide resistance in over 150 Canadian populations of Colorado potato beetle was completed between 2008 and 2011. Three neonicotinoid and two anthranilic diamide insecticides were tested at a discriminating concentration (DC) with second‐instar larvae in a leaf‐disc bioassay. RESULTS: The mean mortality for the imidacloprid (Admire) DC was 46–67% between 2008 and 2011 respectively. Over the 4 years, 10–46% and 26–40% of the populations were classified as resistant or showed reduced susceptibility to imidacloprid. The mean mortality for thiamethoxam (Actara) and clothianidin (Poncho/Titan) ranged from 56–76% in 2008 to 81–84% in 2010 for each insecticide respectively, indicating continuous susceptibility to clothianidin but reduced susceptibility to thiamethoxam. In 2008 and 2009, susceptibility to chlorantraniliprole (Coragen) was observed in 85% of populations. Similarly, cyantraniliprole (Cyazypyr) affected 93% of the 2009 and 74% of the 2010 populations. There was a significant (P < 0.05) and high positive correlation (R = 0.4–0.84) between the three neonicotinoids, indicating the potential for cross‐resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The trend observed in decreasing susceptibility for thiamethoxam and clothianidin will continue unless resistance management practices are followed. © 2014 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Pest Management Science © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3abioassays 3aclothianidin 3across resistance 3aimidacloprid 3ainsecticide resistance 3alarvae 3amortality 3aresistance management 3asurveys 3athiamethoxam 3aCanada1 aTolman, Jeff H1 aMacArthur, Dale C0 tPest management science.g2015 May, v. 71, no. 5 p.712-721dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.38333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01735naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245017800177300001600355520039600371592002800767650001500795650000900810650001500819650001400834650002100848650001100869650001400880650001100894650001900905651001300924653001700937653001400954653001600968653001400984653001400998653002001012700003201032700001701064700001801081773009601099856008501195852000901280655001201289IND60573695720221119144555.0170724e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057369572DNAL7 a10.1080/13235818.2017.13184602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsmail, Mohamad Hanif10aRediscovery of Ellobium scheepmakeri (Petit De La Saussaye, 1850) (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Ellobiidae), a rare ellobiid in Bukit Belimbing mangrove forest, Peninsular Malaysia  ap. 222-226.  aThe ellobiid Ellobium scheepmakeri (Petit de la Saussaye, 1850) is reported from the banks of the Selangor River estuary, 57 years after it was first collected in Peninsular Malaysia.

The genetic conservation of tree species is an urgent global necessity as forest conversion and fragmentation continue apace, damaging insects and pathogens are transported between continents, and climate change alters local habitat suitability. Effective and efficient genetic conservation of tree species presents a substantial challenge because of the lack of basic information about many species, inadequate resources, and a historical lack of coordination within and between conservation sectors. Several cooperative efforts are already under way and are achieving conservation success, but much work remains. The Gene Conservation of Tree Species—Banking on the Future workshop in 2016 enabled the exchange of information and the creation of collaborations among tree conservation stakeholders. Several key themes emerged during the meeting’s presentations and dialogue, which are further explored in this paper. In situ conservation of species is the long-term goal and is often the most efficient approach for preserving the genetic diversity of many forest tree species. Whether existing reserves adequately protect species and are sufficient for future conservation needs is uncertain. Ex situ conservation is an important complement to in situ efforts, acting as an insurance measure against extinction, providing material for restoration, enabling additional research opportunities, and educating the public. Networks of botanic gardens, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations must continue to coordinate ex situ and in situ efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of tree conservation efforts. Assessing and prioritizing which species and populations require genetic conservation and prioritizing among them is a critical need. Two key tree restoration needs are for wider dissemination of planting stock, particularly stock with resistance to insects and pathogens, and for specific silvicultural prescriptions that facilitate restoration efforts.

Experiments were conducted on rocky or sandy substrate throughout the spring and summer months. Trials consisted of single fish, paired conspecifics or round goby/logperch pairs with weight change determined after 28 days. The round gobies were able to outcompete and/or negatively affect logperch on rocky substrates as a direct result of round goby/logperch interactions, as logperch fared well when round gobies were excluded from the enclosures. Although there is evidence that round gobies exclude logperch from rocky substrates, the logperch population remains close to pre‐invasion levels in the predominantly soft‐bottomed harbour. The continued coexistence of the logperch with the round goby is attributed to the vastly greater area of soft‐bottom vs. rocky substrate in the harbour, with the round gobies in the soft bottom younger and smaller than those in the rocky substrate. Recent evidence suggests that the round goby population is declining on the soft substrates indicating that the two populations will continue to coexist in the harbour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aNeogobius melanostomus 3aPercina caprodes 3aPetromyzon marinus 3afish 3aindigenous species 3ainterspecific competition 3ainvasive species 3aspring 3asummer 3aLake Superior1 aMensinger, Allen F.0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2017 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.34-41dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0906-66917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.122473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245007700171300001600248500001500264520178000279592002802059650001102087650001102098650001002109650001802119650001102137650000902148650001402157650002102171650001002192650001402202650000902216650001402225650001302239650001902252653001502271653000702286653000802293653000702301653000802308653000702316653002702323653001602350653000802366653002002374653000702394653001902401653001602420653001502436700001702451700001602468773011602484856008502600852000902685655001202694IND50070849620221123015242.0190403e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007084962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenturas, Martin14aThe reproductive ecology of Ulmus laevis Pallas in a transformed habitat  ap. 170-178.  a2019-12-06  aFrom a life-cycle perspective seed dispersal is a key factor for population dynamics. However, little is known on seed dispersal mechanisms in riparian hydrochorous and anemochorous canopy tree species. We studied Ulmus laevis Pallas reproductive biology in a human transformed population with lack of recruitment, during three consecutive years, in order to evaluate the species’ recovery capabilities. We investigated fruit release timing and rates, and how these are affected by meteorological variables with generalized linear models. Seed production, dispersal distances, dispersal patterns and predation rates were evaluated with inverse modeling. Results show that the stand did not suffer from source limitation, in the fecundity sense. Despite samaras being winged nuts, wind did not disperse these long distances, as 95% of full samaras land at less than 30m from the mother tree. We did not observe secondary dispersal in this stand. Therefore, we hypothesize that for this species water may be responsible for long distance dispersal, and wind would be effective in short distance dispersal. This coupled system would increase efficiency in seed arrival at appropriate habitats for colonization, at both short and long distance scale. Empty samara production and the proportion of these in relation to full samaras are important for diminishing pre- and post-dispersal predation rates. Our results also shed light on how human-induced changes in water-table and river regulation may affect seed dispersal and recruitment in riparian forests. Finally, U. laevis short-term conservation measures are discussed, while long term conservation requires natural hydrological regimes restoration so as to facilitate seed transport and deposition in adequate microsites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3afruits 3aUlmus 3alinear models 3arivers 3awind 3afecundity 3ariparian forests 3atrees 3ahydrology 3anuts 3apredation 3ahabitats 3aseed dispersal 0aAnemochory 0aBA 0aSSM 0aPS 0aDBH 0aFS 0aHabitat transformation 0arecruitment 0aSRR 0aDispersal kenel 0aES 0aSeed dispersal 0aRecruitment 0aHydrochory1 aNanos, Nikos1 aGil, Luís,0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 312 p.170-178dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2013.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245017400160300001600334520130300350592002801653650002701681650001401708650001201722650001701734650001101751650001101762650002001773650002601793650001701819651001201836700002201848700003101870700002101901773012201922856007102044852000902115655001202124IND60137840620221122120244.0150524e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013784062DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.38552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavalle, Sandrine10aProtection of winter wheat against orange wheat blossom midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae): efficacy of insecticides and cultivar resistance  ap. 783-790.  aBACKGROUND: In 2012 and 2013, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin) flights occurred during the susceptible phase of wheat development in Belgium. The protection against this midge afforded by various insecticides was assessed in infested fields on four winter wheat cultivars (susceptible or resistant, and early or late heading). RESULTS: The insecticides sprayed at the right time reduced the number of larvae in the ears by 44–96%, depending on the product. For Julius, the cultivar (cv.) most exposed to S. mosellana in 2013, the mean yield gain resulting from insecticide use was 1558 kg ha⁻¹(18%). In the same year, insecticide use resulted in a yield gain of 780 kg ha⁻¹(8%) for the cv. Lear, in spite of its resistance to this pest. The link between yield and number of larvae counted in the ears was a logarithmic relationship, suggesting an important reduction in yield, caused either by the damage inflicted by young larvae that died at the start of their development or by the activation of costly reactions in plants. CONCLUSION: The study showed that, in cases of severe attack, the timely application of insecticide treatments can protect wheat against S. mosellana, and that even resistant cultivars can benefit from these treatments. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitodiplosis mosellana 3acultivars 3aheading 3ainsecticides 3alarvae 3amidges 3apest resistance 3apesticide application 3awinter wheat 3aBelgium1 aCensier, Florence1 aSan Martin y Gomez, Gilles1 aDe Proft, Michel0 tPest management science.g2015 May, v. 71, no. 5 p.783-790dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.38553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012900173300001600302520137700318592002801695650002201723650002001745650001301765650001001778650001001788650001001798650003701808650001101845650001401856650001401870650001301884650001901897650001401916650001201930650001801942650000901960650003301969650002302002650001202025651001002037700002002047700001802067700001702085700002102102700002602123700002002149773008202169856008102251852000902332655001202341IND60556259320221121023114.0161031e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055625932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-016-1369-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElgendy, Emad Mohamed10aGenetic characterization of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses isolated from naturally infected pigeons in Egypt  ap. 867-871.  aAvian influenza viruses impose serious public health burdens with significant mortality and morbidity not only in poultry but also in humans. While poultry susceptibility to avian influenza virus infection is well characterized, pigeons have been thought to have low susceptibility to these viruses. However, recent studies reported natural pigeon infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses. In Egypt, which is one of the H5N1 endemic areas for birds, pigeons are raised in towers built on farms in backyards and on house roofs, providing a potential risk for virus transmission from pigeons to humans. In this study, we performed genetic analysis of two H5N1 virus strains that were isolated from naturally infected pigeons in Egypt. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that these viruses originated from Egyptian H5N1 viruses that were circulating in chickens or ducks. Several unique mutations, not reported before in any Egyptian isolates, were detected in the internal genes (i.e., polymerase residues PB1-V3D, PB1-K363R, PA-A369V, and PA-V602I; nucleoprotein residue NP-R38K; and nonstructural protein residues NS1-D120N and NS2-F55C). Our findings suggested that pigeons are naturally infected with H5N1 virus and can be a potential reservoir for transmission to humans, and showed the importance of genetic analysis of H5N1 internal genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aavian influenza 3achickens 3aducks 3afarms 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amutation 3anucleoproteins 3aphylogeny 3apigeons 3apublic health 3arisk 3aviral nonstructural proteins 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 3aEgypt1 aWatanabe, Yohei1 aDaidoji, Tomo1 aArai, Yasuha1 aIkuta, Kazuyoshi1 aIbrahim, Madiha Salah1 aNakaya, Takaaki0 tVirus genes.g2016 Dec., v. 52, no. 6 p.867-871dSpringer USx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-016-1369-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04188naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245009600158500002000254520191600274592002802190596003002218596005202248596004602300596004702346596004802393596004702441596005302488650002002541650002502561650001902586650001502605650001102620650002502631650001202656650001502668650001502683650001002698650001502708650002202723650001602745650001702761650004402778650001902822650001402841650001702855650002002872700001602892700002302908700001902931700002002950700005802970700002203028700001803050700001803068700006003086700005803146700005903204700006003263773010903323856007303432852000903505655001203514IND60790645020221119182248.0220826e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079064502DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.1792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFudyma, Jane D.10aUntargeted metabolomic profiling of Sphagnum fallax reveals novel antimicrobial metabolites  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSphagnum mosses dominate peatlands by employing harsh ecosystem tactics to prevent vascular plant growth and microbial degradation of these large carbon stores. Knowledge about Sphagnum‐produced metabolites, their structure and their function, is important to better understand the mechanisms, underlying this carbon sequestration phenomenon in the face of climate variability. It is currently unclear which compounds are responsible for inhibition of organic matter decomposition and the mechanisms by which this inhibition occurs. Metabolite profiling of Sphagnum fallax was performed using two types of mass spectrometry (MS) systems and ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H NMR). Lipidome profiling was performed using LC‐MS/MS. A total of 655 metabolites, including one hundred fifty‐two lipids, were detected by NMR and LC‐MS/MS—329 of which were novel metabolites (31 unknown lipids). Sphagum fallax metabolite profile was composed mainly of acid‐like and flavonoid glycoside compounds, that could be acting as potent antimicrobial compounds, allowing Sphagnum to control its environment. Sphagnum fallax metabolite composition comparison against previously known antimicrobial plant metabolites confirmed this trend, with seventeen antimicrobial compounds discovered to be present in Sphagnum fallax, the majority of which were acids and glycosides. Biological activity of these compounds needs to be further tested to confirm antimicrobial qualities. Three fungal metabolites were identified providing insights into fungal colonization that may benefit Sphagnum. Characterizing the metabolite profile of Sphagnum fallax provided a baseline to understand the mechanisms in which Sphagnum fallax acts on its environment, its relation to carbon sequestration in peatlands, and provide key biomarkers to predict peatland C store changes (sequestration, emissions) as climate shifts.  aPublisher supplied data  cMicrobiomes in Transition  cOffice of Biological and Environmental Research  aDEcBiological and Environmental Research  a‐cBiological and Environmental Research  aAC05cBiological and Environmental Research  a‐cBiological and Environmental Research  a00OR22725cBiological and Environmental Research 3aSphagnum fallax 3abioactive properties 3abiodegradation 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aflavonoids 3afungi 3aglycosides 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic matter 3apeatlands 3aplant growth 3avascular plants1 aLyon, Jamee1 aAminiTabrizi, Roya1 aGieschen, Hans1 aChu, Rosalie K.1 aHoyt, David W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2857-719X1 aKyle, Jennifer E.1 aToyoda, Jason1 aTolic, Nikola1 aHeyman, Heino M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0941-25061 aHess, Nancy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8930-95001 aMetz, Thomas O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6049-39681 aTfaily, Malak M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3036-28330 tPlant direct.g2019 Nov., v. 3, no. 11 p.e00179-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245009300153520141300246592002801659650001501687650001501702650002201717650003001739650002501769650002301794650001001817650001701827650001801844650002201862650001501884650001901899650001101918650002101929650001101950650001101961650002001972650001501992650001602007650001002023650001902033650001102052650001302063651001002076700001502086700001902101700001802120700001702138700001702155773011902172856007302291852000902364655001202373IND60653354420221119071852.0190714e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065335442DNAL7 a10.3390/w100607162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Xinxi12aA Constructed Wetland System for Rural Household Sewage Treatment in Subtropical Regions  aA constructed wetland system, consisting of a surface-flow wetland cell connected in series with three vertical subsurface-flow wetland cells, was tested for treatment of domestic sewage from rural families in southern China. Diatomite, vermiculate, zeolite and hydrotalcite, were used, respectively, as filler adsorbents in the sequenced subsurface-flow cells for adsorption of organic, cationic and anionic pollutants. Selected trees, shrubs and annual herbs were planted to form a wetland plant community. The total treatment capacity, hydraulic loading rate and water retention time were 2 m3/d, 0.5 m/d and 48 h, respectively. Experimental data obtained from a year operation confirmed that the treatment process followed the dynamic pathway of pollutant transformation. The constructed system was effective to remove TSS, COD<inf>Cr</inf> and BOD<inf>5</inf> and their effluent concentrations met the first grade of the discharge standards legislated in China. The removal rates of TN, NH<inf>3</inf>-N and TP were relatively lower, and their effluent concentrations fell within the range between the first and second grade of the standards. An increase in initial pollutant loading and a decrease in temperature in winter caused apparent accumulation of TN, NH<inf>3</inf>-N and TP in the system. Discharge of sludge at adequate intervals was shown to be effective to enhance the treatment efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3adiatomaceous earth 3aherbs 3ahydrotalcite 3aoverland flow 3aplant communities 3apollutants 3arural families 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3ashrubs 3asludge 3asubsurface flow 3asubtropics 3atemperature 3atrees 3awetland plants 3awinter 3azeolites 3aChina1 aWu, Xiaofu1 aZhou, Sangyang1 aChen, Yonghua1 aChen, Mingli1 aChen, Runhua0 tWater.g2018 June 01, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100607163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001200150245008200162300001400244520121600258592002801474650001401502650001101516650002401527650001101551650001301562650001101575650001901586650001301605650001701618650002301635651001001658700001701668700001801685700001501703700001801718773008201736856008601818852000901904655001201913IND4468952220221118040655.0141111e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446895222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Pei10aChinese consumersâ willingness to pay for green- and eco-labeled seafood  ap. 74-82.  aAs the worldâs largest seafood consumer and exporter, China is challenged by frequent seafood contamination incidents. To restore consumer confidence in seafood safety, Chinaâs Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) mandated a nation wide quality standard that awards a green label to qualified safer seafood. MOA is also planning for an environmental friendly label to address consumersâ concerns about wild sea species sustainability. This study developed a three-stage purchase framework model and applied a multivariate Probit regression to analyze questionnaire information collected from 14 supermarkets in Beijing, China. The results show that Chinese consumers consider the seafood label a more important information source than previous consumption experience. They are willing to pay more for green-labeled seafood for the protection of individual benefits. Moreover, consumers are willing to pay more for the eco-labeled seafood for the protection of societal benefits. Gender, shopping venues, education, seafood expenditure and knowledge of the labeled products affected purchase intention and willingness to pay. Price was not a statistically significant factor affecting purchase decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeducation 3agender 3ainformation sources 3amodels 3aplanning 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3aseafoods 3asupermarkets 3awillingness to pay 3aChina1 aZeng, Yinchu1 aFong, Quentin1 aLone, Todd1 aLiu, Yuanyuan0 tFood control.g2012 Nov., v. 28, no. 1 p.74-82dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245012900201500001900330500001100349520215800360592002802518650001402546650001202560650001702572650002502589650001802614650001302632650002102645650001002666650002402676650002402700650001302724650001802737650001102755650000902766650002202775650002102797650001502818650001502833650001302848650001702861650002502878650001702903650001502920650001602935700001602951700006102967700006203028700005703090700002703147700002003174773012703194856007403321852000903395655001203404IND60734760620221122054851.0210422e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073476062DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.136402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Mahmood Ul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4044-139110aPotential of Aloe vera gel coating for storage life extension and quality conservation of fruits and vegetables: An overview  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aAloe vera (ALV) with its unique nutritional profile is being used for food, health, and nutraceutical industries globally. Due to its organic nature, ALV gel coating has created lot of interest for exploring its potential in extending the shelf and storage life of fresh produce. ALV gel coating plays imperative role in delaying fruit ripening by lowering ethylene biosynthesis, respiration rate, and internal metabolic activities associated with fruit softening, color development, enzymatic browning, and decay. ALV gel coating reduces the microbial spoilage due to its antifungal properties and maintains visual appearance, firmness, sugar: acid ratio, total antioxidants, and phenolic contents with conserved eating quality. ALV coated fruits and vegetables showed reduced weight loss, superoxide ion (O2‐∙), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), ion leakage, and soluble solids content and exhibited higher acidity, anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities. It also delayed the enzymatic browning by inducing peroxidase (POD) activity during storage. Recent local studies also revealed that ALV gel coating markedly conserved higher consuming quality and extended storage period (>1.34‐fold) of different fruits and vegetables. Overall, Aloe vera gel coating alone or in combination with other organic compounds has shown great potential as a food‐safe and eco‐friendly coating for maintaining the quality of fruits and vegetables over extended period and reducing postharvest losses in the supply chain. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: ALV gel is a plant‐based natural coating of eco‐friendly nature. The present review summarizes the updated information of ALV gel coating application, methods of extraction, combinations with other postharvest coatings, and its impact on quality of various fruits and vegetables. It also provides future insights for the development of commercially applicable ALV gel coating protocols through simulation studies. So, being a natural coating, ALV gel has tremendous potential to be used in fruit and vegetable industries around the globe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3aacidity 3aanthocyanins 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acell respiration 3acolor 3adietary supplements 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afresh produce 3afruits 3agels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3anutrient content 3aperoxidase 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astorage time 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asupply chain 3avegetables 3aweight loss1 aRiaz, Rehan1 aMalik, Aman Ullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5211-56681 aKhan, Ahmad Sattar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6230-99921 aAnwar, Raheel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4042-35721 aRehman, Rana Naveed Ur1 aʻAlī, Sājid,0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.e13640-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.136403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011000165300001600275520165200291592002801943650001201971650002401983650002202007650001702029650001702046650000902063650002702072650001602099773009102115856008102206852000902287655001202296IND60572621920221121160926.0170717e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057262192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11056-017-9571-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRico, Yessica10aUsing computer simulations to assess sampling effects on spatial genetic structure in forest tree species  ap. 225-243.  aQuantifying spatial genetic structure is key to inform forest management and restoration strategies. Reliable evaluations of genetic structure require sound sampling schemes because inappropriate sampling may over- and under-estimate spatial patterns of genetic structure. Sampling bias has been investigated through computer simulations mostly for animal species with continuous distributions. For tree species that have different life history traits, results from such studies may not apply. Here, I used spatially explicit landscape genetic simulations to assess the effects of spatial sampling scheme (random, systematic, and cluster), sampling intensity (35, 50, 65, and 80%), and the number of microsatellite loci (8, 14, and 20) on inferences of genetic structure under isolation by distance (IBD) in two forest tree species with varying dispersal distances and patchy distributions. Results showed that random sampling with 20 loci was the best performing sampling scheme, irrespective of sampling intensity and the strength of IBD. In contrast, the cluster and systematic sampling were sensitive to sample size. For the three sampling schemes, the number of loci had a large effect because with 8 loci there was an increasing chance of underestimating IBD. Increasing the number of samples over the number of loci, did not improve the performance of sampling schemes. Hence, researchers should put more effort on increasing the number of loci over increasing sample size. Results also showed that sampling error rates varied between species, and sampling bias appeared stronger for the species with a more aggregated spatial distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3acomputer simulation 3aforest management 3aforest trees 3alife history 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aresearchers0 tNew forests.g2017 Mar., v. 48, no. 2 p.225-243dSpringer Netherlandsx0169-42867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-017-9571-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013100163300001600294520130900310592002801619650000801647650001101655650001401666650002501680650002001705653003401725653002701759653001001786653001001796653001901806700001901825700001401844700002001858773009001878856008501968852000902053655001202062IND60622839320221122120831.0190214e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062283932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yang10aCompression performance optimization considering variable charge pressure in an adiabatic compressed air energy storage system  ap. 349-359.  aIn an adiabatic compressed air energy storage system (A-CAES), the storage pressure persistently increases during the energy storage process causing deteriorate of the charge performance under off-design operating conditions. The compression performance with variable backpressure is essential for the energy storage efficiency and density of A-CAES. A thermodynamic model with energy loss analysis is built up to investigate the performance of a multi-stage centrifugal compressor used in an A-CAES (about 6.0 MW). By energy loss analysis, the blade inlet angle is first focused on to improve the disadvantages of narrow operating conditions and low efficiency at large mass flow rate of the original compressor. Then, the variable rotating speed study is applied on to increase the energy charge efficiency with a wide storage pressure range. Using the thermodynamic model, the available rotating speed is determined to be 0.85–1.05 of design value. Furthermore, the rotating speed is optimized to achieve the best efficiency under variable storage pressures and the corresponding correlation is fitted. Using the optimal rotating speed, the compression efficiency can be kept above 80% while the exergy efficiency is above 82% during the whole energy storage process with a wider storage pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aexergy 3amass flow 3athermodynamic models 3avariable charge 0aCompressed air energy storage 0aCentrifugal compressor 0aStall 0aBlock 0aVariable speed1 aChen, Haisheng1 aXu, Yujie1 aDeng, Jianqiang0 tEnergy.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.349-359dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245010600156300001600262520158900278592002801867650002901895650002401924650002901948650001401977650002001991650002002011650001402031650001402045650001502059650000902074650001502083650001402098650001702112650001402129650000902143650001502152650001302167650001102180700002702191700001902218700001602237700002202253773010402275856007102379852000902450655001202459IND60137841020221122215924.0150524e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013784102DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.38432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jun‐Ran10aToxicity of hiba oil constituents and spray formulations to American house dust mites and copra mites  ap. 737-743.  aBACKGROUND: Dermatophagoides farinae and Tyrophagus putrescentiae are recognised as an important source of allergens. An assessment was made of the toxicity of hiba, Thujopsis dolabrata var. hondai, oil and 13 organic compounds and the control efficacy of four experimental spray formulations containing the oil (5–30 g L⁻¹spray) against both mite species. RESULTS: In a contact + fumigant mortality bioassay, (−)‐thujopsene was the most toxic constituent against D. farinae and T. putrescentiae (24 h LC₅₀9.82 and 10.92 µg cm⁻²), and the toxicity of the compound was nearly identical to that of benzyl benzoate (9.33 and 10.14 µg cm⁻²). The toxicity was more pronounced in carvacrol, (+)‐terpinen‐4‐ol, β‐thujaplicin, (−)‐terpinen‐4‐ol, cedrol and α‐terpineol (LC₅₀12.05–15.20 and 12.74–16.48 µg cm⁻²) than in N,N‐diethyl‐3‐methylbenzamide (LC₅₀35.53 and 38.42 µg cm⁻²) against both mite species. The hiba oil 30 g L⁻¹spray and commercial permethrin (cis:trans 25:75) 2.5 g L⁻¹spray treatment resulted in 100 and 11% mortality against the two mite species respectively. In vapour‐phase mortality tests, the two compounds were consistently more toxic in closed versus open containers, indicating that toxicity was achieved mainly through the action of vapour. CONCLUSION: Reasonable mite control in indoor environments can be achieved by a spray formulation containing the 30 g L⁻¹hiba oil as a potential contact‐action fumigant. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermatophagoides farinae 3aThujopsis dolabrata 3aTyrophagus putrescentiae 3aallergens 3aalpha-terpineol 3abenzyl benzoate 3abioassays 3acarvacrol 3acontainers 3adeet 3adust mites 3afumigants 3amite control 3amortality 3aoils 3apermethrin 3atoxicity 3avapors1 aPerumalsamy, Haribalan1 aKwon, Min Jung1 aChae, Se Um1 aAhn, Young‐Joon0 tPest management science.g2015 May, v. 71, no. 5 p.737-743dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.38433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03636naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245012700201500001900328500001100347520223100358592002802589650002002617650002002637650001702657650001102674650002002685650001002705650001102715650001802726650001702744650001102761650001702772650001102789650001902800650001002819650000902829650001702838650002302855650001702878700007302895773012702968856007403095852000903169655001203178IND60734760820221122063924.0210422e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073476082DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.136842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaikh, Sadiya Bi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0453-580910aTherapeutic properties of Punica granatum L (pomegranate) and its applications in lung‐based diseases: A detailed review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aRespiratory diseases are the prime cause of death and disability worldwide. The majority of lung‐based diseases are resistant to treatment. Hence, research on unique drugs/compounds with a more efficient and minimum side effect for treating lung diseases is urgent. Punica granatum L (pomegranate) fruit has been used in the prevention and treatment of various respiratory disorders in recent times. In vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that pomegranate fruit, as well as its juice, extract, peel powder, and oil, exert anti‐proliferative, anti‐oxidant, anti‐microbial, anti‐inflammatory, anti‐cancer, and anti‐tumorigenic properties by attenuating various respiratory conditions such as asthma, lung fibrosis, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alveolar inflammation via modulating various signaling pathways. The current review summarizes the potential properties and medical benefits of pomegranate against different lung‐based diseases, also highlighting its possible role in the lung fibrinolytic system. The available data suggest that pomegranate is effective in controlling the disease progressions and could be a potential therapeutic target benefiting human health status. Furthermore, this review also outlines the preclinical and clinical studies highlighting the role of pomegranate in lung diseases further evoking future studies to investigate the effect of intake of this anti‐oxidant fruit in larger and well‐defined human clinical trials. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This review outlines the putative pharmacologic benefits of P. granatum L (pomegranate) in treating various chronic lung‐based diseases such as lung cancer, COPD, ARDS, asthma, lung fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis.

The bioleaching of gold using microorganisms for in situ cyanide production to recover gold is a promising new approach for prohibiting the use of conventional chemical cyanide. For the first time, this study reports a comprehensive investigation on the role of pH on individual steps of Bacillus megaterium bacterial growth, cyanide production, and gold recovery. This novel way of maximizing biogenic cyanide is highly efficient and demonstrates biocyanidation as a potentially viable technique for direct treatment of sulfidic gold ores, i.e., eliminating the step of biooxidation for the first time. The low-grade sources were treated with both chemical cyanide and biogenic cyanide generated by B. megaterium. Results indicate that the bacteria generated a maximum of 61.89 ppm cyanide, which correspondingly recovered over 87% and 43% gold from O1 and O2 sources, respectively, comparable to gold recoveries by chemical leaching. The pure gold powder leaching was also performed to evaluate the loss in gold recovery due to the biosorption of gold to bacterial cells. The feasibility of the work is also supported by green chemistry metrics, and a comparison has been made between conventional and biocyanide leaching. The results revealed the potential of biocyanidation for industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus megaterium 3abacterial growth 3abioleaching 3abiosorption 3acyanides 3agold 3agreen chemistry 3apH 0aglycine 0acyanogenic bacteria 0abiocyanidation 0alow-grade ores 0asustainability.1 aWang, Jingxiu1 aMahandra, Harshit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7089-29971 aQahramān, Aḥmad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3568-78800 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Dec. 29, v. 9, no. 1 p.236-245dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c069043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002200191245009200213300001800305506007600323520189100399592002802290506003702318650001702355650002202372650000902394650001102403650001202414650001302426650001402439650000702453650001202460653000702472653000702479653000902486653000802495653000602503653000802509653001002517653000802527653000802535653003502543653002302578653002602601653002002627653001802647700001802665700002002683700001902703700002102722700002002743700002702763773013102790856008502921852000903006655001203015IND60088424920221207060706.0190214e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008842492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.01.0092doi7 aPMC39957522pmcid7 a233960042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrofts, Antony R.14aThe mechanism of ubihydroquinone oxidation at the Qo-site of the cytochrome bc1 complex  ap. 1362-1377.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a1. Recent results suggest that the major flux is carried by a monomeric function, not by an intermonomer electron flow. 2. The bifurcated reaction at the Qo-site involves sequential partial processes, — a rate limiting first electron transfer generating a semiquinone (SQ) intermediate, and a rapid second electron transfer in which the SQ is oxidized by the low potential chain. 3. The rate constant for the first step in a strongly endergonic, proton-first-then-electron mechanism, is given by a Marcus–Brønsted treatment in which a rapid electron transfer is convoluted with a weak occupancy of the proton configuration needed for electron transfer. 4. A rapid second electron transfer pulls the overall reaction over. Mutation of Glu-295 of cyt b shows it to be a key player. 5. In more crippled mutants, electron transfer is severely inhibited and the bell-shaped pH dependence of wildtype is replaced by a dependence on a single pK at ~8.5 favoring electron transfer. Loss of a pK ~6.5 is explained by a change in the rate limiting step from the first to the second electron transfer; the pK ~8.5 may reflect dissociation of QH. 6. A rate constant (<103s−1) for oxidation of SQ in the distal domain by heme bL has been determined, which precludes mechanisms for normal flux in which SQ is constrained there. 7. Glu-295 catalyzes proton exit through H+ transfer from QH, and rotational displacement to deliver the H+ to exit channel(s). This opens a volume into which Q− can move closer to the heme to speed electron transfer. 8. A kinetic model accounts well for the observations, but leaves open the question of gating mechanisms. For the first step we suggest a molecular “escapement”; for the second a molecular ballet choreographed through coulombic interactions.

Despite these advancements, achieving self-healing in permanently cross-linked hydrogels has remained elusive because of the presence of water and irreversible cross-links. Here, we demonstrate that permanently cross-linked hydrogels can be engineered to exhibit self-healing in an aqueous environment. We achieve this feature by arming the hydrogel network with flexible-pendant side chains carrying an optimal balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties that allows the side chains to mediate hydrogen bonds across the hydrogel interfaces with minimal steric hindrance and hydrophobic collapse. The self-healing reported here is rapid, occurring within seconds of the insertion of a crack into the hydrogel or juxtaposition of two separate hydrogel pieces. The healing is reversible and can be switched on and off via changes in pH, allowing external control over the healing process. Moreover, the hydrogels can sustain multiple cycles of healing and separation without compromising their mechanical properties and healing kinetics. Beyond revealing how secondary interactions could be harnessed to introduce new functions to chemically cross-linked polymeric systems, we also demonstrate various potential applications of such easy-to-synthesize, smart, self-healing hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acrosslinking 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3amechanical properties 3apH 2aAmino Acidsxchemistry 2aBiomimetics 2aBuffers 2aCross-Linking Reagentsxchemistry 2aHydrogelsxchemistry. 2aHydrogelsxchemistry 2aHydrogen Bonding 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMaterials Testing 2aMolecular Conformation 2aPolystyrenesxchemistry 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infraredxmethods 2aSpectrum Analysis, Ramanxmethods 2aStress, Mechanical 2aTemperature 2aUreaxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry1 aZhang, Chao1 aArman, Bedri1 aXu, Zhengzhi,1 aMashelkar, Raghunath A.1 aLele, Ashish K.1 aTauber, Michael J.1 aArya, Gaurav1 aVarghese, Shyni0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Mar. 20, v. 109, no. 12 p.4383-4388dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1201122109  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245012200166300001800288520104700306592002801353650001901381650002201400650002201422650002301444650001001467650003101477650001901508650002001527650001501547650001901562700002201581700002201603700002201625700002401647773010701671856007501778852000901853655001201862IND60532775120221120194556.0160728e20130610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053277512DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400323c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchott, Marc-Alexandre10aSolubilization of Water-Insoluble Drugs Due to Random Amphiphilic and Degradable Poly(dimethylmalic acid) Derivatives  ap. 1936-1944.  aAmphotericin B (AmB) and clofazimine are potent drugs hindered by their low water solubilities and their toxicities. Carriers able to increase their apparent water solubilities are needed for these drugs and for other molecules with similar properties. Random amphiphilic copolymers derived from poly(dimethylmalic acid) were obtained using different hydrophobization ratios and side group sizes. Apparent water solubilities of pyrene, clofazimine, and AmB were increased up to 10 000, 20 000 and 1000 times, respectively, in aqueous solutions containing these polymers. The presence of sodium chloride in polymer solution increased pyrene solubility but decreased the solubilities of clofazimine and AmB, compared to the salt-free solutions. Synergy between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions was observed for polar and cationic molecules. Degradation studies showed that the examined polymers were degradable, but none of them were totally degraded in 28 days. These polymers could be used as a new tool for drug solubilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphotericin B 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical elements 3acomposite polymers 3adrugs 3aelectrostatic interactions 3ahydrophobicity 3asodium chloride 3asolubility 3asolubilization1 aDomurado, Martine1 aLeclercq, Laurent1 aBarbaud, Christel1 aDomurado, Dominique0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 June 10, v. 14, no. 6 p.1936-1944dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm400323c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005700153245010800210520138400318592002801702650001701730650001001747650001701757650001501774650003101789650002501820650002401845650002201869650001401891650001901905650002101924650001701945650002101962650000901983650001501992653001902007653002502026653002502051653001702076653001602093700001902109700002102128700006502149773011802214856008802332852000902420655001202429IND60676596320221122025759.0220328e20200520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067659632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1346022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhar, Amalesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8357-826X10aPerspectives on environmental impacts and a land reclamation strategy for solar and wind energy systems  aGlobal energy demands and environmental concerns are a driving force for use of alternative, sustainable and clean energy sources. Solar and wind are among the most promising sources and have been developing steadily in recent years. However, these energy developments are not free of adverse environmental consequences, which require appropriate reclamation procedures. The environmental issues caused by solar and wind plants were reviewed in this paper by summarizing existing studies and synthesizing the principles that could underlie development of reclamation practices. The major environmental drawback of solar and wind energy plants are bird mortality, biodiversity, and habitat loss; noise; visual impact; and hazardous chemicals used in solar panels. Available mitigation measures to minimize these adverse environmental impacts, and appropriate reclamation protocol for the disturbed ecosystems, including key research needs are discussed. We include socio-economic perspectives of solar and wind energy, such as policy related to re-powering initiatives, decommissioning, and reclamation liability. The intent of this paper is to provide current perspectives on environmental issues associated with solar and wind energy development, strategies to mitigate environmental impacts, and potential reclamation practices to solar and wind energy planners and developers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3aclean energy 3aecosystems 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenvironmental impact 3ahabitat destruction 3aissues and policy 3amortality 3asocioeconomics 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3atoxic substances 3awind 3awind power 0aClimate change 0aEcosystem resilience 0aEnvironmental impact 0aGreen energy 0aRestoration1 aNaeth, M.

Included in its endemic flora is a representative of the genus Gossypium colloquially referred to as Wake Island cotton. Stanley G. Stephens pointed out that “Wake Island cotton does not resemble closely either the Caribbean or other Pacific forms.” Taking into consideration morphological distinctions, the geographic isolation of Wake Atoll, and newly generated molecular data presented here, we conclude that the cottons of Wake Atoll do in fact represent a new species of Gossypium, here named Gossypium stephensii.

The outcomes of interest were frequent respiratory symptoms and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) below the lower limit of normal (NHANES reference values). Multivariable regression analyses examined the associations (Odds Ratio [OR] and 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]) between exposures and these outcomes, adjusted by sociodemographic characteristics.In adjusted analyses of each exposure, the highest tertile of home PM and season of interview were associated with increased odds for more frequent respiratory symptoms (OR=1.64 95%CI: [1.00, 2.69] and OR=1.66 95%CI: [1.09, 2.51]). The highest tertile of hair nicotine was significantly associated with FEV1 below the lower limit of normal (OR=1.80 95%CI: [1.00, 3.25]). In a model including home PM, ambient PM, hair nicotine, and season, only two associations remained strong: hair nicotine with FEV1 below the lower limit of normal and season of measurement (dry, April–October) with increased respiratory symptoms (OR=1.85 95%CI: [1.00, 3.41] and OR=1.54 95%CI: [1.0, 2.37]). When that model was stratified by sex, the highest tertiles of ambient PM and hair nicotine were associated with FEV1 below the lower limit of normal among women (OR=2.23 95%CI: [1.08, 4.61] and OR=2.90 95%CI: [1.32, 6.38]), but not men. The highest tertile of hair nicotine was also associated with increased respiratory symptoms in women but not men (OR=2.38 95%CI: [1.26, 4.49]). When stratified by age, the middle quartile of ambient PM and the highest hair nicotine tertile were associated with increased respiratory symptoms (OR=2.07 95%CI: [1.01, 4.24] and OR=2.55 95%CI: [1.21, 5.36]) in those under 55 but not in the older stratum.Exposure to PM from both home and ambient sources is associated with increased symptoms and lower lung function in adults with asthma, although these associations vary by type of PM, the respiratory outcome studied, sex and age.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3aasthma 3aconfidence interval 3alung function 3amen 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anicotine 3anormal values 3aodds ratio 3aparticulates 3aregression analysis 3arhinitis 3aroads 3asmoking (habit) 3awomen 0aEPA 0aFEV1 0aICD-9 0aNHANES III 0a95%CI 0aOR 0aPM 0aPM2.5 0aPM10 0aPM10–2.5 0aIndoor particulate matter 0aOutdoor particulate matter 0aHair nicotine 0aAsthma 0aRespiratory symptoms 0aLung function1 aCisternas, Miriam1 aQuinlan, Patricia J.1 aTrupin, Laura1 aLurmann, Fred W.1 aKatz, Patricia P.1 aBlanc, Paul D.0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Feb., v. 129 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2013.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01676naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245022100160300001600381520077600397592002801173650001001201650001001211650001001221773010701231856007501338852000901413655001201422IND60643711520221119013510.0190513e20130823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064371152DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1986.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokarz, Helena10aUdział apofitów i antropofitów we florze segetalnej Pomorza Wschodniego w latach 1972–1979 [Percentage of apophytes and anthropophytes in the segetal flora of East Pomerania under study in the years 1972–1979]  ap. 277-292.  aThe aim of this paper is to present a historic-geographical analysis of the segetal flora of East Pomerania on the basis of floristic materials collected in the years 1972–1979.

Despite a fertilization rate after insemination (AI) of approximately 90%, calving rates are 30%–50%, indicating the occurrence of extensive embryonic and foetal losses. The aim of this study was to establish the extent and pattern of embryonic and foetal loss in Swedish Red (SR) and Swedish Holstein (SH) dairy cows, as well as, the relationship to oestrus intensity (OI) and progesterone (P4) concentration. In total, 2130 AIs and 16,176 milk P4 samples from 359 SR and 212 SH dairy cows were included in the study. Pregnancy losses were estimated using data from P4 values combined with AI information and calving data. RESULTS: Total pregnancy loss from AI to the day of calving was 65%. Early embryonic loss, late embryonic loss and foetal loss were estimated to be 29, 14 and 13%, respectively. There is strong evidence in the literature that P4 concentrations at different time points are associated with pregnancy loss. In the present study, cows with pregnancy losses had significantly higher P4 levels at the day of AI and significantly lower P4 concentration at days 10, 21 and 30 after AI compared to pregnant cows. Swedish Red cows had significantly lower total pregnancy losses compared to SH cows (62% and 68% respectively, P = 0.017). Early embryonic loss was 6.7% points lower for cows inseminated at a stronger OI (OI = 3) compared to at a weaker OI (OI = 2, P = 0.006). Cows inseminated at ovulation number ≥ 5 had significantly lower early pregnancy losses compared to cows inseminated at first or second ovulation (11.5 and 8% points, respectively, P < 0.05). With an increase of one SD of milk (448 kg ECM) during the first 60 days in milk, early embryonic loss increased by 4.7% points (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: It is important to increase the number of cows calving per insemination by reducing embryo/foetal loss. This outcome can be achieved by management and breeding for optimal P4 levels at critical time points, and by considering oestrus expression in the breeding programmes to facilitate the correct timing of insemination.  aPublisher supplied data  aV1130050cStiftelsen Lantbruksforskning  aV0730301cStiftelsen Lantbruksforskning0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3abreeding 3abreeding programs 3acalving 3adairy cows 3aembryo (animal) 3aembryonic mortality 3aestrus 3ainsemination 3alactation 3amilk 3aovulation 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone1 aGustafsson, Hans1 aBerglund, Britt0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2018 Dec., v. 60, no. 1 p.68-68dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-018-0420-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245009900133300001400232520155800246592002801804650001801832650001201850650002201862650001901884650001701903650002001920650001001940650003301950650001401983650001901997650002502016650002402041651001502065653001402080653002002094653001602114700002102130700001702151700002102168700002402189700002202213700002902235700002502264700001602289700002102305773012402326852000902450655001202459IND60594606020221121041314.0180521s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059460602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlon, Heather E.12aA Five Gene Phylogenetic Study of Fuireneae (Cyperaceae) with a Revision of Isolepis humillima  ap. 26-36.  aCyperaceae tribe Fuireneae consists of six genera (Actinoscirpus, Pseudoschoenus, Fuirena, Bolboschoenus, Schoenoplectus, and Schoenoplectiella) and approximately 155 species distributed widely across all continents except Antarctica. Recent molecular analyses suggest that Fuireneae is paraphyletic with respect to Cypereae, but limited taxonomic sampling and low branch support have resulted in unresolved relationships among key genera. To address the potential paraphyly of Fuireneae as well as intratribal and intertribal relationships, thirty taxa representing major lineages from the six Fuireneae genera within Cypereae were sequenced for five coding and non-coding regions from the nuclear (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) and chloroplast (trnL intron/ trnL-trnF spacer; partial ndhF, rbcL and matK genes) genomes. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of the dataset strongly support Fuireneae as a grade of three clades: (1) Fuirena, (2) Bolboschoenus and (3) a group composed of Cypereae and the four remaining Fuireneae genera (Schoenoplectus, Schoenoplectiella, Actinoscirpus, and Pseudoschoenus). Individual and combined gene trees consistently position Isolepis humillima within a well supported clade consisting of species in Schoenoplectiella sect. Schoenoplectiella. Based on molecular evidence, we transfer Isolepis humillima to Schoenoplectiella humillima, and suggest that a large-scale revision of tribal limits is required to reflect the natural relationships of the genera currently treated in Fuireneae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBolboschoenus 3aFuirena 3aSchoenoplectiella 3aSchoenoplectus 3achloroplasts 3adata collection 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aparaphyly 3aplant taxonomy 3astatistical analysis 3ataxonomic revisions 3aAntarctica 0aPhylogeny 0achloroplast DNA 0anuclear DNA1 aShiels, Derek R.1 aLinton, Eric1 aStarr, Julian R.1 aShorkey, Adriane L.1 aFleming, Samantha1 aLichtenwald, Samantha K.1 aSchick, Elizabeth R.1 aPozo, David1 aMonfils, Anna K.0 tSystematic botany.g2017, v. 42, no. 1 p.26-36dAmerican Society of Plant ToxonomistswJournal:jnl7985x0363-64457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245014000156520100400296592002801300650002001328650002101348650001601369650001601385650002501401650001901426650001101445650001701456650002001473650001201493650001801505650001401523650001801537650001201555650000901567700002201576700001701598773012001615856007801735852000901813655001201822IND60757751520221120203147.0211125e20211020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075775152DNAL7 a10.3390/genes121116532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yan 10aAberrant DNA Methylation Mediates the Transgenerational Risk of Metabolic and Chronic Disease Due to Maternal Obesity and Overnutrition  aMaternal obesity is a rapidly evolving universal epidemic leading to acute and long-term medical and obstetric health issues, including increased maternal risks of gestational diabetes, hypertension and pre-eclampsia, and the future risks for offspring’s predisposition to metabolic diseases. Epigenetic modification, in particular DNA methylation, represents a mechanism whereby environmental effects impact on the phenotypic expression of human disease. Maternal obesity or overnutrition contributes to the alterations in DNA methylation during early life which, through fetal programming, can predispose the offspring to many metabolic and chronic diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. This review aims to summarize findings from human and animal studies, which support the role of maternal obesity in fetal programing and the potential benefit of altering DNA methylation to limit maternal obesity related disease in the offspring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3achronic diseases 3aepigenetics 3afatty liver 3agestational diabetes 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ahypertension 3akidney diseases 3aobesity 3aovernutrition 3aphenotype 3apre-eclampsia 3aprogeny 3arisk1 aPollock, Carol A.1 aSaad, Sonia 0 tGenes.g2021 Oct. 20, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes121116533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01463naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003300112245014200145300001600287520030200303592002800605650001000633650001100643650001200654650001600666650001300682650001900695650002800714650002300742650001900765651001100784653001400795653002200809653001800831653001200849653001300861700002600874700003000900773012600930852000901056655001201065IND60594606220221121041211.0180521s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059460622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPederneiras, Leandro Cardoso10aFicus latipedunculata (Moraceae), a New Species from Brazil, and Taxonomic Key for Ficus sect.

However, the impact of biochar application on bacterial (AOB) and archaeal ammonia oxidizers (AOA) remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the responses of AOB and AOA to the application of biochar derived from cotton stalk at rates of 5, 10, and 20 % by weight to a coastal alkaline soil during a 12-week incubation. The results showed that the amoA gene of AOB consistently outnumbered that of AOA, whereas only the AOA amoA gene copy number was significantly correlated with the potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) rate (P < 0.01). The significant decrease of PAO rates in biochar treatments occurred after incubation for 4–6 weeks, which were distinctly longer than that in the control (2 weeks). The PAO rates were significantly different among treatments during the first 4 weeks of incubation (P < 0.05), with the highest usually in the 10 % treatment. Biochar application significantly increased the abundance of both nitrifiers in the 4 weeks of incubation (P < 0.05). Biochar amendment also decreased AOA diversity, but increased AOB diversity, which resulted in different community structures of both nitrifiers (P < 0.01), as shown by the differences between the 5 % biochar and the control treatments. We conclude that biochar application generally enhanced the abundance and altered the composition of ammonia oxidizers; the rate of biochar application also affected the rate and dynamics of nitrification, and the risk for increasing the alkalinity and N leaching of the studied soil was lower with a lower application rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline soils 3aalkalinity 3aammonia 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acotton 3agenes 3aleaching 3amicrobial communities 3anitrification 3aoxidation 3arisk1 aZhang, Xiaoli1 aMa, Bin1 aChang, Scott X.1 aGong, Jun0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2014 Feb., v. 50, no. 2 p.321-332dSpringer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-013-0857-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245013200203300001600335500001900351500002000370520118800390592002801578650003101606650002301637650001601660650001401676651001001690700006301700700006001763773013401823856007901957852000902036655001202045IND60707288620221122194646.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070728862DNAL7 a10.1111/1477-9552.123832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiagini, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9168-127514aThe Role of the Common Agricultural Policy in Enhancing Farm Income: A Dynamic Panel Analysis Accounting for Farm Size in Italy  ap. 652-675.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs a multi‐objective policy, the EU Common Agricultural Policy continues to secure significant income support for farmers as one of the nine specific objectives. We estimate the income transfer efficiency of a broad set of pivotal policy measures, focusing on the effects of farm structure on income transfer efficiency. We use dynamic modelling, based on a micro‐data panel of Italian farms for the period 2008–2014, allowing for endogeneity, simultaneity bias, and omitted variables. In line with previous studies and economic expectations, we find that decoupled direct payments provide the highest contribution to agricultural incomes, followed by agri‐environmental payments and on‐farm investment subsidies. Coupled payments have no significant impacts on farmers’ income. Generally, for all analysed Common Agricultural Policy measures, large farms benefit from greater transfer efficiency levels compared with medium and small farms. These differences among instruments and across farms suggest that policy‐participation costs may play a pivotal role, together with the economic structure of farms, in determining the income transfer efficiency of CAP policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aeconomic structure 3afarm income 3afarm size 3aItaly1 aAntonioli, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1201-26291 aSeverini, Simone1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5501-35520 tJournal of agricultural economics.g2020 Sept., v. 71, no. 3 p.652-675dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl18305x0021-857X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.123833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245011500177300001600292520185800308592002802166650002502194650001502219650001202234650002202246650001002268650003002278650001902308650001302327650001402340650001102354650001402365650001602379650002302395651001102418651002102429651001002450651001002460653001202470653001402482653001902496653002502515653003102540653002602571653002902597653001702626700002302643700001802666773011502684856008402799852000902883655001202892IND60122869620221120032525.0150325e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012286962DNAL7 a10.1080/13887890.2012.6973992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Ram Devi Tachamo10aRange shifts of a relict Himalayan dragonfly in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region under climate change scenarios  ap. 209-222.  aAlthough understanding of geographic range shifts of many species in response to global climate change is expanding steadily, little is known about the Himalayan fauna, which in particular is affected by relatively faster warming rates than other parts of the world. Anticipated increases in temperature and changes in hydrological regimes will have significant adverse impacts on the habitat suitability for many species. This threat will even be higher to endemic and already threatened species due to their restricted distribution and narrow climate tolerance ranges. We investigated the range shifts of a relict Himalayan dragonfly (Epiophlebia laidlawi), a species that is endemic to the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. Currently, the species is only known from few localities in Bhutan, India and Nepal. For conservation of the species, it is necessary to foresee potential suitable habitat areas and range shifts due to global climate change. Here, we first estimated the current potential geographic distribution by identifying the suitable habitat area in the region using bioclimatic envelope models, by means of consensus projections of six algorithms as implemented in the BIOMOD-package in the software program R. We then used the current distribution to render future projections under the A2a and B2a IPCC emission scenarios for the years 2050 and 2080. Models predict that the suitable habitat area of the species will shift on average 374 m and 599 m uphill under the extreme (A2a) climate warming scenario, and 294 m and 342 m uphill under the moderate (B2a) scenario by 2050 and 2080, respectively. Future suitable habitat areas are projected to remain only in the high mountains of eastern Nepal. The results will help conservationists to delineate priority habitats in the first step towards the species conservation in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aalgorithms 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3afauna 3ageographical distribution 3aglobal warming 3ahabitats 3ahydrology 3amodels 3amountains 3atemperature 3athreatened species 3aBhutan 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 3aNepal 0aOdonata 0adragonfly 0aclimate change 0aEpiophlebia laidlawi 0abioclimatic envelope model 0asuitable habitat area 0aaltitudinal range shifts 0aconservation1 aNarayan Shah, Deep1 aDomisch, Sami0 tInternational journal of odonatology.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 15, no. 3 p.209-222dTaylor & Francisx2159-67197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13887890.2012.6973993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245005000167300001600217500001900233520094600252592002801198650001101226650001201237651001101249773012001260856008301380852000901463655001201472IND60688697520221120215804.0200416e19950501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068869752DNAL7 a10.1080/09614529510001570842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKabeer, Naila10aTargeting women or transforming institutions?  ap. 108-116.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWhile inequalities between men and women have long been recognised in formal development policies, poverty-alleviation schemes generally display a discrepancy between their declared commitment to equity for women and their actual achievements in incorporating the insights of gender analysis. This article explores the experience of NGOs which have successfully incorporated gender-awareness into the formulation of anti-poverty interventions. It shows that increasing poor women's organisational experience is critical to ensuring that their needs and views inform the planning process. The article concludes that, unless women are empowered to move beyond the 'project trap', and to take part in formulating policy and allocating resources, they will continue to be a marginalised category in development.

However, it is not easy to control swelling or viscoelastic and biophysical properties of alginate hydrogels prepared by conventional cross-linking methods (ionic interaction using divalent cations). In this study, we describe a bioinspired approach for preparing divalent ion-free alginate hydrogels that exhibit tunable physical and mechanical properties and improved biocompatibility due to the absence of cations in the gel matrices. We conjugated dopamine, a minimalized adhesive motif found in the holdfast pads of mussels, to alginate backbones (alginate-catechol) and the tethered catechols underwent oxidative cross-linking. This resulted in divalent cation-free alginate hydrogels. The swelling ratios and moduli of the alginate-catechol hydrogels are readily tunable, which is difficult to achieve in ionic bond-based alginate hydrogels. Furthermore, alginate-catechol hydrogels enhanced the survival of various human primary cells including stem cells in the three-dimensional gel matrix, indicating that intrinsic cytotoxicity caused by divalent cations becomes negligible when employing catechol oxidation for alginate cross-linking. The inflammatory response in vivo was also significantly attenuated compared to conventional alginate hydrogels with calcium cross-linking. This biomimetic approach for the preparation of alginate hydrogels may provide a novel platform technology to develop tunable, functional, biocompatible, three-dimensional scaffolds for tissue engineering and cell therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiocompatibility 3abiomimetics 3acalcium 3acatechol 3acations 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3adopamine 3adrugs 3ahumans 3ahydrogels 3ainflammation 3amechanical properties 3amussels 3aoxidation 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atissue engineering 3aviscoelasticity1 aShin, Jisoo1 aLee, Jung Seung1 aByun, Eunkyoung1 aRyu, Ji Hyun1 aUm, Soong Ho1 aKim, Dong-Ik1 aLee, Haeshin1 aCho, Sŭng-u,0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 June 10, v. 14, no. 6 p.2004-2013dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm400352d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245010100175300001200276520175200288592002802040650001402068650001302082650002302095650001402118650002102132650001302153650001002166650001902176650001602195650002002211650001802231650003902249650002202288650001502310650003602325650002002361700001802381700001802399700001802417773010302435856008802538852000902626655001202635IND60119450720221116181900.0141214e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011945072DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2001-2-6-preprint00052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelnick, Michael14aThe functional genomic response of developing embryonic submandibular glands to NFκB inhibition  ap. 128.  aBACKGROUND: The proper balance between epithelial cell proliferation, quiescence, and apoptosis during development is mediated by the specific temporal and spatial appearance of transcription factors, growth factors, cytokines, caspases, etc. Since prior studies suggest the importance of transcription factor NF?B during embryonic submandibular salivary gland (SMG) development, we attempted to delineate the emergent dynamics of a cognate signaling network by studying the molecular patterns and phenotypic outcomes of interrupted NF?B signaling in embryonic SMG explants. RESULTS: SN50-mediated inhibition of NF?B signaling in SMG explants results in a highly significant increase in apoptosis and decrease in cell proliferation. Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) analyses of proteomic and transcriptomic assays identify specific transcripts and proteins with altered expression that best discriminate control from SN50-treated SMGs with 100% sensitivity and specificity. These include PCNA, GR, BMP1, BMP3b, Chk1, Caspase 6, E2F1, c-Raf, and JNK-1, as well as several others of lessor importance. Thus, it is apparent that inhibition of NF?B nuclear translocation alters the expression of a cognate genetic network with broadly related, rather than independent, components. CONCLUSIONS: Morphological and functional genomic analyses subsequent to inhibition of NF?B nuclear translocation indicate that NF?B-mediated transcription is critical to embryonic SMG developmental homeostasis. Relative to understanding complex genetic networks and organogenesis, our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating the gene, protein, and activated protein expression of multiple components from multiple pathways within broad functional categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acell proliferation 3acytokines 3aepithelial cells 3aexplants 3agenes 3agrowth factors 3ahomeostasis 3aneural networks 3aorganogenesis 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteomics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atranscriptomics1 aChen, Haiming1 aZhou, Yan Min1 aJaskoll, Tina0 tGenome biology.g2001 June, v. 2, no. 6 p.128-128dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2001-2-6-preprint00053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006300188245009000251300001200341506007600353520066800429592002801097506003701125650000801162650002501170650002501195650002501220700002601245700001501271773010301286856008201389852000901471655001201480IND60619534720221207135710.0220929e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061953472DNAL7 aPMC62114532pmcid7 a303848472pmid7 a10.1186/s13059-018-1521-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrewe-Boss, Philipp1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5459-977110aomniCLIP: probabilistic identification of protein-RNA interactions from CLIP-seq data  ap. 183.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCLIP-seq methods allow the generation of genome-wide maps of RNA binding protein – RNA interaction sites. However, due to differences between different CLIP-seq assays, existing computational approaches to analyze the data can only be applied to a subset of assays. Here, we present a probabilistic model called omniCLIP that can detect regulatory elements in RNAs from data of all CLIP-seq assays. omniCLIP jointly models data across replicates and can integrate background information. Therefore, omniCLIP greatly simplifies the data analysis, increases the reliability of results and paves the way for integrative studies based on data from different assays.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aprobabilistic models 3aregulatory sequences1 aWessels, Hans-Hermann1 aOhler, Uwe0 tGenome biology.g2018 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.183-183dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1521-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01454naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002400138245014400162300001800306520046300324592002800787650002300815650002300838650001300861650001200874650001600886700002000902700001900922773012900941856007301070852000901143655001201152IND60657815620221120031516.0190816e20060615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065781562DNAL7 a10.1039/b603804m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGrath, Matthew J.10aReactivity series for s-BuLi/diamine-mediated lithiation of N-Boc pyrrolidine: applications in catalysis and lithiation of N-Boc piperidine  ap. 2607-2609.  aUsing competition experiments between a range of ligands and (−)-sparteine, a reactivity series for N-Boc pyrrolidine lithiation using s-BuLi/diamines has been constructed; the results indicate that the s-BuLi/(+)-sparteine surrogate complex is more reactive than s-BuLi/(−)-sparteine and this has been exploited in the selection of ligand pairs for ligand exchange catalytic asymmetric lithiation of N-Boc pyrrolidine and lithiation of N-Boc piperidine.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3adiamines 3aligands 3apiperidines1 aBilke, Julia L.1 aO'Brien, Peter0 tChemical communications.g2006 June 15, , no. 24 p.2607-2609dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b603804m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003600152245013500188300001800323500001500341520118600356592002801542650001501570650001801585650001601603650003001619650001101649650001801660650001801678650005201696650001201748650001301760650002401773650002101797650002301818650001201841650001601853653001001869700002401879700001901903700002201922700001701944773012001961856005502081852000902136655001202145IND4510614020221122004841.0150730e20010815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451061402DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02367.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeuzÃ©âVourc'H, Nathalie10aCharacterization of PSAâRP2, a protein related to prostateâspecific antigen and encoded by alternative hKLK3 transcripts  ap. 4408-4413.  a2019-12-04  aDespite the wide use of prostateâspecific antigen (PSA) as a marker of prostate cancer, analysis of its gene products has not yet been completed. The structure of two alternative mRNAs (0.9 and 1.65âkb) of the hKLK3 gene that retain the third intron is reported here. These partially spliced transcripts were detected by hybridization or RTâPCR in normal prostate tissue, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and cancerous prostate tissues, and also in the prostate LNCaP cell line. Insertion of the unspliced intron creates an inâframe stop codon and results in a truncated prepro PSA variant of 180 aminoâacid residues. This novel variant, designated PSAâRP2, has an alternate Câterminal tail and lacks the serine residue essential for the catalytic activity of PSA. Prepro PSAâRP2 was transiently produced in COSâ7 cells and detected in the spent medium using an antiâPSA serum. Secreted PSAâRP2 was glycosylated with an apparent molecular mass of 25âkDa. Our findings suggest that PSAâRP2 contributes to the molecular heterogeneity of freeâPSA in the serum of patients with benign or malignant prostate tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3astop codon 3amessenger RNA 3ablood serum 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aserine 3aglycosylation 3ahybridization 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 3apatients 3aprostatic neoplasms 3amolecular weight 3acatalytic activity 3aintrons 3ahyperplasia 0agenes1 aLeblond, ValÃ©rie1 aOlayat, Sophie1 aGauthier, Francis1 aCourty, Yves0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2001 Aug. 15, v. 268, no. 16 p.4408-4413dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02367.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245014000202300001800342506007600360520141900436592002801855506003701883650002101920650002701941650001601968650002201984650001202006650001502018650001102033650001802044650001102062700002102073700002402094700001602118700001602134700002102150700002102171700002102192773010702213856007502320852000902395655001202404IND60532776020221207065010.0160728e20130610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053277602DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400356m2doi7 aPMC36795572pmcid7 a236176152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Brun, Anton
P.10aStructural Characterization of a Model Gram-Negative Bacterial Surface Using Lipopolysaccharides from Rough Strains of Escherichia coli  ap. 2014-2022.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLipopolysaccharides (LPS) make up approximately 75% of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane (OM) surface, but because of the complexity of the molecule, there are very few model OMs that include LPS. The LPS molecule consists of lipid A, which anchors the LPS within the OM, a core polysaccharide region, and a variable O-antigen polysaccharide chain. In this work we used RcLPS (consisting of lipid A plus the first seven sugars of the core polysaccharide) from a rough strain of Escherichia coli to form stable monolayers of LPS at the air–liquid interface. The vertical structure RcLPS monolayers were characterized using neutron and X-ray reflectometry, while the lateral structure was investigated using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and Brewster angle microscopy. It was found that RcLPS monolayers at surface pressures of 20 mN m–¹ and above are resolved as hydrocarbon tails, an inner headgroup, and an outer headgroup of polysaccharide with increasing solvation from tails to outer headgroups. The lateral organization of the hydrocarbon lipid chains displays an oblique hexagonal unit cell at all surface pressures, with only the chain tilt angle changing with surface pressure. This is in contrast to lipid A, which displays hexagonal or, above 20 mN m–¹, distorted hexagonal packing. This work provides the first complete structural analysis of a realistic E. coli OM surface model.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3alipid A 3amicroscopy 3amodels 3areflectometry 3asugars1 aClifton, Luke A.1 aHalbert, Candice E.1 aLin, Binhua1 aMeron, Mati1 aHolden, Peter J.1 aLakey, Jeremy H.1 aHolt, Stephen A.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 June 10, v. 14, no. 6 p.2014-2022dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm400356m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135100002400153245011400177300001600291520086300307592002801170650002001198650001801218650001401236650002201250650002301272650001901295650002201314650001201336650001701348650003001365650006401395650001201459650007301471650001601544651001401560651001401574653002401588653002601612653002001638653002201658700002401680700002401704700002401728700002501752773010301777852000901880856007101889655001201960IND4417868520200516000000.0200516e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441786852DNAL7 a189591532pmid7 a10.3852/07-1982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarano, Agostina V.10aFrequency, abundance and distribution of zoosporic organisms from Las Cañas stream (Buenos Aires, Argentina)  ap. 691-700.  aZoosporic organisms are common inhabitants of aquatic environments; however there are few ecological studies made for Argentinean streams. In this contribution the taxonomic composition of zoosporic organisms from a stream and their abundance, frequency and diversity on cellulosic baits were analyzed. Samples of water and floating organic matter (vegetable debris) were taken at four dates and different environmental variables (temperature, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations) were measured. Twenty-one taxa were recovered with the baiting technique. Physicochemical fluctuations affected the structure of the studied community; in spring the greatest species richness was related to high nutrient levels whereas in winter the greatest abundance and diversity was related to low water temperature, nutrient levels and well oxygenated conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChytridiomycota 3aaquatic fungi 3azoospores 3aspecies diversity 3aseasonal variation 3ahydrochemistry 3awater temperature 3astreams 2aBiodiversity 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aFungixchemistryxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aSeasons 2aSpores, Fungalxchemistryxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aTemperature 3aArgentina 0aArgentina 0aaquatic environment 0acellulosic substrates 0aChytridiomycota 0aPeronosporomycota1 aBarrera, Marcelo D.1 aSteciow, Mónica M.1 aDonadelli, Jorge L.1 aSaparrat, Mario C.N.0 tMycologia.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 100, no. 5 p.691-700dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3852/07-1983Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01472naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245008800133300001600221520039000237592002800627650001700655650001200672650003000684650001600714650001900730650002000749651001100769653002000780653001400800653002100814653002300835700002600858700001900884700003200903700002800935773012600963852000901089655001201098IND60594606820221121062238.0180521s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059460682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, Joelcio10aAristolochia insolita (Aristolochiaceae), a New Species from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  ap. 169-174.  aA new species of Aristolochia from the Atlantic Forest of Brazil is here described: A. insolita, from Rio de Janeiro, which belongs to subser.

The resurveys across many regions have reported their recent disappearance or deterioration despite both the extreme habitat conditions (carbonate richness, presence of calcareous tufa, nutrient limitation, high water level) and conservation management. To test the stability of their biotic communities in different environmental and management configurations, we repeatedly sampled molluscs (terrestrial and aquatic), vascular plants, and bryophytes at 30 calcareous fens in the Inner Western Carpathians (Slovakia, Poland) after 13–17 years of warm summers and land-use changes. We found a small yet statistically significant effect of sampling period (old versus new survey) on the species composition of all three groups of organisms when the effect of various positions of sites along ecological gradients was controlled for. The compositional changes, interpreted with the help of Ellenberg Indicator Values, suggest an incipient succession towards grasslands and shrublands, driven by decreasing soil moisture and increasing nutrient availability. Although the number of habitat specialists did not change, the number of matrix-derived vascular plant and bryophyte species significantly increased, with six ubiquitous species of productive habitats being significantly more represented currently, while the richness of aquatic molluscs significantly decreased. Fens in which potentially strongly competitive plant species were less stressed because of less intense management and lower habitat extremity were more prone to such succession. There was no single factor that could predict the magnitude of composition changes; instead, tested factors were found to act synergistically. Conservation management was predominantly important for bryophytes, while extreme habitat conditions were predominantly important for terrestrial snails. We suggested a way how nature conservancy authorities can prioritise the management needs by applying an abiotic indicator system, with less environmentally extreme fens requiring more intense conservation management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3abiocenosis 3acarbonates 3afens 3agrasslands 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3anutrient availability 3apeatlands 3arefuge habitats 3ashrublands 3asnails 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3asurveys 3avascular plants 3aCarpathian region 3aPoland 3aSlovakia 0aCalcareous fens 0aGlobal change 0aConservation management 0aEnvironmental stress 0aMolluscs 0aVegetation1 aHorsáková, Veronika1 aHájková, Petra1 aCoufal, Radovan1 aDítě, Daniel,1 aNěmec, Tomáš1 aHorsák, Michal0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 June 01, v. 719 p.134693-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1346933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01784naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008100166300001600247520086500263592002801128650001401156650001701170650001601187650001301203650001101216650001401227650000901241650001301250700002201263773007901285856008501364852000901449655001201458IND60088426420221119182440.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008842642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuha, Noah10aDomoic acid induced seizures progress to a chronic state of epilepsy in rats  ap. 168-171.  aThe emergence of an epilepsy syndrome in sea lions poisoned by domoic acid (DA) draws striking parallels to the single case study of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) that developed in an 84 yr old man one year after being poisoned by DA. To establish a basis for understanding this disease in sea lions and humans that appears to progress from DA poisoning, we have investigated the potential for a single incident of DA poisoning in rats to progress to spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), the hallmark of epilepsy. We have developed a DA administration protocol to induce a nonlethal status epilepticus (SE) and monitored the animals for SRS by 6 h/week of video recording. We demonstrate that a single episode of SE leads to SRS in 94% of rats (n = 23) in 6 months. These findings indicate that DA induced SE can efficiently translate to epileptic disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOtariidae 3acase studies 3adomoic acid 3aepilepsy 3ahumans 3apoisoning 3arats 3aseizures1 aRamsdell, John S.0 tToxicon.g2011 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.168-171dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2010.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011900154300001800273520177600291592002802067650002302095650002302118650001402141650002302155650001702178650002602195650001102221650001802232650001402250650004402264650000702308650001502315650001902330650001702349650001602366650003702382700001802419700001802437700001602455700001302471700001502484700001602499773010702515856007502622852000902697655001202706IND60532776120221121005728.0160728e20130610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053277612DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400358z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yue10apH-Triggered Charge-Reversal Polypeptide Nanoparticles for Cisplatin Delivery: Preparation and In Vitro Evaluation  ap. 2023-2032.  aA series of pH-responsive random copolymer poly(l-glutamic acid-co-l-lysine) [P(Glu-co-Lys)] were synthesized through the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of γ-benzyl-l-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride (BLG-NCA) and 3-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysine N-carboxyanhydride (ZLys-NCA) and the subsequent deprotection. The chemical structure of the P(Glu-co-Lys)s was confirmed by NMR. Critical aggregation concentration and transmission electron microscopy measurements indicated that the P(Glu-co-Lys)s could self-assemble into aggregates in phosphate buffer. The surface charge of P(Glu-co-Lys) aggregates was greatly affected by the solution’s pH and l-glutamic acid/l-lysine ratio because the carboxyl and amino groups present on the P(Glu-co-Lys) aggregates could be protonated or deprotonated to become charged. The pH value of the solution at which the surface charge of the P(Glu-co-Lys) aggregates reversed could be manipulated by the feed ratio of BLG-NCA and ZLys-NCA. In vitro methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assays demonstrated that negatively charged P(Glu-co-Lys)s were nontoxic and biocompatible. Positive charged P(Glu-co-Lys)s showed some cytotoxicity to Hela cells. Cisplatin (CDDP) was used as a model anticancer drug to evaluate the charge-reversal drug delivery system. By the manipulation of CDDP loading content, the surface charge of the CDDP/P(Glu-co-Lys) nanoparticles could be reversed to positive from negative at tumor extracellular pH (pHₑ 6.5–7.2). An enhanced drug uptake and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation were observed for the tumoral pHₑ triggered charge-reversal CDDP/P(Glu-co-Lys) drug delivery system. These indicated that the CDDP/P(Glu-co-Lys) nanoparticles could be used as intelligent drug delivery systems for cancer therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3achemical structure 3acisplatin 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3aphosphates 3apolymerization 3apolypeptides 3atetrazolium 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aTang, Zhaohui1 aZhang, Xuefei1 aYu, Haiyang1 aSun, Hai1 aPang, Xuan1 aChen, Xuesi0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 June 10, v. 14, no. 6 p.2023-2032dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm400358z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245012900206300001200335506007600347520157500423592002801998506003702026650001702063650002202080650001402102650001202116650001302128650002502141650001502166650001402181650002302195650002202218650001402240650001502254650002002269650002402289650001802313650001102331650001902342650001902361650002302380650001202403650001302415650001702428650001502445650000902460650002102469650001302490700001602503700001202519700005202531773012002583856008202703852000902785655001202794IND60619535120221207135535.0191213e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061953512DNAL7 a10.1186/s13068-018-1298-22doi7 aPMC62114292pmcid7 a304105732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fengcheng12aA novel FC17/CESA4 mutation causes increased biomass saccharification and lodging resistance by remodeling cell wall in rice  ap. 298.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Rice not only produces grains for human beings, but also provides large amounts of lignocellulose residues, which recently highlighted as feedstock for biofuel production. Genetic modification of plant cell walls can potentially enhance biomass saccharification; however, it remains a challenge to maintain a normal growth with enhanced lodging resistance in rice. RESULTS: In this study, rice (Oryza sativa) mutant fc17, which harbors the substitution (F426S) at the plant-conserved region (P-CR) of cellulose synthase 4 (CESA4) protein, exhibited slightly affected plant growth and 17% higher lodging resistance compared to the wild-type. More importantly, the mutant showed a 1.68-fold enhancement in biomass saccharification efficiency. Cell wall composition analysis showed a reduction in secondary wall thickness and cellulose content, and compensatory increase in hemicelluloses and lignin content. Both X-ray diffraction and calcofluor staining demonstrated a significant reduction in cellulose crystallinity, which should be a key factor for its high saccharification. Proteomic profiling of wild-type and fc17 plants further indicated a possible mechanism by which mutation induces cellulose deposition and cell wall remodeling. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that CESA4 P-CR site mutation affects cell wall features especially cellulose structure and thereby causes enhancement in biomass digestion and lodging resistance. Therefore, CESA4 P-CR region is promising target for cell wall modification to facilitate the breeding of bioenergy rice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3aX-ray diffraction 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3abreeding 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acellulose synthase 3acrystal structure 3adigestion 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3agenetic engineering 3ahemicellulose 3ahumans 3alignin content 3alignocellulose 3alodging resistance 3amutants 3amutation 3aplant growth 3aproteomics 3arice 3asaccharification 3astaining1 aLiu, Sitong1 aXu, Hai1 aXu, Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8387-101X0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.298-298dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1298-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002400111040001800135100001900153245009200172300001600264520198000280592002802260650002302288650001902311650002802330650003002358650006002388650002602448650002602474650002802500650003902528650003202567653002902599653001402628653001002642653001902652653000802671700002102679773010302700852000902803856007102812655001202883IND4417868420221120041938.0200516e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441786842DNAL7 a189591522pmid7 a10.3852/08-0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Patricia10aDevelopment and evaluation of a real-time quantitative PCR assay for Aspergillus flavus  ap. 683-690.  aAspergillus flavus is a ubiquitous mold and the most common mold contaminating foodstuffs. Many strains of A. flavus produce aflatoxins. In addition it is an allergen and an opportunistic pathogen of animals and plants. A. flavus often is underestimated in traditional culture analyses due to the expertise required and the cost associated with speciating members of the genus Aspergillus. The goal of this study was to develop and validate a primer and probe set for the rapid detection and quantitation of A. flavus in pure culture using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) amplification. Unique DNA regions were located in the genome of the target organism by sequence comparison with the GenBank database, and several candidate oligonucleotides were identified from the scientific literature for potential use with the TaqMan® QPCR technology. Three primer and probe sets were designed and validated for specificity and sensitivity in laboratory experiments. Initial screening to test for sensitivity was performed with seven A. flavus isolates and selected nontarget fungi. Specificity testing was conducted with the selected primer and probe set, which amplified all nine A. flavus isolates tested, including an aflatoxin producing strain. The primers did not amplify DNA extracted from 39 other fungal species (comprising 16 genera), including 18 other Aspergillus species and six Penicillium species. No amplification of human or bacterial DNA was observed; however cross-reactivity was observed with Aspergillus oryzae. PCR analysis of DNA dilutions and the use of an internal positive control demonstrated that 67% of the fungal DNA samples assayed contained PCR inhibitors. The assay validated for the target organism is capable of producing PCR results in less than 1 h after DNA extraction. The results of this research demonstrate the capabilities of QPCR for the enhanced detection and enumeration of fungi of significance to human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3afood pathogens 3apathogen identification 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAspergillus flavusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aanalytical/rapid methods 0adetection 0aFungi 0aidentification 0aPCR1 aButtner, Mark P.0 tMycologia.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 100, no. 5 p.683-690dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3852/08-0223Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01370naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002100135024001900156040001800175100002100193245011800214300001200332506007600344520031200420592002800732506003700760650001300797650001100810650001100821650002500832773010300857856008700960852000901047655001201056IND60119451120221207062958.0141214e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011945112DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2001-2-6-reviews20012doi7 aPMC1389452pmcid7 a114230142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemple, Colin AM10aBases and spaces: resources on the web for accessing the draft human genome - II - After publication of the draft  ap. 173.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe volume of human genome sequence and the variety of web-based tools to access it continue to grow at an impressive rate, but a working knowledge of certain key resources can be sufficient to get the most from your genome.

Species-specific restriction fragment patterns (both nrDNA and cpDNA) were established as markers, and synthetic hybrids of known parentage were utilized to determine that the chloroplast genome is maternally inherited. Of 89 mature natural hybrids examined, approximately two thirds were mothered byP. drummondii, the outcrosser. That the outcrosser should mother most hybrids is expected since it is dependent upon incoming pollen for fertilization, and hybrids may result when heterospecific pollen is received. The fact that the highly selfingP. cuspidata mothered nearly one third of the hybrids is surprising, and may be related to both pre-zygotic and post-zygotic factors. Which species mothers hybrids has important implications for the potential for introgression as well as its direction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolemoniaceae 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplast genome 3ahybrids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aintrogression 3amothers 3aoutcrossing 3aparentage 3apollen1 aLevin, Donald A.1 aJansen, Robert K.0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g1999 Mar., v. 218, no. 1-2 p.153-158dSpringer-Verlagx0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF010870433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245009800163300001400261500001400275520151500289592002801804650002001832650001701852650001601869650001401885650001301899650001501912650002701927650001601954650001301970650002301983650002502006650001602031653001602047653001802063653003302081700002602114700002602140700002102166700001602187700001802203773014702221856007502368852000902443655001202452IND60710074820221118033704.0200908e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071007482DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.114192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdedara, Arjun B.10aEffect of different temperature humidity indices on antioxidant parameters in Surti buffaloes  ap. 29-32.  aNAL-light  aThe present study was conducted on 20 Surti buffalo heifers of 16 to 21 months age maintained under standard feeding and management practices.

For Group I, Group II and Group III, concentration of SOD (U) was 5.29±0.06, 4.65±0.04 and 2.94±0.09; GPx (U/ml) was 43.63±0.71, 36.40±0.56 and 25.84±1.00; catalase (μmoles/min/ml) was 1,609.17±45.93, 1,322.00±18.65 and 1,106.35±45.07; LPO (nM of MDA/ml of packed cells) was 6.00±0.13, 3.45±0.09 and 2.87±0.14 and TAS (mmol/l) was 5.18±0.11, 2.90±0.09 and 2.37±0.13, respectively. Significantly (P<0.01) higher levels of SOD, GPx, catalase, TAS and LPO were observed in hot dry season (THI₁) as compared to hot humid (THI₂) and comfortable (THI₃)seasons. Increased levels of SOD, GPx, catalase, TAS and LPO indicated that hot dry season is more stressful for animals as compared to hot humid season in Surti buffaloes astheyareinhabitants of hot humid region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3abuffaloes 3acatalase 3adry season 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahumid zones 3ahumidity 3alipid peroxidation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atemperature 0aHeat stress 0aSurti buffalo 0aTemperature humidity indices1 aChaudhary, Sandhya S.1 aSingh, Virendra Kumar1 aPatel, Pankaj A.1 aPuri, Gopal1 aKharadi, V.B.0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2018 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.29-32dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.114193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01564naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245014000167300001600307500001500323520045300338592002800791650002200819650002000841650001000861650001400871651000900885651002100894653004700915653001200962653001900974653001400993653001501007773009401022856007701116852000901193655001201202IND60520413420221120201035.0160520e20130731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052041342DNAL7 a10.2478/pbj-2013-00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKürschner, Harald,10aJubula Hutchinsiae Subsp.

Due to the increased market demand, the production of PUFAs from potential alternative sources such as microalgae is receiving increased interest.The aim of this study was to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the biotechnological production of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) from the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, followed by the identification of avenues to improve its environmental profile. The LCA tackles two production schemes of P. tricornutum PUFAs with an EPA content of 36%: lab and pilot scales.The results at lab scale show that both the electricity requirements and the production of the extraction agent (chloroform) have significant influence on the life cycle environmental performance of microalgal EPA production. An alternative method based on hexane was proposed to replace chloroform and environmental benefits were identified.Regarding the production of EPA at pilot scale, three main environmental factors were identified: the production of the nitrogen source required for microalgae growing, the transport activities and electricity requirements. Improvement alternatives were proposed and discussed concerning: a) the use of nitrogen based fertilizers, b) the valorization of the residual algal paste as soil conditioner and, c) the anaerobic digestion of the residual algal paste for bioenergy production.Encouraging environmental benefits could be achieved if sodium nitrate was substituted by urea, calcium nitrate or ammonium nitrate, regardless the category under assessment. In contrast, minor improvement was found when valorizing the residual algal paste as mineral fertilizer, due to its overall low content in N and P. Concerning the biogas production from the anaerobic digestion, the improvement on the environmental profile was also limited due to the discrepancy between the potential energy production from the algal paste and the high electricity requirements in the culturing and extraction stages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aammonium nitrate 3aanaerobic digestion 3achloroform 3aecosystem services 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3ahexane 3ahuman health 3alife cycle assessment 3amarkets 3amicroalgae 3amineral fertilizers 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apastes 3asodium nitrate 3asoil conditioners 3aurea 2aBioreactors 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aDiatomsxmetabolism 2aEicosapentaenoic Acidxbiosynthesis 2aEnvironment 2aMicroalgaexmetabolism 2aNitrogen Compoundsxmetabolism 2aPilot Projects 0aEnvironmental assessment 0aMarine eukaryotic microalgae 0aLife cycle assessment 0aLife cycle inventory (LCI) 0aPUFAs 0aEPA1 aGonzález-García, Sara1 aAllewaert, Céline1 aVerween, Annick1 aMurray, Patrick1 aFeijoo, Gumersindo1 aMoreira, Mª Teresa0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 466-467 p.991-1002dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009900167300001500266500001900281520113500300592002801435650002301463650001301486650002401499650002401523650001501547650001301562650001901575650000901594650001401603700001601617700001501633700002001648700002601668700006101694700005701755700005701812773012001869856008201989852000902071655001202080IND60723048620221121022354.0210111e20200909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072304862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.0c005632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarkar, Amrita10aRapid Synthesis of Silk-Like Polymers Facilitated by Microwave Irradiation and Click Chemistry  ap. 95-105.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSilk is a natural fiber that surpasses most man-made polymers in its combination of strength and toughness. Silk fibroin, the primary protein component of silk, can be synthetically mimicked by a linear copolymer with alternating rigid and soft segments. Strategies for chemical synthesis of such silk-like polymers have persistently resulted in poor sequence control, long reaction times, and low molecular weights. Here, we present a two-stage approach for rapidly synthesizing silk-like polymers with precisely defined rigid blocks. This approach utilizes solid-phase peptide synthesis to create uniform oligoalanine “prepolymers”, followed by microwave-assisted step-growth polymerization with bifunctional poly(ethylene glycol). Multiple coupling chemistries and reaction conditions were explored, with microwave-assisted click chemistry yielding polymers with Mw ∼ 14 kg/mol in less than 20 min. These polymers formed antiparallel β-sheets and nanofibers, which is consistent with the structure of natural silk fibroin. Thus, our strategy demonstrates a promising modular approach for synthesizing silk-like polymers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3afibroins 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3ananofibers 3apeptides 3apolymerization 3asilk 3asynthesis1 aEdson, Cody1 aTian, Ding1 aFink, Tanner D.1 aCianciotti, Katherine1 aGross, Richard A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5050-31621 aBae, Chulsung1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9026-33191 aZha, R.

The sorghum Dry Stalk (D) locus controls a qualitative difference between juicy green (dd) and dry white (D‐) stalks and midribs, and co‐localizes with a quantitative trait locus for sugar yield. Here, we apply fine‐mapping and genome‐wide association study (GWAS) to identify a candidate gene underlying D, and use nearly isogenic lines (NILs) to characterize the transcriptional, compositional, and agronomic effects of variation at the D locus. The D locus was fine‐mapped to a 36 kb interval containing four genes. One of these genes is a NAC transcription factor that contains a stop codon in the NAC domain in the recessive (dd) parent. Allelic variation at D affects grain yield, sugar yield, and biomass composition in NILs. Green midrib (dd) NILs show reductions in lignin in stalk tissue and produce higher sugar and grain yields under well‐watered field conditions. Increased yield potential in dd NILs is associated with increased stalk mass and moisture, higher biomass digestibility, and an extended period of grain filling. Transcriptome profiling of midrib tissue at the 4–6 leaf stages, when NILs first become phenotypically distinct, reveals that dd NILs have increased expression of a miniature zinc finger (MIF) gene. MIF genes dimerize with and suppress zinc finger homeodomain (ZF‐HD) transcription factors, and a ZF‐HD gene is associated with midrib color variation in a GWAS analysis across 1,694 diverse sorghum inbreds. A premature stop codon in a NAC gene is the most likely candidate polymorphism underlying the sorghum D locus. More detailed understanding of the sorghum D locus could help improve agronomic potential in cereals.  aPublisher supplied data  cOffice of Science (BER)  aDE‐SC0012400cU.S. Department of Energy 3aSorghum bicolor 3aallelic variation 3abiomass 3acolor 3adigestibility 3aforage 3agenome-wide association study 3agrain yield 3agrasses 3ainbreeding 3aleaves 3alignin 3aloci 3aquantitative trait loci 3astop codon 3asugars 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3azinc finger motif1 aZhao, Yunjun1 aBurks, Payne1 aPauly, Markus1 aBrown, Patrick J.0 tPlant direct.g2018 July, v. 2, no. 7 p.e00070-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245009500175300001800270520175400288592002802042650001202070650001802082650001502100650002002115650001602135650002102151653002302172653002002195653002002215653002402235653002402259653002002283653002302303700001702326700001302343773013302356856008502489852000902574655001202583IND60573693320221119144836.0170724e20170902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057369332DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2016.12631432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTumen-Ulzii, Ganbat10aManufacturing nanofibrous bundles and the roller drafting effects on the bundle properties  ap. 1556-1562.  aThis research reports a new product form made of nanofibers and the method used to produce it. Nanofibers are electrospun into a web form on a moving collector and the web is continuously transformed into a bundle by passage through a condenser. Since the web is made of loops of nanofibers and peeled off from the collector surface, the condensed bundle deforms very easily and is too weak for further processing. Thus, the bundle is drafted through a roller drafting system to improve the fiber array in the bundle length direction in various levels of draft temperature, since the temperature may affect the bundle drafting process and thus the bundle properties. Using a newly designed system, we tried to produce nanofibrous bundle of polyvinylidiene difluoride. The nanofiber arrangement and the tensile properties of the bundle were measured before and after the roller drafting process under various conditions. Results showed that the technology suggested in this paper had the feasibility to manufacture a new product form composed of nanofibers, which implied the possible improvement of the productivity and product quality. Thickness reduction of the bundle occurring during the roller drafting straightened the nanofiber loops in the bundle and rearranged the nanofibers along the bundle axis. The drafting process was affected by the process temperature. Uni-axial tensile tests demonstrated that the bundle strength reached 4.8 cN/tex, and the strain at breakage was 0.087, when the draft ratio was 4.0 and the temperature 110 °C, whereas the raw nanofiber bundle in process had a strength of 0.014 cN/tex and the strain at breakage of 0.65. The thickness of the constituent nanofibers was not significantly affected by drafting.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3amanufacturing 3ananofibers 3aproduct quality 3atemperature 3atensile strength 0aNanofibrous bundle 0aroller drafting 0ananofiber loops 0afiber rearrangement 0athickness reduction 0abundle strength 0astrain at breakage1 aLim, Jung Ho1 aHuh, You0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2017 Sept. 2, v. 108, no. 9 p.1556-1562dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2016.12631433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03106naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245024100167300001600408520139800424592002801822650001501850650002201865650001401887650001201901650001301913650000901926650001401935650001701949650001601966650001001982650002701992650001302019650001402032650001202046650001502058653002902073653002002102653001902122653002702141653003102168700002602199700001902225700002102244700002102265700002502286700001802311700002002329773012602349856008002475852000902555655001202564IND60520659820221122204327.0160522e20141230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052065982DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2014-00292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeibuss, Roberts10aAnaesthesia Management with Deep Hypothermia and Circulatory Arrest During Surgery for Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension / Anestēzija Pie Plaušu Artēruas Endarterektomijas Dziļā Hipotermuā Ar Cirkulācijas Apiurēšanu  ap. 232-236.  aChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) occurs in 1 to 4% after acute pulmonary embolism. CTEPH can be cured by pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), which is approved golden standard in chronic condition. There were performed three cases of PEA in Latvian Cardiology Centre during 2013-2014. General anaesthesia under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrests was provided. The core issue is correct patient selection (in terms of central PA obstruction by thrombus) as well as pulmonary circulation recovery capacity. Neuroprotection was provided by deep hypothermia, topical cooling of the head, Trendelenburg position, mild hypocapnia, Hb 9-10 g/L and pharmacological agents. For screening postoperative cognitive function the mini mental state examination (MMSE) was used before and after the surgery. Postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance index decreased by 56.3% (right ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 93.3 ± 25.7 to 44.5 ± 11.2 mmHg). Before the surgery three patients had NYHA functional class III or IV, at the time of discharge - I or II. In one case moderate (MMSE 18) cognitive disorders was observed at discharge from the ICU. No one died neither in the hospital nor within 30 days of discharge. The surgery improved RV function and pulmonary perfusion with no considerable organ failure, except mild cognitive disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3ablood circulation 3acognition 3acooling 3aembolism 3ahead 3ahospitals 3ahypertension 3ahypothermia 3alungs 3aneuroprotective effect 3apatients 3ascreening 3asurgery 3athrombosis 0apulmonary endarterectomy 0aneuroprotection 0acardiac bypass 0apulmonary hypertension 0aneurocognitive dysfunction1 aKalējs, Mārtiēņš1 aSkride, Andris1 aBekkers, Mihails1 aOzoliņa, Agnese1 aStradiņš, Pēteris1 aStrīķe, Eva1 aLācis, Romāns0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2014 Dec. 30, v. 68, no. 5-6 p.232-236dDe Gruyter Openx1407-009X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2014-00293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010300171300001200274520101500286592002801301650002401329650001501353650001301368650001701381650001301398650001901411650002001430650002801450650003101478650003001509650001801539650001501557650001901572650001801591650002401609650001301633650001101646650002201657650001601679650001001695651001201705653002001717653003101737653001301768653001801781700002301799700002001822773009501842856008501937852000902022655001202031IND60622836920221122084136.0210105e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062283692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2018.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, Mary C.10aImpact of ethanedinitrile rates and application method on nutsedge species and tomato root galling  ap. 1-6.  aThe pre-plant soil fumigant ethanedinitrile (EDN) has shown promising activity against several key pests including plant-parasitic nematodes, a variety of weeds, and soil-borne pathogens. With chemical properties similar to those of methyl bromide, EDN has the potential to move readily through the soil profile. EDN is being investigated as a pre-plant soil fumigant alternative to current industry standards for Florida plasticulture vegetable production. EDN was applied via shank injection, vapor, and drip irrigation. Control of nutsedge species and plant-parasitic nematode species was determined and compared to a non-treated control and a mixture of 39% 1,3-dichloropropene and 59.6% chloropicrin (1,3-D:Pic) in tomato and watermelon. In these studies, EDN performed as well as 1,3-D:Pic and significantly better than the nontreated control against nutsedge species. EDN applied as a vapor resulted in significantly increased nematode incidence at one location when compared with most other treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,3-dichloropropene 3aCyperaceae 3aNematoda 3achloropicrin 3aindustry 3amethyl bromide 3amicroirrigation 3aorganobromine compounds 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3aplasticulture 3aroot galls 3asoil fumigants 3asoil profiles 3asoil-borne diseases 3atomatoes 3avapors 3avegetable growing 3awatermelons 3aweeds 3aFlorida 0aEthanedinitrile 0aMethyl bromide alternative 0aNutsedge 0aSoil fumigant1 aFreeman, Joshua H.1 aBoyd, Nathan S.0 tCrop protection.g2019 Feb., v. 116 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2018.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02318naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013200154520123800286592002801524650002001552650001601572650003101588650001101619650001601630650000901646651001101655700001301666700001501679700001601694700001501710700001401725700001701739773011801756856007301874852000901947655001201956IND60653352120221119071833.0190714e20180526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065335212DNAL7 a10.3390/w100606942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Aili13aAn Integrated Simulation, Inference and Optimization Approach for Groundwater Remediation with Two-Stage Health-Risk Assessment  aIn this study, an integrated simulation, inference and optimization approach with two-stage health risk assessment (i.e., ISIO-THRA) is developed for supporting groundwater remediation for a petroleum-contaminated site in western Canada. Both environmental standards and health risk are considered as the constraints in the ISIO-THRA model. The health risk includes two parts: (1) the health risk during the remediation process and (2) the health risk in the natural attenuation period after remediation. In the ISIO-THRA framework, the relationship between contaminant concentrations and time is expressed through first-order decay models. The results demonstrate that: (1) stricter environmental standards and health risk would require larger pumping rates for the same remediation duration; (2) higher health risk may happen in the period of the remediation process; (3) for the same environmental standard and acceptable health-risk level, the remediation techniques that take the shortest time would be chosen. ISIO-THRA can help to systematically analyze interaction among contaminant transport, remediation duration, and environmental and health concerns, and further provide useful supportive information for decision makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3agroundwater 3ahealth effects assessments 3amodels 3aremediation 3arisk 3aCanada1 aYang, Qi1 aFan, Yurui1 aSuo, Meiqin1 aFu, Haiyan1 aLiu, Jing1 aLin, Xiajing0 tWater.g2018 May 26, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100606943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03754naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009700160300001800257500002000275520198000295592002802275650002802303650001802331650001002349650001702359650001102376650001202387650001002399650001902409650001902428650001202447650001902459650002002478650001502498650002402513650001202537650001402549650001302563650002602576650001302602650002002615650001002635650001402645650003202659650001402691650001702705650000902722650002802731650001802759650001602777650001002793651001202803700002302815700001802838700002002856700002302876773012302899856007303022852000903095655001203104IND60587817220221122192209.0180102e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058781722DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.134082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerraube, Julien10aIncreased autumn rainfall disrupts predator–prey interactions in fragmented boreal forests  ap. 1361-1373.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThere is a pressing need to understand how changing climate interacts with land‐use change to affect predator–prey interactions in fragmented landscapes. This is particularly true in boreal ecosystems facing fast climate change and intensification in forestry practices. Here, we investigated the relative influence of autumn climate and habitat quality on the food‐storing behaviour of a generalist predator, the pygmy owl, using a unique data set of 15 850 prey items recorded in western Finland over 12 years. Our results highlighted strong effects of autumn climate (number of days with rainfall and with temperature <0 °C) on food‐store composition. Increasing frequency of days with precipitation in autumn triggered a decrease in (i) total prey biomass stored, (ii) the number of bank voles (main prey) stored, and (iii) the scaled mass index of pygmy owls. Increasing proportions of old spruce forests strengthened the functional response of owls to variations in vole abundance and were more prone to switch from main prey to alternative prey (passerine birds) depending on local climate conditions. High‐quality habitat may allow pygmy owls to buffer negative effects of inclement weather and cyclic variation in vole abundance. Additionally, our results evidenced sex‐specific trends in body condition, as the scaled mass index of smaller males increased while the scaled mass index of larger females decreased over the study period, probably due to sex‐specific foraging strategies and energy requirements. Long‐term temporal stability in local vole abundance refutes the hypothesis of climate‐driven change in vole abundance and suggests that rainier autumns could reduce the vulnerability of small mammals to predation by pygmy owls. As small rodents are key prey species for many predators in northern ecosystems, our findings raise concern about the impact of global change on boreal food webs through changes in main prey vulnerability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClethrionomys glareolus 3aPasseriformes 3aPicea 3aStrigiformes 3aautumn 3abiomass 3abirds 3abody condition 3aboreal forests 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenergy requirements 3afemales 3afood webs 3aforaging 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aland use change 3amales 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3aprey species 3arain 3asilvicultural practices 3asmall mammals 3atemperature 3avoles 3aFinland1 aVillers, Alexandre1 aPoudré, Léo1 aVarjonen, Rauno1 aKorpimäki, Erkki,0 tGlobal change biology.g2017 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.1361-1373dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.134083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010500170300001800275520126900293592002801562650001301590650000801603650001601611650001201627650001501639650001501654650001301669653001401682653004201696653001301738653002001751653001901771700002201790700002201812700002701834773013301861856008501994852000902079655001202088IND60573693420221119144654.0170724e20170902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057369342DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2016.12648562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmīn, ʻAlī,10aEffects of porosity gradient of multilayered electrospun nanofibre mats on air filtration efficiency  ap. 1563-1571.  aPerformance of the nanofibrous filter media is determined by fibre diameter and pore size distribution of the membranes. In this study, an attempt is made to fabricate a nanofibrous multi-scale filter media by simply varying the layer-by-layer-assisted stacking structure and composition of individual fibres within the single layers. These structural controls of the filter membrane helped to form a skeletal frame-worked membrane with controlled filtration efficiency and pressure drop aerosol particle filtration application. Altering the right electrospinning parameters, layering structure of the membrane resulted in changes in average fibre diameter and pore size distribution, especially in the middle layer of media, while a gradient in pore size and its distribution was created. The results of measurements of pressure drop and filtration efficiency indicated that by changing the gradient in pore size and its distribution in the middle membrane, keeping other layers constant, the pressure drop and filtration efficiency can be effectively tuned. The results suggested that this developed filter media could be used as promising materials for a variety of potential applications in high efficiency particulate air filters with tunable characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair filters 3afabrics 3afiltration 3ananofibers 3aporosity 0aNanofibre 0amultilayered nano-microfibrous filter 0aporosity 0aelectrospinning 0aair filtration1 aMerati, Ali Akbar1 aBahrami, S.

GA coating substantially reduced weight loss, disease incidence, malondialdehyde concentration, and hydrogen peroxide compared to the control. GA coating resulted in significantly higher total phenols, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity in contrast to the control. GA coating also suppressed cellulase, pectin methylesterase, and polygalacturonase activity in contrast to the non‐coated fruit. In addition, GA‐coated apricot fruit had substantially higher catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities in contrast with the control. Similarly, GA coating inhibited soluble solids content increase and inhibited the reduction in titratable acidity in coated fruit. The fruit coated with GA coating also had significantly better sensory and overall eating quality compared to the control apricots. In conclusion, GA could be considered an appropriate edible coating for quality conservation of apricots. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Apricot is a well renowned and nutrients rich fruit. However, apricot has comparatively short shelf life potential due to its susceptibility to rapid senescence and deterioration under ambient conditions. GA is an eco‐friendly and biodegradable coating which is considered relatively cheap as compared with other coating types. In our present work, application of gum arabic [GA (10%)] edible coating maintained significantly higher quality of harvested apricot fruit as compared with the control. The outcomes of the present work are of global significance with respect to apricot industry. So, GA coating could be considered an appropriate edible coating for quality conservation of the harvested apricot fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus armeniaca 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aapricots 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3abiodegradability 3acatalase 3adisease incidence 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afruits 3agum arabic 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aindustry 3amalondialdehyde 3apectinesterase 3aperoxidase 3apolygalacturonase 3ashelf life 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atitratable acidity 3aweight loss1 aAkbar Anjum, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3483-345X1 aNawaz, Aamir1 aNaz, Safina1 aEjaz, Shaghef1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4018-91891 aShahzad Saleem, Muhammad1 aTul‐Ain Haider, Sakeena1 aUl Hasan, Mahmood1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4044-13910 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.e13656-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.136563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245011700173300001600290520126300306592002801569650001601597650001301613650001701626650001301643650002301656650001901679650003501698650001101733650001601744700002001760773010701780856008101887852000901968655001201977IND60572619420221119160410.0170717e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057261942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-016-2788-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Fumetti, Stefanie10aFaunistic assemblages of natural springs in different areas in the Swiss National Park: a small-scale comparison  ap. 175-184.  aSprings are spatially restricted and insular ecotones. In the Alps, topography enhances this isolation. Springs are to a certain extent inhabited by organisms which are adapted to the relatively constant environmental conditions in springs. We examined thirty-six springs in eight different areas in the Swiss National Park (SNP) to understand if the macroinvertebrate assemblages of high-elevation springs are isolated or interconnected communities. We quantitatively and qualitatively sampled the macroinvertebrate assemblages of the springs and monitored environmental parameters. The similarity of the macroinvertebrate assemblages of the springs within and the dissimilarities between the different areas were relatively high; a clear spatial isolation was not evident. The differences of macroinvertebrate assemblages in different areas were explained by substrate parameters: springs in areas at lower altitudes were characterized by organic substrates and many water mite species. High-elevation springs were characterized by coarse inorganic substrates and Trichoptera of the genus Drusus. For spring conservation, it is important to decide on an individual basis if the loss of a single spring will have severe consequences for spring biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoptera 3aaltitude 3abiodiversity 3aecotones 3amacroinvertebrates 3anational parks 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aspring 3awater mites1 aBlattner, Lucas0 tHydrobiologia.g2017 June, v. 793, no. 1 p.175-184dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2788-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03604naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011400171300001400285520220200299592002802501650000902529650002602538650002702564650001902591650001502610650001102625650001302636650001702649650001202666650002502678650002302703650001502726650001502741653000702756653000702763653000702770653002702777653002302804653002502827653002302852653002602875700002202901773010602923856008403029852000903113655001203122IND50070338120221121025247.0190318e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007033812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2013.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRienzner, Michele10aInvestigation of spatial and temporal variability of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity at the field-scale  ap. 28-40.  aThough soil hydrologists agree that field saturated conductivity (Ks) is a key parameter in modelling the dynamics of water flow and solute transport in soils, they also recognize that its variability in space and time is far from being completely understood. In order to highlight the variability of Ks at the plot scale we performed 10 measurement campaigns in three parcels within a 10ha maize field during two subsequent crop seasons and in the fallow periods following them, in uniform conditions of crop, agricultural practices and, to a large extent, of pedological characteristics. This paper reports the outcomes of the measurements, conducted with the Guelph permeameter (GP) and with the tension infiltrometer (TI), along with detailed information on the data and a thorough description of the experimental field and of the measurement techniques. Based on a careful statistical analysis of the dataset and an extensive discussion of the results, the following conclusions were reached.GP Ks show changes in time and space, both between and within the parcels, with a different temporal behaviour for the different parcels, and no evident seasonal cycle. Mean and standard deviation of the transformed GP data samples are shown to be linearly related. This allowed the definition of a model of Ks statistical distribution that elucidates the distinct contributions of soil matrix and macropores, and provides a validation of the Morales et al. (2010. J. Hydrol. 393, 29) concept of biologically-driven macropore dynamics.TI estimations of Ks vary in space in agreement with the soil texture and show a stable seasonal pattern. However, in presence of macropores, they are not representative of the actual values of the saturated conductivity. On the other hand, TI Ks could provide an estimate of the conductivity of the soil matrix. The comparison with the soil matrix conductivity values deriving from the proposed model of Ks statistical distribution seem to support this possibility.These results, that shall be corroborated by further experiments, support the importance of thoroughly investigating the interactions between soil biota, vegetation and the soil hydraulic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ainfiltrometers 3amacropores 3amodels 3asampling 3asoil texture 3asolutes 3astatistical analysis 3atemporal variation 3avegetation 3awater flow 0aTI 0aGP 0aGM 0aHydraulic conductivity 0aField measurements 0aTemporal variability 0aGuelph permeameter 0aTension infiltrometer1 aGandolfi, Claudio0 tSoil & tillage research.g2014 Jan., v. 135 p.28-40dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2013.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011000164300001600274520129400290592002801584650002401612650001201636650001601648650001101664650001301675650002301688650001501711650001701726650001101743650002401754650001201778650001701790700001401807700001601821700001901837700001701856700001301873773009901886856008101985852000902066655001202075IND60556257220221123023741.0161031e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055625722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-016-0370-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Xingyu10aCarbon electrode materials for supercapacitors obtained by co-carbonization of coal-tar pitch and sawdust  ap. 760-769.  aHigh-surface area-activated carbons (ACs) are successfully prepared by coal-tar pitch (CTP)/sawdust (SD) co-carbonization followed by simple KOH activation. The ACs inherit the tubular morphology of the biomass and possess a hierarchical porous structure, a high specific surface area of 2224 m²/g, and a considerable amount of oxygen-containing species on the surface. The AC obtained from the co-carbonization of 67 % CTP and 33 % SD has a 25 wt% higher oxygen content than the AC (0.17 wt%) from 100 % CTP, and has a 27.50 wt% higher carbon yield than the AC (14.42 wt%) from SD. As an electrode material for supercapacitors, the prepared electrode from 67 % CTP and 33 % SD exhibits a favorable specific capacitance of 251 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte. The electrode also demonstrates excellent cycling stability with a retention rate of 93 % over 7000 cycles at 2 A/g and a favorable rate capability with a retention rate of 74 % when the current density increases from 0.5 to 5 A/g. Therefore, the ACs obtained by co-carbonizing CTP and SD have high potential as electrode materials. This route not only enhances the benefit from agricultural wastes, but also reduces the cost of producing electrode materials for supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acoal tar 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aoxygen 3apotassium hydroxide 3asawdust 3asurface area1 aCao, Qing1 aJin, Li’e1 aZhang, Xiaohua1 aGong, Shilei1 aLi, Ping0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 Jan., v. 52, no. 2 p.760-769dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-016-0370-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245008000166300001600246520164000262592002801902650001501930650001501945650001101960650001701971650001501988650001102003650002102014650001002035650001802045650001302063650001002076650001502086650001502101650001802116650002602134650001002160650001302170650001302183650001702196650001602213650001402229650001402243650001602257650001302273700001802286700001602304700002102320700001802341773011002359856008202469852000902551655001202560IND4462388520221120153629.0141111e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446238852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2011.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerris, Ryan A.10aHydrocephalus in an American Miniature Horse Foal: A Case Report and Review  ap. 611-614.  aA 6-year-old multiparous American Miniature Horse mare was presented at 324 days of gestation for evaluation of vaginal bleeding. A manual obstetrical examination was performed and the cervix was found to be open with the fetus in transverse position. The mare was sedated and placed under general anesthesia. Attempts made to mutate the fetus were unsuccessful. A cesarean section was performed and the foal was noted to be in transverse position with marked enlargement of the cranium. The abdominal incision was closed in a routine manner, and the mare recovered from anesthesia without incident. Postoperative treatment consisted of flunixin meglumine, gentamicin sulfate, potassium penicillin, oxytocin, and intravenous fluid therapy. The mare was discharged to the owners 4 days after surgery. A lateral radiograph of the fetus was obtained and confirmed hydrocephalus. On necropsy, it was found that the calvarium measured 59 cm in circumference and was dome-shaped, the neuropil and leptomininges measured only 1 to 2 mm in thickness, the brainstem and cerebellum were reduced in size, and there was moderate distension of the third ventricle with stenosis of the mesencephalic aqueduct. Inflammatory and neoplastic causes of mesencephalic aqueductal obstruction were ruled out by histopatholgy. This represents a classic case of hydrocephalus because of stenosis of the mesencephalic aqueduct, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported in a miniature foal. Further investigation is warranted into the pathogenesis of mesencephalic aqueduct stenosis in foals, which has now been reported in several equine breeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3abrain stem 3abreeds 3acase studies 3acerebellum 3acervix 3acesarean section 3afetus 3afluid therapy 3aflunixin 3afoals 3agentamicin 3ahemorrhage 3ahydrocephalus 3aintravenous injection 3amares 3anecropsy 3aoxytocin 3apathogenesis 3apenicillins 3apotassium 3apregnancy 3aradiography 3asulfates1 aSonnis, Jenni1 aWebb, Brett1 aLindholm, Alicia1 aHassel, Diana0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2011 Nov., v. 31, no. 11 p.611-614dElsevier Inc.x0737-08067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2011.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245011100158500002000269520157300289592002801862596005701890596005701947596012902004650002502133650002402158650001602182650001702198650001202215650001402227650001202241650001902253650002702272650002802299650002002327700002202347773010802369856007202477852000902549655001202558IND60790643020221119182531.0220826e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079064302DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimakawa, Ginga10aChanging frequency of fluctuating light reveals the molecular mechanism for P700 oxidation in plant leaves  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNatural sunlight exceeds the demand of photosynthesis such that it can cause plants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which subsequently cause photo‐oxidative damage. Because photosystem I (PSI) is a major source of ROS, plants actively maintain the reaction center chlorophyll of PSI(P700) oxidized under excessive light conditions to alleviate the ROS production. P700 oxidation is universally recognized in photosynthetic organisms as a physiological response to excessive light. However, it is still poorly understood how P700 oxidation is induced in response to fluctuating light with a variety of frequencies. Here, we investigated the relationships of photosynthetic parameters with P700 oxidation in Arabidopsis thaliana under a sine fluctuating light with different frequencies. As the photon flux density of the light increased, P700 was oxidized concurrently with the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter qL unless the electron acceptor side of PSI was limited. Conversely, we did not observe a proportional relationship of non‐photochemical quenching with P700 oxidation. The mutant crr‐2, which lacks chloroplast NADPH dehydrogenase, was impaired in P700 oxidation during light fluctuation at high, but not low frequency, unlike the pgrl1 mutant deficient in PGR5 and PGRL1 proteins, which could not oxidize P700 during light fluctuation at both high and low frequencies. Taken together, our findings suggested that the changing frequency of fluctuating light reveals the tracking performance of molecular mechanisms underlying P700 oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data  a26450079cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a16J03443cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aAL65D21010cCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) division of the Japan Science and Technology Agency 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aNADPH dehydrogenase 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3amutants 3aoxidation 3aphotons 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3areactive oxygen species 3asolar radiation1 aMiyake, Chikahiro0 tPlant direct.g2018 July, v. 2, no. 7 p.e00073-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04643naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245007300176300001300249520272900262592002802991650001003019650001503029650002603044650002703070650001503097650001303112650001203125650002003137650001803157650001403175650002003189650001403209650001503223650001603238650001203254650003103266650001703297650001603314650001103330650003503341650001203376650001803388650001303406650001503419650001503434650000903449650001903458650001603477650001403493650001703507653001303524653001503537653001603552653001103568653003403579653001603613653001303629700002503642700002103667700002003688700003503708773009603743856008503839852000903924655001203933IND60622837020221122084114.0210105e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062283702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2018.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLancaster, Zachary D.10aEvaluation of quizalofop tank-mixtures for quizalofop-resistant rice  ap. 7-14.  aEffective grass weed control in rice is becoming more difficult due to herbicide resistance. To combat weed resistance a new non-GMO resistant rice is under development. Quizalofop, an acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting herbicide, can be applied over-the-top of quizalofop-resistant rice for selective grass control. Due to the absence of broadleaf weed control from this herbicide, other herbicides will be needed to achieve control of a diverse weed spectrum. Antagonism often occurs when mixing ACCase-inhibiting herbicides with other herbicides; thus, two experiments were conducted to evaluate quizalofop in tank-mixes with common rice herbicides having either grass or broadleaf activity. Both greenhouse experiments were a two-factor factorial where factor-A was quizalofop rate and factor-B was tank-mix partner. The first experiment contained tank-mix partners for grass control with some treatments having activity on broadleaf species as well. The second experiment contained tank-mix partners that when applied alone are not effective in controlling grass weeds. The first experiment included labeled rates of clomazone, pendimethalin, thiobencarb, quinclorac, propanil, imazethapyr, bispyribac, penoxsulam, cyhalofop, and fenoxaprop in tank-mixes with quizalofop at 0 or 80 g ai ha⁻¹ on common grass weeds found in rice production. The second experiment included labeled rates of triclopyr, acifluorefen, carfentrazone, salfufenacil, halosulfuron, halosulfuron + thifensulfuron, bentazon, or 2,4-D amine in tank-mixes with quizalofop at 0, 80, or 160 g ai ha⁻¹. Tank-mix interactions for percent control or biomass reduction were evaluated using Colby's method. Overall, quizalofop alone provided effective control of all grass species evaluated (>90%) in both experiments, except for ACCase-resistant Amazon sprangletop. When quizalofop was tank-mixed with other herbicides, antagonism was observed for various combinations on multiple grass weeds. The acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides consistently antagonized quizalofop in terms of grass weed control and biomass reduction. Likewise, the addition of propanil to quizalofop antagonized the graminicide based on multiple grass species evaluated. Similarly, the auxinic herbicides antagonized quizalofop, with 2,4-D being the most consistently antagonistic tank-mix partner, resulting in reduced control of all grass weeds evaluated compared to quizalofop alone. Overall, the results indicate caution should be taken before tank-mixing quizalofop with other rice herbicides, and ultimately, separate applications may be needed when a diverse spectrum of grasses, broadleaves, and/or sedges are present in a rice field.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aCyperaceae 3aacetolactate synthase 3aacetyl-CoA carboxylase 3aantagonism 3abentazon 3abiomass 3abroadleaf weeds 3acarfentrazone 3aclomazone 3acrop production 3acyhalofop 3afenoxaprop 3agrass weeds 3agrasses 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahalosulfuron 3aimazethapyr 3amixing 3anon-genetically modified foods 3apaddies 3apendimethalin 3apropanil 3aquinclorac 3aquizalofop 3arice 3athifensulfuron 3athiobencarb 3atriclopyr 3aweed control 0aTank-mix 0aAntagonism 0aInteraction 0aACCase 0aAcetyl coenzyme A carboxylase 0aGraminicide 0aProvisia1 aNorsworthy, Jason K.1 aScott, Robert C.1 aGbur, Edward E.1 aNorman, Richardq(Richard J.),0 tCrop protection.g2019 Feb., v. 116 p.7-14dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2018.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158300001800260520138500278592002801663650001901691650002001710650002301730650002101753650001601774650002201790700002001812773014301832856007501975852000902050655001202059IND60771000020221121104717.0220322e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077100002DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta07778c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zedong10aSingle-atom catalysts: stimulating electrochemical CO₂ reduction reaction in the industrial era  ap. 5863-5877.  aCarbon monoxide and formic acid play a significant role in industrial processes and are exceedingly economical C₁ products in electrochemical CO₂ reduction reactions (ECR). To improve the yield and catalytic activity in ECR processes, numerous researchers have optimized catalysts and upgraded the electrolyzer. An increase in the electrocatalytic current density and production yield can significantly enable industrial electrochemical conversion from CO₂ to CO/HCOOH. However, the crucial factor restricting the industrialization of ECR is the lack of high-efficiency catalysts. Thus, the development of efficient catalysts for ECR has been ongoing for decades. Traditional nanostructure catalysts suffer from poor product selectivity, unstable structure, and inhomogeneous catalytic active centers, seriously affecting the industrial process. In contrast, single-atom catalysts (SACs) process a uniform coordination environment of active centers, maximum atom-utilization efficiency, and impressive stability, which are suitable as catalysts for industrial ECR. This perspective highlights and summarizes the designed coordination of SACs to obtain a high yield of CO/HCOOH. Moreover, we discuss the fabrication of the electrolyzer and the method of techno-economic assessment (TEA). Finally, we summarize the opportunities and challenges for ECR in industrial processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aformic acid 3aindustrialization1 aWang, Dingsheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 10, no. 11 p.5863-5877dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta07778c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03971naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015900167300001600326520207700342592002802419650002702447650002702474650002902501650001802530650001602548650002502564650001802589650001002607650001202617650001402629650002002643650001202663650002402675650002402699650004302723650001402766650001902780650001702799650001402816650002502830650001902855653002902874653003302903653001802936653001602954653001802970700001702988700001603005700001203021700001403033700001403047700001803061700001703079700001803096700001603114773011203130856008203242852000903324655001203333IND60581804920221121085151.0190411e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058180492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2017.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Mengmeng14aThe functional characterization and comparison of two single CRD containing C-type lectins with novel and typical key motifs from Portunus trituberculatus  ap. 398-407.  aC-type lectins are a superfamily of Ca2+-dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins, which play crucial roles in innate immunity including nonself-recognition and pathogen elimination. In the present study, two single-CRD containing C-type lectins were identified from swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus (designated as PtCTL-2 and PtCTL-3). The open reading frame (ORF) of PtCTL-2 encoded polypeptides of 485 amino acids with a signal peptide and a single carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD), while PtCTL-3's ORF encoded polypeptides of 241 amino acids with a coiled-coil region and a single-CRD. The key motifs determining carbohydrate binding specificity in PtCTL-2 and PtCTL-3 were EPR (Glu-Pro-Arg) and QPD (Gln-Pro-Asp). EPR is a motif being identified for the first time, whereas QPD is a typical motif in C-type lectins. Different PAMPs binding features of the two recombinant proteins - PtCTL-2 (rPtCTL-2) and PtCTL-3 (rPtCTL-3) have been observed in our experiments. rPtCTL-2 could bind three pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with relatively high affinity, including glucan, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN), while rPtCTL-3 could barely bind any of them. However, rPtCTL-2 could bind seven kinds of microbes and rPtCTL-3 could bind six kinds in microbe binding assay. Moreover, rPtCTL-2 and rPtCTL-3 exhibited similar agglutination activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi in agglutination assay. All these results illustrated that PtCTL-2 and PtCTL-3 could function as important pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) with broad nonself-recognition spectrum involved in immune defense against invaders. In addition, the results of carbohydrate binding specificity showed that PtCTL-2 with novel key motif had broad carbohydrate binding specificity, while PtCTL-3 with typical key motif possessed different carbohydrate binding specificity from the classical binding rule. Furthermore, PtCTL-2 and PtCTL-3 could also function as opsonin to enhance encapsulation of hemocytes against Ni-NTA beads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aPortunus trituberculatus 3aagglutination 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrate binding 3aencapsulation 3afungi 3aglucans 3ahemocytes 3ainnate immunity 3alectins 3alipopolysaccharides 3aopen reading frames 3apathogen-associated molecular patterns 3apathogens 3apeptidoglycans 3apolypeptides 3areceptors 3arecombinant proteins 3asignal peptide 0aPortunus trituberculatus 0aPattern recognition receptor 0aC-type lectin 0aRecognition 0aEncapsulation1 aMu, Changkao1 aWu, Yuehong1 aYe, Fei1 aWang, Dan1 aSun, Cong1 aLv, Zhengbing1 aHan, Bingnan1 aWang, Chunlin1 aXu, Xue-Wei0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2017 Nov., v. 70 p.398-407dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245010800152300002000260520115200280592002801432650001701460650001401477650001901491650001401510650001301524650001301537650001601550700001301566700001401579700001601593700001801609700001401627700001801641700001701659700001901676700001901695773014401714856007401858852000901932655001201941IND60676008420221117180231.0191113e20191112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067600842DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta09140h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Li10aFlexible, transparent ion-conducting membranes from two-dimensional nanoclays of intrinsic conductivity  ap. 25657-25664.  aThe recent boom in human–machine interaction has triggered a significant demand for flexible and transparent ionotronics. State-of-the-art ion conductors are built by embedding electrolytes in a transparent gel polymer to form an ion-conducting composite, named ion conductive hydrogels or ionogels. Herein, we demonstrate an intrinsic ion-conducting membrane with ultrahigh ion conductivity, flexibility and transparency based on two-dimensional nanoclays of intrinsic conductivity (NICs). The inherently charged and ordered laminar microstructure exhibits an ultrahigh ion conductivity of 0.45 S cm⁻¹ at 80 °C without external electrolytes, which is 100–1000 times higher than that of state-of-the-art ion-conducting composites. The NICs membranes also exhibit superior stability against harsh conditions including organic solvents, high temperature and prolonged dehydration–hydration cycles. We further demonstrate a NICs touch panel that can realize real-time, human–machine communication by drawing and typing. The nanoclays with intrinsic conductivity may open an avenue to electrolyte-free transparent and flexible ionotronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogels 3amicrostructure 3ananoclays 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aWu, Hong1 aHe, Xueyi1 aGeng, Haobo1 aZhang, Runnan1 aQiu, Ming1 aYang, Pengfei1 aShi, Benbing1 aKhan, Niaz Ali1 aJiang, Zhongyi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Nov. 12, v. 7, no. 44 p.25657-25664dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta09140h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007100164300001600235500001500251520170900266592002801975596006302003650000902066650001202075650001302087650001902100650001002119650001602129650005202145650003702197650001602234650002602250650002102276650003802297650003402335650001202369650001202381650001102393653003202404700002202436700002202458773013302480856008202613852000902695655001202704IND60629686620221121033425.0190512e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062968662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-018-1685-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlpay, Gizem10aPersistent BVD virus infections in offspring from imported heifers  ap. 297-302.  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the possible risk of bovine viral diarrhea virus transport from imported live animals. For this purpose, two different groups of animals were sampled in this study. Group 1 consisted of pregnant heifers; group 2 consisted of male beef cattle imported during 2011–2012 and 2015, respectively. Blood samples were tested for pestivirus antigen using a commercial BVDV antigen ELISA. All the pregnant heifers were negative, but 9 out of 412 offspring and 5 of the 332 male cattle were BVDV antigen positive. Virus isolation and also investigation by RT-PCR were carried out by using 14 ELISA-positive samples. At the end of three blind passages, eight non-cytopathogenic isolates were obtained by indirect immunoperoxidase monolayer assay, which were also RT-PCR positive using panpesti-virus primers. After discriminative RT-PCR, all the isolates that were identified as BVDV-1 and 5′UTR-based analysis demonstrated the existence of BVDV-1b (n = 4), BVDV-1f (n = 2), BVDV-1 l (n = 1), and BVDV-1r (n = 1) subgenotypes. There was no BVDV subgroup that is newly introduced into the country. However, detection of persistent infection in calves born from imported animals demonstrates the risk of BVDV virus introduction by imported animals into the receiving country. Viral strains from persistently infected animals were characterized as BVDV-1b, which is predominant subgroup in the country where animals are imported. These results highlight a possible problem for the areas where a BVDV control program is currently ongoing. Additionally, sequences obtained in this study also showed that there are two distinct branches identified in BVDV-1l.  aPublisher supplied data  aproject no: HDP(V)2016/26cUludag University Research Fund 3arisk 3aheifers 3aantigens 3ablood sampling 3amales 3abeef cattle 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aimmunoperoxidase monolayer assay 3asubgenotype 3abovine viral diarrhea 3achronic diseases 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aviruses 3aprogeny 3acalves 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aToker, Eda Baldan1 aYeşilbağ, Kadir0 tTropical animal health and production.g2019 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.297-302dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-018-1685-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245017000198300001800368500002000386520156300406592002801969596004801997650001402045650002102059650002502080650002302105650002702128650001502155650001002170650003302180650001302213650001302226650002602239650001502265650001802280650001502298650001502313650001402328650001802342650002102360651001202381700002002393700002302413700002702436700002302463773012202486856007302608852000902681655001202690IND60672074320221122022254.0191009e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067207432DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.129032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaltsev, Yevhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4710-319X10aFatty Acid Content and Profile of the Novel Strain of Coccomyxa elongata (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) Cultivated at Reduced Nitrogen and Phosphorus Concentrations  ap. 1154-1165.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA novel freshwater strain of Coccomyxa elongata (MZ–Ch64) was isolated from the Zaporizhia region, Ukraine. The identification was based on the phylogenetic analysis of SSU rDNA gene and ITS1–5.8S rDNA–ITS2 region and predicted secondary structure of the ITS2. Phylogenetic analysis placed this strain in the Coccomyxa group, within the class Trebouxiophyceae. The novel strain MZ–Ch64 formed a strongly supported lineage closest with C. elongata. The MZ–Ch64 strain differed from the morphological description of the species by the size of vegetative cells and absence of small mucilaginous caps at one end of the cell. A number of experiments with different concentrations of phosphate and nitrate were conducted to evaluate changes in the resulting fatty acid profiles and biomass productivity. The fatty acid profile and total fatty acids varied significantly under different nutrient deficiencies. The dominant fatty acid during cultivation on standard BBM medium, as well as in phosphorus‐depleted conditions, was oleic acid (to 48.0%–54.6% of total fatty acids). Absence of nitrogen alone, and absence of both nitrogen and phosphorus, led to an increase of palmitic acid (to 24.7%–25.6%), cis‐7‐hexadecenoic acid (to 14.8%) and α‐linolenic acid (to 9.1%–10.1%) in comparison with the control sample. The greatest variation was found for oleic acid (31.9%–54.6%). Thus, this strain can be considered as a potential producer of oleic acid or cis‐7‐hexadecenoic and α‐linolenic acids for biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data  a18‐74‐00095cRussian Science Foundation 3aCoccomyxa 3aTrebouxiophyceae 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3abiomass production 3afatty acid composition 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3avegetative cells 3aUkraine1 aMaltseva, Irina1 aMaltseva, Svetlana1 aKociolek, John Patrick1 aKulikovskiy, Maxim0 tJournal of phycology.g2019 Oct., v. 55, no. 5 p.1154-1165dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl23523x0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.129033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04341naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011500172300001400287520210300301592002802404650001102432650001702443650002302460650002002483650001802503650002302521650002502544650001802569650001102587650001802598650001502616650001402631650002402645650002202669650001202691651001702703651001102720651001002731651002202741700002502763700001702788700001902805700002602824700002602850700002102876700002602897700002202923700002202945700002702967700002402994700002503018700002203043700002803065700002303093700002903116700002603145700002103171700002103192700001903213700002003232700002103252700001703273700001803290700001603308700002803324700002203352773010303374856008503477852000903562655001203571IND60540498020221118000548.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054049802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2014.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranger, Victoria10aLarge-scale spatio-temporal monitoring highlights hotspots of demersal fish diversity in the Mediterranean Sea  ap. 65-74.  aIncreasing human pressures and global environmental change may severely affect the diversity of species assemblages and associated ecosystem services. Despite the recent interest in phylogenetic and functional diversity, our knowledge on large spatio-temporal patterns of demersal fish diversity sampled by trawling remains still incomplete, notably in the Mediterranean Sea, one of the most threatened marine regions of the world. We investigated large spatio-temporal diversity patterns by analysing a dataset of 19,886 hauls from 10 to 800m depth performed annually during the last two decades by standardised scientific bottom trawl field surveys across the Mediterranean Sea, within the MEDITS program. A multi-component (eight diversity indices) and multi-scale (local assemblages, biogeographic regions to basins) approach indicates that only the two most traditional components (species richness and evenness) were sufficient to reflect patterns in taxonomic, phylogenetic or functional richness and divergence. We also put into question the use of widely computed indices that allow comparing directly taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity within a unique mathematical framework. In addition, demersal fish assemblages sampled by trawl do not follow a continuous decreasing longitudinal/latitudinal diversity gradients (spatial effects explained up to 70.6% of deviance in regression tree and generalised linear models), for any of the indices and spatial scales analysed. Indeed, at both local and regional scales species richness was relatively high in the Iberian region, Malta, the Eastern Ionian and Aegean seas, meanwhile the Adriatic Sea and Cyprus showed a relatively low level. In contrast, evenness as well as taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional divergences did not show regional hotspots. All studied diversity components remained stable over the last two decades. Overall, our results highlight the need to use complementary diversity indices through different spatial scales when developing conservation strategies and defining delimitations for protected areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiogeography 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3ademersal fish 3aecosystem services 3afunctional diversity 3aglobal change 3ahumans 3alinear models 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3aregression analysis 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aAdriatic Sea 3aCyprus 3aMalta 3aMediterranean Sea1 aFromentin, Jean-Marc1 aBez, Nicolas1 aRelini, Giulio1 aMeynard, Christine N.1 aGaertner, Jean-Claude1 aMaiorano, Porzia1 aGarcia Ruiz, Cristina1 aFollesa, Cristina1 aGristina, Michele1 aPeristeraki, Panagiota1 aBrind’Amour, Anik1 aCarbonara, Pierluigi1 aCharilaou, Charis1 aEsteban Drake, Antonio,1 aJadaud, Angélique1 aJoksimović, Aleksandar,1 aKallianiotis, Argyris1 aKolitari, Jerina1 aManfredi, Chiara1 aMassuti, Enric1 aMifsud, Roberta1 aQuetglas, Antoni1 aRefes, Wahid1 aSbrana, Mario1 aVrgoc, Nedo1 aSpedicato, Maria Teresa1 aMérigot, Bastien0 tProgress in oceanography.g2015 Jan., v. 130 p.65-74dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2014.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245015500167520099900322592002801321650002001349650002701369650001701396650001301413650001301426650001401439650001301453650001401466650001901480650002301499650001301522650000901535650001801544650001201562650001401574650000901588653002401597653001901621653002601640653001301666653002301679700001401702700001801716700001701734700002001751700001301771773010101784856008701885852000901972655001201981IND60732844020221119112648.0220606e20210930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073284402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1297262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bao10aPreparation of Pickering emulsion gels based on κ-carrageenan and covalent crosslinking with EDC: Gelation mechanism and bioaccessibility of curcumin  aPickering emulsions stabilized by zein/carboxymethyl dextrin nanoparticles were added to the κ-carrageenan-based gel matrix to prepare emulsion gels via EDC - induced covalent crosslinking.

Therefore, accurate and high-resolution maps of pinyon-juniper distribution and abundance across broad geographic extents would facilitate science that quantifies ecological effects of pinyon-juniper expansion and help guide land management decisions that better target areas for pinyon-juniper treatment projects. We mapped conifers at a high (1- m²; i.e., 1 × 1-m) resolution across the majority of Nevada and northeastern California. We used digital orthophoto quad tiles from National Agriculture Imagery Program (USDA, 2013) to classify conifers using automated feature extraction (AFE) with the program Feature Analyst™ (Overwatch, 2013). Overall accuracy was >86% across all mapped areas for ground referencing methods. We provide five sets of full-extent maps for land managers: (1) a shapefile representing accuracy results linked to mapping subunits; (2) binary rasters representing conifer presence or absence at a 1-m² resolution; (3) a 900-m² resolution raster representing percentages of conifer canopy cover within each cell; (4) 1-m² resolution canopy cover classification rasters derived from a 50-m radius moving window analysis; and (5) an example map derived from our canopy cover product that prioritizes pinyon-juniper treatment by significance to sage-grouse habitat improvement. Importantly, the canopy cover maps were developed to allow user-specified flexibility based on their own objectives (i.e., develop phases of expansion). These products improve upon or complement existing conifer maps for the Western United States and will help facilitate habitat management and sagebrush ecosystem restoration through an accurate understanding of conifer distribution and abundance at multiple spatial scales.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtemisia 3aCentrocercus urophasianus 3aJuniperus osteosperma 3aPinus monophylla 3aUSDA 3aautomation 3acanopy 3acomplement 3aconifers 3aecological function 3aecological restoration 3aeconomic sustainability 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aimage analysis 3aland management 3aorthophotography 3apinyon-juniper 3ashapefile 3awildlife 3aCalifornia 3aNevada 0aObject-based image analysis 0aSage-grouse 0aSagebrush 0aFeature extraction 0aImage processing1 aCoates, Peter S.1 aRoth, Cali L.1 aChenaille, Michael P.1 aRicca, Mark A.1 aSanchez-Chopitea, Erika1 aCasazza, Michael L.0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2018 Dec., v. 73 p.148-155dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.06.002  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012100154300001400275520129900289592002801588650002701616650001401643650001301657650001501670650001101685650002101696650001701717650001601734700001601750773012601766856007401892852000901966655001201975IND60764965720221120151027.0220904e20100207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076496572DNAL7 a10.17221/2693-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProkop, M.10aInfluence of droplet spectra on the efficiency of contact fungicides and mixtures of contact and systemic fungicides  ap. 26-33.  aThe effects of droplet spectra, spray volume, and the addition of an adjuvant to the spray solution against <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> were evaluated using contact fungicides, mixtures of contact and systemic fungicides, and a contact fungicide + an adjuvant. Six droplet spectra, ranging from VMD = 183 µm to VMD = 939 µm, were used. The spray volumes were 300, 450 and 600 l/ha for the contact fungicides, and 300 l/ha was used for the mix of contact with systemic fungicides. No significant differences in efficiency were observed between different droplet spectra when used for the mix of contact with systemic fungicide treatments. However, the efficiency of treatments with a contact fungicide significantly increased with smaller droplet spectra. The larger droplet spectra required larger spray volumes for greater efficiency. The addition of the adjuvant (pinolene, 96%) to the spray solution of the contact fungicide caused the efficiency to be similar for all droplet spectra. The effect of droplet spectra is more pronounced in contact compounds. The translocation of the systemic compounds and the ability of the surfactant to improve the coverage with contact compounds may be the main mechanisms that counteract the effects of larger droplet spectra and lower leaf coverage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aadjuvants 3adroplets 3afungicides 3aleaves 3aplant protection 3aspray volume 3asurfactants1 aVeverka, K.0 tPlant Protection Science.g, v. 42, no. 1 p.26-33dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21418x1212-25807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/2693-pps3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245007900206300001600285520153600301592002801837650002701865650001501892650001201907650000901919650001001928650001501938650001101953650001501964650002401979650001102003650001802014650001202032650001202044650001602056651001902072700002202091700002102113700002202134700002602156700001902182773010702201856008102308852000902389655001202398IND60629686920221121023114.0190202e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062968692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-018-0800-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdez, Rene X.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2097-107X10aPredicting development preferences for fishing sites among diverse anglers  ap. 127-135.  aShifting demographics among angling communities mean that managers may need different amenities at fishing sites to satisfy new constituents. Anglers approach recreational fishing from diverse demographic and cultural perspectives which influence the sites they access and utilize. Understanding linkages between landscape preferences at fishing sites and demographics in shaping those preferences can improve plans for providing better fishing experiences for diverse constituents. We began addressing this need with a survey of 811 resident anglers in North Carolina. Respondents were asked to state their preference for development at fishing locations, and choose between pictures of streams, rivers, and lakes with and without visible docks and walkways. We used logistic regression analysis to model preference for development in each of the four contexts, with demographics and fishing practices as independent variables. Anglers who stated a preference for developed fishing sites and chose pictures with docks and walkways tended to be non-White minorities, female, older than average, and fish more frequently. Consumptive anglers, however, preferred the less developed site. These results suggest that should the current angling population continue to age and diversify, more individuals will desire development of user amenities at fishing sites. Development of family oriented sites may successfully attract and maintain key groups of anglers and encourage intergenerational transfer of fishing as a cultural practice.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademographic statistics 3aecosystems 3afemales 3afish 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3arivers 3asport fishing 3astreams 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aNorth Carolina1 aDrake, Michael D.1 aBurke, Conner R.1 aPeterson, M.

Various medicinal plants used in folk medicine have demonstrated wound healing and antimicrobial properties, and some of these species are currently used in commercial preparations. Despite the well-documented and rich tradition of the use of local herbs for the treatment of skin injuries in Samoan folk medicine, their wound healing potential has not yet been systematically studied.Investigation into the in vitro antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts from 14 medicinal plants used in Samoan traditional medicine for the healing of wounds, burns and sores, and their effects on the proliferation and migration of human fibroblasts.The antibacterial activity of these extracts was tested against pathogens associated with infected skin injuries, using the broth microdilution method. The effect on migration, proliferation and viability of human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated using wound healing scratch assay, cell proliferation assay, and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity test.The extracts from Cerbera manghas, Commelina diffusa, Kleinhovia hospita, Mikania micrantha, Omalanthus nutans, Peperomia pellucida, Phymatosorus scolopendria, Piper graeffei, Psychotria insularum, and Schizostachyum glaucifolium inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≥4 μg/mL, whereas C. manghas and P. pellucida produced the same MIC against both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among the antibacterially active species, C. diffusa, K. hospita, P. scolopendria, P. insularum, and S. glaucifolium did not produce toxicity towards the standard line of normal adult human dermal fibroblasts (IC₈₀ > 128 μg/mL). In addition, extracts from Barringtonia asiatica, C. manghas, M. micrantha, O. nutans, P. insularum, and Piper graeffei stimulated significant migration of dermal fibroblasts, while M. micrantha, O. nutans, and P. insularum did not affect cell proliferation at a concentration of 32 μg/mL.The results suggest that the above-mentioned species of Samoan medicinal plants can be used for the development of new wound healing agents. However, further phytochemical and pharmacological research is needed regarding the isolation and identification of their active constituents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBarringtonia 3aCerbera manghas 3aCommelina diffusa 3aEscherichia coli 3aHomalanthus 3aMikania micrantha 3aPeperomia pellucida 3aPhymatosorus 3aPiper 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aPsychotria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adisease incidence 3aethanol 3afibroblasts 3aherbs 3ahuman cell lines 3amedicinal plants 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apathogens 3aphytochemicals 3aplant extracts 3athiazolyl blue 3atissue repair 3atraditional medicine 0aSamoa 0aMedicinal plant 0aAntibacterial activity 0aWound healing1 aVistejnova, L.1 aMerinas-Amo, T.1 aLeheckova, Z.1 aDoskocil, I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7373-13601 aWong Soon, J.1 aKudera, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8940-28791 aLaupua, F.1 aAlonso-Moraga, A.1 aKokoska, L.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2021 Jan. 10, v. 264 p.113220-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1132203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013800197300001600335500002000351520148100371592002801852596003901880650000901919650001401928650002501942650002301967650002201990650001202012650001602024650001302040700001602053773012002069856007302189852000902262655001202271IND60649936420221120113853.0190709e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064993642DNAL7 a10.1111/faf.123752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotwicki, Stan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6112-502114aThe effect of random and density‐dependent variation in sampling efficiency on variance of abundance estimates from fishery surveys  ap. 760-774.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAbundance indices (AIs) provide information on population abundance and trends over time, while AI variance (AIV) provides information on reliability or quality of the AI. AIV is an important output from surveys and is commonly used in formal assessments of survey quality, in survey comparison studies, and in stock assessments. However, uncertainty in AIV estimates is poorly understood and studies on the precision and bias in survey AIV estimates are lacking. Typically, AIV estimates are “design based” and are derived from sampling theory under some aspect of randomized samples. Inference on population density in these cases can be confounded by unaccounted process errors such as those due to variable sampling efficiency (q). Here, we simulated fish distribution and surveys to assess the effect of q and variance in q on design‐based estimates of AIV. Simulation results show that the bias and precision of AIV depend on the mean q and variance in q. We conclude that to fully evaluate the reliability of AI, both observation error and variability in q must be accounted for when estimating AIV. A decrease in mean q and an increase in the variance in q results in increased bias and decreased precision in survey AIV estimates. These effects are likely small in surveys with mean q ≥ 1. However, for surveys where q ≤ 0.5, these effects can be large. Regardless of the survey type, AIV estimates can be improved with knowledge of q and variance in q.  aPublisher supplied data  a255675cResearch Council of Norway 3afish 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3apopulation density 3aspecies abundance 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3avariance1 aOno, Kotaro0 tFish and fisheries.g2019 July, v. 20, no. 4 p.760-774dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867077x1467-29607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/faf.123753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010300204300001400307520134600321592002801667650001301695650001201708650001601720650002001736650001801756650001601774650001501790650000901805650001701814650002901831650001501860653002601875653002001901653006601921700005501987700001702042700001302059700001502072773014802087856004802235852000902283655001202292IND60778058420221118215659.0220523e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077805842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2018.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomayouni, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0214-535610aQuad and compact multitemporal C-band PolSAR observations for crop characterization and monitoring  ap. 78-87.  aMonitoring crop condition using optical satellite indices has a legacy of several decades. Early warning of variances in crop production is vital in mitigating regional and global food insecurity. Adoption of optical vegetation indices for this purpose is widespread, yet cloud cover impedes the acquisition of these data. Although early research using scatterometers and aircraft hinted at the sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) responses to crop development, the implementation of satellite SAR observations in operational crop condition monitoring is limited. In the research presented here, volume-to-surface (V/S) scattering ratios derived from C-band RADARSAT-2 quad and simulated compact polarimetric (QP and CP) imagery are assessed for their potential to monitor crop growth. Both V/S ratios were strongly correlated with optical vegetation indices, including the widely adopted Normalized Difference and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Indices. The changes in the ratio of volume to surface scattering were correlated with variations in crop biomass. The results support the potential of a SAR scattering ratio for crop condition monitoring. In particular, encouraging results were reported for compact polarimetry, a mode that can be implemented to deliver broader swath coverage conducive to regional and national monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3abiomass 3acloud cover 3acrop production 3afood security 3apolarimetry 3asatellites 3asoil 3aspatial data 3asynthetic aperture radar 3avegetation 0aCrop characterization 0aCrop monitoring 0aC-band quad and compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar1 aMcNairn, H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1006-00181 aHosseini, M.1 aJiao, X.1 aPowers, J.0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2019 Feb., v. 74 p.78-87dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.09.009  aDNAL 7aarticle04057naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245011300203506010400316506007600420520215400496592002802650506003702678650002302715650001302738650003102751650001102782650002302793650001602816650002102832650002502853650001902878650001302897650001602910650001102926650002702937650002002964650001302984650002002997653002803017653001903045653002103064653002503085653002203110700002103132700001803153700006103171700002003232700006003252773009703312856008503409852000903494655001203503IND60780483020221207051101.0220809e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078048302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1187762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0635-250410aArtificial infiltration in drinking water production: Addressing chemical hazards using effect-based methods  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aArtificial infiltration is an established managed aquifer recharge method that is commonly incorporated into drinking water processes. However, groundwater sourced from this type of purification method is prone to contamination with chemical hazards. Such an instance was previously shown at a Swedish DWTP where the river water was contaminated by hazardous chemicals during artificial infiltration. Further, there remains a paucity of research studying the quality of drinking water following this type of treatment from an effect-based bioanalytical perspective. In the current study, an effect-based assessment for chemical hazards was conducted for a Swedish drinking water system comprised of two DWTPs fed artificially-infiltrated river water. In this system, artificial infiltration of the river water takes approximately six to eight months. A sampling event was conducted in the autumn season and the samples were enriched by solid phase extraction. A panel of cell-based reporter gene assays representing several toxicity pathways was selected: oxidative stress response (Nrf2 activity), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation, and hormone receptor-mediated effects (estrogen receptor [ER], androgen receptor [AR]). AhR and ER bioactivities were detected in samples collected from the river intake and in the open-air infiltration basins prior to artificial infiltration. However, the AhR activity decreased and ER activity was effectively removed following artificial infiltration. In the Nrf2 and AR assays, no bioactivities above cut-off levels were detected in any samples collected along the entire treatment process of the drinking water production from source to tap. Using a suite of bioassays, the current study highlighted the effectiveness of artificial infiltration in reducing bioactive compounds in this raw river water. Although artificial infiltration is a common purification method in drinking water production, the limited number of effect-based studies evaluating the effectiveness of this method emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the risks and benefits of this water treatment process.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aandrogen receptors 3aaquifers 3aaryl hydrocarbon receptors 3aautumn 3aestrogen receptors 3agroundwater 3aoxidative stress 3apurification methods 3areporter genes 3aresearch 3ariver water 3arivers 3asolid phase extraction 3astress response 3atoxicity 3awater treatment 0aArtificial infiltration 0aDrinking water 0aChemical hazards 0aEffect-based methods 0aIn vitro bioassay1 aMapuskar, Shreya1 aLavonen, Elin1 aOskarsson, Agneta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3134-78111 aMcCleaf, Philip1 aLundqvist, Johan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5693-90070 tWater research.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 221 p.118776-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1187763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245012800177300001600305520095100321592002801272650004401300650001601344650002201360650001601382650001901398650000901417650001701426650002401443650001301467650004401480650002101524650001101545700002301556700001801579773010401597856008601701852000901787655001201796IND60096457420221121093608.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009645742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2010.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMursito, Anggoro Tri10aAlkaline hydrothermal de-ashing and desulfurization of low quality coal and its application to hydrogen-rich gas generation  ap. 762-769.  aThis paper describes experimental research and a fundamental study of alkaline hydrothermal treatment of high-sulfur, high-ash coal from Banten, Java-Indonesia.

The present study aimed to determine the genetic structure of the endophytic and epiphytic populations of Psa isolated from four different Portuguese orchards with distinct abiotic conditions in two consecutive seasons. The results identified several coexisting and highly heterogeneous Psa populations. Moreover, evident changes in population structure occurred between the epiphytic and endophytic populations, and between seasons with a notable decrease in Psa diversity in autumn. This work provided solid evidence that the initial clonal expansion of Psa in Europe was followed by a wide genomic diversification. This perspective is important for the understanding of kiwifruit bacterial canker disease occurrence and Psa evolution, namely when adopting strategies for management of epidemics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinidia chinensis 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae 3aautumn 3abacterial canker 3aendophytes 3aepiphytes 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3akiwifruit 3aorchards 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation structure 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial variation 3aPortugal1 aGarcia, Eva 1 aAres, Aitana 1 aTiago, Igor 1 aVeríssimo, António 1 aCosta, Joana 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 June 20, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80609313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007500139245008400214300001800298500002000316520147400336592002801810596004201838596007001880596009301950650001502043650002302058650001002081650002302091650001102114650001402125650001502139650001502154650001402169650001302183650001802196650001602214700007402230700006702304773012202371856007302493852000902566655001202575IND60672074920221122022008.0191009e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067207492DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.128652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález‐Olalla, Juan Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8053-214310aMixotrophic trade‐off under warming and UVR in a marine and a freshwater alga  ap. 1028-1040.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMixotrophic protists combine phagotrophy and phototrophy within a single cell. Greater phagotrophic activity could reinforce the bypass of carbon (C) flux through the bacteria‐mixotroph link and thus lead to a more efficient transfer of C and other nutrients to the top of the trophic web. Determining how foreseeable changes in temperature and UVR affect mixotrophic trade‐offs in favor of one or the other nutritional strategy, along the mixotrophic gradient, is key to understanding the fate of carbon and mineral nutrients in the aquatic ecosystem. Our two main hypotheses were: (i) that increased warming and UVR will divert metabolism toward phagotrophy, and (ii) that the magnitude of this shift will vary according to the organism's position along the mixotrophic gradient. To test these hypotheses, we used two protists (Isochrysis galbana and Chromulina sp.) located in different positions on the mixotrophic gradient, subjecting them to the action of temperature and of UVR and their interaction. Our results showed that the joint action of these two factors increased the primary production:bacterivory ratio and stoichiometric values (N:P ratio) close to Redfield's ratio. Therefore, temperature and UVR shifted the metabolism of both organisms toward greater phototrophy regardless of the original position of the organism on the mixotrophic gradient. Weaker phagotrophic activity could cause a less efficient transfer of C to the top of trophic webs.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinisterio Economía y Competitividad  aCGL2015–67682‐RcFondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)  aFPU14/00977cSpanish Government Fellowship “Formación de Profesorado Universitario” 3aChromulina 3aIsochrysis galbana 3aalgae 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acarbon 3afood webs 3afreshwater 3ametabolism 3anutrients 3aprotists 3astoichiometry 3atemperature1 aMedina‐Sánchez, Juan Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0991-93311 aCarrillo, Presentación1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3794-42940 tJournal of phycology.g2019 Oct., v. 55, no. 5 p.1028-1040dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl23523x0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.128653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01945naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245006800172300001600240520094000256592002801196650001201224650002001236650001401256650002001270650001501290650001301305700001701318700001501335700001801350700001401368700001401382773010401396856008601500852000901586655001201595IND60096457620221121093631.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009645762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2010.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartolini, C.M.10aApplication of artificial neural networks to micro gas turbines  ap. 781-788.  aIn this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were applied to describe the performance of a micro gas turbine (MGT).

The experimental data used to feed the ANNs were acquired from a manufacturer’s test bed. Though large, the data set did not cover the whole working range of the turbine; ANNs and an artificial neural fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) were therefore applied to fill information gaps. The results of this investigation were also used for sensitivity analysis of the machine’s behavior in different ambient conditions. ANNs can effectively evaluate both MGT performance and emissions in real installations in any climate, the worst R² in the validation set being 0.9962.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3adata collection 3aemissions 3aneural networks 3apollutants 3aturbines1 aCaresana, F.1 aComodi, G.1 aPelagalli, L.1 aRenzi, M.1 aVagni, S.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2011 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.781-788dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2010.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04243naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014900169300001600318520230300334592002802637650002302665650003002688650001902718650001902737650002302756650001602779650000902795650001102804650001802815650001302833650001702846650000902863650002702872650003402899650001302933650001502946650001902961650001202980650001602992653001703008653003003025653002703055653001903082653001703101653001903118653001103137653000803148653001203156653001003168653000803178653000803186653000803194653001003202700001803212700005703230700001803287700001603305700001903321700001903340773010403359856008503463852000903548655001203557IND60722215220221117035253.0210226e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072221522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVockley, Jerry10aDietary management and major clinical events in patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders enrolled in a phase 2 triheptanoin study  ap. 293-298.  aLong-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) are rare, life-threatening, autosomal recessive disorders that lead to energy depletion and major clinical events (MCEs), such as acute metabolic crises of hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, and rhabdomyolysis. The aim of this study was to report a post hoc analysis of diet diary data from the phase 2 UX007-CL201 study (NCT01886378).In the single-arm, open-label, phase 2 UX007-CL201 study, the safety and efficacy of 78 weeks of treatment with triheptanoin, an odd-carbon, medium-chain triglyceride consisting of three 7-carbon fatty acids on a glycerol backbone, was investigated in subjects with LC-FAOD versus a retrospective 78-week period when subjects were optimally managed under published dietary guidelines. Subject dietary reports were collected to analyze the relationship between diet, triheptanoin treatment, and MCEs. Referring metabolic physicians completed a survey on patient management and clinical outcomes before and after initiation of triheptanoin. Before initiating triheptanoin, subjects received a mean daily caloric intake (DCI) of 17.4% from medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). During the study, subjects received a mean of 27.5% DCI from triheptanoin. Protein (13.7% vs 14.5% DCI), long-chain fat (13.1% vs 10.5% DCI), and carbohydrate (55.3% vs 47.1% DCI) intake were consistent between the pre-triheptanoin and triheptanoin treatment periods, respectively.Following 78 weeks of treatment, mean annualized MCE rate decreased by 48.1% (p = 0.021) and mean annualized MCE event-day rate decreased by 50.3% (p = 0.028). A weak association existed between improvement in annualized MCE rate and change in percent DCI from MCT (Spearman rank correlation: r = −0.38; 95% CI: −0.675, 0.016). However, there was large variability in the association and no specific pattern of change for larger or smaller changes in dose. Seventy-two percent of physicians reported that triheptanoin had a clinically meaningful benefit on medical management of their patients.Treatment with triheptanoin at the protocol-specified dose decreased the rate of MCEs in patients with LC-FAOD independently from other dietary changes between the pre-triheptanoin and triheptanoin treatment periods.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01886378.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Guidelines 3aadministrative management 3abeta oxidation 3acardiomyopathy 3aclinical nutrition 3acorrelation 3adiet 3adosage 3aenergy intake 3aglycerol 3ahypoglycemia 3alead 3along chain fatty acids 3amedium chain triacylglycerols 3apatients 3aphysicians 3arhabdomyolysis 3asurveys 3avariability 0aTriheptanoin 0aMedium-chain triglyceride 0aAcute metabolic crises 0aRhabdomyolysis 0aHypoglycemia 0aCardiomyopathy 0aCPT-II 0aDCI 0aLC-FAOD 0aLCHAD 0aMCE 0aMCT 0aTFP 0aVLCAD1 aLongo, Nicola1 aMadden, Megan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5496-51021 aDwyer, Lauren1 aMu, Yunming1 aChen, Chao-Yin1 aCataldo, Jason0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Feb., v. 41 p.293-298dElsevier LtdwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245014100209300001400350520136000364592002801724650002201752650001201774650001601786650001501802650000801817650001301825650001101838650001301849650001301862650001001875650001101885650001301896650001701909650001301926650001801939650001401957651001401971653000901985653000801994653000802002653000802010653001002018653001002028653000902038653000902047700001802056700001602074700002502090773010302115856008502218852000902303655001202312IND60540498720221118000204.0190318e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054049872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2014.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres, Rodrigo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0416-429110aSilicic acid enrichment of subantarctic surface water from continental inputs along the Patagonian archipelago interior sea (41–56°S)  ap. 50-61.  aWe estimated Si∗, the surplus or deficit of orthosilicic acid (DSi) relative to nitrate available for diatom growth, in the Chilean Patagonian Archipelago Interior Sea (PAIS). Si∗ and salinity were negatively correlated in the PAIS because of the mixing of high nitrate, low DSi subantarctic surface water and high DSi, low nitrate continental freshwater runoff. Both the slope and the intercept of this relationship decreased from northern to southern Patagonia, which was likely a consequence of reduced DSi inputs from several overlapping hydrological, biological and geological drivers along this gradient. In general, lower freshwater DSi concentrations were expected below 46°S, and a lower total DSi load was expected from reduced runoff below 51°S. The north–south decreasing DSi concentration trend may be linked to dilutions from a higher proportion of runoff in latitudes with higher precipitation rates (45–53°S), the transition to more resistant granitic rocks and glacial melt-water from the Northern and Southern Patagonia Ice Fields (46–51°S) and a reduced density of volcanoes active during the Holocene (48–56°S). The intensification of a southward DSi deficit may be a forcing factor involved in the reported southward reductions in plankton biomass and a more frequent occurrence of non-diatom blooms in southern PAIS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3afreshwater 3aice 3alatitude 3amixing 3anitrates 3aplankton 3arocks 3arunoff 3asalinity 3asilicic acid 3asnowmelt 3asurface water 3avolcanoes 3aArgentina 0aPAIS 0aDSi 0aDIN 0aDFe 0aSi∗ 0aSAASW 0aLOFZ 0aNODC1 aSilva, Nelson1 aReid, Brian1 aFrangopulos, Máximo0 tProgress in oceanography.g2014 Dec., v. 129 p.50-61dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2014.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05091naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245018800164520262600352592002802978650001903006650001203025650003403037650002503071650002503096650002703121650001503148650001603163650001603179650002503195650001303220650002203233650001303255650001703268650001003285650001403295650001903309650003603328650001703364650001903381650002203400650002903422650001003451650002003461650002003481650001803501650000903519650002103528650004303549650005203592650002403644650001303668650002503681650003803706650003203744651001003776653002503786653001903811653002203830653002203852653001903874700001503893700001203908700001703920700001703937700001303954700001603967700001403983700001303997700001404010700001504024700001504039773011604054856008204170852000904252655001204261IND60707549320221121042550.0201024e20201205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070754932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2020.1132272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yajing10aBaihe Wuyao decoction ameliorates CCl4-induced chronic liver injury and liver fibrosis in mice through blocking TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling, anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation effects  aBaihe Wuyao decoction (BWD), a prescription of Traditional Chinese Medicines, composed of Lilium brownii var. viridulum Baker.(Lilii Bulbus) and Lindera aggregata (Sims) Kosterm. (Linderae Radix), has been used to treat epigastric pain and superficial gastritis for hundreds of years in China. Recently, some compounds obtained from Lilii Bulbus and Linderae Radix had active effects of hepatic protection or liver fibrosis alleviation. Thus, we aim to evaluate the effects of BWD on treatment of chronic liver injury and liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanism.Mice were treated with BWD (low, medium and high dose), diammonium glycyrrhizinate or vehicle by oral gavage once daily, simultaneously intraperitoneal injected with a single dose of CCl₄ (1 μl/g body weight) twice a week for consecutive 6 weeks. Next, all mice were sacrificed after fasted 12 h, and serums and liver tissues were harvested for analysis. The hepatic injury was detected by serum biomarker assay, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The hepatic histology and collagen were illustrated by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Sirius red staining respectively. The antioxidant capacity of liver tissues was evaluated by the contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver homogenization. The mRNA gene or protein expressions related to fibrosis, oxidative stress and inflammation molecules were performed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) or Western-blot.BWD exhibited a good hepatic protection with ameliorating liver histological changes, decreasing serum AST and ALT contents, and reducing hepatic fibrosis with stimulation ECMs (such as Collagen1 and Collagen3) degradation. BWD inhibited hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, promoted matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), MMP9, and MMP12 while suppressing tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1) expression, and blocked traditional fibrosis TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signal pathway. Moreover, BWD exhibited anti-inflammation effect proved by the reduction of liver Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), TNF-α, IL-11 mRNA levels and promoted anti-oxidation effects determined by inhibition of liver MDA and iNOS levels while promoting liver SOD and Mn-SOD.BWD ameliorates CCl₄-induced CLI and liver fibrosis which is correlated to its blocking TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation effects. BWD, as a small traditional prescription, is a promising treatment for CLI and liver fibrosis through multiple pharmacological targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLilium brownii 3aLindera 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acollagen 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afibrosis 3agelatinase A 3agenes 3ahistology 3ahomogenization 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-11 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterstitial collagenase 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aChina 0aChronic liver injury 0aLiver fibrosis 0aSignaling pathway 0aAnti-inflammation 0aAnti-oxidation1 aLi, Ruofei1 aHu, Nan1 aYu, Chunping1 aSong, Hongyu1 aLi, Yida1 aDai, Yujiao1 aGuo, Zhao1 aLi, Meng1 aZheng, Yi1 aGuo, Zhiyi1 aQi, Yajuan0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Dec. 05, v. 263 p.113227-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2020.1132273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009900161300001400260520167000274592002801944650000901972650001201981650001301993650001202006650001502018650001302033650001602046650001902062650001102081650000902092650001702101650001702118653002002135653002702155653001202182653000702194653000902201653002302210653003902233700002902272700002602301700002702327700002902354700003202383700003102415773014802446856004802594852000902642655001202651IND60778058820221118220238.0220523e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077805882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSola, Ion10aAssessment of atmospheric correction methods for Sentinel-2 images in Mediterranean landscapes  ap. 63-76.  aAtmospheric correction of optical satellite imagery is an essential pre-processing for modelling biophysical variables, multi-temporal analysis, and digital classification processes. Sentinel-2 products available for users are distributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) as Top Of Atmosphere reflectance values in cartographic geometry (Level-1C product). In order to obtain Bottom Of Atmosphere reflectance images (Level-2A product) derived from this Level-1C products, ESA provides the SEN2COR module, which is implemented in the Sentinel Application Platform. Alternatively, ESA recently distributes Level-2A products processed by SEN2COR with a default configuration. On the other hand, the conversion from Level-1C to Level-2A product can be generated using alternative atmospheric correction methods, such as MAJA, 6S, or iCOR. In this context, this paper aims to evaluate the quality of Level-2A products obtained through different methods in Mediterranean shrub and grasslands by comparing data obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery with field spectrometry data. For that purpose, six plots with different land covers (asphalt, grass, shrub, pasture, and bare soil) were analyzed, by using synchronous imagery to fieldwork (from July to September 2016). The results suggest the suitability of the applied atmospheric corrections, with coefficients of determination higher than 0.90 and root mean square error lower than 0.04 achieving a relative error in bottom of atmosphere reflectance of only 2–3%. Nevertheless, minor differences were observed between the four tested methods, with slightly varying results depending on the spectral band and land cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaja 3abitumen 3ageometry 3agrasses 3aland cover 3apastures 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3ashrubs 3asoil 3aspatial data 3aspectroscopy 0aSentinel 2A-MSI 0aAtmospheric correction 0aSEN2COR 0a6S 0aiCOR 0aField spectrometry 0aMediterranean shrub and grasslands1 aGarcía-Martín, Alberto1 aSandonís-Pozo, Leire1 aÁlvarez-Mozos, Jesús1 aPérez-Cabello, Fernando1 aGonzález-Audícana, María1 aMontorio Llovería, Raquel0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2018 Dec., v. 73 p.63-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.05.020  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245003100179300001400210520137200224592002801596650003001624650002301654650000901677650002101686650001401707650002301721650001701744650001301761650001501774650001301789650001701802650001401819650002001833650002501853653001401878653002101892653001301913653002501926773015801951856008502109852000902194655001202203IND60722215320221117040240.0210226e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072221532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar-Shea, Antonio L.10aVitamin D, the natural way  ap. 10-12.  aVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin whose main function in the body is the regulation of bone mineral metabolism. In the last two decades, there has been an intensive research for possible vitamin D benefits in non-skeletal health but as today it still remains unclear. The aim of this article is to review vitamin D metabolism and the natural sources to encourage lifestyle changes to avoid deficiency.Universal screening for vitamin D deficiency is not warranted and it should only be done in cases with risk factors for vitamin deficiency. Vitamin D is measured in the body by determining 25-hydroxycholecalciferol; values below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) are considered inadequate. The three sources of vitamin D are the ultraviolet sun radiation, diet and supplementation. The role of vitamin D supplementation out of the osteoporosis treatment and prevention still remain controversial. Healthy sun exposure and diet should be discussed with all patients with vitamin D deficiency and in general population in promoting health. The skin, through solar radiation, is the main source of vitamin D and provides 90% of the body's needs.Changing lifestyle habits, encouraging a controlled sun exposure and proper vitamin D diet is a preventive strategy that should be applied in our daily practice to prevent osteoporosis and other diseases associated with low vitamin D.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aclinical nutrition 3adiet 3ahealth promotion 3alifestyle 3amineral metabolism 3aosteoporosis 3apatients 3apopulation 3aresearch 3arisk factors 3ascreening 3asolar radiation 3avitamin D deficiency 0aVitamin D 0aUltraviolet rays 0aSunlight 0aVitamin D deficiency0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Feb., v. 41 p.10-12dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010500153300002000258520080300278592002801081650001101109650001301120650001401133650002201147650001101169650001801180700001601198700001301214700001601227700001601243700001701259773014401276856007401420852000901494655001201503IND60676009320221120033628.0191113e20191112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067600932DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta09643d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jun10aN-doped CoSb@C nanofibers as a self-supporting anode for high-performance K-ion and Na-ion batteries  ap. 25268-25273.  aHerein, the preparation of CoSb nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanofibers with a raised surface (N-doped CoSb@C nanofibers) via the electrospinning method is reported for the first time.

For potassium-ion batteries, the capacity maintains 250 mA h g⁻¹ after 500 cycles at 1 A g⁻¹, and for sodium-ion batteries, the capacity keeps 413 mA h g⁻¹ after 1000 cycles at 1 A g⁻¹.

Assessments of expected damage provide critical information for flood risk management efforts. The evaluation of potential damages under different flood scenarios through quantification of their ability to provide relative short-, medium- and long-term risk reduction, supports decision-makers in discriminating among several alternative mitigation actions. End-users should be aware of, and knowledgeable about, the limitations and uncertainties of such analyses, as well-informed decisions regarding efficient and sustainable flood risk management will become increasingly relevant under future climate and socio-economic changes. In this context, a method was developed to identify and quantify the role of the input parameters in the uncertainty of the potential flood economic damage assessment in urban areas with low sloping/flat terrain and complex topography using a GIS-based, free and open-source software called Floodrisk. Sets of plausible input parameters for the model’s two flood loss modelling subroutines (hydraulic modelling and damage estimation) were dynamically combined to quantify the contribution of their inner parameters to the total damage assessment uncertainty. To estimate the contributions of each input to overall model uncertainty, the combination of input parameters that minimized the error in the spatial distribution assessment of the extensive damages affecting (downtown) Albenga (Italy), enumerated after the historical Centa River flood of November 5, 1994, was taken as a reference. In this specific case, a high epistemic uncertainty for the damage estimation module was noted for the specific type and form of the damage functions used. In the absence of region-specific depth-damage functions, the vulnerability curves were adapted from a range of geographic and socio-economic studies. Given the strong dependence of model uncertainty and sensitivity to local characteristics, the epistemic uncertainty associated with the risk estimate was reduced by introducing additional information into the risk analysis. Implementing newly developed site-specific curves and a more detailed classification of the construction typology of the buildings at risk, led to a substantial decrease in modelling uncertainty, along with a decrease in the sensitivity of the flood loss estimation to the uncertainty in the depth-damage function input parameter. These findings indicated the need to produce and openly disseminate data in order to develop micro-scale risk analysis through site-specific vulnerability curves. Moreover, this study highlighted the urgent need for research on the development and implementation of methods and models for the assimilation of uncertainties in decision-making processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acomputer software 3adecision making 3aflood control 3alandscapes 3amodel uncertainty 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk estimate 3arisk reduction 3arivers 3asocioeconomics 3aspatial data 3atopography 3auncertainty analysis 3aItaly 0aCBA 0aCV 0aDTM 0aEAD 0aEPL 0aFLORA2D 0aFOSS 0aGIS 0aIDW 0aIQR/M 0aISTAT 0aMAE 0aMU 0aNLCDUS 0aQ-H 0aRMSE 0aRU 0aFlood risk 0aEconomic damages 0aGIS 0aDepth-dammage curves1 aSole, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3265-73681 aAdamowski, J.1 aPerrone, A.1 aInam, A.0 tInternational journal of applied earth observation and geoinformation.g2018 Dec., v. 73 p.220-229dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21448x1569-84327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.06.019  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245016000201300001600361500002000377520120500397592002801602596002901630596004701659650002001706650001501726650002701741650001701768650002001785650003101805650001501836650002201851650003301873650001401906650001601920650001401936650002401950650001801974650001801992651001802010651001802028700002802046700002102074700002302095700006402118773012002182856007302302852000902375655001202384IND60672075220221122021918.0191009e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067207522DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.128972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietrasiak, Nicole1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4636-800610aWhen Is A Lineage A Species?

Despite this importance, their taxonomy and population genetics remain poorly known. We isolated 42 strains of simple filamentous cyanobacteria previously identified as Pseudophormidium hollerbachianum from 26 desert locations in the North and South America and characterized these strains using a total evidence approach, that is, using both morphological and molecular data to arrive at taxonomic decisions. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, we propose and characterize Myxacorys gen. nov. with two new species Myxacorys chilensis, the generitype, and M. californica. We also found distinct 16S‐23S ITS sequence variability within species in our dataset. Especially interesting was the presence of two distinct lineages of M. californica obtained from locations in close spatial proximity (within a few meters to kilometers from each other) suggesting niche differentiation. The detection of such unrecognized lineage‐level variability in soil cyanobacteria has important implications for biocrust restoration practices and conservation efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  cCzech Science Foundation  aDEB–0842702cNational Science Foundation 3aSynechococcales 3aarid lands 3abiological soil crusts 3acase studies 3adata collection 3aecological differentiation 3aecosystems 3agenetic variation 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew genus 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3apopulation genetics 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3aNorth America 3aSouth America1 aOsorio‐Santos, Karina1 aShalygin, Sergei1 aMartin, Michael P.1 aJohansen, Jeffrey R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0794-94170 tJournal of phycology.g2019 Oct., v. 55, no. 5 p.976-996dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl23523x0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.128973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03976naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245011100213300001600324520221000340592002802550650000802578650002002586650002302606650002802629650001602657650001202673650001402685650001402699650001502713650001602728650001102744650001002755650001702765650001302782650002002795650001502815650001302830650001402843650002002857650001902877650001302896650001602909650000902925650001802934653001702952653001502969653001302984653002302997700002803020700002403048700002603072700002203098773016003120856008503280852000903365655001203374IND60722215420221118160508.0210226e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072221542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCelik, Zehra Margot1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4622-925210aEvaluation of malnutrition risk of inpatients in a research and training hospital: A cross-sectional study  ap. 261-267.  aMalnutrition is one of the most important factors affecting the prognosis of inpatients. The aim of this study is to determine the malnutrition risk of hospitalized patients and to examine the relationship between the presence of malnutrition and other parameters.The study included 162 inpatients over the age of 25 who were staying in the hospital's internal medicine service for 7 days or more and who volunteered to participate in the study. A demographic-information questionnaire, consisting of 5 sections, a 24-h food recall record, NRS-2002, NRI and Beck Depression Inventory was given to patients during bedside interviews. After obtaining the necessary permission, the anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameter values of the patients were taken from their files. All statistical analyzes were performed by researchers with the SPSS package program.Of 162 patients (48.8% female, 51.2% male), 24.7% were at risk for malnutrition according to NRS-2002 and 66.7% of the patients were not depressive, based on the Beck Depression Inventory scale. The malnutrition risk was higher (60.0%) in patients who had been hospitalized for more than 15 days (p = 0.010). The majority of those with malnutrition had no problems preventing them from eating (32.5%), were found to be not depressive (52.5%) and were in the normal range of body mass index (57.5%) (p = 0.002, p = 0.034, p = 0.001; respectively). Nutrient intake was lower in patients with a higher malnutrition risk, but the difference was insignificant (p > 0.05). Albumin levels (p = 0.028) and total protein levels (p = 0.015) were significantly lower in patients who were at risk of malnutrition. While overweight patients showed higher levels of serum albumin (p < 0.001), CRP levels were found to be lower in overweight patients (p < 0.001).It was found that the majority of patients with malnutrition were in the normal range for BMI. Nutritional intake and biochemical parameters should be followed closely in patients who are at risk of malnutrition. Depression can be a cause for insufficient nutrition and should be evaluated, particularly in patients whose length of hospital stay is greater than 7 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3abody mass index 3aclinical nutrition 3across-sectional studies 3adiet recall 3afemales 3ahospitals 3aingestion 3ainterviews 3ainventories 3alength 3amales 3amalnutrition 3amedicine 3anutrient intake 3aoverweight 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aprotein content 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 3aresearchers 3arisk 3aserum albumin 0aMalnutrition 0aDepression 0aNRS-2002 0aNutritional status1 aIslamoglu, Ayse Humeyra1 aSabuncular, Guleren1 aToprak, Hatice Selcen1 aGunes, Fatma Esra0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2021 Feb., v. 41 p.261-267dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245011800183300001400301500001500315520102200330592002801352650001601380650001301396650002101409650001601430653002801446700002001474700001901494700001601513773010201529856008601631852000901717655001201726IND60096457920221121093623.0141104e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009645792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2010.06.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehkordi, Behzad Mirzaeian10aSensorless speed control of switched reluctance motor using brain emotional learning based intelligent controller  ap. 85-96.  a2019-12-06  aIn this paper, a brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC) is developed to control the switched reluctance motor (SRM) speed. Like other intelligent controllers, BELBIC is model free and is suitable to control nonlinear systems. Motor parameter changes, operating point changes, measurement noise, open circuit fault in one phase and asymmetric phases in SRM are also simulated to show the robustness and superior performance of BELBIC. To compare the BELBIC performance with other intelligent controllers, Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is developed. System responses with BELBIC and FLC are compared. Furthermore, by eliminating the position sensor, a method is introduced to estimate the rotor position. This method is based on Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The estimator inputs are four phase flux linkages. Suggested rotor position estimator is simulated in different conditions. Simulation results confirm the accurate rotor position estimation in different loads and speeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3afuzzy logic 3alearning 3anonlinear models 3acontrollers 0aartificial intelligence1 aParsapoor, Amir1 aMoallem, Mehdi1 aLucas, Caro0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2011 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.85-96dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2010.06.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245011400204300001600318520123800334592002801572650001101600650002101611650002801632650002601660650002501686650002501711653002501736653002401761653001401785653001201799700001701811700002101828700001401849700001601863700005901879773008701938856008502025852000902110655001202119IND60752932320221120223433.0211123e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075293232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2766-190410aHighly aligned and densified carbon nanotube films with superior thermal conductivity and mechanical strength  ap. 205-214.  aFlexible thermal conducting materials with the combination of excellent thermal conductivity and mechanical strength are highly desired for many practical applications, but meeting this strict requirement remains as a big challenge. Herein, facile preparation of highly aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) films is demonstrated, which involves the continuous production of a hollow cylindrical CNT assembly, followed by in-situ alignment of CNTs through optimizing the winding rate and a further stretching-pressing process. Benefiting from the resultant excellent CNT alignment and high density (1.59 ± 0.05 g cm⁻³), the CNT film simultaneously has a high thermal conductivity of 558.06–700.15 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹, electrical conductivity of 4870 ± 150 S cm⁻¹, mechanical strength of 2.74–2.95 GPa, and Young's modulus of 55.2–58.9 GPa. The combination of such high thermal and mechanical properties is outstanding for carbon-based thermal conducting materials. Furthermore, the CNT material exhibits negligible structural and mechanical decay even after 500 cycles of bending test. Our study provides an effective strategy toward developing new thermal conducting materials for applications under harsh conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3aelectrical conductivity 3amodulus of elasticity 3astrength (mechanics) 3athermal conductivity 0aCarbon nanotube film 0aMechanical strength 0aAlignment 0aDensity1 aChen, Yu Wen1 aShi, Qiang Qiang1 aZhang, Yu1 aMo, Run Wei1 aWang, Jian Nong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2766-19040 tCarbon.g2022 Jan., v. 186 p.205-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2021.09.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03017naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245018100167300001600348520143100364592002801795650002501823650000801848650002101856650002601877650001801903650002101921650000801942650001501950650001101965650003101976650002002007650001002027650001002037650003702047650001102084650001202095650001202107651001202119700001602131700002302147700002002170700001802190700002102208700002202229700002102251700004102272773008402313856008102397852000902478655001202487IND60123736220221120133804.0150331e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012373622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10393-014-0947-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Volker10aCloacal Aerobic Bacterial Flora and Absence of Viruses in Free-Living Slow Worms (Anguis fragilis), Grass Snakes (Natrix natrix) and European Adders (Vipera berus) from Germany  ap. 571-580.  aDisease problems caused by viral or bacterial pathogens are common in reptiles kept in captivity. There is no information available on the incidence of viral pathogens or the physiological cloacal bacterial flora of common free-living reptiles in Germany. Therefore, 56 free-living reptiles including 23 European adders (Vipera berus), 12 grass snakes (Natrix natrix) and 21 slow worms (Anguis fragilis) were investigated on the island Hiddensee in northeastern Germany. Pharyngeal and cloacal swabs were taken immediately after capture. Bacteriological examination was performed from the cloacal swabs to study the aerobic cloacal flora. Molecular biological examination included amplification of DNA or RNA from adeno-, rana- and ferlaviruses as well as culturing on Russell’s viper heart cells for virus isolation. Salmonella spp. were isolated from European adders but not from the other reptiles examined. The minimal inhibitory concentration was determined from the isolated Salmonella spp. However, some potentially human pathogenic bacteria, such as Proteus vulgaris, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were isolated. Viruses were not detected in any of the examined reptiles. To the authors’ best knowledge, the present study is the first survey of viral pathogens in free-living snakes and slow worms in Germany and the first survey of cloacal aerobic bacterial flora of slow worms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aNatrix natrix 3aProteus vulgaris 3aRNA 3aSalmonella 3aVipera 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3acaptive animals 3aflora 3aheart 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3asnakes 3asurveys 3aviruses 3aGermany1 aMock, Ronja1 aBurgkhardt, Eileen1 aJunghanns, Anja1 aOrtlieb, Falk1 aSzabó, István,1 aMarschang, Rachel1 aBlindow, Irmgard1 aKrautwald-Junghanns, Maria-Elisabeth0 tEcoHealth.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 4 p.571-580dSpringer-Verlagx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-014-0947-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012600167300001800293520107900311592002801390650000801418650001901426650001201445650002101457650001001478650001601488650002001504650001101524650001501535650001901550650001001569650001301579650002501592650001301617650002001630650001401650650001101664653000901675653001101684653001401695653002001709653001601729700001801745700001701763700001801780700001501798700001801813700001301831700001501844700002601859700001501885700001701900700001401917773009901931856008402030852000902114655001202123IND60701595720221117030338.0210312e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070159572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.06.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Xiaoteng12aA pan-cancer analysis of the oncogenic role of staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1 (SND1) in human tumors  ap. 3958-3967.  aAlthough emerging cell- or animal-based evidence supports the relationship between SND1 and cancers, no pan-cancer analysis is available. We thus first explored the potential oncogenic roles of SND1 across thirty-three tumors based on the datasets of TCGA (The cancer genome atlas) and GEO (Gene expression omnibus). SND1 is highly expressed in most cancers, and distinct associations exist between SND1 expression and prognosis of tumor patients. We observed an enhanced phosphorylation level of S426 in several tumors, such as breast cancer or lung adenocarcinoma. SND1 expression was associated with the CD8⁺T-cell infiltration level in colon adenocarcinoma and melanoma, and cancer-associated fibroblast infiltration was observed in other tumors, such as bladder urothelial carcinoma or testicular germ cell tumors. Moreover, protein processing- and RNA metabolism-associated functions were involved in the functional mechanisms of SND1. Our first pan-cancer study offers a relatively comprehensive understanding of the oncogenic roles of SND1 across different tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aadenocarcinoma 3abladder 3abreast neoplasms 3acolon 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agenome 3agerm cells 3ahuman diseases 3alungs 3amelanoma 3amicrococcal nuclease 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3aprognosis 3atestes 0aSND1 0aCancer 0aPrognosis 0aPhosphorylation 0aMethylation1 aZhang, Xinxin1 aLiu, Minghui1 aZhao, Chunyan1 aZhang, Nan1 aRen, Yuanyuan1 aSu, Chao1 aZhang, Wei1 aSun, Xiaoming,d1955-1 aHe, Jinyan1 aGao, Xingjie1 aYang, Jie0 tGenomics.g2020 Nov., v. 112, no. 6 p.3958-3967dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245005200174300002000226520120800246592002801454650002501482650001701507650002501524650001701549650001601566650001601582650002001598650001201618650001601630650002001646650001901666650002101685650001301706650001001719650000901729700002801738700006601766700003101832700003101863700002901894773017001923856008102093852000902174655001202183IND60611696920221123024750.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061169692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2741-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález, Cesar Iván10aEffects on Eichhornia crassipes under Zn stress  ap. 26957-26964.  aEichhornia crassipes is a macrophyte widely used in phytoremediation, demonstrating a high ability to remove metals from water. The aim of this work was to evaluate its enzymatic detoxification strategies and metal accumulation when it is exposed to different Zn concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, and 9 ppm) for periods of 24, 48, and 72 h. Zn concentration in roots was significantly higher than in aerial parts. Independently of the treatment, in the first 48 h, concentrations of photosynthetic pigments were not affected. However, a significant increase (between 19 and 34%) in Chl-b concentrations for all treatments was observed at 72 h. Carotenoid concentration was not affected during the first 48 h, while at 72 h, there was a significant increase regarding the control (between 11 and 24%) for all treatments. Malondialdehyde concentration in aerial parts and roots was not affected during the experiment. Nonetheless, a significant increase in the enzymatic activity of the antioxidant system was observed. Results suggest that Zn could have potential antioxidant properties, which may result in the activation of different antioxidant enzymes involved in the protection against metal stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aaerial parts 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3amacrophytes 3amalondialdehyde 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytoremediation 3apigments 3aroots 3azinc1 aMaine, María Alejandra1 aHadad, Hernán Ricardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8664-93821 aSanchez, Gabriela Cristina1 aBenavides, María Patricia1 aCampagnoli, Marcelo Abel0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Sept., v. 25, no. 27 p.26957-26964dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2741-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04099naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245022400173520226200397592002802659650001302687650001402700650002302714650001202737650001802749650001602767650001802783650000902801650001802810650002202828650002002850650001702870650001202887650001802899650001302917650002102930650001902951650001902970650001302989650002303002650001703025650001003042650001603052653001803068653002503086653002303111653002403134653002003158700002603178700002403204700001703228700005703245773010803302856009003410852000903500655001203509IND60726008220221121033642.0220606e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072600822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2021.1063302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValizadeh, A.10aEffects of different rumen undegradable to rumen degradable protein ratios on performance, ruminal fermentation, urinary purine derivatives, and carcass characteristics of growing lambs fed a high wheat straw-based diet  aThe present study aimed to evaluate the effects of various rumen undegradable to rumen degradable protein ratios (RUP:RDP) on the performance, rumen fermentation pattern, urinary purine derivatives, and carcass characteristics in growing lambs when received a high dietary wheat straw level (420 g/kg, DM basis). Lambs (average initial live weight = 27.2 ± 2.4 kg) were individual housed (n = 18, 6 animals/treatment) to evaluate the effects of treatments. The RUP:RDP ratios tested were obtained through replacing extruded soybean meal (ESBM; RUP = 64 %, based on total CP) instead of conventional soybean meal (CSBM; RUP = 26 %, based on total CP) in proportion of 0, 50, and 100 % in order to obtain ratios of (1) low RUP:RDP ratio as LR diet (25:75); (2) moderate RUP:RDP ratio as MR diet (30:70) (3) high RUP:RDP ratio as HR diet (35:65). The study lasted 10 weeks. Dry matter intake did not differ among experimental treatments (P = 0.80), while average daily gain (ADG) and final BW were linearly improved (P < 0.05) with increased RUP:RDP ratio. Accordingly, the lowest feed efficiency observed in LR lambs and it was reduced linearly when RUP:RDP ratio was increased (P = 0.01). Although the amount of nitrogen intake was constant across experimental treatments (P = 0.69); however, the nitrogen to gain conversion ratio was increased as RUP:RDP being increased (P = 0.02). Digestibility of organic matter (P = 0.02) and crude protein (P = 0.03) as well as ruminal concentration of acetate (P = 0.05), urinary concentration of allantoin (P = 0.01), and blood glucose and insulin concentrations (P = 0.01) were linearly increased when lambs received diets contained high RUP:RDP ratio. In contrast, ruminal propionate concentration (P = 0.02) and urinary nitrogen concentration (P = 0.02) were reduced as RUP:RDP being increased. The dressing percentage was increased (P = 0.02) but mesenteric fat content (P = 0.03) and back-fat thickness (P = 0.01) were reduced when diets with higher RUP:RDP ratio being fed to lambs. In summary, high dietary RUP:RDP level is recommendable when growing lambs received wheat straw based-diet due to improvement in nutrient digestibility, nitrogen efficiency, and preventing high fat accretion within animal body.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aallantoin 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3afeed conversion 3afermentation 3ainsulin 3alipid content 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3apropionic acid 3aresearch 3arumen fermentation 3asoybean meal 3awheat 3awheat straw 0aGrowing lambs 0aUndegradable protein 0aLow-quality forage 0aNitrogen efficiency 0aCarcass quality1 aKazemi-Bonchenari, M.1 aKhodaei-Motlagh, M.1 aMoradi, M.H.1 aSalem, A.Z.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7418-41700 tSmall ruminant research.g2021 Apr., v. 197 p.106330-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2021.1063303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245008800167300001800255520095700273592002801230650001601258650001201274650001601286650002201302650001301324650002301337650001301360650001201373650001501385650001701400700001901417700001901436700002401455700001901479700002201498700002901520773011801549856007501667852000901742655001201751IND60549958720171220000000.0160909e20120217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054995872DNAL7 a10.1021/jo20222632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi Paccani, Riccardo10aToward a Stable α-Cycloalkyl Amino Acid with a Photoswitchable Cationic Side Chain  ap. 1738-1748.  aThe N-alkylated indanylidenepyrroline (NAIP) Schiff base 3 is an unnatural α-amino acid precursor potentially useful for the preparation of semisynthetic peptides and proteins incorporating charged side chains whose structure can be modulated via Z/E photoisomerization. Here we report that the heteroallylic protons of 3 led to partial loss of ethanol accompanied by formation of the novel heterocyclic system 4 during attempted deprotection. We also show that the same protons catalyze the thermal isomerization of 3, making the light-driven conformational control concept ineffective for times longer than a few hours. These problems are not present in the previously unreported compound 5 where the acidic methyl group is replaced by an H atom. Therefore, 5, rather than 3, constitutes a promising prototype for the design of building blocks capable to modulate the electrostatic potential of a protein in specific locations via light irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aethanol 3airradiation 3aorganic chemistry 3apeptides 3aphotoisomerization 3aproteins 3aprotons 3aprototypes 3aschiff bases1 aDonati, Donato1 aFusi, Stefania1 aLatterini, Loredana1 aFarina, Grazia1 aZanirato, Vinicio1 aOlivucci, M.q(Massimo),0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Feb. 17, v. 77, no. 4 p.1738-1748dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo20222633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245009300167520193600260592002802196650001502224650002802239650002202267650002002289650002902309650001402338650001302352650003102365650001302396650002602409650001902435650001502454650001502469700002602484700003102510700001902541773012902560856007402689852000902763655001202772IND60704043620221119191604.0200722e20200622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070404362DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121220022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanagiotou, Emmanouil 10aGenerating Elevation Surface from a Single RGB Remotely Sensed Image Using Deep Learning  aGenerating Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from satellite imagery or other data sources constitutes an essential tool for a plethora of applications and disciplines, ranging from 3D flight planning and simulation, autonomous driving and satellite navigation, such as GPS, to modeling water flow, precision farming and forestry. The task of extracting this 3D geometry from a given surface hitherto requires a combination of appropriately collected corresponding samples and/or specialized equipment, as inferring the elevation from single image data is out of reach for contemporary approaches. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years as they can extrapolate rules in a data-driven manner and retrieve convoluted, nonlinear one-to-one mappings, such as an approximate mapping from satellite imagery to DEMs. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end Deep Learning (DL) approach to construct this mapping and to generate an absolute or relative point cloud estimation of a DEM given a single RGB satellite (Sentinel-2 imagery in this work) or drone image. The model has been readily extended to incorporate available information from the non-visible electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike existing methods, we only exploit one image for the production of the elevation data, rendering our approach less restrictive and constrained, but suboptimal compared to them at the same time. Moreover, recent advances in software and hardware allow us to make the inference and the generation extremely fast, even on moderate hardware. We deploy Conditional Generative Adversarial networks (CGAN), which are the state-of-the-art approach to image-to-image translation. We expect our work to serve as a springboard for further development in this field and to foster the integration of such methods in the process of generating, updating and analyzing DEMs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adigital elevation models 3aequipment 3aforestry 3aglobal positioning systems 3aplanning 3aprecision agriculture 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3awater flow1 aChochlakis, Georgios 1 aGrammatikopoulos, Lazaros 1 aCharou, Eleni 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 June 22, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121220023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006000138245009800198500002000296520096200316592002801278596003601306596004701342596004701389650001001436650001501446650002001461650001101481650002201492650001601514650002001530650000901550700006301559700006201622773012901684856007301813852000901886655001201895IND60784424520221120140021.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078442452DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.48722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPace, Crystal L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9339-646710aSequential paired covariance for improved visualization of mass spectrometry imaging datasets  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUntargeted analyses in mass spectrometry imaging produce hundreds of ion images representing spatial distributions of biomolecules in biological tissues. Due to the large diversity of ions detected in untargeted analyses, normalization standards are often difficult to implement to account for pixel‐to‐pixel variability in imaging studies. Many normalization strategies exist to account for this variability, but they largely do not improve image quality. In this study, we present a new approach for improving image quality and visualization of tissue features by application of sequential paired covariance (SPC). This approach was demonstrated using previously published tissue datasets such as rat brain and human prostate with different biomolecules like metabolites and N‐linked glycans. Data transformation by SPC improved ion images resulting in increased smoothing of biological features compared with commonly used normalization approaches.  aPublisher supplied data  cNorth Carolina State University  aR01GM087964cNational Institutes of Health  aR56AG063885cNational Institutes of Health 3abrain 3acovariance 3adata collection 3ahumans 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3apolysaccharides 3arats1 aGarrard, Kenneth P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0654-47761 aMuddiman, David C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2216-499X0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2022 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.e4872-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.48723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01381naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007800169300001400247520035400261592002800615653001300643653002500656653002400681653002300705653002200728700002100750700002000771700002100791700006300812773008500875856008600960852000901046655001201055IND60592148420221122041459.0180330e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059214842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.placenta.2017.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerz, George10aClarification and 3-D visualization of immunolabeled human placenta villi  ap. 36-39.  aWe report here the successful 3D visualization of human placenta villous structures on the order of ∼1 mm³ by a combination of immunolabeling, rapid tissue clarification and laser scanning confocal microscopy.

Two‐μL whole blood samples were collected using “minimal invasive” diabetes lancet and placed on a thin glass rod mounted on a newly designed BloodProbe. The BloodProbe with the whole blood sample was inserted directly into a ChromatoProbe mounted on the GC inlet, and thus, no sample preparation was involved. The analysis was performed within 10 min using a GC‐MS with Cold EI that is based on interfacing GC and MS with supersonic molecular beams (SMB) along with electron ionization of vibrationally cold sample compounds in the SMB (hence the name Cold EI). Our blood analysis revealed several observations: (1) Detailed mass chromatograms were generated with full range of all the nonpolar lipids in blood including fatty acids, cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, vitamin E, monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides. (2) The analysis of whole blood was found to be as informative as the conventional clinical analysis of blood serum. (3) Cholesteryl esters were more sensitive than free cholesterol alone to the effect of diet of obese people. (4) Major enhancement of several fatty acid methyl esters was found in the blood of a cancer patient with liver dysfunction. (5) Vitamin E as both α‐ and β‐tocopherol was found with person‐dependent ratio of these two compounds. (6) Elemental sulfur S₈ was identified in blood. (7) Several drugs and other compounds were found and need further study of their correlation to medical issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acold 3adiabetes 3adiacylglycerols 3adiet 3aglass 3ahematologic tests 3ainstrumentation 3aionization 3aliver 3amonoacylglycerols 3apatients 3apeople 3asulfur1 aElkabets, Oneg1 aSheffer, Gabriel,1 aBuch, Assaf1 aStern, Naftali1 aAmirav, Aviv1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4982-79840 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2022 July, v. 57, no. 7 p.e4873-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.48733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245009000202300002000292520221800312592002802530650002002558650001502578650001102593650001302604650003002617650001502647650001802662650002302680650001902703700001802722700001602740700001702756700001602773773013802789856008002927852000903007655001203016IND60742818620221120093621.0210624e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074281862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c020142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6964-870810aEffect of Particle Size on the Heat Transfer Performance of SiO₂–Water Nanofluids  ap. 13590-13600.  aIt is common to improve heat transfer performance to meet the needs of small volume, low energy consumption, and high heat transfer performance of heat exchangers and mixers in industrial production. In the process of heat transfer, the fluid type considerably influences the heat transfer performance. Consequently, nanofluids—which do not easily cause friction or blockages and which have the advantage of enhancing heat transfer—are used in place of traditional fluids to meet the abovementioned heat transfer requirements. In this work, an experimental system is established to measure the heat transfer performance of SiO₂–water nanofluids. The convective heat transfer coefficients of SiO₂–water nanofluids with different particle sizes are measured. The effects of particle sizes and the Reynolds number (Re) on the heat transfer coefficients are discussed. The results show that the particle size of SiO₂ nanoparticles and Re have an important influence on the convective heat transfer coefficient. By adding SiO₂ nanoparticles with particle sizes of 15, 30, and 80 nm in water, it is found that the convective heat transfer coefficient of nanofluids increases by 36.8, 30.2, and 23.6%, respectively, compared with that of pure water under the same Re. The change in the convective heat transfer coefficient in different regimes is compared. It is found that the convective heat transfer coefficient increases most near the transition point of laminar turbulence. The changes in physical properties of nanofluids with different particle sizes and the contribution ratio of micro-motion of nanoparticles to the increase in the convective heat transfer coefficient are investigated. The results show that with the change in the Reynolds number, the contribution of physical parameters to the convective heat transfer coefficient has not exceeded 50%. At the same time, it is found that the traditional single-phase convection heat transfer formula is not suitable for calculating the heat transfer coefficient of SiO₂–water nanofluids. Therefore, the correlations for calculating the convective heat transfer of SiO₂–water nanofluids in laminar and turbulent regimes are established.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3aconvection 3aenergy 3afriction 3aheat transfer coefficient 3ananofluids 3aparticle size 3aphysical chemistry 3aturbulent flow1 aZhang, Anlong1 aJing, Yuyan1 aQu, Pingping1 aWu, Zhaoran0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 June 10, v. 125, no. 24 p.13590-13600dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c020143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245008900192300001600281520177400297592002802071650002502099650002802124650001902152650001202171650001302183650002502196650002002221650001902241650001102260650001402271650003702285650001402322650002002336650001302356650001502369650001902384650003702403650003102440650001802471650002502489650001502514650002002529650003702549650005902586650003102645650001102676650002502687650002602712650003602738650006102774650001702835650002002852650003002872650002402902700001902926700001802945700001902963773008902982856008403071990002303155852000903178655001203187IND60087379320221120081229.0141102e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008737932DNAL7 a220792092pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2011.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDecaris, Martin L.10aTransferable cell-secreted extracellular matrices enhance osteogenic differentiation  ap. 744-752.  aThe coating of synthetic biomaterials with cell-derived decellularized extracellular matrices (DMs) represents a promising approach to confer bioactivity to otherwise inert materials and direct cell fate of host or transplanted cells. These coatings are typically deposited on biomaterials by culturing matrix-depositing cells for a sufficient duration on the target, followed by decellularization of the substrate. We hypothesized that DMs created in monolayer culture could be collected and then transferred to a secondary substrate while retaining their instructive potential. Transferred decellularized matrices (tDMs) were created by culturing human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on tissue culture plastic (TCP) under a controlled microenvironment to deposit a highly osteogenic DM, followed by collection, mechanical homogenization and transfer to a secondary culture surface. We then investigated its capacity to accelerate naïve hMSC osteogenic differentiation by quantifying gene expression, intracellular alkaline phosphatase production, and calcium deposition when cultured on DMs or tDMs. All markers were significantly higher in hMSCs seeded on DMs or tDMs compared to cells on TCP. The osteogenic response of naïve hMSCs to tDMs was dose dependent. We observed a reduction in ERK phosphorylation in hMSCs, as well as a possible role of the cell surface integrin α₂β₁, when probing the mode of efficacy for tDMs. This study represents a proof-of-principle that cell-derived matrix coatings can be deposited and effectively transferred while retaining the ability to instruct cell phenotype, thus offering a novel approach toward the development of hybrid biomaterials that mimic the complex interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3acalcium 3acoatings 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3aplastics 3astem cells 3atissue culture 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aAnthraquinonesxmetabolism 2aCell Adhesion 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Shape 2aCells, Cultured 2aExtracellular Matrixxmetabolism 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIntegrinsxmetabolism 2aIntracellular Spacexenzymology 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxcytologyxenzymologyxsecretion. 2aOsteogenesis 2aPhosphorylation 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transduction1 aMojadedi, Azad1 aBhat, Archana1 aLeach, J.

This study aimed to enhance key metabolic processes related to flavan-3-ols biosynthesis. The engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain E32 that produces naringenin from glucose was further engineered for de novo production of two basic flavan-3-ols, afzelechin (AFZ) and catechin (CAT). Through introduction of flavonoid 3-hydroxylase, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), and leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR), de novo production of AFZ and CAT can be achieved. The combination of FaDFR from Fragaria × ananassa and VvLAR from Vitis vinifera was optimal. (GGGGS)₂ and (EAAAK)₂ linkers between DFR and LAR proved optimal for the production of AFZ and CAT, respectively. Optimization of promoters and the enhanced supply of NADPH further increased the production. By combining the best engineering strategies, the optimum strains produced 500.5 mg/L AFZ and 321.3 mg/L CAT, respectively, after fermentation for 90 h in a 5 L bioreactor. The strategies presented could be applied for a more efficient production of flavan-3-ols by various microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aVitis vinifera 3abioreactors 3abiosynthesis 3acatechin 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3aglucose 3anaringenin 3aoxidoreductases 0aafzelechin 0aflavan-3-ols 0alinker 0ametabolic engineering1 aLi, Guangjian1 aLi, Hongbiao1 aLyu, Yunbin1 aYu, Shiqin1 aZhou, Jingwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3949-37330 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 69, no. 43 p.12763-12772dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c044893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03049naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016500172300001200337520173600349592002802085650001802113650002802131650001302159650002402172650001202196650001102208650001702219650001502236650002202251650001802273651001202291700001802303700001802321700001802339700002302357700003602380773013302416856008102549852000902630655001202639IND60123736720221120133848.0170724e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012373672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4409-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakhlé, Myriam Mrad10aShort-term relationships between emergency hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and fine particulate air pollution in Beirut, Lebanon  ap. 196.  aHigh levels of major outdoor air pollutants have been documented in Lebanon, but their health effects remain unknown. The Beirut Air Pollution and Health Effects study aimed to determine the relationship between short-term variations in ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅) and emergency hospital admissions in the city of Beirut, and whether susceptible groups are more greatly affected. An autoregressive Poisson model was used to evaluate the association between daily concentrations of particulate matter and respiratory and cardiovascular emergency hospital admissions after controlling for confounders. All variables were measured during 1 year from January 2012 to December 2012. Relative risks of admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases were calculated for an increase in 10 μg.m⁻³ of pollutant concentrations. Total respiratory admissions were significantly associated with the levels of PM₁₀ (1.012 [95 % CI 1.004–1.02]) per 10 μg.m⁻³ rise in daily mean pollutant concentration for PM₁₀ and 1.016 [95 % CI 1.000–1.032] for PM₂.₅ on the same day. With regard to susceptible groups, total respiratory admissions were associated with PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ within the same day in children (relative risk (RR), 1.013 and 1.014; 95 % confidence interval, 0.985–1.042 and 1.000–1.029 for PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀, respectively). Moreover, a nearly significant association was found between particles and total circulatory admissions for adults and elderly groups in the same day. These results are similar to other international studies. Therefore, air pollution control is expected to reduce the number of admissions of these diseases in Lebanon.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acardiovascular diseases 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apollution control 3arelative risk 3aLebanon1 aFarah, Wehbeh1 aZiadé, Nelly1 aAbboud, Maher1 aSalameh, Dominique1 aAnnesi-Maesano, I.q(Isabella),0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Apr., v. 187, no. 4 p.196-196dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4409-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011600204300002000320520095800340592002801298650001901326650001401345650002301359650001401382650002301396700007001419773013801489856008001627852000901707655001201716IND60742818920220218000000.0210624e20210614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074281892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c020602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSitja, Georges1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9951-163310aActivity of Pdₙ (n = 1–5) Clusters on Alumina Film on Ni₃Al(111) for CO Oxidation: A Molecular Beam Study  ap. 13247-13253.  aSingle atom catalyst (SAC) is a vivid new area of research in catalysis. However, the activity in CO oxidation of isolated Pt or Pd atoms, generally supported on an oxide powder, is still controversial. Furthermore, the steady state activity of few atoms clusters is still not yet quantitatively known. In this work, we study, by molecular beam reactive scattering (MBRS), the activity of Pdₙ (n = 1–5) clusters, grown on a nanostructured alumina films on a Ni₃Al(111) surface. It is shown that the single atoms are not active at 473 K, but under reaction at 533 K, they diffuse and coalesce forming larger clusters. The activity per cluster is proportional to the number of atoms it contains (n = 2–5). At 533 K, the activity per (surface-) atom, which is the turnover frequency (TOF), is constant. Its value is close to those obtained for large clusters of 181 ± 13 atoms and Pd(111) extended surfaces, under the same experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry1 aHenry, C.

Aspergillus species belong to a genus renown for an abundance of bioactive secondary metabolites, many important as toxins, pharmaceuticals and in industrial production. The genes required for secondary metabolites are typically co‐localized in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which often localize in heterochromatic regions of genome and are ‘turned off’ under laboratory condition. Efforts have been made to ‘turn on’ these BGCs by genetic manipulation of histone modifications, which could convert the heterochromatic structure to euchromatin. Additionally, non‐histone PTMs also play critical roles in the regulation of secondary metabolism. In this review, we collate the known roles of epigenetic and PTMs on Aspergillus SM production. We also summarize the proteomics approaches and bioinformatics tools for PTM identification and prediction and provide future perspectives on the emerging roles of PTM on regulation of SM biosynthesis in Aspergillus and other fungi.  aPublisher supplied data  a31900036cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31972171cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKC21295cNatural Science Foundation by Xuzhou City  aBK20190994cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  a19KJB180016cProgram of Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China 3aAspergillus 3abioinformatics 3abiosynthesis 3adrugs 3aepigenetics 3agenetic engineering 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3aprediction 3aproteomics 3asecondary metabolites1 aTian, Jun1 aKeller, Nancy P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4386-94730 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.2857-2881dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.160343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013500168300001600303520124100319592002801560650001501588650002301603650001201626650001501638650001701653650001601670650001901686650001501705650001801720650001701738650002101755650002101776650001801797650001901815653001901834653001801853653001501871653002001886653001801906700002701924700002501951700002101976773010501997856008702102852000902189655001202198IND60634018920221120193453.0190502e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063401892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeg, Sarwar10aChylomicron mimicking nanocolloidal carriers of rosuvastatin calcium for lymphatic drug targeting and management of hyperlipidemia  ap. 541-549.  aThe present work entails development of novel phospholipid-based self-nanoemulsifying systems (SNES) of rosuvastatin calcium for improving the oral biopharmaceutical performance via intestinal lymphatic pathways. The phospholipid complex-loaded SNES exhibited emulsification time of 142 s, particle size of 182.5 nm, polydispersity index of 0.35, zeta potential of −22.5 mV and complete in vitro drug release within 3 h. Cell line study on Caco-2 indicated absence of cytotoxicity and excellent cellular uptake of PL-SNES vis-à-vis plain SNES. Permeability study revealed >85% enhancement in the permeation, while intestinal perfusion study showed 2.9 and 3.5-fold increase in the permeation and absorption of the drug from the optimized PL-SNES over the pure drug suspension. Nearly 2.2 and 7.2-folds improvement in AUC0-t and Cmax, and 0.33-fold reduction in the Tmax of drug was observed for PL-SNES vis-à-vis the pure drug suspension during pharmacokinetic study. Moreover, PL-SNES also showed superior antihyperlipidemic activity over the pure drug suspension during pharmacodynamic study.

In addition to the well-known hexanucleotide motif and downstream sequence element (DSE), less-defined auxiliary elements are usually found to modulate cleavage and polyadenylation. They are generally located in close proximity to the core polyadenylation elements but, in most of the cases, the molecular mechanisms involved are not well defined. We concentrated our studies on the regulation of the mouse β adducin (Add2) pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. It contains two proximal erythroid-specific (PAS1 and PAS2-3) and one distal brain-specific (PAS4) polyadenylation sites along the 3′UTR. Using an in vivo approach based in the transfection of minigenes containing the Add2 polyadenylation signals, we previously identified the core regulatory elements responsible for PAS4 activity. Here, we have identified two novel non-canonical cis-acting elements regulating 3′end processing at PAS4, which show long-distance activities. The first of these elements, which spans for 257 nucleotides and is located at more than 5 kb upstream the PAS4, was essential to enable processing at the Add2 PAS4. The second element, located at about 4.5 kb upstream of the PAS4, reduces PAS4 processing. Both elements display long-distance activities and, to our knowledge, long-distance upstream polyadenylation regulatory elements have not been previously described in non-viral eukaryotic transcripts. These results highlight the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms directing Add2 pre-mRNA 3′end processing, and suggests that pre-mRNA 3′ end processing of other genes may also be unexpectedly regulated by non-canonical auxiliary elements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a3' untranslated regions 3agenes 3amice 3anucleotides 3atransfection 0a3′ end processing 0along-distance 0amouse beta adducin (Add2) 0anon-canonical 0aupstream sequence element (USE)1 aCostessi, Luisa1 aIaconcig, Alessandra1 aPorro, Fabiola1 aMuro, Andrés F.0 tRNA biology.g2013 Apr. 1, v. 10, no. 4 p.516-527dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.238553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010900165300002000274520136300294592002801657596005501685596005501740596005501795596005501850596005501905596005501960650002202015650000802037650002102045650001402066650001702080650000902097650001802106650001102124650001902135650001002154650001102164650001402175650001402189650001202203650001302215650001502228650004302243650005202286650001402338650001102352700001902363700001702382700002002399700001802419700001702437773017002454856008102624852000902705655001202714IND60611697620221123024911.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061169762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-018-2620-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, SungJun10aInactivation of influenza A virus via exposure to silver nanoparticle-decorated silica hybrid composites  ap. 27021-27030.  aInfluenza A virus (IFV-A) is one of the main cause of seasonal flu and can infect various of host species via the reassortment of segmented RNA genomes. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been known as excellent antiviral agent against IFV. However, the use of free AgNPs has several major drawbacks, including the inherent aggregation among AgNPs and unwanted cytotoxic or genotoxic damages for human body via inhalation or ingestion. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of our novel ~ 30-nm-diameter AgNP-decorated silica hybrid composite (Ag30-SiO₂; ~ 400 nm in diameter) for IFV-A inactivation. Ag30-SiO₂ particles can inhibit IFV-A effectively in a clear dose-dependent manner. However, when real-time RT-PCR assay was used, merely 0.5-log₁₀ reduction of IFV-A was observed at both 5 and 20 °C. Moreover, even after 1 h of exposure to Ag30-SiO₂ particles, more than 80% of hemagglutinin (HA) damage and 20% of neuraminidase (NA) activities had occurred, and the infection of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells by IFV-A was reduced. The results suggested that the major antiviral mechanism of Ag30-SiO₂ particles is the interaction with viral components located at the membrane. Therefore, Ag30-SiO₂ particles can cause nonspecific damage to various IFV-A components and be used as an effective method for inactivating IFV-A.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013-069335cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2013-069335cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2013-069335cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2013-069335cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2013-069335cNational Research Foundation of Korea  a2013-069335cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA 3aantiviral agents 3abreathing 3acytotoxicity 3adogs 3adose response 3agenome 3ahemagglutinins 3ahosts 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3aingestion 3akidneys 3amutagens 3ananosilver 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asialidase 3asilver1 aKo, Young-Seon1 aLee, Su-jin,1 aLee, Cheonghoon1 aWoo, Kyoungja1 aKo, GwangPyo0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Sept., v. 25, no. 27 p.27021-27030dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2620-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010000177300001400277520159500291592002801886650002101914650001001935650002801945650001401973650002301987650001902010650003102029650001002060650001902070650001402089650002202103650004302125650001302168653001702181653000802198653000802206653000802214653000802222653000902230653001402239653001702253653000802270653000902278653000902287653000902296653000802305653000802313653000802321653001102329653000702340653000702347653000702354653000702361653000702368653002602375653001402401653000802415653000802423653001002431700002002441700002502461700002002486700002902506700002802535700003602563700003102599773008102630856008102711852000902792655001202801IND60572940320221120161020.0170720e20170715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057294032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2017.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarimabad, Mojgan Noroozi14aThe novel Indole-3-formaldehyde (2-AITFEI-3-F) is involved in processes of apoptosis induction?  ap. 31-44.  aBalancing between Bax and Bcl-2 plays critical roles in both proliferation and self-renewal activation of cancer cells. Indole-3-formaldehyde derivatives limit the growth and facilitate cell death in different cell systems. In this study, we introduced a novel indole derivative (2-AITFEI-3-F) with tendency to facilitate apoptosis in NB4 line in comparison to basal Indole-3-formaldehyde (I3F).The NB4 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium contained 2-AITFEI-3-F and I3F (15.12–1000μg/mL) for 24, 48 and 72h. Inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by trypan blue staining technique and MTT assay. The fold changes of Bax/Bcl-2 expression against β-actin were determined by real-time-PCR technique. Western blotting analysis was also applied for evaluating the expression of Bax and Bcl2 at protein level. Data were analyzed by student t and repeated measure tests. Differences were considered significant if (P<0.01).There was a significant difference in cell viability, when various concentrations of 2-AITFEI-3-F (but similar to I3F) were used for 24, 48 and 72h in comparison to I3F regarding the cellular viability (P<0.05). Real time PCR and Western blotting analysis indicated that the gene and protein expression level of Bcl-2 down-regulated while Bax was up-regulated in compare to untreated control cells and cells treated with I3F (P<0.01).According to these findings, the novel indole derivative 2-AITFEI-3-F probably triggered apoptosis of NB4 cells by modulating Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Furthermore, the 2-AITFEI-3-F had markedly displayed anti-cancer activity than I3F.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aactin 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3acell viability 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 0a2-AITFEI-3-F 0aI3F 0aNB4 0aAPL 0aAML 0aDMSO 0aBcl-2/Bax 0a2-AITFEI-3-F 0aMTT 0amRNA 0aPVDF 0aRIPA 0aIgG 0aHRP 0aECL 0aNF-Κb 0aCT 0aUL 0aUR 0aLR 0aLL 0aIndole-3-formaldehyde 0aApoptosis 0aNB4 0aBax 0aBcl-21 aMahmoodi, Mehdi1 aJafarzadeh, Abdollah1 aDarehkordi, Ali1 aHajizadeh, Mohammad Reza1 aKhorramdelazad, Hossein1 aFalahati-pour, Soudeh Khanamani1 aHassanshahi, Gholamhossein0 tLife sciences.g2017 July 15, v. 181 p.31-44dElsevier Inc.x0024-32057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2017.05.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007400164300001400238520107000252592002801322650001501350650001101365650001501376650000901391650001301400650001301413650002301426650001301449650001101462650001601473650001501489650001301504650001401517653002501531653001401556653002401570653001601594653001901610700002401629700001501653773012301668856008201791852000901873655001201882IND60602373620221119184058.0180711e20150215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060237362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.10.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yafei10aOrientation of charged clay nanotubes in evaporating droplet meniscus  ap. 68-77.  aDuring drying, an aqueous suspension of strongly charged halloysite clay nanotubes concentrates at the edge of the droplet (“coffee-ring” effect) which provides alignment of the tubes along the liquid-substrate contact line. First, the surface charge of the nanotubes was enhanced by polyanion adsorption inside of the lumen to compensate for the internal positive charges. This increased the magnitude of the ξ-potential of the tubes from −36 to −81mV and stabilized the colloids. Then, colloidal halloysite was dropped onto the substrate, dried at 65°C and after a concentration of ∼0.05mgmL⁻¹ was reached, the alignment of nanotubes occurred starting from the droplet edges. The process was described with Onsager’s theory, in which longer nanorods, which have higher surface charge, give better ordering after a critical concentration is reached. This study indicates a new application of halloysite clay nanotubes in polymeric composites with anisotropic properties, microchannel orientation, and production of coatings with aligned nanotubes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanions 3aanisotropy 3aclay 3acoatings 3acolloids 3acomposite polymers 3adroplets 3adrying 3aevaporation 3ahalloysite 3ananorods 3ananotubes 0aHalloysite nanotubes 0aAlignment 0aDroplet evaporation 0aCoffee ring 0aLiquid crystal1 aCavallaro, Giuseppe1 aLvov, Yuri0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 440 p.68-77dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007400139245011300213300001600326500002000342520115400362592002801516650002201544650001501566650002201581650001901603650001101622650002301633650002301656650002101679650003101700650001101731650001701742650001401759650001401773650002001787650001001807700002201817700001701839700002201856700002601878773014001904856007402044852000902118655001202127IND60592149020221122064720.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059214902DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.126582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaak‐van den Berg, C.

However, in most cases, these have been determined under laboratory conditions. Here, we use a field set‐up to determine immature development time and survival of invasive Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) and native Adalia bipunctata L. (both Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). On caged Tilia × europaea L. cv. Pallida trees (Malvaceae) with ample amounts of aphid food, we introduced freshly hatched larvae of a single or of both ladybird species and followed their development until emergence of adults. Under the condition of ample prey availability, both ladybird species apparently hardly interacted and intraguild predation did not cause significant mortality. Development time of both species is in line with data from laboratory tests under controlled conditions. Immature survival can reach high levels, but is considerably higher for H. axyridis (44–100%) than for A. bipunctata (11–77%), resulting in faster increase of H. axyridis populations, which is one of the factors that may explain its invasion success.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdalia bipunctata 3aAphidoidea 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aTilia europaea 3aadults 3acolonizing ability 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3alife history 3amortality 3apredation 3atemperate zones 3atrees1 ade Jong, Peter W.1 aGort, Gerrit1 aManly, Bryan F.J.1 avan Lenteren, Joop C.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2018 Mar., v. 166, no. 3 p.151-161dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.126583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245012400206300002000330520125600350592002801606650002901634650001001663650001701673650001901690650001401709650001301723650002601736650000901762650001601771650001101787653002201798653000901820653003201829653002101861653002301882653002001905653002001925653002401945700001901969700005701988773015002045856008102195852000902276655001202285IND60755536420220219000000.0211103e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075553642DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c047602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHellwig, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8528-689310aReduction of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural and 1,2-Dicarbonyl Compounds by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Model Systems and Beer  ap. 12807-12817.  aGlycation and caramelization reactions in malt lead to the formation of 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds, which come in contact with yeast during fermentation. In the present study, the metabolic fate of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds (3-deoxyglucosone, 3-deoxygalactosone, 3-deoxypentosone, 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene) was assessed in the presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. HMF is degraded very fast by yeast with the formation of 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). By contrast, only 7–30% of 250 μM dicarbonyl compounds is degraded within 48 h. The respective deoxyketoses, 3-deoxyfructose (3-DF), 3-deoxytagatose, 3-deoxypentulose, and 3,4-dideoxyfructose, were identified as metabolites. While 17.8% of 3-deoxyglucosone was converted to 3-deoxyfructose, only about 0.1% of 3-deoxypentosone was converted to 3-deoxypentulose during 48 h. Starting with the parent dicarbonyl compounds, the synthesis of all deoxyketose metabolites was achieved by applying a metal-catalyzed reduction in the presence of molecular hydrogen. In a small set of commercial beer samples, BHMF and all deoxyketoses were qualitatively detected. 3-DF was quantitated in the four commercial beer samples at concentrations between 0.4 and 10.1 mg/L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abeers 3afermentation 3afood chemistry 3aglycation 3ahydrogen 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amalt 3ametabolites 3ayeasts 0aMaillard reaction 0abeer 0a2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan 0a3-deoxyglucosone 0a3-deoxygalactosone 0a3-deoxyfructose 0a3-deoxytagatose 0a3,4-dideoxyfructose1 aBörner, Marie1 aHenle, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6220-72670 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 69, no. 43 p.12807-12817dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c047603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245008400200300001800284506007600302520086900378592002801247506003701275650001201312650002301324650002601347650001401373650002701387650002201414700001801436700002401454700002401478773011801502856007501620852000901695655001201704IND60549959920221207103008.0160909e20120217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054995992DNAL7 a10.1021/jo202366c2doi7 aPMC33066192pmcid7 a222838182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalona, John A.10aTotal Synthesis of (±)-Rocaglamide via Oxidation-Initiated Nazarov Cyclization  ap. 1891-1908.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis article describes the evolution of a Nazarov cyclization-based synthetic strategy targeting the anticancer, antiinflammatory, and insecticidal natural product (±)-rocaglamide. Initial pursuit of a polarized heteroaromatic Nazarov cyclization to construct the congested cyclopentane core revealed an unanticipated electronic bias in the pentadienyl cation. This reactivity was harnessed in a successful second-generation approach using an oxidation-initiated Nazarov cyclization of a heteroaryl alkoxyallene. Full details of these two approaches are given, as well as the characterization of undesired reaction pathways available to the Nazarov cyclization product. A sequence of experiments that led to an understanding of the unexpected reactivity of this key intermediate is described, which culminated in the successful total synthesis of (+)-rocaglamide.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acations 3achemical structure 3acyclization reactions 3aevolution 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aorganic chemistry1 aCariou, Kevin1 aSpencer, William T.1 aFrontier, Alison J.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Feb. 17, v. 77, no. 4 p.1891-1908dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo202366c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02202naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008900166300001800255520107900273592002801352650001901380650002001399650001501419650002601434650004101460650001601501650001301517650001101530650001301541700002001554700002001574700002001594773013801614856007901752852000901831655001201840IND60626114220221119062623.0181217e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062611422DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmx0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawrence, Glen D10aLiquid Chromatographic Analysis of α-Dicarbonyls Using Girard-T Reagent Derivatives  ap. 1043-1050.  aThe measurement of α-dicarbonyls and other degradation products of sugars has become important in view of their toxicity. Although there are several methods used for their analysis, most require long reaction times to form UV absorbing or fluorescent derivatives and the nonpolar nature of commonly used derivatives necessitates relatively high concentrations of organic solvents for elution in reverse phase liquid chromatography. The present method describes the use of Girard-T reagent in a simple, one step derivatization of α-dicarbonyls and conjugated aldehydes and analysis using ion-pair reverse phase liquid chromatography. The limit of detection was in the range of 0.06–0.09 μM (4–12 ng/mL) for glyoxal, methylglyoxal, 3-deoxyglucosone and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural with good linear response and reproducibility using UV detection. The hydrazone derivatives were stable for several days in solution. The method was used to study degradation of several sugars and quantification of the target α-dicarbonyls and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in several soft drinks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3ahydrazones 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asoft drinks 3asolvents 3asugars 3atoxicity1 aRahmat, Rozaiha1 aMakahleh, Ahmad1 aSaad, Bahruddin0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 55, no. 10 p.1043-1050dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmx0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012700162300001300289520188700302592002802189650004702217650001102264650000902275650001502284650001902299650002002318650005002338650001502388650001302403650001602416650001902432650001502451650002202466650001102488650002502499651001002524653002002534653001302554653002002567653000802587653000802595653000802603653001002611653002202621653002202643653002502665700001502690700001602705700001602721773010902737856008202846852000902928655001202937IND60526982920221121225328.0190411e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052698292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2016.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Huaan10aImprovement of spatially and temporally continuous crop leaf area index by integration of CERES-Maize model and MODIS data  ap. 1-12.  aThe spatially and temporally continuous leaf area index (LAI) mapping is very crucial for many agricultural applications, such as crop yield estimation and growth status monitoring. Data assimilation technology provides an innovational way to improve spatio-temporally continuous crop LAI estimation through integration of remotely sensed observations and crop growth models. In this study, a very fast simulated annealing (VFSA)-based variational assimilation scheme was proposed to integrate the crop growth model (CERES-Maize), MODIS reflectance product (MOD09A1) and a two-layer canopy reflectance model (ACRM) to estimate time-series crop LAI at regional scale. Simultaneously, a new sensitivity analysis method (called “histogram comparison”) was developed to identify sensitive parameters of CERES-Maize and ACRM models. The proposed scheme was applied for continuous crop LAI estimation during the maize growing season in the dominating spring maize planting area of Jilin province, China. Results showed that R2 values between LAI estimations from the proposed assimilation scheme (referred to as assimilated LAI) and fine resolution LAI reference maps were 0.24 and 0.63, with RMSE values of 0.21 and 0.54 for Julian day 176, 2010, and Julian day 196, 2010, respectively. The assimilated results were closer to LAI reference maps than the MODIS LAI product and ACRM-based inversion results (referred to as ACRM LAI). Moreover, by introducing the prior information of LAI dynamics depicted by a crop growth model, the assimilated LAI showed better temporal consistency than the MODIS LAI product, LAI profiles simulated by CERES-Maize model (referred to as CERES-Maize LAI), and ACRM LAI. It was found that the accuracies of LAI estimations could be enhanced by assimilating satellite observations into a crop simulation model in the VFSA framework at a regional scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrop Environment Resource Synthesis models 3acanopy 3acorn 3acrop yield 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3amonitoring 3aplanting 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asimulation models 3aspring 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aAssimilated LAI 0aACRM LAI 0aCERES-Maize LAI 0aLSA 0aGSA 0aVIs 0aMODIS 0aData assimilation 0aCrop growth model 0aSensitivity analysis1 aLi, Ainong1 aWang, Jindi1 aBo, Yanchen0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2016 Aug., v. 78 p.1-12dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245013700155300001600292520130000308592002801608650002301636650001801659650000901677650001101686650001201697650002601709650001601735650001801751650001401769650000901783653001501792653001201807653001801819653002201837773010901859856003801968852000902006655001202015IND4472718720221121225442.0120319s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447271872DNAL7 a10.1071/WF100522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, P. F. M.10aFuelbed ignition potential and bark morphology explain the notoriety of the eucalypt messmate ‘stringybark’ for intense spotting  ap. 897-907.  aIn south-eastern Australia, bark of the ‘stringybark’ eucalypt group, and notably that of messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua L’Hér.), is notorious for intense spotting and it is likely that firebrands of this type contribute significantly to loss of life and property during major wildfires. The fuelbed ignition potential by glowing samples was laboratory tested on excised sections of Pinus radiata D. Don litterbed at moisture contents between 2 and 8% and for ‘no-wind’ or for ‘wind’ of 1ms-1. Prepared samples of outer bark between 0.5 and 1.6g were combusted until they attained ~20% of initial mass before placement. For ‘no-wind’, flaming ignition did not occur and the probability of glowing ignition appeared to depend on the chance of contact with needles. For ‘wind’, the probability of flaming ignition was a function of sample glowing mass and fuelbed moisture content. Its ignition probability, weight-for-weight, appears to exceed that reported for other forest firebrands, including bark of E. globulus Labill. However, it is likely that the notoriety of messmate bark is also due, in part, to its morphology and in-flight behaviour. It is argued that firebrand laboratory tests to date may poorly reflect the ignition potential of similar samples after flight.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus obliqua 3aPinus radiata 3abark 3aflight 3aforests 3alaboratory techniques 3aprobability 3awater content 3awildfires 3awind 0acandlebark 0agumbark 0amass spotting 0aterminal velocity0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2011, v. 20, no. 7 p.897-907dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF10052  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012200168300001600290520160700306592002801913650001101941650002301952650002501975650002102000650001302021650001302034650002702047650001802074650001202092650001702104700002202121773011802143856008102261852000902342655001202351IND60123737920221120150742.0150331e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012373792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-015-9626-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegarty, Kathryn10aWeaving complexity and accountability: approaches to higher education learning design (HELD) in the built environment  ap. 239-258.  aThe role of built environment professionals—planners, construction and project managers and property professionals—is to develop efficient cities improving social, environmental and economic outcomes. Professional practice that strikes a balance between the built and natural environment requires graduates with multidisciplinary skill sets, dictating the need for cross-disciplinary practice in undergraduate study. If we want alternative approaches to development, we must nurture professional capabilities that allow for a change in the way we see and act. In the light of this, we seek to enfranchise the many stakeholders engaged in the professional education programs offered in higher education. Higher education plays a central role in the development of professionals with the ability to recognise and mitigate the environmental impacts of traditional practice. This paper presents how courses in two Schools at RMIT, Global, Urban and Social Studies and Property, Construction and Project Management, have developed a transferable framework through which environmental capabilities may be embedded into undergraduate education. It explores the role higher education plays in the development of graduate capabilities and presents a conceptualisation of processes to realise this, through the Higher Education Learning Design Framework for development, and renewal, of traditional courses. The paper offers with a detailed exposition of the HELD framework against two courses. We explore this framework in relation to knowledge themes, professional and generic skills and assessment design.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aeducation programs 3aenvironmental impact 3ahigher education 3alearning 3amanagers 3aprofessional education 3aprofessionals 3aschools 3astakeholders1 aHoldsworth, Sarah0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2015 Apr., v. 17, no. 2 p.239-258dSpringer-Verlagx1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-015-9626-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001500168245015200183300001600335520151500351592002801866650001801894650001401912650001401926650001101940650001001951650001901961650001501980650001601995650001502011650001202026650002002038650001402058650001202072650002102084650002602105650000902131650003602140650002202176650003102198650005502229650004102284700001402325700002802339700001602367700001502383773008502398856008502483852000902568655001202577IND4475343920221118063115.0141110e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447534392DNAL7 a222104982pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampos, B.10aEnhanced offspring production in Daphnia magna clones exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 4-nonylphenol. Stage- and food-dependent effects  ap. 100-110.  aRisk assessment of emerging pollutants requires the development of bioassays able to detect and understand novel mechanisms of action. This study tested the hypothesis that the increase of offspring production in Daphnia magna induced by certain pollutants may be mediated through different mechanisms, depending on development stages, clones and food rations The study included two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, and the detergent metabolite 4-nonylphenol. Organisms were exposed from birth to adulthood or only during adulthood at low and high food ration levels. Results indicated that low exposure levels of the three studied substances increased offspring production and/or juvenile developmental rates similarly for all studied clones, but the responses differed among life-stages and food rations. When individuals were exposed to the studied chemicals from birth, enhanced offspring production per female was observed only at low and intermediate food rations. On the contrary, when exposures started in gravid females most treatments increased offspring production. Results obtained with SSRIs support previous findings, where it was stated that these compounds may amplify serotoninergic signaling in D. magna. Nonylphenol effects may be related to the reported alteration of this compound in Daphnia ecdysteroid metabolism. Further investigations are necessary to resolve the biochemical mechanism of SSRI and nonylphenol enhancing offspring production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aadulthood 3abioassays 3aclones 3afoods 3agravid females 3ametabolism 3aparturition 3apollutants 3aprogeny 3arisk assessment 3aserotonin 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aDaphniaxdrug effects 2aFood 2aLife Cycle Stagesxdrug effects 2aPhenolsxtoxicity 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitorsxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aPiña, B.1 aFernández-Sanjuán, M.1 aLacorte, S.1 aBarata, C.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2012 Mar., v. 109 p.100-110dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245015000160300001300310520119000323592002801513650001701541650001301558650002101571650001001592650001501602650001301617650001301630650001301643650000701656650001901663650001501682650004401697650001601741700002201757700001901779700002401798773013201822856008001954852000902034655001202043IND60626114320221119062624.0191018e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062611432DNAL7 a10.1093/chromsci/bmx0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaibaba, B10aStability-Indicating Reversed-Phase UHPLC Method Development and Characterization of Degradation Products of Almotriptan Maleate by LC-QTOF-MS/MS  ap. 6-17.  aAlmotriptan maleate (ALMT), a highly selective 5-hydroxy tryptamine 1B/1D (5-HT₁B/₁D) receptor agonist used in the treatment of migraine headache was subjected to various ICH (Q1A (R2)) specified guidelines. The drug underwent significant degradation under hydrolytic (acid, base and neutral), oxidative and photolytic stress conditions, while it was stable under thermal stress condition. A total of seven significant degradation products (DPs) were obtained. A simple, selective and reliable UPLC method has been developed for the separation of ALMT and its DPs using Acquity UPLC HSS Cyano (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm) column with mobile phase consisting of ammonium acetate (10 mM, pH 4.4) buffer and acetonitrile in gradient elution mode. Chromatographic analysis was performed at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min using a PDA detector at a wavelength of 230 nm. All the DPs (DP-1 to DP-7) were characterized using UHPLC-ESI-QTOF based on mass fragmentation pattern and accurate m/z values. The developed UPLC method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy. The developed stability-indicating method helps in quantification of drug in the presence of DPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aagonists 3aammonium acetate 3adrugs 3aguidelines 3aheadache 3amaleates 3amigraine 3apH 3athermal stress 3atryptamine 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awavelengths1 aVishnuvardhan, Ch1 aJohnsi Rani, P1 aSatheesh Kumar, N.,0 tJournal of chromatographic science.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 56, no. 1 p.6-17dOxford University PresswJournal:18439x1945-239X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chromsci/bmx0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245008400179300001600263520138800279592002801667650001701695650002501712650001101737650001201748650001001760650002501770650002401795650000901819650001801828650001501846650001601861650002201877650001201899650001301911650001401924650001601938650001301954650000901967650001401976650001001990650002202000650002702022650001202049650002402061650001802085650002302103650002302126650002302149650002802172650001302200650003302213650002802246650004202274650002302316650002702339700001802366700001702384700001502401773010902416856008102525852000902606655001202615IND4409362020221122035317.0151023e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440936202DNAL7 a185667952pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-008-0818-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, S. I.14aThe rice OsLpa1 gene encodes a novel protein involved in phytic acid metabolism  ap. 769-779.  aThe rice low phytic acid 1 (lpa1) mutant was originally identified using a forward genetics approach. This mutant exhibits a 45% reduction in rice seed phytic acid with a molar-equivalent increase in inorganic phosphorus; however, it does not appear to differ significantly in productivity from its wild-type progenitor. A second lpa1 mutant was identified from additional screening for high seed inorganic phosphorus phenotypes. Using a positional cloning strategy, we identified a single candidate gene at the rice Lpa1 locus. Sequence analysis of the candidate gene from the lpa1 mutants revealed two independent mutations (a single base pair substitution and a single base pair deletion) that confirmed the identification of this candidate as the rice low phytic acid 1 gene, OsLpa1. The OsLpa1 gene has three splice variants. The location and nature of the two mutations suggests that these lesions only affect the translation of the predicted protein derived from the longest transcript. The proteins encoded by OsLpa1 do not have homology to any of the inositol phosphate metabolism genes recently characterized in plants, although there is homology to 2-phosphoglycerate kinase, an enzyme found in hyperthermophilic methanogens that catalyzes the formation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate from 2-phosphoglycerate.

The ƩOPs together with the most commonly detected individual OPs (TCPP, TCEP, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), tri-iso-butyl phosphate (TiBP), triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), and TPPO) tended to decrease from nearshore to offshore and from the surface to the bottom seawaters, indicating major land-based sources. Furthermore, the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass (YSCWM), Changjiang Diluted Water (CDW), Taiwan Warm Current (TaWC), and Subei Coastal Water (SCW) influenced the horizontal and vertical distributions of the OPs in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal water 3aflame retardants 3ageometry 3aphosphates 3aplasticizers 3aseawater 3aChina 3aTaiwan 3aYellow Sea 0aTris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) 0aTris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) 0aTriphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) 0aSource 0aFate1 aTang, Jianhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9006-263X1 aMi, Lijie1 aLi, Fei1 aWang, Runmei1 aHuang, Guopei1 aWu, Huifeng0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 121, no. 1-2 p.331-338dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245012900207300002000336520097400356592002801330650002701358650002101385650003201406650001501438650001301453650001601466700002201482700001901504773013801523856008001661852000901741655001201750IND60742819920221120033314.0210624e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074281992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c025512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshimoto, Minoru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0240-809910aNanoscale Dynamics of Self-Assembled Monolayers on a MHz-Oscillating Solid–Liquid Interface Revealed by Direct Observation  ap. 13629-13634.  aUnder dynamic mechanical conditions, temperature and oscillation frequency directly affect the dynamics of soft materials. Specifically, temperature impacts stiffness, while oscillation frequency affects the material response region. The resonant length of a soft material quantitatively reveals the nanoscale dynamics of its main chain in the MHz region, effectively acting as a rheometer. Here, we investigated the nanoscale dynamics of a linear soft material against temperature and oscillation frequency using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and a chemisorbed, self-assembled monolayer. A novel direct analysis based on the Debye process showed that the logarithm of resonant length or molecular weight decreased linearly with that of the QCM angular frequency over the studied temperature range and converged to a single point independently of temperature. Furthermore, the convergence point of molecular weight was independent of the type of bonding/sorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliquid-solid interface 3amolecular weight 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3arheometers 3asorption 3atemperature1 aKurosawa, Shigeru1 aTanaka, Mutsuo0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 June 10, v. 125, no. 24 p.13629-13634dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c025513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245014900170520172100319592002802040650001502068650002002083650002602103650001402129650002102143650001102164650001502175650001002190650000902200650001602209650001902225650001102244650001502255650001502270651001702285651001202302700002202314700002502336700001802361700002202379700001902401773012902420856007402549852000902623655001202632IND60704041920221119191711.0200722e20200620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070404192DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121219862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrellana-Alvear, Johanna 10aAssessment of Native Radar Reflectivity and Radar Rainfall Estimates for Discharge Forecasting in Mountain Catchments with a Random Forest Model  aDischarge forecasting is a key component for early warning systems and extremely useful for decision makers. Forecasting models require accurate rainfall estimations of high spatial resolution and other geomorphological characteristics of the catchment, which are rarely available in remote mountain regions such as the Andean highlands. While radar data is available in some mountain areas, the absence of a well distributed rain gauge network makes it hard to obtain accurate rainfall maps. Thus, this study explored a Random Forest model and its ability to leverage native radar data (i.e., reflectivity) by providing a simplified but efficient discharge forecasting model for a representative mountain catchment in the southern Andes of Ecuador. This model was compared with another that used as input derived radar rainfall (i.e., rainfall depth), obtained after the transformation from reflectivity to rainfall rate by using a local Z-R relation and a rain gauge-based bias adjustment. In addition, the influence of a soil moisture proxy was evaluated. Radar and runoff data from April 2015 to June 2017 were used. Results showed that (i) model performance was similar by using either native or derived radar data as inputs (0.66 < NSE < 0.75; 0.72 < KGE < 0.78). Thus, exhaustive pre-processing for obtaining radar rainfall estimates can be avoided for discharge forecasting. (ii) Soil moisture representation as input of the model did not significantly improve model performance (i.e., NSE increased from 0.66 to 0.68). Finally, this native radar data-based model constitutes a promising alternative for discharge forecasting in remote mountain regions where ground monitoring is scarce and hardly available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adecision making 3aearly warning systems 3ahighlands 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aradar 3arain 3arain gauges 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3asoil water 3awatersheds 3aAndes region 3aEcuador1 aCelleri, Rolando,1 aRollenbeck, Rütger 1 aMuñoz, Paul 1 aContreras, Pablo 1 aBendix, Jörg,0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 June 20, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121219863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03877naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010500153300001600258500002000274520183500294592002802129596007602157596006802233596002802301596002802329596006602357650001602423650001602439650002302455650001402478650003702492650004402529650001402573650001402587650002002601650002902621650001302650650001302663650002902676650002602705700001902731700001602750700002102766700005802787700002202845700001302867700001802880700001502898700001602913700001702929700001702946700001702963700001602980700005802996773011403054856007403168852000903242655001203251IND60784422720221120181139.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078442272DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.158092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Hong10aGmMKK4‐activated GmMPK6 stimulates GmERF113 to trigger resistance to Phytophthora sojae in soybean  ap. 473-495.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhytophthora root and stem rot is a worldwide soybean (Glycine max) disease caused by the soil‐borne pathogen Phytophthora sojae. This disease is devastating to soybean production, so improvement of resistance to P. sojae is a major target in soybean breeding. Mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are important signaling modules that convert environmental stimuli into cellular responses. Compared with extensive studies in Arabidopsis, the molecular mechanism of MAPK cascades in soybean disease resistance is barely elucidated. In this work, we found that the gene expression of mitogen‐activated protein kinase 6 (GmMPK6) was potently induced by P. sojae infection in the disease‐resistant soybean cultivar ‘Suinong 10’. Overexpression of GmMPK6 in soybean resulted in enhanced resistance to P. sojae and silencing of GmMPK6 led to the opposite phenotype. In our attempt to dissect the role of GmMPK6 in soybean resistance to phytophthora disease, we found that MAPK kinase 4 (GmMKK4) and the ERF transcription factor GmERF113 physically interact with GmMPK6, and we determined that GmMKK4 could phosphorylate and activate GmMPK6, which could subsequently phosphorylate GmERF113 upon P. sojae infection, suggesting that P. sojae can stimulate the GmMKK4–GmMPK6–GmERF113 signaling pathway in soybean. Moreover, phosphorylation of GmERF113 by the GmMKK4–GmMPK6 module promoted GmERF113 stability, nuclear localization and transcriptional activity, which significantly enhanced expression of the defense‐related genes GmPR1 and GmPR10‐1 and hence improved disease resistance of the transgenic soybean seedlings. In all, our data reveal that the GmMKK4–GmMPK6–GmERF113 cascade triggers resistance to P. sojae in soybean and shed light on functions of MAPK kinases in plant disease resistance.  aPublisher supplied data  aGX18B032cKey Research and Development Program of Heilongjiang Province  aZD2019C001cNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province  a31671719cNSFC Projects  a31971972cNSFC Projects  a2021YFD1201103cNational Key Research and Development Program 3aArabidopsis 3aGlycine max 3aPhytophthora sojae 3acultivars 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3aplant disease resistance 3asoybeans 3astem rot 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aJiang, Liangyu1 aDu, Banghan1 aNing, B.q(Bin),1 aDing, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3554-58551 aZhang, Chuanzhong1 aSong, Bo1 aLiu, Shanshan1 aZhao, Ming1 aZhao, Yuxin1 aRong, Tianyu1 aLiu, Dongxue1 aWu, Junjiang1 aXu, Pengfei1 aZhang, Shuzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-00920 tplant journal.g2022 July, v. 111, no. 2 p.473-495dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47643x0960-74127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tpj.158093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245014200178520159600320592002801916650001701944650001801961650001101979650003101990650001402021650003702035650001902072653002902091653003702120653004402157653001802201653001202219653001302231653001702244653001902261653004102280653001902321653003702340700002202377773010202399856008802501852000902589655001202598IND60701594020221117034620.0200831e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070159402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1046842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhaustov, Aleksander10aFractioning of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the components of the non-equilibrium geochemical systems (thermodynamic analysis)  aThe paper investigates the properties of geochemical systems components (GCS) within the thermodynamic framework. In a departure from previous approaches, the maximum possible number of interconnected media in holistic GCS is analyzed using hierarchical classification procedures.The studied sample covers the maximum possible selection of media, which are interconnected in natural systems in real conditions.The paper reports that complex organic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are highly informative indicators of the properties of substances migration in media. Being geochemical markers, these compounds demonstrate the ability to accumulate on geochemical barriers and selectively move in interacting media, which makes them key objects of study. In addition, the marker role of these compounds draws on their “confinement” to several geochemical processes (natural or industrial) and ability to ultimately identify the source of the pollution. The existing accounts fail to describe these mechanisms of mass transfer. The proposed phenomenological models of migration, transformation, and accumulation of PAHs are based on quantitative estimates, which provide more consistent results compared with the descriptive representations of the behavior of substances. This allowed us to identify the role of studied physicochemical characteristics of PAHs in their accumulation in the environmental media. The paper demonstrates that the most active evolution of GCS occurs in case plant media and, in general, living matter is included in their composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageochemistry 3amass transfer 3amodels 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3athermodynamics 0aGeochemical system (GCS) 0aInteraction of system components 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 0aLiving matter 0aEntropy 0aEnthalpy 0aGibbs energy 0aClassification 0aIndication of the transfer processes 0aStructuredness 0aEvolution of geochemical systems1 aRedina, Margarita0 tApplied geochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 120 p.104684-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.1046843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009100156520200700247592002802254650001302282650001702295650001102312650002002323650001602343650001302359650002802372650001902400650001002419650002202429650001902451700001502470700001802485700001602503700001902519700001802538700001702556773012902573856007402702852000902776655001202785IND60704042020221119191414.0200722e20200620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070404202DNAL7 a10.3390/rs121219872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Leli 10aDetailed Mapping of Urban Land Use Based on Multi-Source Data: A Case Study of Lanzhou  aDetailed urban land use information is the prerequisite and foundation for implementing urban land policies and urban land development, and is of great importance for solving urban problems, assisting scientific and rational urban planning. The existing results of urban land use mapping have shortcomings in terms of accuracy or recognition scale, and it is difficult to meet the needs of fine urban management and smart city construction. This study aims to explore approaches that mapping urban land use based on multi-source data, to meet the needs of obtaining detailed land use information and, taking Lanzhou as an example, based on the previous study, we proposed a process of urban land use classification based on multi-source data. A combination road network dataset of Gaode and OpenStreetMap (OSM) was synthetically applied to divide urban parcels, while multi-source features using Sentinel-2A images, Sentinel-1A polarization data, night light data, point of interest (POI) data and other data. Simultaneously, a set of comparative experiments were designed to evaluate the contribution and impact of different features. The results showed that: (1) the combination utilization of Gaode and OSM road network could improve the classification results effectively. Specifically, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient are 83.75% and 0.77 separately for level I and the accuracy of each type reaches more than 70% for level II; (2) the synthetic application of multi-source features is conducive to the improvement of urban land use classification; (3) Internet data, such as point of interest (POI) information and multi-time population information, contribute the most to urban land use mapping. Compared with single-moment population information, the multi-time population distribution makes more contributions to urban land use. The framework developed herein and the results derived therefrom may assist other cities in the detailed mapping and refined management of urban land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3acase studies 3acities 3adata collection 3aland policy 3aland use 3apopulation distribution 3aremote sensing 3aroads 3aurban development 3aurban planning1 aHe, Sijia 1 aLian, Jiting 1 aBie, Qiang 1 aWang, Xiaoyun 1 aDong, Jingru 1 aXie, Yaowen 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 June 20, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs121219873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011500166300002000281520162500301592002801926650001501954650002301969650002101992650001202013650001102025650001902036650001302055650001902068650001902087650002902106650001902135650001302154650001502167650002102182650002402203650001902227700001802246700001702264700002502281700002002306773017002326856008102496852000902577655001202586IND60611695220221117184651.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061169522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9234-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJien, Shih-Hao10aShort-term biochar application induced variations in C and N mineralization in a compost-amended tropical soil  ap. 25715-25725.  aTo mitigate food shortage due to global warming, developing sustainable management practices to stabilize soil organic matter (SOM) and sequester more carbon (C) in the cultivated soils is necessary, particularly in subtropical and tropical areas. A short-term (56 days) incubation experiment was conducted to evaluate the influences of rice husk biochar (RHB) and manure compost (MC) application on C mineralization and nitrogen (N) immobilization in a sandy loam soil. The RHB was separately incorporated into the soil at application rates of 2 and 4% (w/w) either with or without 1% (w/w) compost. Our results displayed that macroaggregates (≥2 mm) were obviously increased by 11% in soil amended with RHB + MC at the end of incubation. In addition, the experimental results presented that the C mineralization of the soil rapidly increased during the first week of incubation. However, the co-application of compost with biochar (RHB + MC) revealed that CO₂ emission was significantly decreased by 13–20% compared to the soil with only MC. In addition, the mineralized N in the soil was lower in RHB + MC-amended soil simultaneously than only MC-amended soil, indicating that biochar addition induced N immobilization. The physical protection of compost by its occlusion into aggregates or adsorption on surface of RHB as proved by the micromorphological observation was the main reason for lower C and N mineralization in soil amended with RHB + MC. Overall results revealed that RHB + MC treatment can decrease the decomposition of compost and sequester more C in the tropical agricultural soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aagricultural soils 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposts 3afood shortages 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3arice hulls 3asandy loam soils 3asoil organic matter 3atropical soils1 aChen, Wen-Chi1 aOk, Yong Sik1 aAwad, Yasser Mahmoud1 aLiao, Chien-Sen0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Sept., v. 25, no. 26 p.25715-25725dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9234-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245014400202300002000346520129600366592002801662650003001690650001401720650001101734650001501745650001901760650002401779650002301803650002101826700001601847700005201863773017301915856008102088852000902169655001202178IND60755533820221121160857.0211103e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075553382DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c032142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhenshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3407-807912aA First-Principles Microkinetic Rate Equation Theory for Heterogeneous Reactions: Application to Reduction of Fe₂O₃ in Chemical Looping  ap. 15514-15524.  aHow to couple the microscale surface reactions with the macroscale kinetic phenomenon and achieve a first-principles-based kinetics prediction is an unsolved problem in the field of chemical looping. This study proposes a first-principles-based theoretical model to calculate the heterogeneous reduction kinetics of an Fe₂O₃ oxygen carrier in chemical looping. At the atom scale, the surface reaction mechanism of H₂ with Fe₂O₃ is investigated on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetic data, frequency, and atomic structure obtained from DFT calculations are introduced into transition state theory (TST) to calculate the reaction rate constants. At the grain scale, a rate equation theory is developed and used to couple the surface reaction with the bulk diffusion of lattice oxygen, and the reaction mechanism and reaction rate constants obtained from DFT and TST are introduced into the rate equations to predict the reduction kinetics of Fe₂O₃. The theoretical prediction is validated by experimental data from thermogravimetric analysis, and it is demonstrated that the first-principles-based microkinetics rate equation theory can provide an accurate prediction of the reduction kinetics of Fe₂O₃ oxygen carrier in chemical looping.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aequations 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3aprocess design 3areaction mechanisms 3atheoretical models 3athermogravimetry1 aCai, Jinzhi1 aLiu, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3049-20610 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 60, no. 43 p.15514-15524dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c032143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002300180245007300203300001600276506007600292520142400368592002801792506003701820650000801857650001701865650002001882650003201902650002301934650004201957650001401999650001202013650001402025650001102039650002402050650001402074653001202088653001402100653000802114653002602122653001402148700001602162700002102178700001802199700002302217700002402240700001702264773010402281856007302385852000902458655001202467IND60691088120221207143410.0200427e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069108812DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.235902doi7 aPMC36722832pmcid7 a233246072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeauregard, Arthur10aIdentification and characterization of small RNAs in Yersinia pestis  ap. 397-405.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aYersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, is closely related to Yersinia pseudotuberculosis evolutionarily but has a very different mode of infection. The RNA-binding regulatory protein, Hfq, mediates regulation by small RNAs (sRNAs) and is required for virulence of both Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Moreover, Hfq is required for growth of Y. pestis, but not Y. pseudotuberculosis, at 37°C. Together, these observations suggest that sRNAs play important roles in the virulence and survival of Y. pestis, and that regulation by sRNAs may account for some of the differences between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. We have used a deep sequencing approach to identify 31 sRNAs in Y. pestis. The majority of these sRNAs are not conserved outside the Yersiniae. Expression of the sRNAs was confirmed by Northern analysis and we developed deep sequencing approaches to map 5ʹ and 3ʹ ends of many sRNAs simultaneously. Expression of the majority of the sRNAs we identified is dependent upon Hfq. We also observed temperature-dependent effects on the expression of many sRNAs, and differences in expression patterns between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Thus, our data suggest that regulation by sRNAs plays an important role in the lifestyle switch from flea to mammalian host, and that regulation by sRNAs may contribute to the phenotypic differences between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aSiphonaptera 3aYersinia pestis 3aYersinia pseudotuberculosis 3aetiological agents 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alifestyle 3amammals 3aphenotype 3aplague 3aregulatory proteins 3avirulence 0aRNA-seq 0asmall RNA 0aHfq 0aY. pseudotuberculosis 0aDeep-RACE1 aSmith, Eric1 aPetrone, Brianna1 aSingh, Navjot1 aKarch, Christopher1 aMcDonough, Kathleen1 aWade, Joseph0 tRNA biology.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 10, no. 3 p.397-405dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.235903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245009200202300001600294506007600310520110100386592002801487506003701515650001201552650002101564650001301585650002301598650001701621650001001638650001801648650000901666650001801675650001401693650001401707650001101721650001301732650001301745650002901758653001001787653002301797653002401820653001601844653003601860653003801896773010301934856007302037852000902110655001202119IND60691088220221207142535.0200427e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069108822DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.235912doi7 aPMC37373452pmcid7 a233922922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiedenheft, Blake10aIn defense of phagebViral suppressors of CRISPR-mediated adaptive immunity in bacteria  ap. 886-890.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aViruses that infect bacteria are the most abundant biological agents on the planet and bacteria have evolved diverse defense mechanisms to combat these genetic parasites. One of these bacterial defense systems relies on a repetitive locus, referred to as a CRISPR (clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats). Bacteria and archaea acquire resistance to invading viruses and plasmids by integrating short fragments of foreign nucleic acids at one end of the CRISPR locus. CRISPR loci are transcribed and the long primary CRISPR transcript is processed into a library of small RNAs that guide the immune system to invading nucleic acids, which are subsequently degraded by dedicated nucleases. However, the development of CRISPR-mediated immune systems has not eradicated phages, suggesting that viruses have evolved mechanisms to subvert CRISPR-mediated protection. Recently, Bondy-Denomy and colleagues discovered several phage-encoded anti-CRISPR proteins that offer new insight into the ongoing molecular arms race between viral parasites and the immune systems of their hosts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aCRISPR sequences 3abacteria 3adefense mechanisms 3agene editing 3ahosts 3aimmune system 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3anucleases 3aparasites 3aphages 3aplasmids 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics) 0aphage 0abacterial immunity 0aRNA-guided immunity 0aanti-CRISPR 0aviral suppressors of RNAi (VSR) 0aviral suppressors of CRISPR (VSC)0 tRNA biology.g2013 May 1, v. 10, no. 5 p.886-890dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.235913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100001700191245008900208300001600297520093900313592002801252650002501280650001801305650002601323650002201349650001801371650001401389650001301403650001501416650001101431650001801442650002401460650001201484650005501496650003201551650003201583650003701615650002001652650002401672650008001696650001101776650002901787650002701816650006401843650002501907650002801932650003201960650005101992650003702043650001502080700003002095700002202125700002302147700002302170773008902193856008402282990002302366852000902389655001202398IND60087377820221120131837.0141102e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008737782DNAL7 a220611082pmid7 aPMC38807942pmcid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2011.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavi, Swathi10aMaleimide–thiol coupling of a bioactive peptide to an elastin-like protein polymer  ap. 627-635.  aRecombinant elastin-like protein (ELP) polymers display several favorable characteristics for tissue repair and replacement as well as drug delivery applications. However, these materials are derived from peptide sequences that do not lend themselves to cell adhesion, migration, or proliferation. This report describes the chemoselective ligation of peptide linkers bearing the bioactive RGD sequence to the surface of ELP hydrogels. Initially, cystamine is conjugated to ELP, followed by the temperature-driven formation of elastomeric ELP hydrogels. Cystamine reduction produces reactive thiols that are coupled to the RGD peptide linker via a terminal maleimide group. Investigations into the behavior of endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells on the RGD-modified ELP hydrogel surface reveal significantly enhanced attachment, spreading, migration and proliferation. Attached endothelial cells display a quiescent phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acell adhesion 3adrug delivery systems 3aendothelial cells 3ahydrocolloids 3aphenotype 3apolymers 3astem cells 3athiols 3atissue repair 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBiocompatible Materialsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCell Adhesionxdrug effects 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aElastinxmetabolism 2aHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHydrogelsxpharmacology. 2aMaleimidesxmetabolism 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligopeptidesxpharmacology 2aPeptidesxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxmetabolism 2aSus scrofa1 aKrishnamurthy, Venkata R.1 aCaves, Jeffrey M.1 aHaller, Carolyn A.1 aChaikof, Elliot L.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2012 Feb., v. 8, no. 2 p.627-635dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2011.10.0273Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003700147245011500184300002000299520107700319592002801396650001301424650001701437650001801454650002301472650001601495650001601511650001001527651001001537700002401547700006101571700002201632700002301654700002101677700002101698700001901719773017001738856008101908852000901989655001201998IND60611695520221122235451.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061169552DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0220-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantonastaso, Giovanni Francesco10aDiscontinuous permeable adsorptive barrier design and cost analysis: a methodological approach to optimisation  ap. 26793-26800.  aThe following paper presents a method to optimise a discontinuous permeable adsorptive barrier (PAB-D). This method is based on the comparison of different PAB-D configurations obtained by changing some of the main PAB-D design parameters. In particular, the well diameters, the distance between two consecutive passive wells and the distance between two consecutive well lines were varied, and a cost analysis for each configuration was carried out in order to define the best performing and most cost-effective PAB-D configuration. As a case study, a benzene-contaminated aquifer located in an urban area in the north of Naples (Italy) was considered. The PAB-D configuration with a well diameter of 0.8 m resulted the best optimised layout in terms of performance and cost-effectiveness. Moreover, in order to identify the best configuration for the remediation of the aquifer studied, a comparison with a continuous permeable adsorptive barrier (PAB-C) was added. In particular, this showed a 40% reduction of the total remediation costs by using the optimised PAB-D.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3acost analysis 3acost effectiveness 3aremediation 3aurban areas 3awells 3aItaly1 aBortone, Immacolata1 aChianese, Simeone1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9356-845X1 aDi Nardo, Armando1 aDi Natale, Michele1 aErto, Alessandro1 aKaratza, Despina1 aMusmarra, Dino0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Sept., v. 25, no. 27 p.26793-26800dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0220-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245006600206300001400272520127200286592002801558650002901586650002201615650001201637650001901649650001201668650001301680650002201693650002601715650002901741650001101770653002401781653001601805653001301821653002601834700005701860700001801917700001501935700005801950773013702008856008302145852000902228655001202237IND60752931020221120201308.0211106e20211210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075293102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Jin Seok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3617-795410aCrystal structure of yeast Gid10 in complex with Pro/N-degron  ap. 86-92.  aThe cellular glucose level has to be tightly regulated by a variety of cellular processes. One of them is the degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes such as Fbp1, Icl1, Mdh2, and Pck1 by GID (glucose-induced degradation deficient) E3 ubiquitin ligase. The Gid4 component of the GID ligase complex is responsible for recognizing the N-terminal proline residue of the target substrates under normal conditions. However, an alternative N-recognin Gid10 controls the degradation process under stressed conditions. Although Gid10 shares a high sequence similarity with Gid4, their substrate specificities are quite different. Here, we report the structure of Gid10 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in complex with Pro/N-degron, Pro-Tyr-Ile-Thr, which is almost identical to the sequence of the natural substrate Art2. Although Gid10 shares many structural features with the Gid4 protein from yeast and humans, the current structure explains the unique structural difference for the preference of bulky hydrophobic residue at the second position of Pro/N-degron. Therefore, this study provides a fundamental basis for understanding of the structural diversity and substrate specificity of recognition components in the GID E3 ligase complex involved in the Pro/N-degron pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3acrystal structure 3aglucose 3ahydrophobicity 3aproline 3aresearch 3asequence homology 3asubstrate specificity 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3ayeasts 0aE3 ubiquitin ligase 0aGID complex 0aN-degron 0aX-ray crystallography1 aPark, Si Hoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3518-78081 aKim, Leehyeon1 aHeo, Jiwon1 aSong, Hyun Kyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5684-40590 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Dec. 10, v. 582 p.86-92dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001900180245007500199300001600274506007600290520131800366592002801684506003701712650003201749650001601781650002801797650002501825650001501850650002301865650001801888650001901906650001301925650001501938650002901953653001601982653001901998653000802017653001502025653001002040653001002050653002102060700002102081700001702102773010402119856007302223852000902296655001202305IND60691088320221207143409.0200427e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069108832DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.236082doi7 aPMC36722772pmcid7 a233286302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Mahavir10axRRMbA new class of RRM found in the telomerase La family protein p65  ap. 353-359.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenuine La and La-related proteins group 7 (LARP7) bind to the non-coding RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII), which end in UUU-3′OH. The La motif and RRM1 of these proteins (the La module) cooperate to bind the UUU-3′OH, protecting the RNA from degradation, while other domains may be important for RNA folding or other functions. Among the RNAPIII transcripts is ciliate telomerase RNA (TER). p65, a member of the LARP7 family, is an integral Tetrahymena thermophila telomerase holoenzyme protein required for TER biogenesis and telomerase RNP assembly. p65, together with TER and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), form the Tetrahymena telomerase RNP catalytic core. p65 has an N-terminal domain followed by a La module and a C-terminal domain, which binds to the TER stem 4. We recently showed that the p65 C-terminal domain harbors a cryptic, atypical RRM, which uses a unique mode of single- and double-strand RNA binding and is required for telomerase RNP catalytic core assembly. This domain, which we named xRRM, appears to be present in and unique to genuine La and LARP7 proteins. Here we review the structure of the xRRM, discuss how this domain could recognize diverse substrates of La and LARP7 proteins and discuss the functional implications of the xRRM as an RNP chaperone.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA folding 3aTetrahymena thermophila 3aamino acid sequences 3abiogenesis 3acatalytic activity 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aproteins 3atelomerase 3atranscription (genetics) 0aTetrahymena 0atelomerase RNA 0ap65 0aLa protein 0aLARP7 0axRRM2 0aRNA conformation1 aChoi, Charles P.1 aFeigon, Juli0 tRNA biology.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 10, no. 3 p.353-359dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.236083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01129naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245016100169500001900330520015400349592002800503650002300531650001700554650002400571651002200595700002200617773012500639856007800764852000900842655001200851IND60738695220221119131318.0210524e20210512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073869522DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100507662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStefanucci, Azzurra 10aMediterranean Edible Plants: An Assessment of Their Antioxidant, Radical Scavenger Properties and Their Use as Super Foods, Nutraceuticals, Functional Foods  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Mediterranean diet comprises a set of foods that commonly feature in the diet of inhabitants from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean diet 3aantioxidants 3adietary supplements 3aMediterranean Sea1 aMollica, Adriano 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 May 12, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100507663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245014500205300002000350520146200370592002801832650002201860650001201882650001301894650001901907650001701926700006101943700001502004700003002019700005902049700005902108700005602167773017302223856008102396852000902477655001202486IND60755534020221121160930.0211103e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075553402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c032962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanesan, Arvind1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9840-509710aControlled Demolition and Reconstruction of Imidazolate and Carboxylate Metal–Organic Frameworks by Acid Gas Exposure and Linker Treatment  ap. 15582-15592.  aThe metal-linker coordination bond in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be unstable in humid and acid gas environments, leading to loss of crystallinity and porosity. This degradation is not necessarily irreversible; solvent-assisted crystal redemption (“SACRed”) has been shown to recover the physical and chemical properties of ZIF-8 exposed to humid SO₂. This approach can also be useful in creating mixed-linker materials that might be challenging to produce via de novo synthesis. Here, we expand more generally the concept of controlled degradation of a MOF with acid gas, followed by treatment with a fresh linker solution, to the use of different template MOFs (ZIFs, UiO-66, and UiO-67) and acid gases (SO₂ and NO₂ in dry and humid conditions). Significant losses in porosity and crystallinity along with structural changes (acid gas-linker complexes and linker functionalizations) are observed in the acid gas-exposed MOF templates, and SACRed is shown to reconstruct these partially demolished MOFs with a high degree of structural recovery. Detailed structural and spectroscopic characterizations of the controlled degradation and subsequent recovery are presented and analyzed. These findings indicate the generality of controlled degradation and reconstruction as a means for linker replacement in a wider variety of MOFs and also create the potential for linker substitutions (with non-native linkers) to obtain new hybrid MOFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3ahybrids 3aporosity 3aprocess design 3aspectroscopy1 aPurdy, Stephen C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9870-10291 aYu, Zhenzi1 aBhattacharyya, Souryadeep1 aPage, Katharine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9071-33831 aSholl, David S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2771-91681 aNair, Sankar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5339-470X0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 60, no. 43 p.15582-15592dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c032963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245011500178300001600293520187000309592002802179650001402207650001702221650002802238650001502266650001502281650001802296650002702314650001602341650001502357653003202372653002202404653002202426653001302448653001602461653002702477653002602504700006502530700002502595700002102620700002002641773010602661856008702767852000902854655001202863IND60634017120221120070631.0190516e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063401712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDejtaradon, Pitchayut10aImpact of ZnO and CuO nanoparticles on the rheological and filtration properties of water-based drilling fluid  ap. 354-367.  aDuring the past decade, many researchers have reported on various improvements to water-based drilling fluid properties through the addition of different nanoparticles to improve the rheological properties, the thermal and electrical conductivity, and fluid loss control. Although various types of nanoparticles have been tested for their ability to improve the rheological and filtration properties of water-based drilling fluids at low pressure and temperature, some of them have not yet been tested at elevated pressure and temperature. In this study, the impact of different concentrations of ZnO and CuO nanoparticle additives on the rheological properties of a water-based drilling fluid at 25 °C, 50 °C and 80 °C, and on the filtration properties at 500 psi and 100 °C was studied. A range of ZnO and CuO nanoparticle concentrations, from 0.1 to 1 wt%, were prepared as nanofluids and introduced as additives (1 vol%) into prepared water-based base drilling fluids. The rheological properties for both nanoparticle-based drilling fluids showed a significant improvement over the base drilling fluid, with ZnO providing a better overall performance than CuO. Both nanoparticle-based drilling fluids were also observed to be more stable at elevated temperatures. For the filtration tests conducted under elevated pressure and temperature conditions (500 psi and 100 °C), a greater reduction in filtration loss was obtained at 0.8 wt% CuO nanoparticles (30.2%), compared to 0.8 wt% ZnO nanoparticles (18.6%). Mud cake thickness was also reduced, compared to the base fluid, with the CuO (27.6%) and ZnO (24.6%) nanoparticle fluids. These results demonstrate the ability of ZnO and CuO nanoparticles to enhance the properties of water-based drilling fluids, and their potential to be used as a high-efficiency filtration loss additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acupric oxide 3aelectrical conductivity 3afiltration 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3arheological properties 3atemperature 3azinc oxide 0aWater-based drilling fluids 0aZnO nanoparticles 0aCuO nanoparticles 0aPressure 0aTemperature 0aRheological properties 0aFiltration properties1 aḤamīdī, Ḥusayn,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1872-24101 aChuks, Michael Halim1 aWilkinson, David1 aRafati, Roozbeh0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 June 05, v. 570 p.354-367dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005300165300001600218520170900234592002801943650002001971650001301991650001102004650002102015650002602036650000902062650002802071650001002099650001902109650001102128650001102139650001402150650001402164650001802178650001202196650001302208700001902221773008402240856008102324852000902405655001202414IND60123734920221120164050.0150331e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012373492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10393-014-0931-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWork, Thierry10aTo Understand Coral Disease, Look at Coral Cells  ap. 610-618.  aDiseases threaten corals globally, but 40 years on their causes remain mostly unknown. We hypothesize that inconsistent application of a complete diagnostic approach to coral disease has contributed to this slow progress. We quantified methods used to investigate coral disease in 492 papers published between 1965 and 2013. Field surveys were used in 65% of the papers, followed by biodetection (43%), laboratory trials (20%), microscopic pathology (21%), and field trials (9%). Of the microscopic pathology efforts, 57% involved standard histopathology at the light microscopic level (12% of the total investigations), with the remainder dedicated to electron or fluorescence microscopy. Most (74%) biodetection efforts focused on culture or molecular characterization of bacteria or fungi from corals. Molecular and immunological tools have been used to incriminate infectious agents (mainly bacteria) as the cause of coral diseases without relating the agent to specific changes in cell and tissue pathology. Of 19 papers that declared an infectious agent as a cause of disease in corals, only one (5%) used microscopic pathology, and none fulfilled all of the criteria required to satisfy Koch’s postulates as applied to animal diseases currently. Vertebrate diseases of skin and mucosal surfaces present challenges similar to corals when trying to identify a pathogen from a vast array of environmental microbes, and diagnostic approaches regularly used in these cases might provide a model for investigating coral diseases. We hope this review will encourage specialists of disease in domestic animals, wildlife, fish, shellfish, and humans to contribute to the emerging field of coral disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal diseases 3abacteria 3acorals 3adomestic animals 3afield experimentation 3afish 3afluorescence microscopy 3afungi 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3amodels 3apathogens 3ashellfish 3askin diseases 3asurveys 3awildlife1 aMeteyer, Carol0 tEcoHealth.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 4 p.610-618dSpringer-Verlagx1612-92027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10393-014-0931-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245011400163300001500277500002000292520074300312592002801055650002101083650001201104650002001116650002001136650000901156650001001165650001401175650001201189650001701201650001601218650002001234650001001254700002101264700002301285700006001308700002501368700002201393700006401415773013201479856007401611852000901685655001201694IND60784423220221122060920.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078442322DNAL7 a10.1111/vru.130952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarneiro, Rafael K.10aExcretory urographic, ultrasonographic, and cystoscopic characteristics of urinary bladder abscesses in a dog  ap.

Survey radiographs were inconclusive. Excretory urography allowed visualization of two filling defects in the cranioventral urinary bladder region.

The cystoscopic diagnosis was urinary bladder abscesses and urine cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial/anti‐inflammatory therapy was started with good clinical outcomes and negative culture after 21 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abladder 3abladder calculi 3acalcium oxalate 3adogs 3amales 3aradiology 3asurveys 3atherapeutics 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 3aurine1 aPereira, Tainara1 aBrun, Maurício V.1 ada Cruz, Igor C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0615-99901 aAntunes, Bernardo N.1 aPozzobon, Ricardo1 aFeliciano, Marcus R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4373-65390 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2022 July, v. 63, no. 4 p.E7-E10dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.130953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012000169300001600289520197900305592002802284650001902312650002202331650001602353650002102369650001402390650002702404650002202431653001902453653001302472653001502485653002102500653003202521700001702553700002202570700002102592700002202613700002202635773011202657856008202769852000902851655001202860IND60526980720221120191931.0190411e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052698072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2016.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGinaldi, Fabrizio10aInteroperability of agronomic long term experiment databases and crop model intercomparison: the Italian experience  ap. 209-222.  aThe IC-FAR national project (Linking long term observatories with crop system modelling for better understanding of climate change impact, and adaptation strategies for Italian cropping systems) initiated in 2013 with the primary aim of implementing data from 16 long term Italian agronomic experiments in a common, interoperable structure. The building of a common database (DB) structure demands a harmonization process aimed at standardising concepts, language and data in order to make them clear, and has to produce a well-documented and easily available tool for the whole scientific community. The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) has made a great effort in this sense, improving the vocabulary developed by the International Consortium for Agricultural Systems Applications (ICASA) and defining harmonization procedures. Nowadays, these ones have also to be addressed to facilitate the extraction of input files for crop model simulations. Substantially, two alternative directions can be pursued: adapting data to models, building a standard storage structure and using translators that convert DB information to model input files; or adapting models to data, using the same storage structure for feeding modelling solutions constituted by combining model components, re-implemented in the same model platform.The ICFAR information management system simplifies data entry, improves model input extraction (implementing System Dynamics ontology), and satisfies both the paradigms. This has required the development of different software tools: ICFAR-DB for data entry and storage; a model input extractor for feeding the crop models (MoLInEx); SEMoLa platform for building modelling solutions and performing via scripts the model intercomparison. The use of the standard AgMIP/ICASA nomenclature in the ICFAR-DB and the opportunity to create files with MoLInex for feeding AgMIP model translators allow full system interoperability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3acrop models 3acropping systems 3adatabases 3ainformation management 3asimulation models 0aData structure 0aDatabase 0aCrop model 0aInteroperability 0aLong term field experiments1 aBindi, Marco1 aMarta, Anna Dalla1 aFerrise, Roberto1 aOrlandini, Simone1 aDanuso, Francesco0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2016 July, v. 77 p.209-222dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2016.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245020300208300002000411520147400431592002801905650001501933650001501948650003001963650001501993650001002008650001102018700002002029700001902049773013802068856008002206852000902286655001202295IND60742817420221120121010.0210624e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074281742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c009142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujisawa, Jun-ichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8703-485X10aInterfacial Charge-Transfer Transitions in TiO₂ Nanoparticles Adsorbed with 4-Mercaptobenzenoic Acid: Carboxy versus Thiol Anchor and Adsorbate-to-TiO₂ versus TiO₂-to-Adsorbate Charge Transfer  ap. 13534-13541.  aInterfacial charge-transfer transitions (ICTTs) in surface coordination complexes of organic compounds with inorganic semiconductors enable the absorption of visible light with colorless organic molecules and direct photoinduced charge separation for applications in photoenergy conversions and biosensing. The surface complex of 4-mercaptobenzenoic acid (4-MBA) with TiO₂ nanoparticles has attracted much attention for the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). However, the adsorption and electronic structures and optical properties of the TiO₂–4-MBA surface complex remain to be clarified. Here, we examine the TiO₂–4-MBA surface complex in detail experimentally and computationally. Upon adsorption of 4-MBA, TiO₂ nanoparticles show a broad absorption band in the visible region. The IR vibrational analysis clearly indicates that 4-MBA adsorbs on TiO₂ via the carboxylate group, contrary to the reported thiol linkage. Ionization potential measurements and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations reveal that the absorption band is attributed to ICTT from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the adsorbed 4-MBA to the conduction band of TiO₂, contrary to the reported TiO₂-to-adsorbate photoinduced charge-transfer scheme. Our research clarifies the predominant adsorption mode of 4-MBA via the carboxylate linkage and organic-to-inorganic ICTT and suggests that the reported SERS originates from the ICTT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3aionization 3alight 3athiols1 aKaneko, Naohito1 aHanaya, Minoru0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 June 10, v. 125, no. 24 p.13534-13541dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c009143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03462naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012800165300001600293520186700309592002802176650002302204650001802227650001802245650001902263650001502282650001402297650002002311650001902331650001202350650001502362650001902377650002002396650001102416650001402427650001902441650000902460650001002469650002002479651001002499653001902509653002302528653002002551653001802571653001702589700001502606700001702621700001802638700001702656700002102673773011102694856008202805852000902887655001202896IND60526980820221120191929.0190411e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052698082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2016.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBregaglio, S.10aCoupling a generic disease model to the WARM rice simulator to assess leaf and panicle blast impacts in a temperate climate  ap. 107-117.  aBlast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae B. Couch) is one of the most important causes of rice yield losses worldwide. Although farmers implement countermeasures to limit its impacts, blast disease is still an important constraint to rice production in both tropical and temperate environments. This study presents the coupling of a generic disease model to the WARM rice simulator to quantify the pathogen impact on key physiological processes and thus on final yield. The impact of leaf blast was simulated by reducing the photosynthetic leaf area index and in turn radiation interception, as a function of disease progress rate. Panicle blast damage was reproduced by decreasing the percentage of photosynthates translocated to kernels. The modelling solution was calibrated and evaluated using field observations of blast impact at harvest, collected on 20 rice cultivars with different blast resistance and grown in five sites in Northern Italy in the period 1996–2012 (total 272 observations). Results showed a good correlation between simulated impacts (fraction of potential yield) and observations (0–5 scale used for the visual assessment, with 0=no impact and 5=complete crop failure), for both calibration (R2=0.57) and evaluation (R2=0.51) datasets. Model outputs were converted to the same scale used for the visual assessments to perform an in-depth evaluation of the modelling solution, which exactly matched the 46% of observed impact values, and presented an error of 1 class in 48.2% of the cases. This study demonstrated the soundness of the approach developed for crop-pathogen interactions and its suitability for the application in research—e.g., to explore the impacts of climate change on blast-related yield losses —and operational contexts—e.g., to test alternate fungicide strategies to optimize agricultural chemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aagrochemicals 3ablast disease 3aclimate change 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adisease models 3afarmers 3afungicides 3ainflorescences 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aphotosynthates 3arice 3aseeds 3atemperate zones 3aItaly 0aBiotic damages 0aDisease resistance 0aPathogen impact 0aPanicle blast 0aYield losses1 aTitone, P.1 aCappelli, G.1 aTamborini, L.1 aMongiano, G.1 aConfalonieri, R.0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2016 May, v. 76 p.107-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2016.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02474naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013400170300001800304520101900322592002801341650002301369650002401392650002601416650001601442650002301458650001501481650001301496650001401509650002201523650001801545650001301563653002401576653001301600653001801613653002301631653002501654700001301679700001301692700001601705700001801721700001701739700001301756700001901769773009901788856008401887852000901971655001201980IND60701594720221117030018.0210312e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070159472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiang, Weiling,10aTranscriptome and complete chloroplast genome of Glycyrrhiza inflata and comparative analyses with the other two licorice species  ap. 4179-4188.  aIn this study, we characterized the transcriptome and chloroplast genome of Glycyrrhiza inflata and performed comparative analyses with G. uralensis and G. glabra. 60,541unigenes were obtained from the transcriptome of G. inflata. The results of function annotation revealed a similar distribution of functional categories among three licorice species. By comparing chloroplast genomes of licorice species, it was demonstrated that the structure and the length of genome as well as gene content and gene order were highly similar. The phylogenetic tree, constructed with the mixed data of transcriptome and chloroplast genome, elucidated that G. inflata and G. glabra had a closer relationship than G. uralensis. Six regions were suggested as potential markers for the identification of three licorice species. In each licorice species, two unigenes were homologous to reference flavonol synthase. For G. inflata, 48 and 21 RNA editing sites were detected by PREP-Cp program and RNA-Seq data mapping, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycyrrhiza glabra 3aGlycyrrhiza inflata 3aGlycyrrhiza uralensis 3aRNA editing 3achloroplast genome 3agene order 3alicorice 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes 0aGlycyrrhiza inflata 0aLicorice 0aTranscriptome 0aChloroplast genome 0aComparative analyses1 aTan, Wei1 aGao, Han1 aYu, Xiaolei1 aZhang, Huanyu1 aBian, Yuhong1 aWang, Yu1 aTian, Xiaoxuan0 tGenomics.g2020 Nov., v. 112, no. 6 p.4179-4188dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245014700170300001800317520103900335592002801374650000801402650001801410650001501428650001501443650000901458650001501467650002501482650002001507650003101527650001001558650001701568650002301585650000901608650002601617650003701643650001201680650001701692650001701709650001801726650002001744650002501764653002301789653000901812653002001821653001901841653001601860653002101876653002001897700003501917700002101952700002701973700002202000700002402022773009902046856008402145852000902229655001202238IND60701594820221117030409.0210312e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070159482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.06.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasias, Dimitris10aTranscriptome analysis of the adipose tissue in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome identifies gene signatures related to disease pathogenesis  ap. 4053-4062.  aThe white adipose tissue (WAT) contributes to the metabolic imbalance observed in obesity and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) by mechanisms that are poorly understood.

ApoE3L.CETP mice were fed a high fat (HFD) or a low-fat (LFD) diet for different time periods. Adipose RNA was analyzed by microarrays. We found an increasing number of differentially expressed transcripts during MetS development. In mice with MetS, 1396 transcripts were differentially expressed including transcripts related to immune/inflammatory responses and extracellular matrix enzymes, suggesting significant inflammation and tissue remodeling. The top list of pathways included focal adhesion, chemokine, B and T cell receptor and MAPK signaling. The data identify for the first time adipose gene signatures in apoE3L.CETP mice with diet-induced MetS and might open new avenues for investigation of potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aT-lymphocytes 3abiomarkers 3achemokines 3adiet 3aepididymis 3aextracellular matrix 3afocal adhesions 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ametabolic syndrome 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3atherapeutics 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3awhite adipose tissue 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aMetS 0aTranscriptomics 0aAdipose tissue 0aMicroarrays 0aapoE3L.CETP mice 0aGene signatures1 aDalakoura-Karagkouni, Katerina1 aVassou, Despoina1 aPapagiannakis, Giorgos1 aPapadaki, Ariadni1 aKardassis, Dimitris0 tGenomics.g2020 Nov., v. 112, no. 6 p.4053-4062dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12348x0888-75437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.06.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02193naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245012500203300002000328520115900348592002801507650002001535650001901555650003101574700005901605773017301664856008101837852000901918655001201927IND60755534420221121160903.0211103e20211025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075553442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c034012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinel, Pietro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8263-764310aSelective Dissolution Process Featuring a Classification Device for the Removal of Fines in Crystallization: Experiments  ap. 15752-15765.  aWith the aim of removing fine particles from a suspension obtained by crystallization, a selective dissolution process featuring a hydrocyclone is compared against a well-established partial dissolution process with a dedicated experimental campaign, which complements an earlier theoretical study. For this purpose, 3D printed hydrocyclones, solid–liquid separation devices, are studied in detail and successfully operated under conditions viable at the laboratory scale. A model due to Braun is fitted to the experimental results and validated using a cross validation strategy, thus providing a valuable tool for process simulation. The experimental campaign is designed to comparatively assess the efficacy and efficiency of the two processes under analysis as a function of their respective operating conditions, finally demonstrating the superior performance of the selective dissolution process. In particular, it is shown that while in a standard partial dissolution process 20–40% of the suspended mass has to be dissolved to remove a reasonable amount of fines, the proposed process reaches the same goal by dissolving as little as 3–10%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystallization 3aprocess design 3athree-dimensional printing1 aMazzotti, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4948-67050 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Oct. 25, v. 60, no. 43 p.15752-15765dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c034013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245008200198300001600280500002000296520170100316592002802017650001002045650001902055650000902074650001902083650001002102650001402112650002602126650001602152650001402168650001602182700005802198700005602256700002002312700002302332700002002355700002702375700005802402773013302460856007402593852000902667655001202676IND60784423620221122093239.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078442362DNAL7 a10.1111/vru.130632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGombert, Alexis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9387-690610aImaging features of retroperitoneal extra‐adrenal paragangliomas in 10 dogs  ap. 393-402.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRetroperitoneal paragangliomas are rare tumors of the neuroendocrine system. Only a few canine case reports are available with rare descriptions of their imaging features. The objectives of this multi‐center, retrospective case series study were to describe the diagnostic imaging features of confirmed retroperitoneal paragangliomas and specify their location. Medical records and imaging studies of 10 affected dogs with cytological or histopathologic results concordant with retroperitoneal paragangliomas were evaluated. Dogs had a median age of 9 years. Four of them had clinical signs and laboratory reports compatible with excessive production of catecholamines. Six ultrasound, four CT, four radiographic, and one MRI studies were included. The paragangliomas did not have a specific location along the aorta. They were of various sizes (median 33 mm, range: 9–85 mm of length). Masses had heterogeneous parenchyma in six of 10 dogs, regardless of the imaging modality. Strong contrast enhancement was found in all CT studies. Encircling of at least one vessel was detected in six of 10 masses, clear invasion of a vessel was identified in one of 10 masses. In five of 10 cases, the masses were initially misconstrued as lymph nodes by the on‐site radiologist. Retroperitoneal paragangliomas appear along the abdominal aorta, often presenting heterogeneous parenchyma, possibly affecting the local vasculature, and displaying strong contrast enhancement on CT. Clinical signs can be secondary to mass effects or excessive catecholamine production. Underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of this tumor are suspected as they can be silent, of small size, or confused with other structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaorta 3acatecholamines 3adogs 3ahistopathology 3alymph 3aneoplasms 3aneurosecretory system 3aradiography 3aradiology 3aultrasonics1 aDiana, Alessia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1709-39201 aHecht, Silke1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8805-836X1 aNicoli, Stefano1 aFracassi, Federico1 aMortier, Jeremy1 aReyes‐Gomez, Edouard1 aPey, Pascaline1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3917-47560 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2022 July, v. 63, no. 4 p.393-402dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.130633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245020700208300002000415520105400435592002801489650001601517650002201533650002801555650002101583650001601604650001201620650002101632650001201653650001101665650002301676650001501699650001101714650001601725700002701741700002401768700002801792700002801820700002101848700001901869700002101888700002801909700006701937773013802004856008002142852000902222655001202231IND60742817720220218000000.0210624e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074281772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c013962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrzywiecki, Maciej1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6151-881010aChemical and Electronic Structure Characterization of Electrochemically Deposited Nickel Tetraamino-phthalocyanine: A Step toward More Efficient Deposition Techniques for Organic Electronics Application  ap. 13542-13550.  aPhthalocyanines (Pc), with or without metal ligands, are still of high research interest, mainly for the application in organic electronics. Because of rather low solubility, Pc-based films are commonly deposited applying various advanced and demanding vacuum techniques, like physical vapor deposition (PVD). In this work, an alternative straightforward approach of NiPc layer formation is proposed in which NH₂-side groups of nickel(II) tetraamino-phthalocyanine (AmNiPc) are engaged in the process of electrochemical deposition of (AmNiPc)ₗₐyₑᵣ on indium-tin oxide (ITO) substrates. The resulting layer is widely investigated by cyclic voltammetry, atomic force microscopy, UV–vis, and ATR-IR spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction, and photoemission techniques: X-ray and UV-photoelectron spectroscopies. The chemical and electronic structure of (AmNiPc)ₗₐyₑᵣ is characterized. It is shown that the electronic properties of the formed (AmNiPc)ₗₐyₑᵣ/ITO hybrid correspond to the ones previously reported for PVD-NiPc films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectronics 3ahybrids 3aindium tin oxide 3aligands 3anickel 3aphysical chemistry 3asolubility 3avapors 3avoltammetry1 aPluczyk-Małek, Sandra1 aPowroźnik, Paulina1 aŚłusarczyk, Czesław,1 aKról-Molenda, Wirginia1 aSmykała, Szymon1 aKurek, Justyna1 aKoptoń, Paulina1 aŁapkowski, Mieczysław1 aBlacha-Grzechnik, Agata1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5269-81540 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 June 15, v. 125, no. 24 p.13542-13550dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c013963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245009000158300001400248520139200262592002801654650001601682650001101698650001201709650001301721650001201734650002401746650001001770650002301780650002101803650002101824650002601845650002401871650001501895651001801910651001801928653001701946653001801963653001601981653002601997653001702023653002302040653001402063773010702077856003802184852000902222655001202231IND4472720420221118063342.0120319s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447272042DNAL7 a10.1071/WF101402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrooks, Matthew L.10aEffects of high fire frequency in creosote bush scrub vegetation of the Mojave Desert  ap. 61-68.  aPlant invasions can increase fire frequency in desert ecosystems where fires were historically infrequent. Although there are many resource management concerns associated with high frequency fire in deserts, fundamental effects on plant community characteristics remain largely unstudied. Here I describe the effects of fire frequency on creosote bush scrub vegetation in the Mojave Desert, USA. Biomass of the invasive annual grass Bromus rubens L. increased following fire, but did not increase further with additional fires. In contrast, density, cover and species richness of native perennial plants each decreased following fire and continued to decrease with subsequent fires, although not as dramatically as after the initial fire. Responses were similar 5 and 14 years post-fire, except that cover of Hymenoclea salsola Torr. & A. Gray and Achnatherum speciosa Trin. & Rupr. both increased in areas burnt once. These results suggest that control of B. rubens may be equally warranted after one, two or three fires, but revegetation of native perennial plants is most warranted following multiple fires. These results are valid within the scope of this study, which is defined as relatively short term vegetation responses (≤14 years) to short fire return intervals (6.3 and 7.3 years for the two and three fire frequency levels) within creosote bush scrub of the Mojave Desert.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchnatherum 3aBromus 3abiomass 3acreosote 3adeserts 3aecological invasion 3afires 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3aland restoration 3aplant characteristics 3aresource management 3ashrublands 3aMojave Desert 3aUnited States 0aannual grass 0aBromus rubens 0adisturbance 0aecosystem transformer 0afire effects 0agrass–fire cycle 0ared brome0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2012, v. 21, no. 1 p.61-68dCSIRO Publishingx1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF10140  aDNAL 7aarticle01650naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013900166520046200305592002800767650001600795650002200811650001800833650001300851650002200864653002400886653000800910653002100918653002100939653001600960700001700976700002200993700001501015700001501030700002001045773010501065856008501170852000901255655001201264IND60752931520221120181422.0211114e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075293152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2021.1084572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojas, A.H.10aStructure investigation on a novel 2-halo-2,3-unsaturated-N-galactoside, NMR and X-ray diffraction of a monoclinic multidomain crystal  aSingle crystal X-ray and NMR investigations on multidomain structured N-(4,6-di-O-acetyl-2,3-dideoxy-α-D-threo-hex-2-en-2-iodo-pyranosyl)-methylsulfonamide are reported.

In Thailand, an unidentified disease associated with runting-stunting syndrome and neoplasia, resembling REV infection, has been continuously observed in several chicken farms. However, REV infection in Thailand has never been reported. In this study, we investigated the occurrence and genetic characteristics of REVs in chickens in Thailand from 2013 to 2016. Of the 130 clinical samples obtained from 29 chicken farms from 9 provinces located in the major chicken-raising regions of Thailand, including the central, eastern, northern, and northeastern parts of Thailand, 51 samples (39.23%) and 21 farms (72.41%) were REV-positive. REV-positive samples were detected in all 9 provinces tested. Our results demonstrated that REV was extensively distributed in the major chicken-raising regions of Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence showed that Thai REV was most closely related to Chinese, Taiwanese, and the US REV strains isolated from different avian species and clustered into REV subtype III. This finding indicates that REV subtype III was predominantly circulated in Thai chicken flocks. This study is the first report on REV infection in chickens in Thailand. Our findings raise the awareness of REV as another causative agent of runting and oncogenic disease in chickens in Thailand and highlight the wide distribution of REV infection among chickens worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRP5905010230cAgricultural Research Development Agencydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100005076  cChulalongkorn Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002873  aRTA6080012cThailand Research Funddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004396 3aReticuloendotheliosis virus 3achickens 3aetiological agents 3afarms 3aflocks 3aimmunosuppression 3aneoplasms 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apoultry diseases 3aThailand 3aUnited States 0achickens 0agenetic characterization 0areticuloendotheliosis virus 0aThailand1 aWannaratana, Suwarak1 aSasipreeyajan, Jiroj0 tPoultry science.g2019 June 01, v. 98, no. 6 p.2432-2438dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012400164300002000288520101000308592002801318650002301346650002401369650001701393650002101410650000701431650001901438650002501457700002601482700006101508773017301569856008101742852000901823655001201832IND60755534620221121160917.0211103e20211022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075553462DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c038332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero, Iveth10aExperimental Study of the Aqueous Phase Reaction of Hydrogen Sulfide with MEA-Triazine Using In Situ Raman Spectroscopy  ap. 15549-15557.  aA method for quantitation of bisulfide in the aqueous phase reactions of H₂S scavenging with MEA-triazine is proposed. The method is based on time-resolved in situ Raman spectroscopy, thus allowing in situ monitoring of the reactions. The method is applied to obtain the kinetic data of the reactions in batch configuration at room temperature for initial pH values of 9, 10, and 11 and MEA-triazine/bisulfide initial concentration ratios in the range of 0.5–10. The pH increases remarkably during the reactions, causing a substantial decrease in the rate of disappearance of bisulfide. If the system is reacidified, complete depletion of bisulfide can be achieved, evidencing the irreversibility of the scavenging reactions. The results are also supported by a qualitative analysis of the trends of the characteristic Raman peaks of MEA-triazine, dithiazine, and monoethanolamine. These trends are in line with the currently accepted reaction scheme, consisting of two scavenging reactions in series.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aethanolamine 3ahydrogen sulfide 3apH 3aprocess design 3aqualitative analysis1 aKucheryavskiy, Sergey1 aMaschietti, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3120-75600 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2021 Oct. 22, v. 60, no. 43 p.15549-15557dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c038333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008700168300001600255520114300271592002801414650002301442650002201465650003701487650001701524650001101541650001501552650002301567650001101590650002001601650003701621650001601658650001901674650001701693650001101710650002101721650003701742650002601779650001501805653002001820653002501840653001901865653001901884653002001903700001501923700001601938700001901954700001601973700001801989773010602007856008702113852000902200655001202209IND60634017720221120091431.0190516e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063401772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Yumei10aFacile synthesis and bi-functionality of mesoporous TiO2 implanted with AgCu alloy  ap. 420-428.  aHere, by a simple one-step in situ chemical reduction method, the AgxCuy alloy was tailored on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 (M-TiO2), therefore, a series of bi-functional mesoporous TiO2 nanohybrids (M-TiO2/AgxCuy) for both surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection and photocatalytic degradation of ampicillin (AMP) were achieved.

Thus, the M-TiO2/AgxCuy nanohybrids could be used as efficient SERS substrates to sensitively monitor the AMP in water with lower detection limit (˜ 1 ppt) than P25−Ag−Cu. Besides, the M-TiO2/Ag3Cu1 nanohybrid also showed higher photocatalytic activities for the degradation of AMP under UV irradiation over the M-TiO2/Ag, the M-TiO2/Cu and the P25−Ag−Cu. This work provided a simple and effective approach to synthesize bi-functional nanohybrids for detection and degradation of organic contaminants in wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aalloys 3aampicillin 3achemical reduction 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ananohybrids 3aphotocatalysis 3aporous media 3asilver 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater 0aMesoporous TiO2 0aNano-micro composite 0aSERS detection 0aPhotocatalysis 0aWater treatment1 aQin, Lixia1 aLiu, Jiefei1 aKang, Shi-Zhao1 aLi, Guodong1 aLi, Xiangqing0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 June 05, v. 570 p.420-428dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03747naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245010000186300001600286520164000302592002801942650001401970650001901984650001302003650002502016650001102041650001602052650002002068650001102088650002002099650002502119650001302144650001302157650001402170650001802184650001802202650001002220650000902230650002802239650004202267650003702309650002902346650001102375650004502386650001102431650003402442650002502476650001302501650000902514650004602523650003502569650001602604650003602620650001802656650003202674650003202706700001502738700001602753700002002769700001802789700001302807773008902820856008402909990002302993852000903016655001203025IND60087378520221120112132.0141102e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008737852DNAL7 a220237462pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2011.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreymann, U.10aExpanded human meniscus-derived cells in 3-D polymer–hyaluronan scaffolds for meniscus repair  ap. 677-685.  aTreatment options for lesions of the avascular region of the meniscus using regenerative medicine approaches based on resorbable scaffolds are rare. Recent approaches using scaffold-based techniques for tissue regeneration known from cartilage repair may be a promising treatment option for meniscal tears. The aim of the study was the investigation of meniscus matrix formation of in vitro expanded human meniscus-derived cells in a three-dimensional (3-D) bioresorbable polymer graft for meniscal repair approaches. Cultivation of the human meniscus cells was performed in a resorbable scaffold material made of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and hyaluronic acid, stabilized with fibrin glue. Cell viability and distribution of human meniscus cells in PGA–hyaluronan scaffolds were evaluated by fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide staining. Verification of typical meniscal extracellular matrix molecules like type I and type III collagen was performed histologically, immunohistochemically and by gene expression analysis. In results, 3-D scaffold-based meniscus cultures showed high cell viability over an observational period of 21days in PGA–hyaluronan scaffolds. On the protein level, type I collagen and proteoglycans were evident. Gene expression analysis confirmed the re-expression of meniscus-specific markers in PGA–hyaluronan scaffolds. This study demonstrated that in vitro expanded human meniscus cells allow for formation of meniscal matrix components when cultured in 3-D PGA–hyaluronan scaffolds stabilized with fibrin. These results encourage scaffold-based approaches for the treatment of meniscal lesions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acartilage 3acell viability 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3afibrin 3afluorescein 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ahyaluronic acid 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amedicine 3apolymers 3apropidium 3aproteoglycans 3atissue repair 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAlcian Bluexmetabolism 2aBiocompatible Materialsxpharmacology 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Shapexdrug effects 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aHyaluronic Acidxpharmacology 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aKinetics 2aMale 2aMenisci, Tibialxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolyglycolic Acidxpharmacology 2aTissue Donors 2aTissue Scaffoldsxchemistry 2aWound Healingxdrug effects1 aEndres, M.1 aNeumann, K.1 aScholman, H.-J.1 aMorawietz, L.1 aKaps, C.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2012 Feb., v. 8, no. 2 p.677-685dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2011.10.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002700180245008100207300001600288506007600304520086200380592002801242506003701270650001301307650002001320650001801340650001101358650002701369653000901396653001201405653000901417653002901426653000801455653001801463700002501481773010401506856007301610852000901683655001201692IND60691089020221207142448.0200427e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069108902DNAL7 a10.4161/rna.236962doi7 aPMC36722742pmcid7 a233922452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalasubramanian, Divya10aNew developments in post-transcriptional regulation of operons by small RNAs  ap. 337-341.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSmall regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are influential post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression in bacteria. They regulate gene expression by base pairing to target mRNAs, leading to inhibition of translation and/or alteration of mRNA stability. Recently, several sRNAs have been discovered to regulate genes encoded in operons. In some cases, these sRNAs regulate all the genes encoded by the polycistronic mRNA (coordinate regulation) while in other cases, only a select subset of cistrons is controlled by the sRNA (discoordinate regulation). In this point of view, mechanisms of regulation and characteristics of sRNA-mRNA interactions involving polycistronic mRNAs are described. The diversity in mechanisms represented by these few characterized examples suggests that we still have much to learn about sRNA regulation of long polycistronic messages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aoperon 3atranslation (genetics) 0aSgrS 0aSpot 42 0aRyhB 0atranslational inhibition 0aHfq 0apolycistronic1 aVanderpool, Carin K.0 tRNA biology.g2013 Mar. 1, v. 10, no. 3 p.337-341dTaylor & FranciswJournal:27170x1555-85847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/rna.236963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010000168300001600268520089300284592002801177650001501205650001901220650002001239650002101259650000901280650001501289650001401304650001601318650001401334650001301348650001801361650002801379650001301407650001201420650000901432650001301441650001401454650001601468653001701484653001201501653001601513653001801529653001601547700001801563773010601581856008701687852000901774655001201783IND60634017820221120132716.0190516e20190605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063401782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Soomin10aPolypyrrole-coated hollow gold nanoshell exerts anti-obesity effects via photothermal lipolysis  ap. 414-419.  aObesity is one of the most serious health problems, and liposuction among the treatment strategies is the most common and popular regimen, but it induces various undesired side-effects. Here, we synthesized a polypyrrole (PPy)-coated hollow gold nanoshell (HAuNS@PPy) that minimized these side-effects of liposuction (pain, bleeding, infection, and long recovery times). To improve biocompatibility and photothermal conversion efficiency, PPy was coated on the surface of HAuNS. The synthesized HAuNS@PPy showed excellent photothermal stability under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation in a five-time recycling experiment. The temperature elevation of HAuNS in the adipose tissue reached 47.7 °C, which efficiently induced hyperthermia-mediated killing of adipocytes. Histological analysis revealed necrosis of adipocytes subjected to HAuNS@PPy treatment with NIR laser irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3aadverse effects 3abiocompatibility 3agold 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3airradiation 3alipolysis 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anear infrared radiation 3anecrosis 3aobesity 3apain 3apyrroles 3arecycling 3atemperature 0aPhotothermal 0aObesity 0aHollow gold 0aNear-infrared 0aPolypyrrole1 aKim, Younghun0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 June 05, v. 570 p.414-419dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.03.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245012000162300002000282520135800302592002801660650001201688650003001700650001701730650001301747650001901760650002001779650002601799650002201825650001601847650002001863650002201883700002001905700005901925773013801984856008002122852000902202655001202211IND60742817920221120112506.0210624e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074281792DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c015642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiaoyun10aComposition and Structure of Fluorescent Graphene Quantum Dots Generated by Enzymatic Degradation of Graphene Oxide  ap. 13361-13369.  aThe wide applications of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) in both materials and life sciences necessitate investigation of their metabolites due to the inevitable contact of CNMs and biological systems. Graphene oxide (GO), along with other types of CNMs, can be enzymatically degraded by myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme released during the innate immune response. However, enzymatic degradation products are neither well-defined nor well-understood. Some products generated during MPO-catalyzed degradation of GO could emit blue photoluminescence (PL) and were simply dubbed graphene quantum dots (GQDs) without further elucidating their structures. In this work, we use liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry to isolate and elucidate chemical structures of the MPO-catalyzed degradation products. A general chemical formula screening workflow was developed for the GQDs, which are in the form of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), obtained in the degradation products. Structures of the PAHs responsible for the blue PL were further proposed using density functional theory calculations. Our results indicated that structures with several conjugated benzene rings are likely to generate the observed PL. This work provides insights into the mechanism of enzymatic degradation and opens opportunities for fluorescence imaging of GO in biological systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzene 3adensity functional theory 3afluorescence 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ainnate immunity 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amyeloperoxidase 3aphotoluminescence1 aSorescu, Dan C.1 aStar, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7863-59870 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 June 15, v. 125, no. 24 p.13361-13369dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.1c015643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02763naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245017000165500001900335520145500354592002801809650002401837650001701861650002501878650001501903650002401918650001201942650001501954650000701969650001601976650001101992650003302003650001602036650002102052700002202073700002702095700001902122773012502141856007802266852000902344655001202353IND60738696020221119131438.0210524e20210513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073869602DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox100507732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyrpas, Michail 10aValorization of Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) Pomace by Enzyme-Assisted Extraction: Process Optimization and Comparison with Conventional Solid-Liquid Extraction  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) pomace contains a significant amount of polyphenols and can serve as a basis for food additives, nutraceuticals, and functional foods. Although various techniques can be employed to recover bioactive fractions from berry pomaces, data on enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE) of bilberry pomace are rather scarce. This study aimed to optimize critical EAE parameters using Viscozyme L to obtain a high-yield extract with enhanced antioxidant capacity. Central composite design and response surface methodology evaluating the effect of four independent variables, namely, pH, temperature, extraction time, and enzyme concentration on three responses, were employed to define optimal EAE conditions. Under the optimal conditions (pH: 4.5, temperature 46 °C, 1 h of extraction, and 2 active units (AU) of Viscozyme L/g of pomace), EAE yielded 56.15 g/100 g DW of the water-soluble fraction. Comparison with conventional maceration indicated that EAE, besides the yield, significantly increased the in vitro antioxidant capacity measured by the total phenolic content, ABTS, ORAC, and CUPRAC assays. Moreover, an increase was observed for the measured mono- and disaccharide as well as anthocyanin content. Overall, this study demonstrates the improved efficiency of EAE over conventional solid–liquid extraction to recover fractions with a higher yield and enhanced functional properties in a fast and sustainable manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium myrtillus 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3abilberries 3adietary supplements 3aenzymes 3amaceration 3apH 3apolyphenols 3apomace 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3awater solubility1 aValanciene, Egle 1 aAugustiniene, Ernesta 1 aMalys, Naglis 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 May 13, v. 10, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox100507733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245012200164300002000286520146100306592002801767650002601795650001401821650003101835650001701866650001901883650001801902650001801920650001601938650000901954650003301963653002701996653003802023653001902061653002502080653002402105700001702129700001602146700001902162700006102181773015002242856008102392852000902473655001202482IND60755534820221121160841.0211103e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075553482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c030152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Karen C.10aIdentification of Apocarotenoids as Chemical Markers of In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory Activity for Spirulina Supplements  ap. 12674-12685.  aIdentification of chemical markers in food additives and dietary supplements is crucial for quantitative assessment and standardization of their quality and efficacy. Arthrospira platensis, formerly Spirulina platensis and known colloquially as spirulina, has been widely investigated for its various biological effects, including anti-inflammation, antihypertension, antioxidant, and antiatherosclerosis. In this study, we utilized an approach involving a combination of bioassay-guided fractionation, synthesis, mass spectral molecular networking, principal component analysis (PCA), and correlation analysis to identify measurable chemical markers in spirulina products that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of commercial products in downregulating the expression level of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Consequently, we found that the apocarotenoids 3-hydroxy-β-ionone (1) and apo-13-zeaxanthinones (2a/2b) significantly repressed expression of IL-1β (9.5 ± 1.5 and 28.7 ± 0.6%, respectively) and IL-6 (10.1 ± 0.7 and 6.1 ± 0.4%, respectively) at 10 μg/mL (p < 0.05) using RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Notably, this is the first report of the isolation of these apocarotenoids from spirulina and their in vitro anti-inflammatory properties. Finally, we propose the use of our approach as a convenient way to establish markers in other dietary supplements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aSpirulina 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3afood chemistry 3afractionation 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amice 3aprincipal component analysis 0ablue-green algae (BGA) 0aArthrospira platensis (spirulina) 0aapocarotenoids 0amolecular networking 0acytokine expression1 aPham, Tho X.1 aLee, Yoojin1 aLee, Ji Young,1 aBalunas, Marcy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2374-40480 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 69, no. 43 p.12674-12685dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c030153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009200170300001200262520164000274592002801914650001501942650001501957650002401972650001201996650001302008650001502021650001302036650001702049650001302066650001102079650003302090650002202123650002302145700002302168700002202191700002902213700002502242700002402267700003202291700002602323773012502349856008102474852000902555655001202564IND60466338720221117215654.0160112e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046633872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2645-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunha, Graziele C.10aPerformance of Agroindustrial Wastes for Removal of Disinfection By-products From Water  ap. 426.  aThe aim of the present work was to use agroindustrial wastes as alternative adsorbents for the removal of trihalomethanes (THMs). SEM micrographs of sugar cane bagasse and coconut mesocarp samples showed a high degree of particle agglomeration, with particle sizes of 114.4 ± 74.0 μm, while the sugar cane bagasse particles were larger (557.3 ± 169.5 μm). The pyrogram obtained for sugar cane bagasse revealed the presence of many compounds with different functional groups containing oxygen atoms. In the case of the coconut mesocarp, the range of oxygenated functional groups was smaller. The adsorption processes showed fast kinetics, with equilibrium reached after around 240 min of contact. Adsorption tests revealed different selectivities of the biomass adsorption sites for the THMs. Adsorption percentages obtained with coconut mesocarp ranged from 49.2 ± 2.57 to 71.9 ± 1.88 %, while the values obtained for sugar cane bagasse were between 31.8 ± 1.08 and 67.4 ± 1.27 %. The orders of removal (significant at p < 0.05) were as follows: CHCl₃>CHBrCl₂>CHBr₂Cl>CHBr₃ (using sugar cane bagasse) and CHBr₂Cl>CHBrCl₂>CHCl₃>CHBr₃ (using coconut mesocarp). Use of the sugar cane bagasse resulted in high removal percentages of chloroform (51.1 %) and dichlorobromoform (42.3 %) in the first 5 min of contact, showing that this biomass had greater affinity for trihalomethane compounds with more chlorine atoms in their structures. This finding has considerable environmental importance, given that these are the two commonest compounds found in water distribution networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aagricultural wastes 3abiomass 3achlorine 3achloroform 3acoconuts 3adisinfection 3amesocarp 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asugarcane bagasse 3awater distribution1 aSantos, Mônica C.1 aAraújo, Bruno R.1 ade Jesus, Jany Hellen F.1 ados Santos, Luana O.1 aSantos, Jandyson M.1 aWisniewski, Alberto, JrcJr1 aRomão, Luciane P.

In this study, an innovative lanthanum-modified carbon (LMC) adsorbent rooted in Sargassum sp. was developed for fluoride removal. Excellent removal efficiency was observed over a wide pH range of 3–9. Almost 90% of fluoride adsorption occurred within the first 1h; the equilibrium was established within 4h. The maximum adsorption capacity of LMC could reach 94.34mg/g at neutral pH, much higher than many commercial adsorbents. Although the presence of such competitive anions as SiO3²⁻, SO4²⁻, HCO3⁻, PO4³⁻ and AsO3⁻ had certain interference on fluoride uptake, it was noticed that there was no significant impact in the presence of humic acid. Furthermore, according to the instrumental analysis, the fluoride removal was majorly controlled by outer-sphere complex adsorption, while electrostatic attraction and ion exchange mechanisms could also be observed in the fluoride adsorption process. The findings from this study suggest that our adsorbent may have a great potential in industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanions 3acarbon 3aelectrostatic interactions 3afluorides 3ahuman health 3ahumic acids 3aindustrial applications 3aion exchange 3alanthanum 3apH 3aphosphates 3asulfates 0aAdsorption 0aDefluoridation 0aFluoride 0aSargassum sp. 0aLanthanum modified carbon adsorbent1 aWang, Chenghong1 aGuo, Xue1 aPaul Chen, J.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2015 Mar. 01, v. 441 p.113-120dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.10.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245017100174300001200345520172700357592002802084650001002112650001402122650001502136650002302151650001502174650002102189650001702210650001902227650002002246650002902266650002502295650001602320650001502336650001302351650001602364650001602380650001002396650001802406650002102424650002702445650004402472650001002516700002502526700002602551700002302577700002202600700002202622700001902644700003402663773012502697856008102822852000902903655001202912IND60466338820221117215721.0160112e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046633882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2695-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLajmanovich, Rafael C.10aHarmful Effects of the Dermal Intake of Commercial Formulations Containing Chlorpyrifos, 2,4-D, and Glyphosate on the Common Toad Rhinella arenarum (Anura: Bufonidae)  ap. 427.  aAmphibians have complex life cycles with aquatic and terrestrial life and uncovered skins; therefore, they are exposed to chemical contamination, where dermal exposure is a significant route for pesticide uptake in both habitats. In this study, measurements in blood samples such as levels of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), carboxylesterase (CbE), glutathione S-transferases (GST), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), modified alkaline comet assay (ACA) for detection of oxidized bases (FPG and Endo III sites), as well as the ratio of heterophils and lymphocytes (H/L), were evaluated as non-destructive biomarkers to monitor dermal pesticide exposure in male toads of Rhinella arenarum. Toads were exposed to a solution containing a nominal concentration of commercial formulations of the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF, 10 mg/L), and herbicides 2,4-D and glyphosate (GLY) (20 mg/L, respectively). After 48 h of exposure, the levels of plasma B-sterases (BChE and CbE) were inhibited (55 and 43 %, respectively) in toads exposed to CPF. Also, the activity of GST was inducted for dermal exposure to 2,4-D, as well as the levels of TBARS due to CPF exposure. Besides this, CPF and 2,4-D exposure induced oxidative DNA damage, and the H/L ratio decreased for the both herbicide exposures. Our results showed that exposure via dermal uptake to CPF, 2,4-D, and GLY in the common toad R. arenarum induced neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immunological depression. Thus, some blood biomarkers employed in our study (B-esterases, GST, levels of TBARS, ACA, and H/L ratio) might be used as predictors in health and ecological risk assessment of amphibian populations exposed to OP insecticides and herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aBufonidae 3aDNA damage 3aat-risk population 3abiomarkers 3acarboxylesterase 3achlorpyrifos 3acholinesterase 3adermal exposure 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental health 3aglutathione 3aglyphosate 3ahabitats 3aheterophils 3alymphocytes 3amales 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apesticide formulations 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atoads1 aAttademo, Andrés M.1 aSimoniello, María F.1 aPoletta, Gisela L.1 aJunges, Celina M.1 aPeltzer, Paola M.1 aGrenón, Paula1 aCabagna-Zenklusen, Mariana C.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Dec., v. 226, no. 12 p.427-427dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2695-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245005100132300001600183500012400199500002300323520075700346650001501103650001801118650002401136650002701160650001701187650002501204650000901229650003101238650001101269653002301280653002701303700001601330773008501346852000901431939003301440945000801473946001301481655001201494991615365490742620221121233416.0920221s1988    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920002832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopple, J.D.10aVitamin B-6 nutriture in chronic renal disease  ap. 263-278.  aPaper presented at the "Third International Conference on Vitamin B-6," August 24-28, 1987, Goslar-Hahnenklee, Germany.  aLiterature review.  aThe authors present data evaluating the incidence of vitamin B-6 deficiency in patients with chronic renal failure and the dietary requirements for vitamin B-6 in chronic renal failure patients.

With its polymorphic life cycle, its worldwide distribution, and the capacity of several of the Phaeocystis species to form dense blooms, this genus is a key player for our understanding of biogeochemical cycling of elements. This paper provides an overview of what is know to date about the ecological role of viruses in regulating Phaeocystis population dynamics. It explores which variables affect the algal host-virus interactions, and examines the impact of virally induced cell lysis of Phaeocystis on the function and structure of the pelagic food web as well as on the flow of organic carbon and nutrients. 3aPhaeocystis 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3afood webs 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3amortality 3anutrients 3aphytoplankton 3apopulation dynamics 3aviruses 0aCharacteristics 0aPhaeocystis 0aPgV1 aBratbak, Gunnar 1 aBaudoux, Anne-Claire 1 aRuardij, Piet 0 tBiogeochemistry.g2007 Mar., v. 83, no. 1-3 p.201-215dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9096-03Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02890naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006900165300001600234520161600250650002001866650001801886650001201904650001401916650001001930650001201940650001601952650002801968650001501996650001902011650001102030650001402041650001702055650001502072650001902087650001302106651001402119653002202133700002602155773011302181852000902294856008502303930003302388946001102421655001202432IND4393519320221121233340.0070729e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439351932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-007-9114-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHines, Neal A. 10aMercury inputs and outputs at a small lake in northern Minnesota  ap. 265-284.  aStorages and cycling of total mercury (HgT), methylmercury (MeHg), and Hg⁰ are described for Spring Lake, a small bog lake in the Marcell Experimental Forest in north-central Minnesota. We quantified photoredox transformations, MeHg photolysis, burial to the sediments, and internal and external loadings of HgT and MeHg. Atmospheric deposition was the main input of HgT; MeHg was supplied by a combination of atmospheric, near-shore wetland, and biotic (methylation) sources. HgT outputs were dominated by burial (67%), and Hg⁰ evasion accounted for 26% of HgT outputs. The watershed of Spring Lake is small (3.7x lake surface area), and accordingly, bog and upland runoff were minor contributors to both HgT and MeHg inputs. Wet deposition was ~9% of total MeHg input, and other external inputs (runoff, sediment porewater) provided only an additional 7%, indicating that internal production of MeHg was occurring in the lake. Photolysis of MeHg, measured in the field and laboratory, removed ~3x the lake mass of MeHg (20 mg) annually, and was the dominant sink for MeHg. Residence times of MeHg and HgT in the lake were 48 and 61 days, respectively, during the open-water season, compared with only 8 days for the residence time of MeHg on settling particles (seston). Photoreduction of Hg²⁺ to Hg⁰ was greater than the reverse reaction (Hg⁰ photooxidation), and the residence time of Hg⁰ in the photic zone was short (hours). Data from this study show active cycling of all the measured species of mercury (HgT, MeHg, and Hg⁰) and the importance of MeHg photolysis and photo-redox processes. 3abiogeochemistry 3aeuphotic zone 3aforests 3ahighlands 3alakes 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3aphotolysis 3aphotooxidation 3arunoff 3asediments 3asurface area 3awatersheds 3awet deposition 3awetlands 3aMinnesota 0aElemental mercury1 aBrezonik, Patrick L. 0 tBiogeochemistry.g2007 July, v. 84, no. 3 p.265-284dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-007-9114-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03042naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009300165300001400258520168000272650001601952650001401968650002001982650001202002650001602014650001802030650000902048650003102057650002002088650001802108650002302126650001302149650001802162651002102180653002702201653001302228700001902241700002002260700001902280700002102299773011302320852000902433856008602442930003302528946001102561655001202572IND4391510520221121233346.0070522e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439151052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-007-9081-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedwick, P. N. 10aEvidence for high iron requirements of colonial Phaeocystis antarctica at low irradiance  ap. 83-97.  aWe have carried out field and laboratory experiments to examine the iron requirements of colonial Phaeocystis antarctica in the Ross Sea. In December 2003, we performed an iron/light-manipulation bioassay experiment in the Ross Sea polynya, using an algal assemblage dominated by colonial Phaeocystis antarctica, collected from surface waters with an ambient dissolved Fe concentration of ~0.4 nM. Results from this experiment suggest that P. antarctica growth rates were enhanced at high irradiance (~50% of incident surface irradiance) but were unaffected by iron addition, and that elevated irradiance mediated a significant decrease in cellular chlorophyll a content. We also conducted a laboratory iron dose-response bioassay experiment using a unialgal, non-axenic strain of colonial P. antarctica and low-iron (<0.2 nM) filtered seawater, both collected from the Ross Sea polynya in December 2003. By using rigorous trace-metal clean techniques, we performed this dose-response iron-addition experiment at ~0°C without using organic chelating reagents to control dissolved iron levels. At the relatively low irradiance of this experiment (~20 μE m-² s-¹), estimated nitrate-specific growth rate as a function of dissolved iron concentration can be described by a Monod relationship, yielding a half-saturation constant with respect to growth of 0.45 nM dissolved iron. This value is relatively high compared to reported estimates for other Antarctic phytoplankton. Our results suggest that seasonal changes in the availability of both iron and light play critical roles in limiting the growth and biomass of colonial Phaeocystis antarctica in the Ross Sea polynya. 3aPhaeocystis 3abioassays 3abiogeochemistry 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adose response 3airon 3alaboratory experimentation 3alight intensity 3aphytoplankton 3aseasonal variation 3aseawater 3asurface water 3aAntarctic region 0aPhaeocystis antarctica 0aRoss Sea1 aGarcia, N.

A total of 12 and 18 strains of P. multocida obtained from two separate outbreaks were subjected to phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Phenotypically, all strains were similar; however, DNA-based techniques by employing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were found to be highly specific and sensitive for rapid detection and differentiation of strains. All 30 strains gave amplicons of approximately 460 bp and approximately 1044 bp specific for P. multocida and capsular serogroup A in the Multiplex Capsular PCR typing system. Molecular typing techniques such as repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR and single primer PCR differentiated all 30 strains into different profiles. However, similar patterns of genome fragments were observed among all strains following restriction endonuclease analysis using the enzyme HpaII. The current investigation revealed involvement of the same and multiple strains of P. multocida in two outbreaks. The results also indicated that molecular methods of detection and typing are rapid in comparison with conventional methods for epidemiological investigations of fowl cholera outbreaks. 3achickens 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease detection 3aphenotype 3afowl cholera 3agenome 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astrain differences 3adisease outbreaks 3agenotype 3aDNA fingerprinting 3amixed infection 3aPasteurella multocida 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aPasteurella Infectionsxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aPasteurella multocidaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPoultry Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 0aepidemiology 0amolecular genetics 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0astrains1 aKumar, A.A.1 aGautam, R.1 aSaxena, M.K.1 aChoudhuri, P.1 aSrivastava, S.K.0 tAvian pathology.g2005 Dec., v. 34, no. 6 p.456-462x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794505003679633Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/02/28  aNon-US 7aarticle04277naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009400184300001300278500001500291520264600306650002402952650001502976650001102991650002203002650001003024650001803034650002003052650002503072650001803097650002603115650001503141650001503156650001203171650003403183650009303217650003503310650007203345650003803417653001703455653002303472653001303495653001803508773007003526852000903596856008503605930003303690945001303723946001103736655001203747IND2328563420221121232958.0020816e200202  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232856342DNAL7 a124305502pmid7 a10.1080/030794501201065702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalvorson, D.A.14aThe control of H5 or H7 mildly pathogenic avian influenza: a role for inactivated vaccine  ap. 5-12.  a2019-12-04  aBiosecurity is the first line of defence in the prevention and control of mildly pathogenic avian influenza (MPAI). Its use has been highly successful in keeping avian influenza (AI) out of commercial poultry worldwide. However, sometimes AI becomes introduced into poultry populations and, when that occurs, biosecurity again is the primary means of controlling the disease. There is agreement that routine serological monitoring, disease reporting, isolation or quarantine of affected flocks, application of strict measures to prevent the contamination of and movement of people and equipment, and changing flock schedules are necessities for controlling AI. There is disagreement as to the disposition of MPAI-infected flocks: some advocate their destruction and others advocate controlled marketing. Sometimes biosecurity is not enough to stop the spread of MPAI. In general, influenza virus requires a dense population of susceptible hosts to maintain itself. When there is a large population of susceptible poultry in an area, use of an inactivated AI vaccine can contribute to AI control by reducing the susceptibility of the population. Does use of inactivated vaccine assist, complicate or interfere with AI control and eradication? Yes, it assists MPAI control (which may reduce the risk of highly pathogenic AI (HPAI)) but, unless steps are taken to prevent it, vaccination may interfere with sero-epidemiology in the case of an HPAI outbreak. Does lack of vaccine assist, complicate or interfere with AI control and eradication? Yes, it assists in identification of sero-positive (convalescent) flocks in a HPAI eradication program, but it interferes with MPAI control (which in turn may increase the risk of emergence of HPAI). A number of hypothetical concerns have been raised about the use of inactivated AI vaccines. Infection of vaccinated flocks, serology complications and spreading of virus by vaccine crews are some of the hypothetical concerns. The discussion of these concerns should take place in a scientific framework and should recognize that control of MPAI reduces the risk of HPAI. That inactivated vaccines have reduced a flock's susceptibility to AI infection, have reduced the quantity of virus shed post-challenge, have reduced transmission and have markedly reduced disease losses, are scientific facts. The current regulations preventing vaccination against H5 or H7 MPAI have had the effect of promoting circulation of MPAI virus in commercial poultry and live poultry markets. In the absence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, there is no justification for forbidding the use of inactivated vaccine. 3aserological surveys 3amonitoring 3aflocks 3aInfluenza A virus 3ahosts 3alive vaccines 3adisease control 3adisease transmission 3apathogenicity 3abiological resistance 3apopulation 3aquarantine 2aAnimals 2aInfluenza A virusximmunology 2aOrthomyxoviridae Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & controlxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aPoultryximmunologyxvirology. 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyximmunologyxtransmissionxvirology. 2aVaccines, Inactivatedximmunology 0aepidemiology 0aliterature reviews 0amovement 0acontamination0 tAvian pathology.g2002 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.5-12x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501201065703Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle01577naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245006600130300001600196500002300212500001500235520071500250650002600965650001900991650001801010653002301028653000901051653001401060700001601074773009801090852000901188939003301197945000801230946001301238655001201251991615362980742620221121232927.0920918e199205  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, K.E.10aBehavioral treatments for pica: a review of empirical studies  ap. 377-389.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aBehavioral treatments for the eating disorder pica are reviewed.

Food intake, body weight, body composition, activity, and metabolic rates were recorded during a 10-d baseline period and over the 61-65 d of fattening. Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured by using doubly labeled water during the baseline period and the final 10 d of Guru Walla. Cumulative overfeeding consisted of 955 +/- 252 MJ (average +/- SD) mainly as carbohydrate. Body-weight increase was 17 +/- 4 kg, 64-75% as fat. Metabolic rates increased but TEE did not. However, when accounting for the reduction in physical activity, substantial thermogenesis was observed but its amplitude was not greater than that observed under less extreme carbohydrate-overfeeding conditions. If luxuskonsumption does exist, it is not related to the magnitude of the cumulative overfeeding. 3anutrient intake 3aoverfeeding 3ametabolism 3adietary protein 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3amen 3abody weight 3aphysical activity 3aenergy expenditure 3adietary carbohydrate 3ayoung adults 3aheat production 3alean body mass 3atraditions 3abody fat 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aAdult 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aEatingxphysiology 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aExercise 2aHumans 2aMale 3aCameroon 0acultural activities 0abody composition 0aenergy balance1 aBrigant, L.1 aFroment, A.1 aKoppert, G.A.1 aBard, D.1 aGarine, I. de.1 aApfelbaum, M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Sept., v. 56, no. 3 p.483-490x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245010200148300001600250500001500266520107900281650002301360650003201383650001001415650001401425650002201439650001901461650001901480650004001499650001601539650000901555650001801564650002901582650002101611650001601632650002001648650001601668650001101684650001101695650001401706650001601720650002301736650002301759653002101782653001301803700001601816700001301832773009701845852001301942939003301955945000801988946001301996852000902009655001202018991615361120742620221121195635.0920923e199209  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030332DNAL7 a15030552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReid, I.R.10aRelationships between upper-arm anthropometry and soft-tissue composition in postmenopausal women  ap. 463-466.  a2019-12-04  aThe value of upper-arm anthropometry as a measure of lean- and fat-tissue masses in 140 normal postmenopausal white women was assessed by studying the relationships of these measures to total and regional fat, and lean masses measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Midarm circumference (MAC) was highly correlated with total and regional fat masses (r = 0.85-0.89, P < 0.0001) but less so with lean-tissue masses (r = 0.26-0.34). Triceps-skinfold thickness was also correlated with fat masses (r = 0.70-0.74, P < 0.0001) but not with lean mass (r = 0.02-0.09). The derived index, arm muscle area (AMA), was less closely correlated with fat mass than was MAC (r = 0.59-0.61), but its correlation with lean-tissue mass was comparable to that for MAC (r = 0.37-0.43). Multiple-regression analysis confirmed that the anthropometric indices were more closely correlated with fat than with lean mass. It is concluded that all these indices are useful measures of fat mass but that none, including AMA, is a specific index of lean-tissue mass in normal postmenopausal women. 3askinfold thickness 3aanthropometric measurements 3awomen 3amenopause 3abody measurements 3alimbs (animal) 3alean body mass 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histology 2aAge Factors 2aAged 2aAnthropometry 2aArmxanatomy & histology 2aBody Composition 2aBody Height 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMenopause 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Status 2aSkinfold Thickness 0abody composition 0abody fat1 aEvans, M.C.1 aAmes, R.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Sept., v. 56, no. 3 p.463-466x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006500125300001600190520094400206650001401150650001501164650001201179650002001191650001501211650002401226650002301250653001601273700001601289773006601305852000901371939003301380946001301413655001201426IND9207028420221121171922.0921117e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920702842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoux, M.M.10aEffect of soil pH on adsorption and persistence of imazaquin  ap. 490-496.  aLaboratory and field studies were conducted in 1988 through 1990 to determine the effect of soil pH on imazaquin adsorption and persistence in a Crosby silt loam (1.6% organic matter) and a Hoytville day (3.3% organic matter). Above a pH of 6, 6 to 7% of the total imazaquin present was adsorbed to both soils. Adsorption increased as pH decreased from about 7 to 4.5, with a maximum of 16.5 and 31% adsorbed on Crosby and Hoytville soils, respectively. Imazaquin was more persistent in the Hoytville clay than in the Crosby silt loam. Herbicide dissipated more slowly in both soils in 1988 than in 1989 due to dry soil conditions immediately prior to and following herbicide application in 1988. In both soils, imazaquin persistence increased as soil pH deceased, over a pH range from 6.5 to 4.5. Increased persistence with decreasing pH was attributed in part to increased adsorption and decreased availability for microbial degradation. 3aimazaquin 3aadsorption 3asoil pH 3asilt loam soils 3aclay soils 3asoil organic matter 3aherbicide residues 0apersistence1 aReese, K.D.0 tWeed science.g1992 , v. 40, no. 3 p.490-496x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02498naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245009200152300001600244500001500260520095600275650003201231650002201263650001201285650000901297650001501306650003501321650001701356650002701373650001501400650002501415650001201440650004601452650004601498650004001544650001101584650001101595650001501606650004701621651001101668651002601679653001601705653002801721700001801749700001601767773009701783852001301880939003301893945000801926946001301934852000901947655001201956991615360070742620221121171859.0920923e199209  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030412DNAL7 a15030652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeldenberg, D.10aEffect of iron on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations  ap. 533-536.  a2019-12-04  aIn 13 of 17 infants (aged 10.5 +/- 4.3; average +/- SD mo) with iron-deficiency anemia, the serum 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentration was below the normal range and in 9 of these 13 the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was below the normal range despite the fact that these infants received 10 micrograms vitamin D/d from the age of 1 mo. The infants were treated with intramuscular iron dextran (Imferon). The iron-dextran treatment increased the hemoglobin and serum iron concentrations as well as 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. It is known that iron deficiency impairs fat and vitamin A intestinal absorption. Therefore, it is suggested that absorption of vitamin D may also be impaired. This may contribute to the development of vitamin D deficiency. Iron supplementation may have improved the absorption of vitamin D in the small intestine and hence increased the vitamin D concentration in the plasma. 3adietary mineral supplements 3ahematologic tests 3acalcium 3airon 3ahemoglobin 3a24,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol 3aerythrocytes 3airon deficiency anemia 3aphosphorus 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ainfants 2a25-Hydroxyvitamin D 2xbloodxdeficiency. 2aAnemia, Hypochromicxbloodxepidemiology. 2aErgocalciferolsxbloodxdeficiency. 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aPrevalence 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxbloodxepidemiology. 3aIsrael 0aIsraelxepidemiology. 0ablood cells 0ahydroxycholecalciferols1 aTenenbaum, G.1 aWeisman, Y.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Sept., v. 56, no. 3 p.533-536x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245006200188300001600250500001500266520069700281650001200978650001300990650001301003650003101016650001501047650001001062650001701072651001601089653004201105653001201147700002101159700002201180773007301202852000901275856008501284930003301369945001301402946001101415655001201426IND2324619820221121100124.0011226e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232461982DNAL7 a191849412pmid7 a10.1080/030794501200787162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZandvliet, M.M.J.M.10aChronic pulmonary interstitial fibrosis in Amazon parrots  ap. 517-524.  a2019-12-04  aIn the Netherlands, a syndrome affecting several species of older Amazon parrots (Amazona sp.) has been described. This syndrome was characterized as a chronic respiratory disease resulting in exercise intolerance. Pathological examination revealed loss of functional lung tissue, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, and right heart failure. Haematology revealed an elevated packed cell volume as a result of an increase in erythrocyte size and an increased haemoglobin mass per erythrocyte. In two patients, hypoxia and hypercapnia were demonstrated. The aetiology of this syndrome is currently not known. The microscopic lesions resemble those found in Diffuse Interstitial Fibrosis in humans. 3aAmazona 3aetiology 3afibrosis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3ahematology 3alungs 3apathogenesis 3aNetherlands 0apathological processes and conditions 0alesions1 aDorrestein, G.M.1 aHage, M. van der.0 tAvian pathology.g2001 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.517-524x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501200787163Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03114naa a2200565 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245013100149300001600280520149200296650002101788650001201809650001001821650001301831650001401844650002001858650001301878650001501891650001601906650004401922650001001966650003501976650005102011650004202062650004602104650001102150650002102161650001102182650001102193650002102204650000902225650001702234650003202251650002202283653001002305700001602315700001302331700001402344773010202358852001302460939003302473945000802506946001302514852000902527655001202536991615356400742620221121055631.0920730e199207  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920024682DNAL7 a16246492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrady, M.S.10aEffectiveness of enteric coated pancreatic enzymes given before meals in reducing steatorrhea in children with cystic fibrosis  ap. 813-817.  aIn vitro data indicate that length of enzyme incubation with food critically affects enzyme dissolution and presumably effectiveness. This study compared the effectiveness of enteric coated (EC) pancreatic enzymes given before meals with those given during meals (15 minutes after beginning of meal) in reducing steatorrhea in well-nourished children with cystic fibrosis. Eight children (6 years 11 months old to 14 years 7 months old) were studied in the General Clinical Research Center at Indiana University Hospital, Indianapolis. A crossover study design randomly assigned enzymes before or during meals during two consecutive 7-day treatment periods for each child. No difference in fat excretion was documented for the total group when the children who took enzymes before meals were compared with those who took enzymes during meals. However, a stepwise multiple regression analysis of the difference (before minus during) in fat excretion on sex, age, enzyme number, and treatment order documented a positive correlation of age with fat excretion (r =.83). Mean fat excretion in younger children (< 10 years old) decreased significantly when enzymes were given before meals (7.14 +/- 1.95%) rather than during meals (9.92 +/- 1.61%) (P =.004). The difference in fat excretion (mean = 2.78 +/- 0.55%, range = 1.4% to 4%) translates into a half to one full year's growth potential. Younger children with cystic fibrosis may benefit clinically from taking EC enzymes before meals. 3apancreatic juice 3aenzymes 3adrugs 3abody fat 3aexcretion 3acystic fibrosis 3achildren 2aAdolescent 2aAge Factors 2aCeliac Diseasexdrug therapyxetiology. 2aChild 2aCystic Fibrosisxcomplications 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMale 2aMicrospheres 2aPancreatinxtherapeutic use 2aRandom Allocation 0ameals1 aRickard, K.1 aYu, P.L.1 aEigen, H.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1992 July, v. 92, no. 7 p.813-817x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245006800177300001600245500001500261520118200276650002801458650001601486650002001502650002001522650000901542650002301551650001501574650000901589653002401598653002501622653002601647653002201673700002101695700001701716700001801733700001701751773007301768852000901841856008501850930003301935945001301968946001101981655001201992IND2324619020221121040236.0011226e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232461902DNAL7 a191849372pmid7 a10.1080/030794501200786712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMete, A.12aA comparative study of iron retention in mynahs, doves and rats  ap. 479-486.  a2019-12-04  aIron retention was studied in rats (Rattus norvegicus), doves (Streptopelia d. decaocto) and two species of mynahs (Acridotheres t. tristis and Gracula r. religiosa) fed two different pelleted diets (88.5 and 567.9 mg Fe/kg diet). The doves and rats served as species that are not susceptible to iron storage, whereas the mynahs are known to develop iron overload frequently. The retention was calculated after measuring the uptake and elimination of a single dose of radioactive iron (59Fe) using whole-body counting. It was hypothesized that the mynahs would retain more iron than the rats and doves, and that after dietary iron challenge the mynahs would downregulate iron retention less effectively. It is concluded that mynahs have much higher iron uptake and retention than doves, but a similar uptake to that in rats. The four studied species are able to downregulate iron retention, the doves being the most efficient. It is suggested that at least part of the susceptibility to iron overload in mynahs is related to a high iron absorption from the intestines regardless of body iron stores, which is comparable with the situation of hereditary haemochromatosis in man. 3ainterspecific variation 3abody weight 3ahemochromatosis 3airon absorption 3airon 3anutrient retention 3ahematology 3arats 0aspecies differences 0aacridotheres tristis 0astreptopelia decaocto 0agracula religiosa1 aDorrestein, G.M.1 aMarx, J.J.M.1 aLemmens, A.G.1 aBeynen, A.C.0 tAvian pathology.g2001 Oct., v. 30, no. 5 p.479-486x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501200786713Available from publisher's Web site  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle01132naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245001100133300003400144300004800178500002300226520038800249650001100637650001200648653000900660653001900669773009100688852000900779939003300788945000800821946001300829655001200842991615352370742620221121033827.0890209e198901  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890002382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDziezak, J.D.10aSpices  ap. 102-116 (not consecutive).  ap. 102-116 (not consecutive). ill., charts.  aLiterature review.  aThis article defines spices, herbs and seasonings and summarizes the history of spices.

A few unrelated meat turkey flocks, from the same integrator, experienced increased condemnation due to neoplasia in a few organs. Lymphoma was characterized by a uniform population of large lymphocytes with large vesicular nuclei containing one or two nucleoli and with little, faintly staining, basophilic cytoplasm. Neoplastic cells replaced normal tissue and were consistent with lesions seen with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) infection. Immunoperoxidase and fluorescent antibody staining characterized the neoplastic cells as CD3+, CD4+ and CD8- lymphocytes. Infection with REV was confirmed by virus isolation, polymerase chain reaction, serology and indirect fluorescent antibody. Poults hatched from these breeders tested positive for REV antibodies at hatch, but the performance of these flocks was normal and lymphoma was not observed. The origin of REV infection in this outbreak could not be determined. This is the first documented report of T-cell lymphomas associated with REV in commercial flocks. Furthermore, this is the first time that lymphomas have been characterized as T helper cells (CD3+ CD4+ and CD8-) in an outbreak of REV in turkeys. 3aturkeys 3alymphoma 3aflocks 3aepidemiology 3amortality 3aegg production 3aT-lymphocytes 2aAnimals 2aCell Nucleusxpathologyxultrastructure. 2aConjunctivaxpathology 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aLiverxpathology 2aLymphoma, T-Cellxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMeat 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aReticuloendotheliosis Viruses, Avianxisolation & purification 2aReticuloendotheliosis, Avianxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aTurkeys 0aCaliforniaxepidemiology. 0alesions 0aoutbreaks 0aavian reticuloendotheliosis1 aWoolcock, P.R.1 aFadly, A.M.1 aHall, C.1 aShivaprasad, H.L.0 tAvian pathology.g2002 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.355-361x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794502201416243Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02160naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245005000167300001600217520127200233653002401505653002201529653002001551653003401571653002401605700001801629773011801647852000901765856008501774946001101859655001201870IND4445176720221120234038.0101113e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444517672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00422-010-0407-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, George P. 10aTimings and interactions of skilled musicians  ap. 401-414.  aWe report here a preliminary study of interactive behavior between two members of a skilled string quartet performing a selected musical passage that required both performers to play several hundred notes in rapid succession at a steady tempo and in synchrony. Bowing movements were recorded using angular velocity sensors attached to their right forearms. The results show a high degree of temporal precision in both players. In addition, both players exhibited embedded rhythmic components in their timekeeping pattern, which arose from the grouping of notes in the musical score: four 16th notes to a beat. Within each group of four notes, we found a consistent timing microstructure: alternate upbows and alternate downbows had different mean durations. Both players' bowings could be modeled as alternating renewal processes. In addition, we report evidence of interactive coupling between the players as an essential component of their joint performance. The alternating renewal model enables us to propose a note-generation process that has implications for the central generators underlying the observed behavior and their hierarchical organization. We discuss the implications of this model for the organization and execution of more complex motor sequences. 0aMusical performance 0aTiming statistics 0aSynchronization 0aAlternating renewal processes 0aCoupled oscillators1 aChen, Jessie 0 tBiological cybernetics.g2010 Nov., v. 103, no. 5 p.401-414dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-12007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00422-010-0407-53Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02855naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245019100169300001600360520142900376650001301805650002501818650001601843650001201859650001401871650002201885650001001907650001001917650001201927650002101939650001401960650001101974650001501985650001802000650001602018653001702034653002002051653002202071700002102093700001702114773011602131852000902247856008502256930003302341946001102374655001202385IND4446081320221120234017.0101203e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444608132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-010-0274-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNekoduka, Syuuichi 10aPathogenicity of Mycochaetophora gentianae, causal fungus of gentian brown leaf spot, as affected by host species, inoculum density, temperature, leaf wetness duration, and leaf position  ap. 370-376.  aWhen the influence of host species, inoculum density, temperature, leaf wetness duration, and leaf position on the incidence of gentian brown leaf spot caused by Mycochaetophora gentianae, was examined, the fungus severely infected all seven Gentiana triflora cultivars, but failed to infect two cultivars of G. scabra and an interspecific hybrid cultivar. Inoculum density correlated closely with disease incidence, and a minimum of 10² conidia/mL was enough to cause infection. In an analysis of variance, temperature and leaf wetness duration had a significant effect upon disease incidence, which increased with higher temperature (15-25°C) and longer duration of leaf wetness (36-72 h). No disease developed at temperatures lower than 10°C or when leaf wetness lasted <24 h. At 48-h leaf wetness, disease incidence was 0, 28, 77, and 85% at 10, 15, 20, and 25°C, respectively. Middle and lower leaves on the plant were more susceptible than upper leaves. In microscopic observations of inoculated leaves, >50% of conidia germinated at temperatures >15°C after 24-h leaf wetness. More appressoria formed at higher temperatures (15-25°C) with extended duration of leaf wetness (24-72 h). At 48-h leaf wetness, appressorium formation was 0, 8, 26, and 73% at 10, 15, 20, and 25°C, respectively. These results suggest that temperature and leaf wetness duration were important factors for infection of gentian leaves. 3aGentiana 3aanalysis of variance 3aappressoria 3aconidia 3acultivars 3adisease incidence 3afungi 3ahosts 3ahybrids 3ainoculum density 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3amicroscopy 3apathogenicity 3atemperature 0aAppressorium 0aGentiana scabra 0aGentiana triflora1 aTanaka, Kazuaki 1 aSano, Teruo 0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2010 Dec., v. 76, no. 6 p.370-376dJapan : Springer Japanx1345-26307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-010-0274-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01753naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245005800203300001800261506007600279520068200355506003701037650001901074650001401093650002201107773017201129852000901301856008301310930003301393946001301426655001201439IND4417345120221207122848.0090306e20090303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441734512DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08113081052doi7 aPMC26513072pmcid7 a191247782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, J.C.10aScaling and self-organized criticality in proteins II  ap. 3113-3118.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe complexity of proteins is substantially simplified by regarding them as archetypical examples of self-organized criticality (SOC). To test this idea and to elaborate it, this article applies the Moret-Zebende (MZ) SOC hydrophobicity scale to transport repeat proteins of the HEAT superfamily, importin β, and transportin, as well as the export protein Cse1p, and their ubiquitous cargo manager Ran. The difference between the MZ scale and conventional hydrophobicity scales reflects long-range conformational forces that are central to protein functionality. These compete with long-range Coulomb forces associated with cationic and anionic side chains in a revealing way.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahydrophobicity 3aimportins 3aprotein transport0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 3, v. 106, no. 9 p.3113-3118dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08113081053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02422naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245010100142300001400243520074600257650001301003650002201016650002201038650001901060650002301079650001001102650002501112650001201137650002401149650003801173650007201211650002001283650005001303650003101353650002101384650007101405650002801476650002101504650001801525650002401543650002601567653002801593653001901621700001501640700001701655700001601672700001301688700001601701700001501717773006901732852000901801939003301810946001301843655001201856IND9205508420221120222850.0920909e19920703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920550842DNAL7 a16210992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Z.M.10aHarpin, elicitor of the hypersensitive response produced by the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora  ap. 85-88.  aA proteinaceous elicitor of the plant defense reaction known as the hypersensitive response was isolated from Erwinia amylovora, the bacterium that causes fire blight of pear, apple, and other rosaceous plants. The elicitor, named harpin, is an acidic, heat-stable, cell-envelope-associated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 44 kilodaltons. Harpin caused tobacco leaf lamina to collapse and caused an increase in the pH of bathing solutions of suspension-cultured tobacco cells. The gene encoding harpin (hrpN) was located in the 40-kilobase hrp gene cluster of E. amylovora, sequenced, and mutated with Tn5tac1. The hrpN mutants were not pathogenic to pear, did not elicit the hypersensitive response, and did not produce harpin. 3aproteins 3aErwinia amylovora 3aNicotiana tabacum 3acultured cells 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3aamino acid sequences 3amutants 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteins 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCells, Cultured 2aErwiniaxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aTobaccoxmicrobiology 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m929941 aLaby, R.J.1 aZumoff, C.H.1 aBauer, D.W.1 aHe, S.Y.1 aCollmer, A.1 aBeer, S.V.0 tScience.g1992 July 3, v. 257, no. 5066 p.85-88x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02706naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245008600198300001800284506007600302520137300378506003701751650000801788650001501796650001501811650001401826650001101840650001601851650001501867650001901882650001701901700001701918700001601935700002301951773017201974852000902146856008302155930003302238946001302271655001202284IND4417346120221207134032.0090306e20090303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441734612DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08109871062doi7 aPMC26424732pmcid7 a192210312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakob, B.10aLive cell microscopy analysis of radiation-induced DNA double-strand break motion  ap. 3172-3177.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe studied the spatiotemporal organization of DNA damage processing by live cell microscopy analysis in human cells. In unirradiated U2OS osteosarcoma and HeLa cancer cells, a fast confined and Brownian-like motion of DNA repair protein foci was observed, which was not altered by radiation. By analyzing the motional activity of GFP-53BP1 foci in live cells up to 12-h after irradiation, we detected an additional slower mobility of damaged chromatin sites showing a mean square displacement of [almost equal to]0.6 μm²/h after exposure to densely- or sparsely-ionizing radiation, most likely driven by normal diffusion of chromatin. Only occasionally, larger translational motion connected to morphological changes of the whole nucleus could be observed. In addition, there was no general tendency to form repair clusters in the irradiated cells. We conclude that long-range displacements of damaged chromatin domains do not generally occur during DNA double-strand break repair after introduction of multiple damaged sites by charged particles. The occasional and in part transient appearance of cluster formation of radiation-induced foci may represent a higher mobility of chromatin along the ion trajectory. These observations support the hypothesis that spatial proximity of DNA breaks is required for the formation of radiation-induced chromosomal exchanges.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3achromatin 3ahumans 3airradiation 3amicroscopy 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteosarcoma1 aSplinter, J.1 aDurante, M.1 aTaucher-Scholz, G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 3, v. 106, no. 9 p.3172-3177dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08109871063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02973naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245013100178300001600309520128100325650001301606650001401619650001701633650001001650650002501660650001301685650002501698650002201723650001201745650004801757650005301805650001301858650004401871650003101915650005601946650002402002650003702026651001002063653002002073653002802093653001202121700001502133700001602148700001502164700001602179773007302195852000902268856008502277930003302362945001302395946001102408655001202419IND2329689620221120213022.0021113e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232968962DNAL7 a123963652pmid7 a10.1080/030794501201187022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwata, N.10aAvian retrovirus infection causes naturally occurring glioma: isolation and transmission of a virus from so-called fowl glioma  ap. 193-199.  aSo-called fowl glioma is characterized by multiple nodular gliomatous growths associated with disseminated non-suppurative encephalitis. To investigate the possibility of the induction of the gliomatous lesions, chicks of Japanese bantams (Gallus gallus domesticus) and specific pathogen free chickens (C/O strain White Leghorn) were intracerebrally inoculated with a brain homogenate or culture supernatant from a bantam affected with fowl glioma. All bantams and 16 chickens (89%) in the inoculated groups showed non-suppurative encephalitis, and the 18 bantams (82%) and five chickens (28%) developed multiple nodules consisting of aggregations of astrocytes in the cerebrum. These astrocytes had avian leukosis virus (ALV) antigen. By Southern blot analysis, the ALV sequence was detected both in DNA prepared from the brains of the inoculated birds and in DNA from the inoculum. Ultrastructurally, tadpole-shaped particles, approximately 100 nm in diameter, were detected in the concentrated supernatant of the chicken embryo fibroblasts, and budding of the particles was noted. These results substantiated that fowl glioma of the bantams could be transmitted by intracerebral inoculation of the affected tissue and that the causal agent was an unidentified strain of ALV 3achickens 3aneoplasms 3aencephalitis 3abrain 3adisease transmission 3aantigens 3anucleotide sequences 3aculture filtrates 2aAnimals 2aBrainxpathologyxultrastructurexvirology. 2aBrain Neoplasmsxetiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aChickens 2aGliomaxetiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aPoultry Diseasesxvirology 2aRetroviridae Infectionsxcomplicationsxveterinary. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 0aJapan 0aavian oncovirus 0aexperimental infections 0alesions1 aOchiai, K.1 aHayashi, K.1 aOhashi, K.1 aUmemura, T.0 tAvian pathology.g2002 Apr., v. 31, no. 2 p.193-199x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794501201187023Available from publisher's Web site  a20030101b20030107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03068naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013200166300001400298500001500312520129300327650002901620650002201649650001201671650002101683650001801704650001601722650002601738650001201764650002601776650001901802650002401821650002101845650001701866650001101883650001801894650001001912650002201922650002201944650002301966651001001989653001101999653001802010653002702028653002902055700002202084700002402106700002402130700002202154700002202176700002302198773010702221852000902328856008502337930003302422946001102455655001202466IND4414817820221120191924.0090109e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441481782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-008-9732-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarletti, Paolo 10aSoil humic compounds and microbial communities in six spruce forests as function of parent material, slope aspect and stand age  ap. 47-65.  a2019-12-04  aThe influences on soil chemical and microbial properties of parent material, north south aspect and time measured as stand age were investigated in six spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests located in the alpine range of Northern Italy. Soil samples from A horizons were analysed for humic substances and in parallel Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) community profiles and microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content were determined. Chemical data were analyzed by canonical discriminant analysis while the ARDRA fingerprints were ordered in clusters using image analysis software. The geologic parent material was the most determining factor and the aspect-dependent microclimate features also played a distinct role in defining both soil chemistry and microbial community composition; in contrast the composition of the deeper humus layers (OH, A) was stable and similar within a spruce forest cycle time. Most important variables in the construction of the discriminating models resulted soil pH, Dissolved Organic Carbon content and Dissolved Organic Matter phenolic compounds. Bacterial communities appeared to be shaped first and foremost by the substratum, secondly by mountain slope orientation, and thirdly by forest stage, thus confirming the CDA model. 3adissolved organic carbon 3acomputer software 3aforests 3anitrogen content 3aribosomal DNA 3aPicea abies 3abacterial communities 3asoil pH 3adiscriminant analysis 3aimage analysis 3acommunity structure 3ahumic substances 3amicroclimate 3amodels 3asoil sampling 3ahumus 3atopographic slope 3amicrobial biomass 3aphenolic compounds 3aItaly 0acarbon 0aDOM phenolics 0aPicea abies (L.)

In the bushcricket Ephippiger ephippiger, male song shows large geographical variation in syllable number, and females strongly prefer song typical of their own population. Here it is shown that there is also large variation in syllable number within a population of E. ephippiger. Two factors associated with this variability were identified: eclosion sequence (which was positively correlated with mean male syllable number) and male-male interactions (with chorusing males producing more variable song than those singing in isolation). Similar variability was not evident in female preference as females did not show significant heterogeneity when offered a choice of recorded songs representing the main syllable types from the population, nor did overall preference vary amongst the main song types. A variety of factors, including genetic variability, developmental plasticity, male interactions and weak female preferences, could be responsible for this phenotypic variability. 3aTettigoniidae 3amales 3afemales 0amating preferences 0avariation 0asongs0 tAnimal behaviour.g1992 May, v. 43, no. pt.5 p.845-855x0003-34727nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02618naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100001900199245007600218300001400294500002400308520085100332650002701183650001101210650002101221650001001242650001501252650002801267650001801295650001301313650002401326650001501350650002801365650002801393650002601421650002901447650001301476650002701489650003101516650002301547650001101570653002001581653002501601653002601626700001501652700001601667700001301683700001701696773012001713852000901833856009301842930003301935945002501968946001101993655001202004IND4416570920221120165300.0090220e20090315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657092DNAL7 a191934682pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2008.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aX100 0aQ2051 aPuértolas, E.10aPulsed electric fields inactivation of wine spoilage yeast and bacteria  ap. 49-55.  aIncludes references  aThe use of the pulsed electric fields technology (PEF) as an alternative system of microbiological control in wineries was evaluated.

In 1990, FDA issued the first regulation for the use of a recombinant DNA-produced food ingredient, fermentation-derived chymosin (rennet). In 1992, FDA published a policy statement that explains how foods and animal feeds derived from new plant varieties developed by both conventional and new breeding techniques are regulated under the Act. The 1992 policy provides "guidance to industry" that establishes a standard of care for ensuring safety and wholesomeness. This discussion summarizes FDA's policy and illustrates how the policy was applied by the agency in reaching decisions on chymosin and on the Flavr Savr tomato. 3aUnited States0 tGenetically modified foods : safety issues.dWashington, DC : American Chemical Society, 1995.7nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02793naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002400168245008700192300001600279500002400295520144700319650002201766650001401788650001301802650002501815650002901840650003801869650002301907650001801930650001801948650002101966650002801987700002102015700002502036700002502061773009302086852000902179856009002188930003302278945002502311946001102336655001202347IND4416575020221120161549.0090220e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ5001 aMourtzinos, Ioannis10aThermal oxidation of vanillin affects its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties  ap. 791-797.  aIncludes references  aAccelerated oxidation of vanillin was studied by isothermal and non-isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in model solutions. Exothermic peaks of DSC thermograms, due to the oxidation of vanillin, were observed. Vanillin oxidation to vanillic acid was confirmed by the detection of vanillic acid in heated vanillin samples using GC-MS. The effect of temperature on vanillin oxidation was studied by conducting DSC experiments with pure vanillin at several different final temperatures and by subsequent determination of vanillin and vanillic acid by GC-MS. Furthermore, the DPPH free radical assay was done on DSC-treated samples as well as on mixtures of vanillin-vanillic acid. The radical-scavenging activity of the samples was increased along with the vanillic acid content. Additionally, the antimicrobial activities and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of solutions containing vanillin and vanillic acid against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica were determined by the agar well-diffusion method. All tested samples exhibited inhibitory activity against all of the bacteria. Yet, the higher the vanillic acid concentration, the lower was the MIC of the samples. It is concluded that the thermal treatment of vanillin-containing food may lead to products with improved antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. 3athermal stability 3aoxidation 3avanillin 3aantioxidant activity 3aantimicrobial properties 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amodel food systems 3avanillic acid 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3afree radical scavengers1 aKonteles, Spyros1 aKalogeropoulos, Nick1 aKarathanos, Vaios T.0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 1, v. 114, no. 3 p.791-797dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02572naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245011600202300001800318506007600336520122700412506003701639650001201676650002201688650001101710650001701721650002201738650001301760650001701773650001301790650000901803700001601812700002401828773017201852852000902024856008302033930003302116946001302149655001202162IND4417343420221207134118.0090306e20090303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441734342DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08093161062doi7 aPMC26512512pmcid7 a192184432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Marcus10aQuantitative modeling of the role of surface traps in CdSe/CdS/ZnS nanocrystal photoluminescence decay dynamics  ap. 3011-3016.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCharge carrier trapping is an important phenomenon in nanocrystal (NC) decay dynamics because it reduces photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiencies and obscures efforts to understand the interaction of NC excitons with their surroundings. Particularly crucial to our understanding of excitation dynamics in, e.g., multiNC assemblies, would be a way of differentiating between processes involving trap states and those that do not. Direct optical measurement of NC trap state processes is not usually possible because they have negligible transition dipole moments; however, they are known to indirectly affect exciton photoluminescence. Here, we develop a framework, based on Marcus electron transfer theory, to determine NC trap state dynamics from time-resolved NC exciton PL measurements. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of PL to interfacial dynamics, indicating that the technique can be used as an indirect but effective probe of trap distribution changes. We anticipate that this study represents a step toward understanding how excitons in nanocrystals interact with their surroundings: a quality that must be optimized for their efficient application in photovoltaics, photodetectors, or chemical sensors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acadmium 3aelectron transfer 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3aphotoluminescence 3aselenium 3asolar energy 3asulfides 3azinc1 aLo, Shun S.1 aScholes, Gregory D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 3, v. 106, no. 9 p.3011-3016dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08093161063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02865naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001200128245009500140300001600235520146700251650001901718650001701737650001601754650002301770650001401793650001201807650001701819650002501836650001601861650001801877650001901895650002101914650001101935650002101946650001101967650001101978650001601989650004502005650000902050650001402059650001502073650002102088650001602109650001202125651001002137651001002147700001702157773009602174852000902270939003302279946001102312655001202323IND9205087320221120151634.0920814e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920508732DNAL7 a15595232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, S.10aProlonged breast-feeding and malnutrition among rural Indian children below 3 years of age  ap. 187-195.  aLong periods of exclusive as well as partial breast-feeding in poor communities are of considerable importance from a nutritional standpoint, as it is in these communities that malnutrition is predominant. Although benefits of exclusive breast feeding have been well documented, those for partial breast-feeding have not been examined. The present study in particular examines the effects of prolonged breast-feeding, i.e. exclusive breast-feeding beyond 6 months or partial breast-feeding up to 2-3 years, in terms of prevalent malnutrition and morbidity among rural children. A total of 395 children were observed for weight, height, information on duration of breast-feeding, age at weaning and morbidity in terms of recent illness in the 7 days prior to the day of visit. Exclusive breast-feeding beyond 6 months and up to 12 months appeared beneficial in terms of reduced morbidity. Beyond infancy, there was no evidence of any protective effect of partial breast-feeding. This could be due to poor lactational performance of mothers and their unawareness about it resulting in inadequate weaning foods being offered to partially breast-fed children. Significant differences in male and female children in the extent of malnutrition pointed towards discrimination against girls even in respect of exclusive breast-feeding. The study highlights the need for advocating proper weaning practices while recommending prolonged breast-feeding in poor communities. 3abreast feeding 3amalnutrition 3arural areas 3alactation duration 3amorbidity 3aweaning 3ainfant foods 3anutrition assessment 2aAge Factors 2aAnthropometry 2aBreast Feeding 2aChild, Preschool 2aFemale 2aHealth Education 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Food 2aInfant Nutrition Disordersxepidemiology 2aMale 2aMorbidity 2aPrevalence 2aRural Population 2aSex Factors 2aWeaning 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aKanade, A.N.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Mar., v. 46, no. 3 p.187-195x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01814naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006800124500019100192520088800383650002001271650002201291650001601313700002001329700001401349773010501363852000901468930003301477945001301510946001301523655001201536IND2055584820221120151603.0970224s1995    dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205558482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, J.10aImprovement of beer brewing by using genetically modified yeast  aDeveloped from symposium sponsored by the Division of Agricultural and Food Chemistry of the 208th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, August 21-25, 1994, Washington, D.C.  aDuring fermentation of beer, yeast cells produce ethanol as well as diacetyl, a substance with a low taste threshold of about 0.2 ppm. This unpleasant butter-like flavor can be removed by means of a separate maturation period of 2-6 weeks during which yeast cells degrade the diacetyl. Recombinant DNA techniques have made it possible to reduce the amount of alpha-acetolactate, the precursor molecule of diacetyl, in yeast. The alpha-acetolactatedecarboxylase (ALDC) gene from Acetobacter pasteurianus, which decarboxylates alpha-acetolactate directly into acetoin without forming diacetyl, was isolated and transferred into brewer's yeast. Test fermentation with recombinant yeast having ALDC activity showed no differences in fermentation properties. At the end of the fermentation process hardly any diacetyl was measurable; thus the subsequent maturation period was unnecessary. 3afood processing 3afood microbiology 3afield crops1 aWackerbauer, K.1 aStahl, U.0 tGenetically modified foods : safety issues.dWashington, DC : American Chemical Society, 1995.7nnas  aDNAL  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02669naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002100168245009200189300001600281500002400297520121400321650001101535650001701546650002001563650001501583650001801598650002101616650001501637650001501652650001401667650002501681651001001706653002701716653002301743653001501766653001501781700001601796700002101812700001601833700002301849700001801872773009301890852000901983856009001992930003302082945002502115946001102140655001202151IND4416574920221120151613.0090220e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aQ5051 aBosch-Fusté, J.10aViability of total phenol index value as quality marker of sparkling wines, “cavas”  ap. 782-790.  aIncludes references  aTo evaluate the viability of the A280 value for monitoring the development of cava sparkling wine during its ageing in contact with lees and its commercial shelf life, an accelerated test was applied to four types of sparkling wines obtained at industrial scale. All cava types were stored under oxygen and carbon dioxide conditions at 37°C for 13 weeks. During the accelerated test, a positive relationship between absorbance at 280nm (A280) and time was observed, while the main phenolic compounds decreased even under nonoxidative conditions. The increase in the phenol index value corresponded (p <0.01) to an increase in a colourless compound. Both increases occurred mainly under nonoxidative conditions. This compound is a tentatively identified polyhydroxylate structure with a λ max 284nm and an accurate mass of 178.0398, which corresponds to the molecular formula, C₆H₁₀O₆. The present study found that sugars are the origin of this compound and play an important role in A280 increase under reductive conditions. The value of A280 could be a simple marker for monitoring the quality of the evolution of sparkling wine during its ageing in contact with lees and its commercial shelf life. 3aphenol 3awine quality 3asparkling wines 3ashelf life 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aabsorbance 3awine aging 3aoxidation 3aqualitative analysis 3aSpain 0aCava (sparkling wines) 0aphenol index value 0aA280 value 0ayeast lees1 aSartini, E.1 aFlores-Rubio, C.1 aCaixach, J.1 aLópez-Tamames, E.1 aBuxaderas, S.0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 1, v. 114, no. 3 p.782-790dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03912naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010200193300001600295520218500311650001402496650001902510650001702529650001202546650001802558650004402576650001602620650002902636650003802665650000902703650002802712650000902740650002502749650005202774650003102826650004902857653002802906653002002934653002302954653002302977700001903000700001503019700001803034700002203052700002003074773013103094852000903225856009203234930003303326946001103359655001203370IND4425773920221120095210.0090911e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442577392DNAL7 a185226742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2605.2008.00895.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinnall, Wendy R.10aEffects of chronic celecoxib on testicular function in normal and lipopolysaccharide-treated rats  ap. 542-555.  aCelecoxib (Celebrex[trade mark sign]), an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2; prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; EC 1.14.99.1), is widely used in the treatment of chronic inflammation and pain. COX-2 is constitutively expressed in the testis, where it is responsible for prostaglandin production, so inhibition of this enzyme should have effects on testicular function. The effects of administering celecoxib (oral with feed, 0.15% w/w) for 5 weeks on normal testis function and the response to low dose (0.1 mg/kg body weight) or high dose (5.0 mg/kg) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were examined in adult male rats. Celecoxib caused a 60% reduction in testicular interstitial fluid (IF) prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) concentrations, accompanied by a compensatory increase in COX-2 mRNA expression. Celecoxib increased IF volume by 30%, but had no effect on testis weight, testis morphology or serum testosterone levels. In the celecoxib-fed rats, the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of LPS on testis weight, IF volume and serum testosterone levels were significantly diminished. However, celecoxib had no effect on COX-2 protein levels or LPS-induced expression of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α or inducible nitric-oxide synthase. A similar lack of inhibition of LPS-induced cytokine expression by another COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, was observed in vitro. These data indicate that celecoxib reduces intratesticular activity of COX-2 (as indicated by PGE₂ levels) and inhibits IF formation in the testis, but has no appreciable effect on steroidogenesis or spermatogenesis, at least in the short term. Celecoxib does not appear to alter the ability of the testis to mount an inflammatory response but opposes the deleterious effects of inflammation on IF formation and testosterone production. These results indicate significant roles for products of the COX-2 pathway in testicular vascular control and steroidogenesis, which may have implications for men with marginal fertility taking celecoxib for extended periods, but also highlight the potential of this drug to ameliorate testicular damage caused by systemic or local inflammation. 3acytokines 3aprostaglandins 3atestosterone 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCyclooxygenase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aDNA Primers 2aDinoprostonexmetabolism 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aPyrazolesxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSulfonamidesxpharmacology 2aTestisxdrug effectsxpathologyxphysiology. 0aanti-inflammatory drugs 0acyclooxygenases 0ainterstitial fluid 0alipopolysaccharide1 aMuir, Julie A.1 aLiew, Seng1 aHirst, Jon J.1 aMeachem, Sarah J.1 aHedger, Mark P.0 tInternational journal of andrology.g2009 Oct., v. 32, no. 5 p.542-555dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-62637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2605.2008.00895.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03071naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245020500141300001600346500001500362520142300377650001501800650001801815650002501833650001401858650002201872650002101894650002401915650001201939650004101951650002501992650004102017650003102058650001402089650000902103650002802112650007002140650003802210650003002248650004602278651001702324653001702341700001502358700001602373700001902389773009202408852000902500939003302509946001102542655001202553IND9205085720221120090032.0920812e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920508572DNAL7 a15864532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGade, G.10aPrimary structures of neuropeptides isolated from the corpora cardiaca of various cetonid beetle species determined by pulsed-liquid phase sequencing and tandem fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry  ap. 133-142.  a2019-12-04  aA peptide with the same retention time on gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was present in the corpora cardiaca of 5 scarabaeid beetles, subfamily Cetoniinae: the three fruit beetle species Pachnoda marginata, P. sinuata and P. aemulae and the two protea beetle species Trichostetha fascularis and T. albopicta. Crude corpora cardiaca material from P. sinuata had a small hypertrehalosaemic effect in American cockroaches and a very weak hyperlipaemic activity in migratory locusts. Injections into P. sinuata caused hypertrehalosaemia when a dose of 1.0 corpora cardiaca equivalents was injected. An identical neuropeptide was isolated, by RP-HPLC, and sequenced by pulsed-liquid phase sequencing employing Edman chemistry after enzymically deblocking the N-terminal 5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid residue, as well as by collision-induced decomposition tandem fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The peptide is a blocked octapeptide: Glu-Leu-Asn-Tyr-Ser-Pro-Asp-TrpNH2, previously designated Mem-CC[1]. The synthetic peptide is able to elicit haemolymph carbohydrates in P. sinuata upon injection of low doses. Activity studies using synthetic analogues of this peptide revealed that Tyr4 may be important for receptor recognition/binding. The peptide is synthesized in intrinsic cells of the corpus cardiacum as shown by in vitro incorporation of [3H]Trp and [14C]Tyr in Mem-CC. 3aColeoptera 3aneuropeptides 3aamino acid sequences 3abioassays 3aspectral analysis 3acorpora cardiaca 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aCarbohydratesxblood 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aGrasshoppersxdrug effects 2aHemolymph 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeuropeptidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aNeurosecretory Systemsxchemistry 2aPeriplanetaxdrug effects 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment 3aSouth Africa 0apurification1 aLopata, A.1 aKellner, R.1 aRinehart, K.L.0 tBiological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler.g1992 Mar., v. 373, no. 3 p.133-142x0177-35937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02477naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100002400159245011000183300001800293500002400311520128600335650001401621650001801635650002101653650002301674650001501697650000901712650000901721650001801730650004301748650003701791773009501828852000901923856009001932930003302022945002502055946001102080655001202091IND4416574420221120074319.0090220e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2001 aHerzallah, Saqer M.10aDetermination of aflatoxins in eggs, milk, meat and meat products using HPLC fluorescent and UV detectors  ap. 1141-1146.  aIncludes references  aRaw and pasteurised sheep's, cow's and goat's milk, eggs, and beef samples from different local markets in Jordan were collected during a period of 5months (January through May 2007) and examined for aflatoxins B1(AFB1), B2(AFB2), G1(AFG1), G2(AFG2), M1(AFM1) and M2(AFM2).

Pharmacological depletion of calcium stores leads to the formation of clusters containing STIM and Orai that appear to be sites for calcium influx. Similar puncta are also produced in response to physiological stimuli in immune cells. In T cells engaged with antigen-presenting cells, clusters containing STIM and Orai accumulate at the immunological synapse. We recently discovered that in activated T cells, STIM1 and Orai1 also accumulate in cap-like structures opposite the immune synapse at the distal pole of the cell. Both caps and puncta are long-lived stable structures containing STIM1 and Orai1 in close proximity. The function of puncta as sites of calcium influx is clear. We speculate that the caps may provide a secondary site of calcium entry. Alternatively, they may serve as a source of preformed channel complexes that move to new immune synapses as T cells repeatedly engage antigen-presenting cells. 3aimage analysis 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium Channelsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aMembrane Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aSignal Transduction 2aT-Lymphocytesxchemistryxcytologyximmunologyxmetabolism. 0aSTIM 0aOrai 0aT-cell activation 0astore-operated calcium entry1 aBernot, Kelsie M.1 aShaffer, Meredith H.1 aBurkhardt, Janis K.1 aSamelson, Lawrence E.0 tImmunological reviews.g2009 Sept., v. 231, no. 1 p.148-159dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2009.00812.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02505naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001500159245014600174300001800320500002400338500001500362520076800377650000901145650002901154650002101183650002101204650001001225650001801235650002301253650002301276650002001299650001701319650001901336650002501355650002601380650001201406650002201418650002601440653006901466653001801535653001301553700001701566700001601583700001501599700001701614700001601631700001701647773009501664852000901759856009001768930003301858945002501891946001101916655001201927IND4416574020221120074440.0090220e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2021 aShao, Bing10aMulti-residual analysis of 16 β-agonists in pig liver, kidney and muscle by ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 1115-1121.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA delicate method was developed for simultaneous analysis of 16 illegal residual β-agonists in pork tissues including liver, kidney and meat.

Whereas reinvading terrestrial taxa tracked melting glaciers, marine biota recolonized ocean habitats freed by retreating sea ice. The extent of sea ice in the Southern Hemisphere during the LGM has, however, yet to be fully resolved, with most palaeogeographic studies suggesting only minimal or patchy ice cover in subantarctic waters. Here, through population genetic analyses of the widespread Southern Bull Kelp (Durvillaea antarctica), we present evidence for persistent ice scour affecting subantarctic islands during the LGM. Using mitochondrial and chloroplast genetic markers (COI; rbcL) to genetically characterize some 300 kelp samples from 45 Southern Ocean localities, we reveal a remarkable pattern of recent recolonization in the subantarctic. Specifically, in contrast to the marked phylogeographic structure observed across coastal New Zealand and Chile (10- to 100-km scales), subantarctic samples show striking genetic homogeneity over vast distances (10,000-km scales), with a single widespread haplotype observed for each marker. From these results, we suggest that sea ice expanded further and ice scour during the LGM impacted shallow-water subantarctic marine ecosystems more extensively than previously suggested.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDurvillaea 3achloroplasts 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3aglaciers 3ahabitats 3ahaplotypes 3aice 3aislands 3amacroalgae 3amarine ecosystems 3amelting 3aphylogeography 3atemperature 3aChile 3aNew Zealand1 aNikula, Raisa1 aSpencer, Hamish G.1 aWaters, Jonathan M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 3, v. 106, no. 9 p.3249-3253dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08106351063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03480naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001400191245008400205300001600289500002400305500001500329520129500344650002501639650001501664650001301679650002301692650002301715650002101738650001901759650000901778650001701787650002101804650001501825650002101840650001001861650004301871650001901914650001201933650003301945650001401978650003201992650001502024650003702039650002402076650003402100650000902134650001802143650002302161650002302184650004102207650001902248650001002267650001702277651001302294651001302307653002002320653002102340653001902361653002002380700001902400700001602419773010002435852000902535856008502544930003302629945002502662946001102687655001202698IND4416579820221120032247.0090220e20090225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657982DNAL7 a191469332pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2008.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX380 0aL8101 aDemma, J.10aPotential genotoxicity of plant extracts used in Ethiopian traditional medicine  ap. 136-142.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAim of the study: Although traditional herbal medicines are widely used in Ethiopia, no information is available on their potential genotoxicity. In the present study, hydroalcoholic extracts of Glinus lotoides, Plumbago zeylanica, Rumex steudelii and Thymus schimperi were evaluated for their DNA damaging effects using the comet assay. Material and methods: Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were exposed to different concentrations of the extracts for 3h with and without metabolic activation (S9-mix) using 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and benzo(a)pyrene as positive controls, and vehicles as negative controls. Results: In the absence of S9, all extracts were found to induce significant DNA damage without affecting the cell viability. T. schimperi and R. steudelii were the most potent DNA-damaging extracts, and G. lotoides and P. zeylanica the least potent. The addition of S9 had different effects on the DNA damage induced by the extracts: it lowered the DNA damaging effect of P. zeylanica, did not affect the DNA damaging effect of T. schimperi, and increased the DNA damaging effects of R. steudelii and G. lotoides. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest that all extracts evaluated have a genotoxic potential in vitro which needs to be substantiated by further studies. 3atraditional medicine 3aDNA damage 3alymphoma 3aThymus (Lamiaceae) 3aPlumbago zeylanica 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3amice 3agenotoxicity 3atoxicity testing 3acell lines 3aherbal medicines 3aRumex 2a4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxidexpharmacology 2aMagnoliopsida. 2aAnimals 2aBenzo(a)pyrenexpharmacology 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDNA Damage 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aLymphomaxpathology 2aMedicine, African Traditional 2aMice 2aMolluginaceae 2aMutagenicity Tests 2aMutagensxtoxicity 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aPlumbaginaceae 2aRumex 2aThymus Plant 3aEthiopia 0aEthiopia 0aGlinus lotoides 0aThymus schimperi 0aCaryophyllales 0aRumex steudelii1 aEngidawork, E.1 aHellman, B.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2009 Feb. 25, v. 122, no. 1 p.136-142dElsevierx0378-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2008.12.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/05/06  aNon-US 7aarticle04917naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100003200204245023800236300001600474500002400490520266500514650002303179650001703202650001003219650001303229650002203242650002403264650001903288650001703307650002903324650001003353650005203363650002603415650001803441650001203459650001203471650002903483650004103512650003803553650003003591650004503621650003403666650002403700650003403724650003103758650003103789650005203820650004103872700001803913700003103931700001803962773009603980852000904076856008904085930003304174945002504207946001104232655001204243IND4416568320140725000000.0090220e20090309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441656832DNAL7 a190703732pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL200 0aM001 0aM1201 aPrieto-Álamo, María-José10aSolea senegalensis genes responding to lipopolysaccharide and copper sulphate challenges: Large-scale identification by suppression subtractive hybridization and absolute quantification of transcriptional profiles by real-time RT-PCR  ap. 312-319.  aIncludes references  aSolea senegalensis is a commercially relevant aquaculture species that remains largely unexplored at the genomic level. The aim of this study was to identify novel genomic responses to lipopolysaccharide and copper sulphate challenges using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and real-time RT-PCR. Forward- and reverse-subtractive libraries were generated for the identification of genes whose transcription is altered in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (immunomodulator) in head kidney (immunologically important organ) and to CuSO₄ (common algacide) in liver (central metabolic organ and important source of immune transcripts). A total of 156 genes involved in major physiological functions were identified by SSH, the identified sequences representing a significant increase in the number of sole ESTs in public databases. Fifteen genes represented in the subtracted libraries were selected for further tissue, temporal and inducible transcriptional profiling by real-time RT-PCR. A rigorous quantification of transcript copy numbers was performed for this purpose in both pooled and individual samples from two independent experiments. More than half of the investigated mRNAs encode proteins that deal with different aspects of the immune response, like NCCRP1 (non-specific cytotoxic cell receptor), C3 and C7 (complement components), and ferritin M, HP and TF (iron homeostasis), or play a crucial role in its regulation, like TRAF3. Other mRNAs studied encode proteins involved in metabolism, like TKT and NDUFA4, the response to stimulus, like CEBPB (transcription factor) and CIRBP (RNA-binding protein), and other cell processes. Highly abundant (>500 molecules/pg total RNA) and rare (<=1 molecules/pg) mRNA species were quantified in each sole organ examined, and outstanding differences were also recorded in the comparison between the two organs, e.g. C3 and TF mRNAs were largely overexpressed in liver (>5000 molecules/pg) as compared to head kidney (<5 molecules/pg). Most investigated mRNAs displayed significant alterations in their steady-state copy number following LPS and/or CuSO₄ stimulation, i.e. they were (i) up-regulated in response to both treatments in at least one of the two organs (NCCRP1, CEBPB, SQSTM1, NDUFA4, C7 and HP), (ii) up-regulated (TF, CIRBP, TRFA, C3) or down-regulated (TKT) by LPS, their levels remaining essentially unchanged upon CuSO₄ challenge, or (iii) down-regulated by LPS, though up-regulated by CuSO₄ (ferritin M). Quantifications in individual fish were consistent with those in pooled samples with respect to both the direction and the absolute changes in transcript abundance. 3aSolea senegalensis 3afish culture 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenomic libraries 3alipopolysaccharides 3acopper sulfate 3agenotoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3aliver 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription factors 3ahybridization 3akidneys 2aAnimals 2aCopper Sulfatextoxicity 2aFish Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFlatfishesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aLipopolysaccharidesxtoxicity 2aLiverxdrug effects 2aLymphoid Tissuexdrug effects 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aReproducibility of Results 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aAbril, Nieves1 aOsuna-Jiménez, Inmaculada1 aPueyo, Carmen0 tAquatic toxicology.g2009 Mar. 9, v. 91, no. 4 p.312-319dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03765naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100002400194245018400218300001600402500002400418520213000442650001302572650001902585650002602604650000902630650001702639650002202656650001902678650002002697650002002717650001702737650002002754650002002774653001902794700002402813700002402837700002602861700002202887700002902909700002202938773009602960852000903056856008903065930003303154945002503187946001103212655001203223IND4416568420140725000000.0090220e20090309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441656842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL600 0aL200 0aM0011 aEstrella-Gómez, N.14aThe Pb-hyperaccumulator aquatic fern Salvinia minima Baker, responds to Pb²⁺ by increasing phytochelatins via changes in SmPCS expression and in phytochelatin synthase activity  ap. 320-328.  aIncludes references  aThe relationship between accumulation of Pb²⁺ and the activation of chelation and metal sequestration mechanisms mediated by phytochelatins (PC) was analyzed in the Pb²⁺ hyperaccumulator aquatic fern Salvinia minima, after exposure to 40μM Pb(NO₃)₂. The tissue accumulation pattern of lead and the phytochelatin biosynthesis responses were analyzed in both, S. minima submerged root-like modified fronds (here named “roots”), and in its aerial leaf-like fronds (“leaves”). S. minima roots accumulated a significantly higher concentrations of Pb⁺² than leaves did. Accumulation of Pb²⁺ in roots was bi-phasic with a first uptake phase reached after 3h exposure and a second higher uptake phase reached after 24h exposure. In leaves, a single delayed, smaller uptake phase was attained only after 9h of exposure. In roots lead accumulation correlated with an increased phytochelatin synthase (PCS) activity and an enhanced PC production. A higher proportion of polymerized PC₄ was observed in both tissues of exposed S. minima plants relative to unexposed ones, although a higher concentration of PC₄ was found in roots than in leaves. PCS activity and Pb²⁺ accumulation was also higher in roots than in leaves. The expression levels of the S. minima PCS gene (SmPCS), in response to Pb²⁺ treatment, were also evaluated. In S. minima leaves, the accumulation of Pb²⁺ correlated with a marked increase in expression of SmPCS, suggesting a transcriptional regulation in the PCS activation and PC accumulation in this S. minima tissue. However, in roots, the basal expression of SmPCS was down-regulated after Pb²⁺ treatment. This fact did not correlate with the later but strong increase in both, PCS activity and PC production; suggesting that the PC biosynthesis activation in S. minima roots occurs only by post-translational activation of PCS. Taken together, our data suggest that the accumulation of PC in S. minima is a direct response to Pb²⁺ accumulation, and phytochelatins do participate as one of the mechanism to cope with Pb²⁺ of this Pb-hyperaccumulator aquatic fern. 3aSalvinia 3aaquatic plants 3aferns and fern allies 3alead 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3aphytochelatins 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3abiosynthesis 3abioaccumulation 3awater pollution 0aSalvinia miima1 aMendoza-Cózatl, D.1 aMoreno-Sánchez, R.1 aGonzález-Mendoza, D.1 aZapata-Pérez, O.1 aMartínez-Hernández, A.1 aSantamaría, J.M.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2009 Mar. 9, v. 91, no. 4 p.320-328dElsevier Sciencex0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.11.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/03/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02682naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004600092040001800138072000900156072000900165100001500174245013600189300001600325500002400341520131700365650000901682650002901691650003101720650001101751650001901762650001801781650002501799650002001824650001401844650001701858650002201875650002701897650001101924700001701935773011001952852000902062856009602071930003302167945002502200946001102225655001202236IND4416567620221120023110.0090220e20090315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441656762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL2101 aKaneko, K.14aThe roles of PGF₂α and PGE₂ in regression of the corpus luteum after intrauterine infusion of Arcanobacterium pyogenes in cows  ap. 858-863.  aIncludes references  aTo study the effect of bacteria in the uterus on the fate of the corpus luteum (CL), Arcanobacterium pyogenes was inoculated into the uteri of cows on Day 3 (Day 0=day of spontaneous ovulation). Plasma concentrations of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF₂α (PGFM), 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGE₂ (PGEM) and progesterone (P₄) were determined. In five cows, the developing CL regressed and first-wave dominant follicles, which normally become atretic, ovulated (Group OV) after bacterial inoculation. In another five cows (Group NOV) and five control cows, the developing CL did not regress and first-wave dominant follicles did not ovulate. In Group OV, PGFM concentrations increased by 126.2pg/mL (from 36.8±7.8pg/mL on Day 3 to 163±37.2pg/mL on Day 6), with an increase ratio of 5.8-fold. Conversely, in Group NOV, PGFM had a greater increase of 198.4pg/mL (from 128.2±27.8pg/mL on Day 3 to 326.6±115.1pg/mL on Day 5), but the increase ratio was only 2.3-fold. Although PGEM tended to increase in both groups, raw increases and increase ratios were small. Bacterial inoculation into the uterus stimulated the release of prostaglandins and affected the fate of the CL; in that regard, the CL was affected more by PGF₂α than by PGE₂, and the increase ratio of PGF₂α was more important than the raw increase. 3acows 3aArcanobacterium pyogenes 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3auterus 3aprostaglandins 3acorpus luteum 3abacterial infections 3ablood chemistry 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3aovarian follicles 3afollicular development 3adosage1 aKawakami, S.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 Mar. 15, v. 71, no. 5 p.858-863dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.10.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03584naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129100001700138245015300155300001600308500002400324520216400348650001602512650001702528650002802545650001202573650002602585650000902611650002402620650001002644650002202654650004102676650005002717700001702767700001602784700001402800700001702814700001802831773012002849852000902969856007702978930003303055945002503088946001303113655001203126IND4367671720221117182506.0050315e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436767172DNAL7 a151127222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aHartmann, T.10aAcquired and partially de novo synthesized pyrrolizidine alkaloids in two polyphagous arctiids and the alkaloid profiles of their larval food-plants  ap. 229-254.  aIncludes references  aThe profiles of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in the two highly polyphagous arctiids Estigmene acrea and Grammia geneura and their potential PA sources in southeastern Arizona were compiled. One of four species of Boraginaceae, Plagiobothrys arizonicus, contained PAs; this is the first PA record for this plant species. The principle PA sources are Senecio longilobus (Asteraceae) and Crotalaria pumila (Fabaceae). The known PA pattern of S. longilobus was extended; the species was found to contain six closely related PAs of the senecionine type. Three novel PAs of the monocrotaline type, named pumilines A-C, were isolated and characterized from C. pumila, a species not studied before. The pumilines are the major PAs in the seeds, while in the vegetative organs they are accompanied by the simple necine derivatives supinidine and as the dominant compound subulacine (1beta,2beta-epoxytrachelanthamidine). In both plant species, the PAs are stored as N-oxides, except C. pumila seeds, which accumulate the free bases. Great variation in PA composition was observed between local populations of C. pumila. The PA profiles were established for larvae and adults of E. acrea that as larvae had fed on an artificial diet supplemented with crotalaria-powder and of G. geneura fed with S. longilobus. In both experiments, the larvae had a free choice between the respective PA source and diet or food plants free of PAs. The profiles compiled for the two species reflect the alkaloid profiles of their PA sources with one exception, subulacine could never be detected in E. acrea. Besides acquired PAs, insect PAs synthesized from acquired necine bases and necic acids of insect origin were detected in the two arctiid species. These insect PAs that do not occur in the larval food sources accounted for some 40-70% (E. acrea) and 17-37% (G. geneura) of total PAs extracted from the insects. A number of novel insect PAs were identified. Plant-acquired and insect PAs were found to accumulate as N-oxides. The results are discussed in relation to specific biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral mechanisms involved in PA sequestration by arctiids. 3ahost plants 3ainsect pests 3ametabolic sequestration 2aAnimals 2aAsteraceaexchemistry 2aDiet 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aLarva 2aMothsxphysiology 2aPlants, Ediblexgrowth & development 2aPyrrolizidine Alkaloidsxanalysisxchemistry.1 aTheuring, C.1 aBeuerle, T.1 aErnst, L.1 aSinger, M.S.1 aBernays, E.A.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2004 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.229-254dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3electronic resource  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/04/20  aOther US 7aarticle03877naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100001800218245014900236300001800385500001500403506007600418520169700494506003702191650001202228650000902240650001702249650001902266650001002285650002102295650002102316650002202337650002402359650002002383650001302403650000902416650001302425650002002438650002202458650002002480650002502500650001302525650002102538650002302559651001002582653001702592653002702609700001902636700001902655700002002674700001902694700001702713700001902730700001302749700002002762700002002782700001802802773017202820852000902992856008303001930003303084945002503117946001303142655001203155IND4417343920221207121554.0090306e20090303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441734392DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08134171062doi7 aPMC26442552pmcid7 a192235872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study examines grain yields and N loss pathways using a synthetic approach in 2 of the most intensive double-cropping systems in China: waterlogged rice/upland wheat in the Taihu region of east China versus irrigated wheat/rainfed maize on the North China Plain. When compared with knowledge-based optimum N fertilization with 30-60% N savings, we found that current agricultural N practices with 550-600 kg of N per hectare fertilizer annually do not significantly increase crop yields but do lead to about 2 times larger N losses to the environment. The higher N loss rates and lower N retention rates indicate little utilization of residual N by the succeeding crop in rice/wheat systems in comparison with wheat/maize systems. Periodic waterlogging of upland systems caused large N losses by denitrification in the Taihu region. Calcareous soils and concentrated summer rainfall resulted in ammonia volatilization (19% for wheat and 24% for maize) and nitrate leaching being the main N loss pathways in wheat/maize systems. More than 2-fold increases in atmospheric deposition and irrigation water N reflect heavy air and water pollution and these have become important N sources to agricultural ecosystems. A better N balance can be achieved without sacrificing crop yields but significantly reducing environmental risk by adopting optimum N fertilization techniques, controlling the primary N loss pathways, and improving the performance of the agricultural Extension Service.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aammonia 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3avolatilization 3awheat 3anitrate nitrogen 3alosses from soil 3aTriticum aestivum 3anutrient management 3acrop production 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aleaching 3adryland farming 3airrigated farming 3adenitrification 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3aintensive cropping 3aChina 0arice paddies 0afertilizer application1 aXing, Guang-Xi1 aChen, Xin-Ping1 aZhang, Shao-Lin1 aZhang, Li-Juan1 aLiu, Xue-Jun1 aCui, Zhen-Ling1 aYin, Bin1 aChristie, Peter1 aZhu, Zhao-Liang1 aZhang, Fu-Suo0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2009 Mar. 3, v. 106, no. 9 p.3041-3046dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08134171063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100105b20100205c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/04/03  aOther US 7aarticle02343naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100002300159245011100182300001800293500002400311520090500335650001401240650001201254650002401266650001801290650002201308650001801330650002301348650002501371650001101396650001501407650002801422700001901450700002601469700002101495700001601516700002401532700002001556700002201576773009501598852000901693856009001702930003301792945002501825946001101850655001201861IND4416572620221117160116.0090220e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aFerreres, Federico10aImproved loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) cultivars: Variation of phenolics and antioxidative potential  ap. 1019-1027.  aIncludes references  aLeaves and fruits (peel and flesh) of six improved cultivars ('Mizuho', 'Néctar de Cristal', 'Mizauto', 'Mizumo', 'Centenária' and 'NE-3') of loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.) were studied for their phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity. The analysis by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS allowed the identification of 18 compounds (8 hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and 10 flavonoid glycosides). The quantification of the identified compounds revealed distinct profiles amongst the three analysed materials. Loquat leaves exhibited the lowest amounts of phenolics. 3- And 5-caffeoylquinic, and 5-feruloylquinic acids were the major compounds. Generally, 'Mizauto' cultivar presented the highest phenolic content. All loquat materials exhibited DDPH scavenging capacity, in a concentration-dependent manner, the leaves being the most active one. This effect seems to be related to the flavonoid content. 3acultivars 3aloquats 3aEriobotrya japonica 3afood analysis 3afruit composition 3afruit quality 3aphenolic compounds 3aantioxidant activity 3aleaves 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers1 aGomes, Daniela1 aValentão, Patrícia.1 aGonçalves, Rui.1 aPio, Rafael1 aChagas, Edvan Alves1 aSeabra, Rosa M.1 aAndrade, Paula B.0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 1, v. 114, no. 3 p.1019-1027dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0653Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02388naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002000177245011100197300001800308500002400326520095700350650002701307650001801334650002201352650001201374650002101386650001701407650002401424650002001448650002001468650002601488650001301514650002301527650001501550650002001565700001301585700001501598700001801613773009501631852000901726856009001735930003301825945002501858946001101883655001201894IND4416572720221117160104.0090220e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.09.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ115 0aQ5051 aMeng, Xianghong10aChanges in physiology and quality of peach fruits treated by methyl jasmonate under low temperature stress  ap. 1028-1035.  aIncludes references  aThe quality and physiological changes were determined in peach (Prunus persica L. cv.

Peach fruits stored for 3 weeks at 5°C and following 3d shelf life intervals at 20°C appeared chilling injury (CI) symptom, expressed as flesh browning. MeJA treatment decreased the CI index, which was possibly attributed to higher activity of peroxidase and lower content of phenolic compounds than that without MeJA treatment. Moreover, MeJA treatment not only enhanced the rate of SSC/TA in peach fruits by mainly restraining the decrease of the SSC in peach, but also affected the degradation of cell wall, perhaps by regulation of cell wall modifying enzymes and the calcium content in cell wall of flesh. The results suggested that MeJA treatment was beneficial for maintaining quality owing to reducing chilling injury of peach fruits under low temperature stress. 3apostharvest physiology 3afood analysis 3afruit composition 3apeaches 3amethyl jasmonate 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage quality 3achilling injury 3apostharvest treatment 3afirmness 3aenzymatic browning 3aperoxidase 3aenzyme activity1 aHan, Jin1 aWang, Qing1 aTian, Shiping0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 1, v. 114, no. 3 p.1028-1035dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.09.1093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03318naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245018500126300001600311520221100327650002202538650001802560650001102578650001302589650001102602650001702613650002902630653001202659700001402671700001902685700001802704700002002722773014802742852000902890930003302899945001302932946001102945655001202956IND2048709720221123035154.0951113e19940927ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204870972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurconi, S.10aEnergy transfer and charge separation kinetics in Photosystem I. 2.

The dependence of the fluorescence kinetics and spectra on two parameters was investigated in detail: firstly, the solubilizing detergent used in the measurements was varied between Triton X-100, octylglucoside and SB12 (zwitterionic detergent). Secondly, the PS I particle size and type were varied, studying what is believed on the basis of literature data to be PS I-native and PS I core, respectively. All of these changes had pronounced effects on the kinetics. By global analysis procedures, we generally find four and in some cases five lifetime components in all data sets. Our results indicate that all PS I preparations studied, including the PS I-core complex lacking LHC I, are heterogeneous, displaying at least a bimodal distribution in antenna size. We attribute this size distribution to the action of Triton X-100 used in the isolation procedure. The fastest lifetime component in the range of 6-14 ps, depending on antenna size, appears as a rise term at wavelengths above 710 nm in all particles and is attributed to an energy transfer in the antenna system from the main pool of short wavelength absorbing pigments (F690) to pool(s) of long wavelength absorbing and fluorescing pigments (F720 and/or F735). The observation of such an antenna equilibration component at room temperature is crucial for the understanding of the excitation kinetics. Furthermore, for the sample that is believed to be "native" PS I. we found two lifetime components of 31-49 ps (depending on the detergent) and 130 ps. We attribute both of them to an overall charge separation, but originating from different particle types in the sample. We thus propose a fundamental antenna size heterogeneity. The shorter time most probably corresponds to intact PS I cores, whereas only the longer one originates from "native" PS I with antenna size of about 200 Chl. The data suggest that the excitation kinetics in all of these PS I particles is close to the trap-limit. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aphotosystem I 3aenergy 3akinetics 3amodels 3afluorescence 3alight harvesting complex 0acharges1 aWeber, N.1 aSchweitzer, G.1 aStrotmann, H.1 aHolzwarth, A.R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1994 Sept. 27, v. 1187, no. 3 p.324-334x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02079naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001500167245012000182300001400302500002400316520081900340650002001159650002001179650002101199650001901220650001901239650001901258650002701277650002601304650002501330650001801355650002201373773010701395852000901502856008901511930003301600945002501633946001101658655001201669IND4395929320221123035309.0071007e20070802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439592932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ405 0aQ5051 aKök, M.S.12aA comparative study on the compositions of crude and refined locust bean gum: In relation to rheological properties  ap. 68-76.  aIncludes references  aIn this study the composition of higher quality refined locust bean gum (rLBG) was compared with lower quality crude locust bean gum (cLBG) samples to understand the differences in functionality.

The values obtained for M/G ratio of cLBG and rLBG samples range from 3.1 to 3.9, respectively, however high levels of arabinose were found in cLBG. This indicates that other polysaccharides, which could contain galactose or mannose, are present in the less refined materials. This would question the accuracy of using M/G ratio of cruder seed gums as a tool for predicting galactomannan content and so gelling properties. cLBG also contained higher levels of protein, fat, and ash which could also have an effect on functionality. 3alocust bean gum 3aproduct quality 3afood composition 3agalactomannans 3afood additives 3agelling agents 3arheological properties 3afunctional properties 3achemical composition 3afood analysis 3achemical analysis0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2007 Aug. 2, v. 70, no. 1 p.68-76dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20071014b20071102c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/10/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03742naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100002300181245013400204300001800338500014400356500001500500506007600515520128100591506003701872650002501909650001901934650002501953650002201978650002302000650001002023650001602033650002302049650002402072650001202096650001802108650002302126650003002149650002502179650001702204650003102221650002802252650002902280650001402309650001802323650003902341650003602380650002402416650003302440650005102473650002302524653001102547653002802558653001002586653002502596653001402621700001602635700001302651700001302664700001302677700001402690773014102704852000902845856008302854930003302937945001302970946001302983655001202996IND2046367720221207134412.0950608e19950509dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204636772DNAL7 a77537802pmid7 aPMC419062pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.10.41752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinesh-Kumar, S.P.10aTransposon tagging of tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N: its possible role in the TMV-N-mediated signal transduction pathway  ap. 4175-4180.  aPaper presented at a colloquium "Self-Defense by Plants: Induction and Signalling Pathways" held September 15-17, 1994, Irvine, California.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlants can recognize and resist invading pathogens by signaling the induction of rapid defense responses. Often these responses are mediated by single dominant resistance genes (R genes). The products of R genes have been postulated to recognize the pathogen and trigger rapid host defense responses. Here we describe isolation of the classical resistance gene N of tobacco that mediates resistance to the well-characterized pathogen tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The N gene was isolated by transposon tagging using the maize Activator (Ac) transposon. We confirmed isolation of the N gene by complementation of the TMV-sensitive phenotype with a genomic DNA fragment. Sequence analysis of the N gene shows that it encodes a protein with an amino-terminal domain similar to that of the cytoplasmic domains of the Drosophila Toll protein and the interleukin 1 receptor in mammals, a putative nucleotide-binding site and 14 imperfect leucine-rich repeats. The presence of these functional domains in the predicted N gene product is consistent with the hypothesis that the N resistance gene functions in a signal transduction pathway. Similarities of N to Toll and the interleukin 1 receptor suggest a similar signaling mechanism leading to rapid gene induction and TMV resistance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aplant proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3aexons 3atransposons 3adefense mechanisms 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aPhenotype 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSignal Transduction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxvirology. 2aTobacco Mosaic Virusxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aZea maysxgenetics 0an gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0aisolation1 aWhitham, S.1 aChoi, D.1 aHehl, R.1 aCorr, C.1 aBaker, B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 May 9, v. 92, no. 10 p.4175-4180x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.10.41753Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03827naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245018300144300001600327520210700343650002802450650001402478650001502492650001102507650001702518650001402535650001802549650001502567650001802582650002102600650002102621650001702642650000802659650002702667650002502694650002602719650001102745650001802756650002902774650005602803650000902859650002402868650003102892650002202923650002402945700001702969700001602986700001803002700001703020773014603037852000903183930003303192945001303225946001103238655001203249IND2048733720221123030508.0951114e19950209ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204873372DNAL7 a78579652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCroft, K.D.10aOxidation of low-density lipoproteins: effect of antioxidant content, fatty acid composition and intrinsic phospholipase activity on susceptibility to metal ion-induced oxidation  ap. 250-256.  aThe oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may play an important role in atherogenesis. Our understanding of the mechanism of LDL oxidation and the factors that determine its susceptibility to oxidation is still incomplete. We have isolated LDL from 45 healthy individuals and studied the relationship between LDL fatty acid, vitamin E and beta-carotene composition, intrinsic phospholipase A2-like activity and parameters of LDL oxidation. LDL was exposed to a copper ion-dependent oxidising system and the kinetics of oxidation studied by monitoring formation of fatty acid conjugated dienes. The length of the lag phase of inhibited lipid peroxidation was measured as well as the rate of lipid peroxidation during the propagation phase. There was no significant correlation between LDL antioxidant vitamin or fatty acid composition and lag time to LDL oxidation. Oleic acid was negatively correlated with the rate of LDL oxidation (r = -0.41, P < 0.01) whilst linoleic acid was significantly correlated with the extent of LDL oxidation measured by the production of total dienes (r = 0.34, P < 0.05). Interestingly, LDL vitamin E content was positively correlated with both the rate (r = 0.28, P < 0.05) and extent of LDL oxidation (r = 0.43, P < 0.01). LDL isolated from this group of subjects showed significant intrinsic phospholipase-like activity. The phospholipase activity, whilst not correlated with lag time, was significantly correlated with both rate (r = 0.43, P < 0.01) and total diene production (r = 0.44, P < 0.01) of LDL oxidation. We conclude that antioxidant content, fatty acid composition and intrinsic phospholipase activity have little influence on the lag time of Cu-induced LDL oxidation. These components do however, significantly influence both the rate and extent of LDL oxidation, with increased vitamin E, linoleic acid content and phospholipase activity associated with faster and more extensive oxidation. The possible pro-oxidant effect of vitamin E has interesting implications for the postulated 'protective' effects of vitamin E on atherogenesis. 3alow density lipoprotein 3aoxidation 3ametal ions 3acopper 3aantioxidants 3avitamin E 3abeta-carotene 3aoleic acid 3alinoleic acid 3aarachidonic acid 3aphospholipase A2 3ablood plasma 3amen 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aCopperxpharmacology 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aHumans 2aLinoleic Acid 2aLinoleic Acidsxanalysis 2aLipoproteins, LDLxbloodxisolation & purification. 2aMale 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhospholipases Axanalysis 2aPhospholipases A2 2aVitamin Exanalysis1 aWilliams, P.1 aDimmitt, S.1 aAbu-Amsha, R.1 aBeilin, L.J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1995 Feb. 9, v. 1254, no. 3 p.250-256x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19951204b19951207c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle01922naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001800158245009900176300001600275500002400291520067700315650001600992650001901008650002101027650002101048650002701069650002201096650002001118650002001138653002201158700001701180700001501197700002201212773011101234852000901345856008901354930003301443945002501476946001101501655001201512IND4395930020221123030536.0071007e20070920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439593002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aCardoso, M.B.10aInfluence of alkali concentration on the deproteinization and/or gelatinization of rice starch  ap. 160-165.  aIncludes references  aStarch was extracted from BR-IRGA110 rice flour using solutions of NaOH at concentrations varying between 0.06% and 0.30% (w/v).

Peroxide value showed the highest contribution (53.69%) to the PO, whereas its contribution to the SO was much less significant (0.36%). Acid value contribution to the production of hydroperoxides and carbonyls was 12.75% and 29.82%, respectively. Polyene index showed a relatively low contribution to the PO (6.71%) but contributed highly to the SO (21.82%). Tocopherols were more effective to prevent the production of hydroperoxides (14.77%) than of carbonyls (4.36%). In contrast, phenolics were found to be better than tocopherols to resist off-flavours production (11.64% vs. 3.36%). Total polar compounds had a pronounced contribution to creation of off-flavours (32.00%) as well as a marked effect on the PO (8.72%). 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aoxidation 3acanola oil 3alipid peroxidation 3aperoxide value 3aoff flavors 3afood quality 3afatty acid composition 3aoxidative stability 0aprimary oxidation 0asecondary oxidation1 aPazhouhanmehr, Samaneh0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 1, v. 114, no. 3 p.1002-1006dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0543Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02236naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245017100129300001500300520098700315650001101302650002101313650001101334650002101345650001901366650001401385650002001399650002601419653001501445653001101460700001601471700001701487700001901504700001701523700001801540700002501558700001801583773014701601852000901748930003301757945001301790946001101803655001201814IND2048947220221123015919.0951128e19940928ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204894722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallahan, D.L.10aCytochrome P-450-catalysed monoterpenoid oxidation in catmint (Napeta racemosa) and avocado (Persea americana): evidence for related enzymes with different activities  ap. 94-100.  aA cytochrome P-450 present in ripening avocado (Persea americana) fruit mesocarp (CYP71A1) had previously been shown to metabolize the monoterpenoids nerol and geraniol (Hallahan et al. (1992) Plant Physiol. 98, 1290-1297). Using DNA encoding CYP71A1 as a hybridization probe, we have shown by Southern analysis that a related gene is present in the catmint, Nepeta racemosa. RNA blot analysis, together with Western analysis of catmint leaf polypeptides using avocado cyt P-450 antiserum, showed that a closely related gene is expressed in catmint leaves. Cytochrome P-450 in catmint microsomes catalysed the specific hydroxylation of nerol and geraniol at C-10, whereas avocado CYP71A1, in either avocado microsomes or heterologously expressed in yeast, catalysed 2,3- or 6,7-epoxidation of these substrates. These results suggest that orthologous genes of the CYP71 family are expressed in these two plant species, but catalyse dissimilar reactions with monoterpenoid substrates. 3aNepeta 3aPersea americana 3aleaves 3acytochrome P-450 3amonoterpenoids 3aoxidation 3aenzyme activity 3asubstrate specificity 0asubstrates 0afruits1 aLau, S.M.C.1 aHarder, P.A.1 aSmiley, D.W.M.1 aDawson, G.W.1 aPickett, J.A.1 aChristoffersen, R.E.1 aO'Keefe, D.P.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1994 Sept. 28, v. 1201, no. 1 p.94-100x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02552naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245011600148300001400264500001500278520114600293650001201439650001701451650003701468650002201505650002601527650002601553650002601579650001901605650002401624650001401648650001501662650002401677650002201701650003501723650002001758650000901778653001701787653001501804700001901819700002201838773014401860852000902004930003302013945001302046946001102059655001202070IND2048988120221122235506.0951129e19950405ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204898812DNAL7 a77110552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamasarma, P.R.10aRole of disulfide linkages in structure and activity of proteinase inhibitor from horsegram (Dolichos biflorus)  ap. 35-42.  a2019-12-05  aProteinase inhibitor isolated from horsegram (Dolichos biflorus or Macrotyloma uniflorum) inhibited specifically the enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin. The inhibitor contained seven disulfide linkages and was free from thiol groups. The inhibitor is resistant to denaturation by urea, guanidine hydrochloride or sodium dodecyl sulfate. Reduction of the inhibitor with dithiothreitol abolished both trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities. The kinetic plots of the reduction as followed by activity and loss in structure as reflected in the 257 nm CD band could be superposed; loss in the activity paralleled the loss in structure. The kinetics of the reduction process was complex; reduction of the inhibitor was slow and depended on the concentration of DTT. Reduction of the disulfide linkages with DTT affected the tertiary structure significantly and secondary structure was not affected considerably. Fluorescence quenching by acrylamide and potassium iodide suggested the unfolding of the molecule due to reduction. Thus, disulfide linkages play a predominant role in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the inhibitor. 3atrypsin 3achymotrypsin 3astructure-activity relationships 3asulfhydryl groups 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aMacrotyloma uniflorum 2aDisulfidesxchemistry 2aDithiothreitol 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aGuanidine 2aGuanidines 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aProtease Inhibitorsxchemistry 2aProtein Folding 2aUrea 0apurification 0ainhibition1 aAppu Rao, A.G.1 aRajagopal Rao, D.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1995 Apr. 5, v. 1248, no. 1 p.35-42x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02887naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001500158245012500173300001400298500002400312500001500336520155100351650001401902650001201916650003001928650001301958650000901971650001401980650001301994650002102007650001302028653001402041653001702055653002302072653001802095700001502113700001702128773011702145852000902262856008902271930003302360945002502393946001102418655001202429IND4416571720221122235543.0090220e20090227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441657172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2008.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aMoon, H.S.10aBiogenic U(IV) oxidation by dissolved oxygen and nitrate in sediment after prolonged U(VI)/Fe(III)/SO₄ ²⁻ reduction  ap. 18-27.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSediment column experiments were performed to quantify the effect of biogenic iron sulfide precipitates on the stability of bioreduced uranium during and after a simulated bioremediation scenario. In particular, this study examined the effect of different oxidants (dissolved oxygen and nitrate) on biogenic U(IV) oxidation in sediment that experienced significant sulfate reduction in addition to Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction. The experimental set-up included five replicate columns (each 5 cm in diameter, 15 cm long and packed with background sediment from a site contaminated with uranium) that were bioreduced for 70 days by injecting a nutrient media containing 3 mM acetate and 6 mM sulfate prior to oxidation. Upon oxidation, iron sulfide precipitates formed during bioreduction acted as a buffer to partially prevent biogenic U(IV) oxidation. The iron sulfides were more effective at protecting biogenic U(IV) from oxidation when dissolved oxygen was the oxidant compared to nitrate. A constant supply of 0.25 mM and 1.6 mM nitrate over a 50 day period resulted in uranium resolubilization of 11% and 60%, respectively, while less than 1% of the uranium was resolubilized in the column supplied 0.27 mM dissolved oxygen during the same time period. Over time, oxidation increased pore water channeling, which was more pronounced during oxidation with nitrate. Increased channeling with time of oxidation could affect the transport of an oxidant through the previously reduced zone, and hence the oxidation dynamics of the reduced species. 3asediments 3auranium 3agroundwater contamination 3asulfates 3airon 3aoxidation 3asulfides 3adissolved oxygen 3anitrates 0areduction 0abioreduction 0abiogenic oxidation 0airon sulfides1 aKomlos, J.1 aJaffé, P.R.0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2009 Feb. 27, v. 105, no. 1-2 p.18-27dElsevier Science B.V.x0169-77227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2008.10.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090331b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02694naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003300131040001800164100001600182245009200198300001800290500014400308506007600452520122400528506003701752650001801789650001601807650001901823650002001842650002301862650002201885650001101907650002801918650002001946700001401966773014101980852000902121856008302130930003302213945001302246946001302259655001202272IND2046363620221207133656.0950608e19950509dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204636362DNAL7 a116075372pmid7 aPMC418962pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.10.41202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandra, S.10aRole of phosphorylation in elicitation of the oxidative burst in cultured soybean cells  ap. 4120-4123.  aPaper presented at a colloquium "Self-Defense by Plants: Induction and Signalling Pathways" held September 15-17, 1994, Irvine, California.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe oxidative burst is likely the most rapid defense response mounted by a plant under pathogen attack, and the generated oxidant species may be essential to several subsequent defense responses. In our effort to characterize the signal-transduction pathways leading to rapid H2O2/O2- biosynthesis, we have examined the role of protein phosphorylation in this resistance mechanism. K-252a and staurosporine, two protein-kinase inhibitors, were found to block the oxidative burst in a concentration-dependent manner. When added during H2O2 generation, the burst was observed to rapidly terminate, suggesting that continuous phosphorylation was essential for its maintenance. Importantly, phosphatase inhibitors (calyculin A and okadaic acid) were found to induce the oxidative burst in the absence of any additional stimulus. This may suggest that certain kinases required for the burst are constitutively active and that stabilization of the phosphorylated forms of their substrates is all that is required for burst activity. In autoradiographs of elicited and unstimulated cells equilibrated with 32PO4(3-), several phosphorylated polypeptide bands were revealed that could represent proteins essential for the burst.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afree radicals 3aGlycine max 3aplant proteins 3aphosphorylation 3adefense mechanisms 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aoxygen 3acell suspension culture 3aphosphoproteins1 aLow, P.S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 May 9, v. 92, no. 10 p.4120-4123x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.10.41203Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01965naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245015200125300001600277520094800293650000901241650001301250650001701263650001801280650001101298650001701309650001401326653001401340653002101354653002301375653001601398700001601414700001601430773010401446852000901550939003301559946001101592655001201603IND9205081820221122231212.0920812e199204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920508182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneko, M.10aQuenching of photoexcited 4,4-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridinebis(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) by oxygen in aqueous solution and in silk fibroin membrane  ap. 505-509.  aPhotoluminescence and quenching of 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridinebis(2,2'-bipyridine)-ruthenium(II) complex (Ru(DCbpy)(bpy)2(2+) in an aqueous solution as well as in a silk fibroin membrane were studied. Emission quenching by oxygen in an aqueous solution showed a linear relationship with respect to oxygen concentration. When the complex was incorporated into a silk fibroin membrane by adsorption from an aqueous solution into a preformed membrane, the photoexcited state of the complex was not quenched by oxygen in an aqueous phase. However, when the complex was incorporated into a silk fibroin membrane by casting a mixture of the complex and silk fibroin, the photoexcited complex was quenched by oxygen in an aqueous phase. In this case the Stern-Volmer plots showed a downward-deviating curve indicating heterogeneity of the probe site.

After 5 d, peroxidase activity was found in vesicles located in macrophages and immature plasma cells. On day 7, peroxidase-antiperoxidase complexes were found in vesicles of the epithelial cells lining the secondary ducts and the acini, in the lumina of the ducts, and on the surface of lymphocytes located among these epithelial cells. Dendritic cells showing peroxidase activity on their surface were seen in the subepithelial lymphoid tissue and in the lymphoid follicles. On day 9, peroxidase activity was found as iccosomes on the surface of dendritic cells and lymphoblasts. These results indicate that immature plasma cells in the Harderian gland can take up antigen and may have a role in presenting it to T cells. Further, our results suggest that intraepithelial lymphocytes might be involved in antigen transportation from the epithelium to the subepithelial lymphoid tissue. 3achickens 3alacrimal apparatus 3alymphocytes 3aantigens 3aimmunocytochemistry 0acell ultrastructure 0agland of harder1 aGallego, M.1 aBascuas, J.A.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g1992 , v. 16, no. 2/3 p.209-219x0145-305X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02983naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008500125300001600210500001500226520155900241650001301800650002701813650002301840650002401863650002301887650001801910650002101928650002501949650001501974650001101989650001702000650002002017650001802037653001502055653005202070653001202122653001002134653003602144700001402180700001502194700001602209700001702225700001602242700001402258700001602272700001402288773009602302852000902398939003302407946001302440655001202453IND9205080520221122231243.0920812e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920508052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenesi, S.10aPurine metabolism and B-lymphocyte development in the chicken bursa of fabricius  ap. 197-207.  a2019-12-04  aThe activity of three enzymes involved in the salvage pathway of purine nucleosides-purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT)-was investigated in cellular fractions of the chicken bursa of Fabricius differentially enriched in epithelial cells or lymphocytes. Markedly increasing levels of PNP and XDH were observed along with the enrichment in epithelial cells together with a slight, though significant, decrease in HGPRT activity. By contrast, a dramatic fall in PNP and XDH activities was detected along with the enrichment in lymphocytes together with a slight, though significant, increase in HGPRT activity. This sharply different distribution of the three enzymes, all sharing hypoxanthine as a substrate, clearly indicates that lymphocytes preferentially channel hypoxanthine into the salvage and interconversion pathways, phosphorylating it to IMP, while epithelial cells rapidly catabolize such a purine base to uric acid. Moreover, epithelial cells, unlike lymphocytes, are able to retain high intracellular levels of both hypoxanthine and inosine. These results support the possibility that epithelial cells contribute to the normal development of bursal lymphocytes by supplying such actively proliferating cells with purine rings and at the same time by preventing them from accumulating potentially toxic high levels of purine nucleotides being able to rapidly eliminate excess hypoxanthine as uric acid from the bursa environment into the bloodstream. 3achickens 3axanthine dehydrogenase 3abursa of Fabricius 3anitrogen metabolism 3apurine nucleotides 3ahypoxanthines 3aepithelial cells 3abiochemical pathways 3aepithelium 3achicks 3atransferases 3aenzyme activity 3aB-lymphocytes 0amaturation 0ahypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 0apurines 0acells 0apurine-nucleoside phosphorylase1 aFreer, G.1 aBatoni, G.1 aBarnini, S.1 aGhelardi, E.1 aBianchi, F.1 aDolfi, A.1 aLupetti, M.1 aCampa, M.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g1992 , v. 16, no. 2/3 p.197-207x0145-305X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02898naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001200180245013900192300001400331500002400345520151500369650001501884650002501899650001801924650001501942650001001957650002501967650003101992650002302023650001702046653002502063653002402088700001302112700001102125700001502136700001302151773009302164852000902257856009302266930003302359945002502392946001102417655001202428IND4395935920221122221453.0071009e20070914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439593592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.02.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aM001 0aM1201 aYan, Q.10aCharacteristics of adherence of pathogenic Vibrio alginolyticus to the intestinal mucus of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea)  ap. 21-30.  aIncludes references  aIntestinal mucus (foregut mucus and hindgut mucus) extracted from large yellow croakers was used as a model of investigating the adhesion of pathogenic Vibrio alginolyticus by the method of isotope tracer. The results showed that pathogenic V. alginolyticus could adhere to the intestinal mucus of large yellow croaker strongly. The bacterial adhesion to foregut mucus and hindgut mucus reached equilibrium after incubated at 25 °C for 150 min and 180 min, respectively. The bacterial adhesion was influenced remarkably by environmental factors such as temperature, pH and salinity, and the maximal adhesion was achieved at 30 °C, acidic condition and the normal values of salinity of marine environment (35). Starved bacteria had no adhesive capacity. Lactic acid could inhibit the bacterial adhesion. In addition, the adhesion of V. alginolyticus depended on Na+, while Ca2+ or Mg2+ played an auxiliary role in bacterial adhesion. Results obtained from adhesion assaying under various conditions (heat treatment, protease and periodic acid treatment) indicated that the main components involved in the adherence process of V. alginolyticus to the intestinal mucus might be glycoproteins. The results of adhesion assay after the mucus was roughly fractionated by gel filtration chromatography showed that the components with highest affinity might be the higher molecular mass. Our results indicated that the bacterial adhesion was governable, which might be useful for the epidemic control in fish culture. 3aSciaenidae 3abacterial infections 3afish diseases 3aintestines 3amucus 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3afish culture 0aPseudosciaena crocea 0aLarimichthys crocea1 aChen, Q.1 aMa, S.1 aZhuang, Z.1 aWang, X.0 tAquaculture.g2007 Sept. 14, v. 269, no. 1-4 p.21-30dElsevier Pub.

Equilibrium constants for the covalent modification of the regulatory disulfide bonds of these enzymes in dithiothreitol (DTT)-redox buffer were determined according to a previously published method in the literature (Clancey and Gilbert (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 13545-13549). The thiol/disulfide-redox potential (K(ox)) was defined as the ratio of reduced to oxidized dithiothreitol at which 50% of the maximal enzyme activity was observed after equilibrium had been established. All K(ox) values were very high, comparable to those of extracellular disulfide containing proteins: 0.23 +/- 0.02 for NADP-malate dehydrogenase, 0.59 +/- 0.17 for phosphoribulokinase, and 0.70 +/- 0.16 for D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. The equilibrium constants for the reactions between these enzymes and the redox buffers were also determined in the presence of various concentrations of specific metabolites known to influence the rates of reduction and oxidation. Increasing concentrations of D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in the presence of Ca2+ shift the equilibrium constant between D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and the DTT-redox buffer to much lower values. A decreasing NADPH/(NADP + NADPH) ratio increases the K(ox) of NADP-malate dehydrogenase in the redox buffer to very high values. For PRK, low concentrations of ATP result in a slight decrease of the K(ox) that is not further affected by higher ATP concentrations. The differences of the equilibrium constants of NADP-malate dehydrogenase and D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase as dependent upon the NADPH/(NADP + NADPH) ratio and the concentration of D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, respectively, reflect a mechanism of feed-back and feed-forward regulation by the product NADP and the substrate D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, respectively. Thus the actual activation state of these two key enzymes of chloroplast metabolism are determined in an independent manner. The relatively small effect of the ATP concentration upon the redox potential of phosphoribulokinase indicates that fine-regulation at this step might be achieved on another level (e.g., catalysis or aggregation state). 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aredox reactions 3afructose-bisphosphatase 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aadenosine triphosphate 3amalate dehydrogenase 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3alight 3athiols 3achloroplasts 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aDithiothreitol 2aFructose-Bisphosphatasexmetabolism 2aLight 2aMalate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aMalate Dehydrogenase (NADP+) 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)xmetabolism 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxmetabolism 0akinases 0aequilibrium 0adark 0aphosphoribulokinase1 aHoltgrefe, S.1 aOcheretina, O.1 aMeister, M.1 aBackhausen, J.E.1 aScheibe, R.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1995 Feb. 22, v. 1247, no. 1 p.135-142x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02216naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245014800128300001800276500001500294520113000309650002401439650001701463650002301480650001101503650001201514650001901526651001301545653001901558653001501577653002901592653002101621653002001642653002301662773010201685852000901787939003301796946001301829655001201842IND9205084620221122221550.0920812e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920508462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMassman, W.J.12aA surface energy balance method for partitioning evapotranspiration data into plant and soil components for a surface with partial conopy cover  ap. 1723-1732.  a2019-12-04  aAn objective, data-based method for partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) measurements into soil and plant contributions is proposed and applied to a semiarid shortgrass steppe site in northeastern Colorado. This method requires fairly standard micrometeorological/surface energy balance measurements and relies on a two-source Penman-Monteith model of ET and a submodel (proposed and developed in this study) that relates the soil evaporation resistance to the soil Bowen ratio. Assuming that these soil parameters do not vary much during any given day, their daily values are determined by an optimization procedure which exploits the diurnal change in the meteorological data. Once the soil resistance and soil Bowen ratio are determined, the available energy and the ET data are partitioned into soil and plant components and then the canopy resistance and the within-canopy aerodynamic resistance (herein referred to as the subcanopy resistance) are determined. Comparisons between the present results and other observations made in the shortgrass steppe ecosystem provide support for the validity of the present methods. 3amathematical models 3asteppe soils 3aevapotranspiration 3acanopy 3asteppes 3aenergy balance 3aColorado 0asurface layers 0aresistance 0asemiarid grassland soils 0aplant resistance 0asoil resistance 0ashortgrass steppes0 tWater resources research.g1992 June, v. 28, no. 6 p.1723-1732wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03235naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100002000147245015400167300001400321500002400335520165100359650002202010650002002032650002702052650002002079650003702099650001802136650002102154650001502175650001702190650003002207650001202237650005402249650001602303650002102319650001302340650001002353650003202363650001902395650001002414700001802424773011802442852000902560856007702569930003302646945002502679946001302704655001202717IND4367712220221122155547.0050316e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436771222DNAL7 a150746562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF6001 aBarrett, R.D.H.10aInteractive effects of genotype, environment, and ontogeny on resistance of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) to the generalist herbivore, Spodoptera exigua  ap. 37-51.  aIncludes references  aHost-plant genotype, environment, and ontogeny all play a role in determining plant resistance to herbivory, yet little is known about the nature of the interactions among these factors. We investigated resistance of cucumber plants Cucumis sativus to the generalist herbivore Spodoptera exigua in a manipulative experiment involving three factors. In particular, we tested the effects of bitter (cucurbitacins present) vs. sweet (cucurbitacins absent) plants (genotype), with or without previous herbivory (environment), and cotyledons vs. true leaves (ontogeny). Contrary to our expectations, S. exigua growth was 54% higher on bitter plants than on sweet plants; growth was 63% higher, however, on undamaged plants compared to damaged plants, and 59% higher on true leaves compared to cotyledons. Moreover, all two-way interaction terms between genotype, environment, and ontogeny were significant. For example, S. exigua performance was higher on bitter than on sweet plants; however, this effect was strongly influenced by whether the tissue consumed was a cotyledon or true leaf and also whether it had been previously damaged. An examination of leaf nutritional chemistry revealed that some of our results could be explained by genotypic, environmental, and ontogenic differences in foliar nitrogen content. In contrast, the cucurbitacin content of plants did not appear to affect caterpillar growth. Our results provide evidence for the importance of interactions between genotype, environment, and ontogeny in determining herbivory and illustrate the value of manipulative experiments in revealing the complexities of these interactions. 3aSpodoptera exigua 3apest resistance 3aplant-insect relations 3aCucumis sativus 3agenotype-environment interaction 3acucurbitacins 3anitrogen content 3aherbivores 3ainsect pests 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aCucumis sativusxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aFeeding Behavior 2aGenotype 2aLarva 2aMothsxgrowth & development 2aPlants, Edible 2aTaste1 aAgrawal, A.A.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2004 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.37-51dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3electronic resource  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/04/20  aOther US 7aarticle03750naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001500181245013300196300001800329500001500347506007600362520125500438506003701693650002601730650001801756650002001774650002001794650001101814650001701825650002301842650000901865650002801874650002001902650002901922650001901951650002501970650001801995650001402013650002102027650001202048650003102060650002502091650002002116650002702136650001902163650001102182650003902193650002202232650000902254650002102263650003002284650003702314650002702351650002502378650003902403650003302442653002302475653002102498653002502519653003102544700001702575700001102592700001802603700001402621700001602635773014202651852000902793856008302802930003302885945001302918946001302931655001202944IND2046681620221207123247.0950703e19950606dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204668162DNAL7 a77775172pmid7 aPMC417002pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.12.53912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorvai, A.10aScavenger receptor A gene regulatory elements target gene expression to macrophages and to foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions  ap. 5391-5395.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTranscription of the macrophage scavenger receptor A gene is markedly upregulated during monocyte to macrophage differentiation. In these studies, we demonstrate that 291 bp of the proximal scavenger receptor promoter, in concert with a 400-bp upstream enhancer element, is sufficient to direct macrophage-specific expression of a human growth hormone reporter in transgenic mice. These regulatory elements, which contain binding sites for PU.1, AP-1, and cooperating ets-domain transcription factors, are also sufficient to mediate regulation of transgene expression during the in vitro differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells in response to macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Mutation of the PU.1 binding site within the scavenger receptor promoter severely impairs transgene expression, consistent with a crucial role of PU.1 in regulating the expression of the scavenger receptor gene. The ability of the scavenger receptor promoter and enhancer to target gene expression to macrophages in vivo, including foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions, suggests that these regulatory elements will be of general utility in the study of macrophage differentiation and function by permitting specific modifications of macrophage gene expression.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3agene transfer 3arecombinant DNA 3aatherosclerosis 3ahumans 3asomatotropin 3atransgenic animals 3amice 3alow density lipoprotein 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3areporter genes 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abinding sites 3areceptors 3apromoter regions 2aAnimals 2aArteriosclerosisxgenetics 2aCell Differentiation 2aCells, Cultured 2aFoam Cellsxmetabolism 2aGene Targeting 2aHumans 2aMacrophagesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Proteins 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aReceptors, Immunologicxgenetics 2aReceptors, Lipoprotein 2aReceptors, Scavenger 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aScavenger Receptors, Class B 0agenetic regulation 0abinding proteins 0anucleotide sequences 0aupstream enhancer elements1 aPalinski, W.1 aWu, H.1 aMoulton, K.S.1 aKalla, K.1 aGlass, G.K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 June 6, v. 92, no. 12 p.5391-5395x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.12.53913Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02698naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001400181245008100195300001800276500001500294506007600309520057900385506003700964650002501001650001801026650001101044650001801055650002001073650002201093650001501115650002601130650001401156650001701170650003901187650003701226650005201263650001701315650007001332650005001402650002901452650002801481650006801509650002501577650002801602650002601630653002301656653002801679653004401707700001501751700001301766773014201779852000901921856008301930930003302013945001302046946001302059655001202072IND2046391920221207123250.0950612e19950523dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204639192DNAL7 a77614372pmid7 aPMC418342pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.11.49972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuyer, D.10aEvidence for cross-pathway regulation of metabolic gene expression in plants  ap. 4997-5000.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Arabidopsis thaliana, blocking histidine biosynthesis with a specific inhibitor of imidazoleglycerolphosphate dehydratase caused increased expression of eight genes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, histidine, lysine, and purines. A decrease in expression of glutamine synthetase was also observed. Addition of histidine eliminated the gene-regulating effects of the inhibitor, demonstrating that the changes in gene expression resulted from histidine-pathway blockage. These results show that plants are capable of cross-pathway metabolic regulation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amessenger RNA 3alysine 3aprimisulfuron 3agene expression 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aglyphosate 3aamino acid metabolism 3ahistidine 3ahydro-lyases 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aEnzymesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlutamate-Ammonia Ligasexantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesis. 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aHistidinexbiosynthesis 2aHydro-Lyasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aLysinexbiosynthesis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPurinesxbiosynthesis 0agenetic regulation 0asulfonylurea herbicides 0aimidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase1 aPatton, D.1 aWard, E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 May 23, v. 92, no. 11 p.4997-5000x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.11.49973Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02655naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002200133245013900155300001600294520126800310650001801578650001701596650001401613650002101627650001601648650001101664650001001675650000901685650001101694650004101705650004501746650001601791650006401807650002101871650004101892650003701933650002101970700001801991700001802009773010902027852000902136939003302145945000802178946001102186655001202197991615322070742620221122121228.0920923s1992    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030552DNAL7 a15170322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVannucchi, M.T.I.10aSerum levels of vitamin A and retinol binding protein in chronic renal patients treated by continuous ambulatorial peritoneal dialysis  ap. 107-112.  aThe possible causes and consequences of hypervitaminosis A and retinol binding protein (RBP) levels were investigated in patients with chronic renal disease submitted or not to dialysis treatment. The study was conducted on 20 patients divided into two groups: 10 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) treated by continuous ambulatorial peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and 10 CRF patients with no dialysis treatment. Ten normal subjects formed the control group. Retinol levels were determined by HPLC, and RBP levels by immunoassay in plasma and in post-dialysis fluid at different periods of time. Laboratory tests were carried out on all subjects, and dietary history was taken. Patients on dialysis had higher retinol levels than untreated patients. Retinol levels were found to be correlated with RBP levels. Serum retinol and RBP levels did not vary with diet, age or time of disease, dialysis group or time of dialysis, nor were they correlated with the levels measured in the dialysis fluid (CAPD). There was no significant correlation in retinol levels between chronic patients and controls. It is suggested that vitamin A and RBP clearances during dialysis do not accompany urea or creatinine clearance. Hypervitaminosis A did not show any toxic effect. 3arenal failure 3ahemodialysis 3avitamin A 3abinding proteins 3ablood serum 3aadults 2aAdult 2aAged 2aHumans 2aHypervitaminosis Axbloodxetiology. 2aKidney Failure, Chronicxbloodxtherapy. 2aMiddle Aged 2aPeritoneal Dialysis, Continuous Ambulatoryxadverse effects 2aReference Values 2aRetinol-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aRetinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma 2aVitamin Axblood1 aVannucchi, H.1 aHumphreys, M.0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g1992, v. 62, no. 2 p.107-112x0300-98317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle04253naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157072000900175072000900184100001500193245013100208300001600339500002400355500001500379520198900394650001602383650001202399650002202411650001802433650001902451650001402470650001902484650001302503650002002516650002102536650002402557650001802581650001502599650000902614650004202623650001202665650002902677650005202706650001502758650001902773650002502792650002902817650000902846650003402855650003402889650001002923650005002933650004402983653002603027653001703053653001603070700001403086700001403100700001603114700001703130700001603147700002603163700002203189773011003211852000903321856009603330930003303426945002503459946001103484655001203495IND4416566920221122085223.0090220e20090315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441656692DNAL7 a190811282pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL6001 aColás, C.10aChanges in calmodulin immunocytochemical localization associated with capacitation and acrosomal exocytosis of ram spermatozoa  ap. 789-800.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this study was to determine the localization of calmodulin (CaM) in ram sperm and the possible changes during in vitro capacitation (CA) and the ionophore-induced acrosome reaction (AR). Likewise, changes in intracellular calcium levels ([Ca²⁺]i) were also analysed by using flow cytometry. CA was induced in vitro in a medium containing BSA, CaCl₂, NaHCO₃, and AR by the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187. The acrosomal status was assessed by the chlortetracycline-fluorescence (CTC) assay. Flow cytometry (FC) analyses were performed by loading samples with Fluo-3 AM, that emits fluorescence at a high [Ca²⁺]i, combined with propidium iodide (PI) that allowed us to discriminate sperm with/without an integral plasma membrane both with high/low [Ca²⁺]i. Immunocytochemistry localized CaM to the flagellum, and some sperm also contained CaM in the head (equatorial and post-acrosomal regions). CA and AR resulted in a slight increase in the post-acrosomal labelling. The treatment of sperm with increasing concentrations of two CaM antagonists, W7 and calmidazolium (CZ), accounted for an increase in capacitated and acrosome-reacted CTC-sperm patterns. CZ induced a significant reduction in the content of three protein tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of approximately of 30, 40 and 45kDa. However, W7 showed no significant effect at any of the studied concentrations. Neither of them significantly influenced protein serine and threonine phosphorylation. FC analysis revealed that the main subpopulation in the control samples contained 70% of the total sperm with integral plasma membrane and a medium [Ca²⁺]i. After CA, 67.1% of the sperm preserved an integral membrane with a higher [Ca²⁺]i. After AR, only 7.2% of the total sperm preserved intact membranes with a very high [Ca²⁺]i. These results imply that CaM appears to be involved in ram sperm capacitation, and both treatments increased its localization in the post-acrosomal region. 3aantagonists 3acalcium 3aacrosome reaction 3aion transport 3aflow cytometry 3aflagellum 3acultured cells 3aacrosome 3aplasma membrane 3amolecular weight 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aculture media 3acalmodulin 3arams 2aAcrosomexphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aAnimals 2aCalcimycinxpharmacology 2aCalmodulinxanalysisxantagonists & inhibitors. 2aExocytosis 2aFlow Cytometry 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIonophoresxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMembrane Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aSheep 2aSperm Capacitationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSpermatozoaxchemistryxultrastructure. 0ain vitro capacitation 0acapacitation 0aspermatozoa1 aGrasa, P.1 aCasao, A.1 aGallego, M.1 aAbecia, J.A.1 aForcada, F.1 aCebrián-Pérez, J.A.1 aMuiño-Blanco, T.0 tTheriogenology.g2009 Mar. 15, v. 71, no. 5 p.789-800dButterworth-Heinemann; [New York]x0093-691X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2008.10.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090413b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle01686naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245010100133300001600234520070300250650001500953650001100968650001600979650001800995650002101013650001901034650002801053650001601081650002301097650001801120700002001138700001901158773008401177852000901261939003301270945000801303946001301311655001201324991615321410742620221122085216.0920923e199208  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuchese, R.H.10aAflatoxin production in a meat mix model system in the presence of Pediococcus and Lactobacillus  ap. 583-587.  aThe effect on aflatoxin production by Aspergillus parasiticus of eight individual strains of Pediococcus and Lactobacillus was determined.

We have shown that Haliotis midae fed a probiotic-supplemented diet have an improved survival and growth rate compared to animals not fed probiotics. The growth rate of small (20 mm) and large (67mm) abalone was improved by 8% and 34%, respectively, in two separate eight-month farm growth trials. Furthermore, the number, and phagocytic activity, of circulating haemocytes was significantly higher (P<0.05) in probiotic treated animals compared to non-treated animals following challenge with the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio anguillarum. Seven days after challenging with V. anguillarum, the probiotic-fed animals had 62% survival compared to 25% survival for non-treated animals. In situ protease assays showed that probiotic treatment significantly increased (P<0.05) protease activity in the intestinal region of the digestive tract of animals fed the probiotic-supplemented feed. This correlated with a significant increase (P<0.05) in the amount of protein digestion and absorption measured in this region of the abalone gut. Histological analysis showed that the digestive glands of animals receiving probiotics were bacteria-free, whereas the digestive glands of 70% of the animals receiving the non-supplemented feed had a high bacterial load. The microorganisms tested in this study therefore have tremendous potential as probiotics for commercially produced H. midae. 3aHaliotis 3aabalone 3aanimal growth 3amortality 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3aphagocytosis 3aintestines 3aproteinases 3aenzyme activity 3adigestion 3aintestinal absorption 3afeed supplements 3aprobiotics 3acampylobacteriosis 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3amollusc culture 3amariculture 0aHaliotis midae1 aCoyne, V.E.0 tAquaculture.g2005 Mar. 4, v. 245, no. 1-4 p.249-261dElsevier Pub.

Previously, we reported that renal proximal convoluted tubules, the major site of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 production, have vitamin D receptors. In the presence of vitamin D receptors, renal proximal convoluted tubules cannot maintain the state of enhanced production of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. To clarify this discrepancy, we proposed a working hypothesis for the reciprocal control of renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1 alpha- and 24-hydroxylase activities. In rat models of enhanced renal production of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, expression of vitamin D receptors and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase mRNAs was strikingly suppressed in renal proximal convoluted tubules but not in the cortical collecting ducts. In vitamin D-deficient rats with up-regulated renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity, expression of vitamin D receptor mRNA in renal proximal convoluted tubules was also down-regulated, indicating that the down-regulation of vitamin D receptor mRNA is not the result of the enhanced production of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In Japanese quail models with up-regulated renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity by sex steroids, expression of vitamin D receptor mRNA was also down-regulated in the kidney but not in the duodenum. These results suggest that the down-regulation of vitamin D receptors plays a critical role in production of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in renal proximal convoluted tubules.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aduodenum 3areceptors 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3acalcitriol 3akidneys 3arats 3aCoturnix japonica 3aenzyme activity 3aestradiol 3aoxygenases 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCalcitriolxbiosynthesis 2aCalciumxblood 2aCoturnix 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxbiosynthesis 2aDuodenumxmetabolism 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxphysiologyxphysiopathology. 2aKidney Cortexxmetabolism 2aKidney Tubules, Proximalxmetabolism 2aMale 2aNephronsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aOligonucleotide Probes 2aParathyroid Hormonexblood 2aParathyroidectomy 2aPhosphorusxblood 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Calcitriolxphysiology 2aSteroid Hydroxylasesxbiosynthesis 2aThyroidectomy 2aVitamin Dxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxphysiopathology 2aVitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase 0acholecalciferol derivatives 0a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 24-hydroxylase 0avitamin D 0arenal proximal convoluted tubules 0a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 1alpha-hydroxylase 0aJapanese quails1 aShinki, T.1 aYamaguchi, A.1 aDeluca, H.F.1 aKurokawa, K.1 aSuda, T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 June 20, v. 92, no. 13 p.6112-6116x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.13.61123Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02804naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001300172245010700185300001400292500002400306520139800330650001901728650001901747650001101766650001201777650002001789650001701809650000901826650002001835650002001855650002101875650001701896650003701913651001001950700002101960700001901981700001902000700001702019773011102036852000902147856008502156930003302241945002502274946001102299655001202310IND4415094920221122072455.0090120e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441509492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-008-9755-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF600 0aJ5001 aLi, Ping10aDistribution and Accumulation of Copper and Cadmium in Soil-Rice System as Affected by Soil Amendments  ap. 29-40.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of seven amendments on the distribution and accumulation of copper and cadmium in a soil-rice system were investigated using a pot experiment. Results showed that application of limestone, calcium magnesium phosphate (Ca-Mg-P fertilizer), calcium silicate (silicon fertilizer), Chinese milk vetch, pig manure, and peat significantly decreased the concentrations of Cu and Cd in rice roots by 24.8-75.3% and 9.7-49.9%, respectively. However, no significant difference was observed between zinc sulfate (zinc fertilizer) and the control treatment. The concentrations of Cu and Cd in different parts of rice followed the order: root > straw > grain, and all amendments restrained the transfer of Cu and Cd from rice root to stem. Copper and Cd concentrations in rice stems at the tillering stage were the highest, and then decreased from the tillering stage to the heading stage. However, they increased again at the ripening stage. The results also showed that application of amendments changed Cu and Cd solubility in soil and decreased their bioavailability, which resulted in the reduction of Cu and Cd uptake by rice. Significant correlations between the concentrations of Cu and Cd in soil solutions and in rice stems were found. The result demonstrated that limestone has the best efficiency among all the amendments used in reducing Cu and Cd contamination to rice production. 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3acopper 3acadmium 3asoil amendments 3aOryza sativa 3arice 3abioaccumulation 3abioavailability 3awater solubility 3aheavy metals 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aChina1 aWang, Xing-xiang1 aZhang, Tao-lin1 aZhou, Dong-mei1 aHe, Yuan-qiu0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2009 Jan., v. 196, no. 1-4 p.29-40dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9755-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20090205b20090301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle01883naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002800115245014900143300001600292520066900308650001400977650001500991650001401006650001101020650002001031650001801051650001601069650002101085650001901106650001801125650001901143651001001162653001501172653001601187700001901203700001501222700001901237700001601256700001801272773008401290852000901374939003301383945000801416946001301424655001201437991615319890742620221122072501.0920923e199208  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Manzanares, E.10aRelationship between indicators of fecal pollution in shellfish-growing water and the occurrence of human pathogenic microorganisms in shellfish  ap. 609-614.  aThe suitability and efficiency, of fecal indicators of pollution to determine the quality of shellfish-growing waters were studied in the estuary of Guadalhorce river (Malaga, Spain).

(Rutaceae). Females were strongly deterred from laying eggs by a methanolic extract of O. japonica leaves. Larvae also rejected a diet leaf medium impregnated with O. japonica leaf extracts. Several components in the water-soluble fraction of the leaf extract were found to deter both oviposition and feeding responses. Two major deterrent compounds were characterized as 5-([2-O-(beta-D-apiofuranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranosyl]oxy)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid and a disyringoyl aldaric acid. These compounds induced potent deterrence of both oviposition and larval feeding by P. xuthus, which suggests a congruent chemosensory mechanism of allomonal chemicals acting on both female tarsal chemoreceptors and larval maxillary taste receptors. 3aPapilio xuthus 3aoviposition deterrents 3aphenolic compounds 3afeeding behavior 3ahost seeking 3aplant-insect relations 3ainsect pests 2aAnimals 2aButterfliesxphysiology 2aChemoreceptor Cellsxphysiology 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHydroxybenzoatesxpharmacology 2aLarvaxphysiology 2aOviposition 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aRutaceaexchemistry 2aSolubility 2aTaste1 aKuwahara, Y.1 aNishida, R.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2004 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.287-301dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3electronic resource  a20050815b00000000c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/04/20  aOther US 7aarticle02480naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002100136245010800157300001200265500002400277520128900301650002101590650002601611650001801637650002201655650003801677650001201715650002001727650001501747650001201762650002401774650001901798650000901817650002001826650001901846650003601865700002101901773010001922852000902022856003902031655001202070IND4399714020221122035643.0080106e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439971402DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.21012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEddouks, Mohamed10aEffect of Lepidium sativum L. on renal glucose reabsorption and urinary TGF-β1 levels in diabetic rats  ap. 1-5.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism underlying the hypoglycaemic activity of the aqueous extract perfusion of Lepidium sativum L. (LS) in normal and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The aqueous LS extract was administered intravenously and the blood glucose levels were determined within 4 h of treatment. Plasma insulin concentrations and glycosuria were determined. The 24 h urinary transforming growth factor-β1 (ELISA) was evaluated in diabetic and control rats 15 days after oral treatment with the aqueous LS extract at a dose of 20 mg/kg.The study showed that LS at a dose of 10 mg/kg/h reduced blood glucose levels both in normal and diabetic rats (p < 0.001). At the same time as a potent increase of glycosuria was observed both in normal and diabetic rats (p < 0.001). In addition, oral administration of LS for 15 days normalized glycaemia (p < 0.001), enhanced glycosuria (p < 0.05 vs diabetic control) and decreased the amount of urinary TGF-β1 (p < 0.01) in diabetic rats.It is concluded that the aqueous LS extract caused a potent inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption which in turn reduced blood sugar. This renal effect is at least one mechanism explaining the observed hypoglycaemic activity of this plant in normal and diabetic rats. 3aLepidium sativum 3aanimal disease models 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes mellitus 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aglucose 3aglycemic effect 3aglycosuria 3ainsulin 3aoral administration 3aplant extracts 3arats 3areducing sugars 3arenal function 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aMaghrani, Mhamed0 tPhytotherapy research.g2008 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.1-5dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2101 7aarticle02302naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100001800154245009500172300001600267500002400283520110000307650001101407650002101418650002701439650002201466650001701488650001501505650001701520650002101537650001601558651001001574700001301584700001901597773011301616852000901729856008501738930003301823945002501856946001101881655001201892IND4415093920221122035748.0090120e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441509392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-008-9767-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aPolettini, A.10aAssisted Washing for Heavy Metal and Metalloid Removal from Contaminated Dredged Materials  ap. 183-198.  aIncludes references  aIn the present study a chemical washing process was applied to dredged sea and river sediments. Five chelating agents (ethylenediaminetetraacetic, nitrilotriacetic, citric, [S,S]-ethylenediaminedisuccinic and oxalic acids), three surfactants (sodium dodecyl sulphate, cetylpyridinium chloride and saponin Q), as well as monobasic potassium phosphate were used as the extracting agents. The effect of sonication was also tested as a conditioning step to couple with chelant-based extraction. The extraction experiments were performed in both single and multiple washing stages. The results indicated that, for given experimental conditions, the remediation efficiency was strongly dependent on the specific contaminant under concern, with contaminant speciation and distribution in the solid matrix as well as affinity for the extracting agent playing a major role in the decontamination process. In this respect, the study also showed that in the presence of multiple contaminants the use of a single extraction agent is not sufficient to attain adequate quality levels for the treated sediment. 3arivers 3amarine sediments 3asediment contamination 3adredged materials 3aheavy metals 3aextraction 3asoil washing 3achelating agents 3asurfactants 3aItaly1 aPomi, R.1 aCalcagnoli, G.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2009 Jan., v. 196, no. 1-4 p.183-198dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9767-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03356naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189100001600198245010300214300001600317500002400333520192200357650002302279650001302302650002102315650002302336650001402359650002102373650001102394650001402405650002002419650001602439650002802455653002302483700001702506700002602523700001602549700001902565773009502584852000902679856009302688930003302781945002502814946001102839655001202850IND4395939820221122035656.0071009e20070914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439593982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.04.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL821 0aM001 0aM1201 aWaddy, S.L.10aFeeding response of female American lobsters, Homarus americanus, to SLICE®-medicated salmon feed  ap. 123-129.  aIncludes references  aSLICE® (0.2% emamectin benzoate) is a widely-prescribed in-feed treatment for the control of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus spp.) on farmed salmon (primarily Salmo salar). Large doses of emamectin benzoate disrupt the molt cycle of ovigerous American lobsters (Homarus americanus), causing them to molt prematurely and lose their attached eggs. The feeding responses of adult female lobsters offered a choice between their natural foods and either SLICE®-medicated or unmedicated salmon pellets were assessed in laboratory feeding trials. Most lobsters were initially attracted to and ate salmon feed and 87.5% of the 48 lobsters offered SLICE®-medicated feed acquired quantifiable levels of emamectin B1a in their digestive glands. Postmolt (stage C2-3) lobsters ate three to six times more medicated feed than did intermolt (stage C4) ovigerous lobsters, and 8% of the postmolt lobsters developed problems maintaining proper orientation. Consumption of natural foods in the feeding trials was similar each day, but in five of the six trials consumption of salmon feed declined significantly after day 1. The mean dose of emamectin benzoate ingested in 2 weeks ranged from 0.02 μg g- 1 for the intermolt ovigerous group (0.015 and 0.006 μg g- 1 in the first and second week, respectively) to 0.06 μg g- 1 for the postmolt group (0.043 and 0.012 μg g- 1 in the two weeks, respectively). These doses are lower than the LOEL (lowest observed effect level) on the molt cycle. The results of this study provide the first information on the feeding response of a non-target crustacean to salmon feed medicated with SLICE® at a concentration used by the aquaculture industry. The most significant findings are that ovigerous intermolt lobsters ate relatively little medicated feed and both postmolt and intermolt lobsters preferred their natural foods and became conditioned to reject medicated feed. 3aHomarus americanus 3alobsters 3afeeding behavior 3acrustacean culture 3aingestion 3afeed composition 3asalmon 3abenzoates 3adisease control 3aparasitoses 3aLepeophtheirus salmonis 0aemamectin benzoate1 aMercer, S.M.1 aHamilton-Gibson, M.N.1 aAiken, D.E.1 aBurridge, L.E.0 tAquaculture.g2007 Sept. 14, v. 269, no. 1-4 p.123-129dElsevier Pub.

It is defective in X chromosome-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a neurodegenerative disorder with impaired peroxisomal oxidation of very long chain fatty acids. We report cloning and characterization of PXA1, a yeast gene encoding a protein (Pxa1p) exhibiting high similarity to ALDp. Disruption of PXA1 results in impaired growth on oleic acid and reduced ability to oxidize oleate. Pxa1p is peroxisome associated; however, in the PXA1 mutant yeast, as in ALD cells, peroxisomes are morphologically intact. Disruption of a second yeast gene, YKL741, which encodes a more distantly related ALDp homolog (Yk174p), in either wild-type or PXA1 mutant yeast, results in a growth phenotype identical to that of the PXA1 mutant. This result suggests that Yk1741p and Pxa1p may be subunits of the same transporter. Sequence analysis of Pxa1p, ALDp, and related ABC transporters reveals a possible fatty acid binding domain and a 14-amino acid EAA-like motif, previously described only in prokaryotes. Because of the similarities in sequence and function, we propose that Pxa1p is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of ALDp.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aperoxisomes 3astructural genes 3aphenotype 3amutagenesis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abinding proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3anucleotide sequences 3amutants 3aoleic acid 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aAdrenoleukodystrophyxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCatalasexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aHumans 2aMembrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aMicrobodiesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aX Chromosome 0afatty acids 0aykl741 gene 0apxa1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u17065 0agrowth1 aWatkins, P.A.1 aWalle, D.1 aValle, D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 June 20, v. 92, no. 13 p.6012-6016x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.13.60123Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03027naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001700181245007700198300001800275506007600293520123600369506003701605650002801642650001701670650002101687650001201708650001801720650001201738650002201750650002701772650001501799650002401814650004001838650004201878650005201920650001301972650006401985650002002049650006402069650005102133653003102184773014302215852000902358856008302367930003302450945001302483946001302496655001202509IND2046730820221207121917.0950707e19950620dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204673082DNAL7 a75970612pmid7 aPMC416212pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.13.59602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, R.A.10ancd and kinesin motor domains interact with both alpha- and beta-tubulin  ap. 5960-5964.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMotor domains of the Drosophila minus-end-directed microtubule (MT) motor protein ncd, were found to saturate microtubule binding sites at a stoichiometry of approximately one motor domain per tubulin dimer. To determine the tubulin subunit(s) involved in binding to ncd, mixtures of ncd motor domain and MTs were treated with the zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide) (EDC). EDC treatment generated covalently cross-linked products of ncd and alpha-tubulin and of ncd and beta-tubulin, indicating that the ncd motor domain interacts with both alpha- and beta-tubulin. When the Drosophila kinesin motor domain protein was substituted for the ncd motor domain cross-linked products of kinesin and alpha-tubulin and of kinesin and beta-tubulin were produced. EDC treatment of mixtures of ncd motor domain and unassembled tubulin dimers or of kinesin motor domain and unassembled tubulin dimers produced the same motor-tubulin products generated in the presence of MTs. These results indicate that kinesin family motors of opposite polarity interact with both tubulin monomers and support a model in which some portion of each protein's motor domain overlaps adjacent alpha- and beta-tubulin subunits.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3amicrotubules 3abinding proteins 3atubulin 3abinding sites 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCross-Linking Reagents 2aDrosophila 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEthyldimethylaminopropyl Carbodiimide 2aKinesinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMicrotubule Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aRecombinant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTubulinxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0amicrotubule motor proteins0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 June 20, v. 92, no. 13 p.5960-5964x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.13.59603Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01951naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138100001600147245009500163300001600258500002400274520053800298650001700836650002300853650001800876650002500894650001400919650001200933650003900945650003800984650002801022650002801050650002501078650004001103651002001143700001601163700002101179773012001200852000901320856009301329930003301422945002501455946001301480655001201493IND4367700020221121171445.0050316e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436770002DNAL7 a152602202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL0011 aSchmitt, T.10aQuinone mixture as attractant for necrophagous dung beetles specialized on dead millipedes  ap. 731-740.  aIncludes references  a2-Methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (toluquinone) and 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone are the most common components of defensive secretions of juliform millipedes (Diplopoda: Juliformia).

On all three resistivity traverses there are also indications that a small degree of mixing of saline and fresh water is occurring ahead of the main saline boundary. For one of the traverses much more detail of variations in resistivity structure is provided by CRT utilising three 10m long electrode strings installed at 10m separation. CRT images of the saline mixing zone do not reveal any significant difference between low and high tide for tidal ranges of about 2m, but for a tidal range of approximately twice this clearly show effects due to both increased wave run-up and tidal head. Correlation of the bulk resistivity with fluid resistivity values measured in parallel bores suggests that although there is no apparent widening of the mixing zone during the tidal cycle significant variations in salinity do occur which can be envisaged in terms of the horizontal movement of near vertical salinity contours. 3aaquifers 3aelectrical resistance 3aelectrodes 3afreshwater 3aimage analysis 3amixing 3amonitoring 3asaline water 3asalinity 3asaltwater intrusion 3atides 3atomography1 aIngham, M.R.1 aMcConchie, J.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 July 28, v. 389, no. 1-2 p.69-77dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.022 7aarticle01941naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245011400141300001600255520095300271650001701224650002001241650002501261650002201286700002501308700001501333700001801348700002101366700001801387700001501405773009301420852000901513930003301522945002501555946001101580655001201591IND4363613620221121133141.0040729e20040709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436361362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWastl, J.10aRedox properties of Arabidopsis cytochrome c6 are independent of the loop extension specific to higher plants  ap. 115-120.  aCytochrome c6 (cytc6) from Arabidopsis differs from the cyanobacterial and algal homologues in several redox properties. It is possible that these differences might be due to the presence of a 12 amino acid residue loop extension common to higher plant cytc6 proteins. However, homology modelling suggests this is not the case. We report experiments to test if differences in biochemical properties could be due to this extension. Analysis of mutant forms of Arabidopsis cytc6 in which the entire extension was lacking, or a pair of cysteine residues in the extension had been exchanged for serine, revealed no significant effect of these changes on either the redox potential of the haem group or the reactivity towards Photosystem I (PSI). We conclude that the differences in properties are due to more subtle unidentified differences in structure, and that the sequence extension in the higher plant proteins has a function yet to be identified. 3acytochrome c 3aredox potential 3aamino acid sequences 3asequence homology1 aMolina-Heredia, F.P.1 aHervas, M.1 aNavarro, J.A.1 aRosa, M.A. de la1 aBendall, D.S.1 aHowe, C.J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2004 July 9, v. 1657, no. 2-3 p.115-120x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20040927b20041003c00000000  aINDdLDPe2004/09/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01767naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245007400141300001400215500001500229520056900244650000900813650002600822650000700848650002100855650002300876650001600899650001200915650001100927650001900938650002100957650001100978650003100989650000901020650003001029650001901059653001701078700001601095773014401111852000901255930003301264945001301297946001101310655001201321IND2048565520221121133132.0951102e19950102ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204856552DNAL7 a79998002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBone, S.10aDielectric studies of ion fluctuation and chain bending in native DNA  ap. 85-93.  a2019-12-05  aThe high-frequency dielectric dispersion exhibited by solutions of native DNA is characterised as a function of electrolyte concentration, counterion type, temperature and pH.

Inclusion of a variety of thiol compounds in this system is shown to lead to rapid loss of the iron(IV)-oxo species and the regeneration of the ferric form and/or the formation of novel sulf species formed by nucleophilic attack of the thiol group on the tetrapyrrole ring. The reduction process also results in the generation of thiyl radicals which have been detected by EPR spin trapping. The relative yields of the products produced by these two competing pathways is shown to be highly dependent on the steric and electronic characteristics of the thiol compound. Evidence has also been obtained, in the absence of hydrogen peroxide, for both the reduction of the ferric form of the protein to the oxy-ferrous form, via a process believed to involve the deoxy-ferrous species, and the formation of sulf-leghaemoglobin species. Both of these pathways are again highly dependent on the structure of the thiol, and the former also results in the generation of thiyl radicals. Inclusion of the sulfide anion in place of the organic thiols results in somewhat different behaviour, in that this species appears to both reduce the iron centre and form a complex with the iron atom. This ligation process is reversible, and the sulfide complex is shown to react readily with both strong oxidizing and reducing agents. The behaviour of this protein, which is structurally related to myoglobin, is dramatically different to that demonstrated by myoglobin; this is rationalized in terms of the much more open heme site of leghaemoglobins, and the presence of an electronic gate which hinders access by negatively charged molecules. The contribution of these processes to the maintenance of the leghaemoglobin proteins in the oxy-ferrous form in vivo and the binding of oxygen is discussed. 3aGlycine max 3aroot nodules 3ahydrogen peroxide 3athiols 3asulfhydryl groups 3acysteine 3aspectral analysis 3aredox reactions 3aleghemoglobin 2a3-Mercaptopropionic Acidxchemistry 2aAcetylcysteinexchemistry 2aCysteaminexchemistry 2aCysteinexchemistry 2aDisulfidesxchemistry 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aFerric Compoundsxchemistry 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aLeghemoglobinxchemistry 2aMercaptoethanolxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxchemistry 2aSulfidesxchemistry 2aThioctic Acidxchemistry 0aferric ions1 aDavies, M.J.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1995 Jan. 5, v. 1246, no. 1 p.74-81x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02549naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001800181245008200199300001800281506007600299520076600375506003701141650001501178650000801193650002701201650002301228650002201251650001301273650003001286650002301316650004001339650002301379650002101402650003101423650002701454650003001481650003001511650006801541653001401609653001801623653004001641700001601681700001801697773014101715852000901856856008301865930003301948945001301981946001301994655001202007IND2046380320221207121408.0950609e19950509dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204638032DNAL7 a77538652pmid7 aPMC420092pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.10.46862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeattie, T.L.12aA secondary-structure model for the self-cleaving region of Neurospora VS RNA  ap. 4686-4690.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeurospora VS RNA performs an RNA-mediated self-cleavage reaction whose products contain 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl termini. This reaction is similar to those of hammerhead, hairpin, and hepatitis delta virus ribozymes; however, VS RNA is not similar in sequence to these other self-cleaving motifs. Here we propose a model for the secondary structure of the self-cleaving region of VS RNA, supported by site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification structure probing data. The secondary structure of VS RNA is distinct from those of the other naturally occurring RNA self-cleaving domains. In addition to a unique secondary structure, several Mg dependent interactions occur during the folding of VS RNA into its active tertiary conformation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNeurospora 3aRNA 3amolecular conformation 3achemical reactions 3amitochondrial DNA 3aplasmids 3asite-directed mutagenesis 2aCloning, Molecular 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aModels, Structural 2aMolecular Weight 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNeurosporaxmetabolism 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aNucleic Acid Denaturation 2aRNA, Fungalxbiosynthesisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 0aribozymes 0acatalytic rna 0arna mediated self cleavage reaction1 aOlive, J.E.1 aCollins, R.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 May 9, v. 92, no. 10 p.4686-4690x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.10.46863Available from publisher's Web site  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03515naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013500129300001600264520242900280650002202709650001702731650001502748650001902763650001602782650001702798650002002815653001502835653004002850653001902890700001602909700001502925773014702940852000903087930003303096945001303129946001103142655001203153IND2047695220221121045602.0950912e19940729ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204769522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEriksson, A.C.14aThe ubiquinol cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex of spinach leaf mitochondria involved in both respiration and protein processing  ap. 221-231.  aNuclear encoded mitochondrial precursor proteins are cleaved to mature size products by the general mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). In contrast to non-plant tissues where MPP is located in the matrix, the general processing activity of potato tuber (storage tissue) mitochondria has been shown to constitute an integral part of the isolated cytochrome c reductase complex of the respiratory chain. Here we show isolation of MPP from photosynthetic tissue, spinach leaf mitochondria, starting from the total membrane processing extract using extraction with dodecyl-beta-maltoside followed by FPLC anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The total spinach leaf MPP is found in the fractions containing the cytochrome c reductase complex and is shown to be an integral part of the complex. No processing activity has been found in any other fractions. The isolated cytochrome c reductase complex is shown to process three precursor proteins of different intramitochondrial localisation, the F1 beta subunit of ATP synthase (extrinsic membrane protein on matrix side), the Rieske FeS protein (integral membrane protein facing intermembrane space) and the malate dehydrogenase (matrix protein). The processing activity is totally inhibited by EDTA and orthophenanthroline. Our results together with the results in potato mitochondria show that integration of MPP into the cytochrome c reductase is a general phenomenon for plants. The complex consists of ten protein bands on SDS-PAGE of 61, 54, 52, 34, 32, 26, 15, 12, 11 and 10 kDa. The 61, 54 and 52 kDa bands correspond to Core proteins, the 32 kDa band to cytochrome b and the 26 kDa band to Rieske FeS protein as estimated by immunological methods. The three Core proteins are shown to be immunologically related to MPP from other sources, the Core 1 protein corresponding to beta-MPP and the Core 2 and Core 3 proteins corresponding to alpha-MPP, which in comparison to MPP in potato mitochondria indicates species-dependent differences in the appearance of the processing components. Furthermore, the processing activity of the isolated and membrane-bound spinach cytochrome c reductase complex is shown to be inhibited by antimycin A and myxothiazol, electron transfer inhibitors of the complex. The inhibition of processing is, however, not correlated to the inhibition of electron transfer through the complex or to the redox state of the complex. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3amitochondria 3apeptidases 3aplant proteins 3aubiquinones 3acytochrome c 3aoxidoreductases 0aprecursors 0amitochondrial processing peptidases 0aprotein import1 aSjoling, S.1 aGlaser, E.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1994 July 29, v. 1186, no. 3 p.221-231x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03450naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001500181245014000196300001800336500001500354506007600369520107100445506003701516650002301553650002101576650001901597650001101616650001301627650001801640650002501658650002101683650001801704650001801722650001401740650003101754650001601785650003701801650001801838650001201856650003101868650002401899650001101923650006801934650005502002650001602057650002802073650003502101650001902136650002602155650003002181650003902211650003802250650001702288653002502305653003102330700001602361700001302377700001902390700001502409773014102424852000902565856008302574930003302657945001302690946001302703655001202716IND2046378920221207121637.0950609e19950509dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204637892DNAL7 a77538272pmid7 aPMC419642pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.10.44622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, W.S.12aA mutation in the promoter of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene in a patient with familial combined hyperlipidemia and low LPL activity  ap. 4462-4466.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have identified a naturally occurring mutation in the promoter of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene. One of 20 patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) and reduced levels of postheparin plasma LPL activity was found to be a heterozygote carrier of this mutation. The mutation, a T lead to C substitution at nt-39, occurred in the binding site of the transcription factor Oct-1. As a result, the transcriptional activity of the mutant promoter was < 15% of wild type, as determined by transfection studies in the human macrophage-like cell line THP-1. This decrease in promoter activity was observed in undifferentiated as well as in phorbol ester-differentiated THP-1 cells. Furthermore, the inductive effect of elevating the levels of intracellular cAMP was equally reduced. This mutation was not present among 20 FCHL patients with normal plasma LPL levels nor has it been reported among individuals with familial LPL deficiency. Thus, heterozygosity for LPL promoter mutations may be one of several factors that contribute to the etiology of FCHL.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3alipoprotein lipase 3astructural genes 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahumans 3amutation 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3apromoter regions 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCell Line 2aDNAxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGlutamic Acid 2aGlycine 2aGenetic Carrier Screening. 2aHost Cell Factor C1 2aHumans 2aHyperlipidemia, Familial Combinedxbloodxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aLipoprotein Lipasexbiosynthesisxbloodxgenetics. 2aMacrophages 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOctamer Transcription Factor-1 2aPoint Mutation 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTransfection 0anucleotide sequences 0atranscription factor oct-11 aNevin, D.N.1 aPeng, R.1 aBrunzell, J.D.1 aDeeb, S.S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 May 9, v. 92, no. 10 p.4462-4466x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.10.44623Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02038naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009700127300001600224520085300240650001701093650001401110650001501124650001101139650001001150650000901160650001201169650001201181650001201193650001301205650002301218650002401241650001701265650002001282651001301302651001801315653001301333653002801346700001801374700001701392700001701409700001501426773007201441852000901513939003301522946001301555655001201568IND9205518820221121045556.0920910e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920551882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrehan, J.R.10aRoot damage by the conifer swift moth: a mortality factor in montane red spruce regeneration  ap. 611-622.  aRed spruce seedlings potted with Korscheltellus gracilis (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae) larvae exhibited characteristic feeding damage, including localized removal of bark and cambium, and root girdling. Seedling damage resulted in a significant increase in needle dieback, and reductions in growth, root area, and root weight. A survey of population density and montane distribution of larvae and adults at Whiteface Mountain (New York) and Mount Moosilauke (New Hampshire) revealed significantly higher numbers at elevations of 900-1100 m compared to 500 m, 700 m, and 1300 m. Larval densities reached a maximum mean of 38/m2 on Mount Moosilauke and 11/m2 on Whiteface Mountain, with higher densities recorded from the windward slopes. The potential ecological significance of K. gracilis is discussed in relation to the problem of red spruce decline. 3aPicea rubens 3aseedlings 3aHepialidae 3alarvae 3aroots 3abark 3acambium 3adieback 3adecline 3aaltitude 3apopulation density 3apopulation dynamics 3aforest pests 3amontane forests 3aNew York 3aNew Hampshire 0ainjuries 0akorscheltellus gracilis1 aParicer, B.L.1 aWagner, D.L.1 aRosovsky, J.1 aAleong, J.0 tForest science.g1992 Aug., v. 38, no. 3 p.611-622x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04540naa a2201069 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001400181245016000195300001800355506007600373520127600449506003701725650001601762650002201778650001901800650001101819650002501830650002501855650001901880650002001899650002201919650002401941650001201965650001801977650002401995650003002019650002302049650001502072650001502087650001502102650002302117650003902140650003302179650001702212650001102229650001902240650005802259650002802317650001302345650003302358650004102391650003402432650002502466653002802491653001902519653001902538653001902557653001902576653001902595653001902614653001902633653001902652653001902671653001902690653001902709653001902728653001902747653001902766653001902785653001902804653001902823653001902842653001902861653001902880653001902899653001902918653001902937653001902956653001902975653001902994653001903013653001903032653001903051653002003070700001603090700001903106700001703125700002403142773014103166852000903307856008303316930003303399945001303432946001303445655001203458IND2046378720221207121635.0950609e19950509dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204637872DNAL7 a77538262pmid7 aPMC419632pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.10.44572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, J.R.10aIdentification of cDNA clones encoding valosin-containing protein and other plant plasma membrane-associated proteins by a general immunoscreening strategy  ap. 4457-4461.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn approach was developed for the isolation and characterization of soybean plasma membrane-associated proteins by immunoscreening of a cDNA expression library. An antiserum was raised against purified plasma membrane vesicles. In a differential screening of approximately 500,000 plaque-forming units with the anti-(plasma membrane) serum and DNA probes derived from highly abundant clones isolated in a preliminary screening, 261 clones were selected from approximately 1,200 antiserum-positive plaques. These clones were classified into 40 groups by hybridization analysis and 5'- and 3'-terminal sequencing. By searching nucleic acid and protein sequence data bases, 11 groups of cDNAs were identified, among which valosin-containing protein (VCP), clathrin heavy chain, phospholipase C, and S-adenosylmethionine:delta 24-sterol-C-methyltransferase have not to date been cloned from plants. The remaining 29 groups did not match any current data base entries and may, therefore, represent additional or yet uncharacterized genes. A full-length cDNA encoding the soybean VCP was sequenced. The high level of amino acid identity with vertebrate VCP and yeast CDC48 protein indicates that the soybean protein is a plant homolog of vertebrate VCP and yeast CDC48 protein.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlycine max 3acomplementary DNA 3aplant proteins 3aclones 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aimmunoblotting 3aplasma membrane 3amembrane proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Cycle Proteins 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aDNA Probes 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aGene Library 2aHumans 2aImmunoblotting 2aMembrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptides 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexmetabolism 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSoybeansxmetabolism 0amolecular sequenes data 0agenbank/u20213 0agenbank/t41432 0agenbank/t41433 0agenbank/t41434 0agenbank/t41435 0agenbank/t41436 0agenbank/t41437 0agenbank/t41438 0agenbank/t41439 0agenbank/t41440 0agenbank/t41441 0agenbank/t41442 0agenbank/t41443 0agenbank/t41444 0agenbank/t41445 0agenbank/t41446 0agenbank/t41447 0agenbank/t41448 0agenbank/t41449 0agenbank/t41450 0agenbank/t41451 0agenbank/t41452 0agenbank/t41453 0agenbank/t41454 0agenbank/t41455 0agenbank/t41456 0agenbank/t41457 0agenbank/t41458 0agenbank/t41459 0agenbank/t41460+1 aDixon, R.A.1 aGonzales, R.A.1 aKjellbom, P.1 aBhattacharyya, M.K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 May 9, v. 92, no. 10 p.4457-4461x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.10.44573Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02885naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012300128300001600251520197000267650001902237650002902256650001102285650001402296650001302310650001602323653001102339653001402350653001502364653002702379700001402406773007202420852000902492939003302501946001302534655001202547IND9205519320221121045444.0920910e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920551932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleming, R.A.10aSpruce budworm defoliation and growth loss in young balsam fir: cohort models of needlefall schedules for spaced trees  ap. 678-694.  aThe relationship between the age-specific rates of needlefall, q(x), and needle age, x, for cohorts of needles from young, spaced balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L.] Mill.) was described by the discrete hazard function of the Weibull model, q(x) = 1 - exp|(x(s) - [x + 1](s))/u(s)|. Here u = 6.32 yr (SE = 0.122 yr), s = 3.03 (SE = 0.109), and R2 = 0.982. These age-specific rates increased with needle age, demonstrating a type I pattern of needlefall. Three phases of needlefall were distinguished. An "early life" phase in which the mean rates of needlefall remained under 10% per year occurred during the first 2 years of existence. Later, up to about needle age 4, the rates climbed steadily upwards with age (at 5.5% per year per year). After age 4, the rate of increase in needlefall with age increased to over 8% per year per year. This may be due to the onset of old-age or wear-out effects in the progressive deterioration of the needles with age. Use of crown level and year of observation as independent variables in addition to needle age did little to extend the explanatory power of our models. These results are consistent with the period analysis performed by Fleming and Piene (1992) on the same stands. Because of the large year-to-year variability in age-specific rates of needlefall, fits of the Weibull's discrete hazard function to individual cohorts usually left over half the variation in the rates unexplained. This contrasted with the period analysis in which the Weibull model explained over 80% of the variation each year. Hence, despite the success of the period analysis, the large year-to-year variability drastically restricts our ability to predict age-specific rates of needlefall. Although the Weibull model may describe future needle age distributions within a given year accurately, large fluctuations in parameter values, possibly reflecting weather-caused variations or long-term cycles and trends in needlefall, can be expected. 3aAbies balsamea 3aChoristoneura fumiferana 3aleaves 3amortality 3atree age 3alife tables 0agrowth 0aleaf fall 0aneedle age 0aage-specific mortality1 aPiene, H.0 tForest science.g1992 Aug., v. 38, no. 3 p.678-694x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02765naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245013200132300001600264500001500280520168800295650002101983650002102004650001702025650001402042650000902056650003202065653001902097653001402116653002502130700001402155700001902169773014902188852000902337930003302346945001302379946001102392655001202403IND2049259620221121035005.0951219e19941117ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204925962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristensen, M.S.10aLymphatic absorption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from marine oils with different intramolecular fatty acid distributions  ap. 198-204.  a2019-12-05  aor seal oil intragastrically. The intramolecular fatty acid distributions of the triacylglycerols administered were determined by non-specific Grignard degradation followed by isolation and analysis of the 2-mono acylglycerols. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5(n-3)) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6(n-3)), were located in outer positions (sn-1/3) in the seal oil triacylglycerols whereas the sn-2 position of fish oil triacylglycerols was enriched in 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3). The mesenteric lymph was collected over the following 24 h and the absorption patterns of n-3 PUFAs were determined. In the lymph, the n-3 fatty acids characteristic of the marine oils rapidly increased both with regard to mole percentage and transport (microgram/min). There were, however, no overall significant differences in the absorption patterns over a 24 h period. The ratio between mole percentage in the oil and mole percentage in the lymph calculated at the steady-state period was significantly greater for both 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) following fish oil administration compared with seal oil. Initially, the recover, of n-3 PUFAs as a percentage of the total amount transported over the experimental period was higher following injection of fish of than seal oil but seal oil resulted in greater recovery in the last two fractions at 8 and 24 h post injection, respectively. This indicated the n-3 PUFAs from fish oil may have been better absorbed in the initial period of digestion but overall the structure of dietary triacylglycerols had negligible effects on the assimilation of n-3 PUFAs when these were administered as native marine oils. 3alymphatic system 3atriacylglycerols 3achylomicrons 3afish oils 3arats 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0afat absorption 0aseal oils 0aanimal fats and oils1 aHoy, C.E.1 aRedgrave, T.G.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1994 Nov. 17, v. 1215, no. 1/2 p.198-204x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle03346naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001500161245008600176300001600262500002400278500001500302520146600317650003701783650002701820650000801847650001001855650001201865650001001877650001401887650001201901650001501913650002401928650002401952650001701976650001201993650002102005650002302026650001202049650002002061650001002081650002502091650002002116650004202136650001102178650001902189650001102208650002002219650000902239650005202248650001502300650001502315650001702330651002602347653002502373700001502398700001502413700001802428700002002446773011502466852000902581856008202590655001202672IND4464430120221121034818.0121109s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446443012DNAL7 a126295642pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08022422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrotto, I.10aRelation of parental history of coronary heart disease to obesity in young adults  ap. 362-368.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aOBJECTIVE: To assess the association between obesity and parental coronary heart disease (CHD) history. DESIGN: Analysis of data from an ongoing, large-scale survey on medical status, health behaviour and attitudes. SUBJECTS: Representative samples of Israeli military personnel upon discharge from compulsory service at age 20-22 y. Overall 14 297 men and 11 638 women were interviewed and examined upon release from military service between 1989 and 1999. MEASUREMENTS: Data on demographic characteristics, family history of CHD, lifestyle, weight and height were collected. Analysis of variance and logistic regression were used. RESULTS: Higher mean body mass index (BMI) and obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2) were associated with paternal CHD history in both sexes, and with maternal CHD history among men. Offspring of a parent with a positive CHD history had a higher mean BMI (23.22 vs 22.86 kg/m2, P<0.001) and were more likely to be obese (5.4 vs 3.7%, P<0.001) than offspring of parents with no history of CHD. Multivariate adjustment for demographic and behavioural variables associated with obesity attenuated the association (adjusted odds ratio for obesity 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.15, 1.64). When stratified by sex, this association remained statistically significant only among males. CONCLUSION: Young adults with a parental history of CHD are more likely to be overweight. This high-risk group should be targeted for early preventive activities. 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aattitudes and opinions 3amen 3awomen 3aparents 3amales 3alifestyle 3asurveys 3aodds ratio 3aconfidence interval 3aregression analysis 3ayoung adults 3aobesity 3acoronary disease 3amilitary personnel 3aprogeny 3abody mass index 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBody Mass Index 2aCoronary Diseasexetiologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aOdds Ratio 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 0aIsraelxepidemiology. 0aanalysis of variance1 aHuerta, M.1 aKark, J.D.1 aShpilberg, O.1 aMeyerovitch, J.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2003 Mar., v. 27, no. 3 p.362-368dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08022423Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01993naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002700163245005200190300001600242500002400258520081400282650002501096650001101121650001401132650001501146650001301161650002301174650002301197700001701220700001901237700002401256700002701280773011301307852000901420856008501429930003301514945002501547946001101572655001201583IND4415092320221121025218.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441509232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-008-9817-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aS2001 aZafar, Muhammad Nadeem10aRemoval of Nickel onto Alkali Treated Rice Bran  ap. 361-370.  aIncludes references  aDifferent bases were used for the pretreatment of Rice bran biomass. Pretreatment with bases such as NaOH, Ca(OH)₂ and Al(OH)₃ were found to improve biosorption capacity. But in Rice bran, treatment with 0.5 M NaOH increased its nickel selective adsorption ability very much. The main binding site of nickel in NaOH treated cells is assumed to be carboxylic, hydroxyl, sulphate, phosphate and amino groups. The maximum biosorption capacity of Rice bran biomass subjected to 0.5 M NaOH was 198.92 mg g⁻¹. Kinetic and isotherm experiments were carried out at the optimal pH 6.0 for nickel. The Freundlich and Langmuir models were used to describe the uptake of nickel on NaOH pretreated Rice bran. To improve the biosorption capacity for metal ions by biomass, alkali pretreatment is an effective method. 3awastewater treatment 3anickel 3arice bran 3aadsorbents 3asorption 3abinding properties 3asorption isotherms1 aAbbas, Imran1 aNadeem, Raziya1 aSheikh, Munir Ahmad1 aGhauri, Muhammad Afzal0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2009 Feb., v. 197, no. 1-4 p.361-370dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9817-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20090209b20090301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/02/09  aNon-US 7aarticle03265naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001900181245009600200300001800296500001500314506007600329520074500405506003701150650001101187650001101198650002301209650001401232650002201246650002501268650001901293650000801312650001101320650001201331650002501343650009501368650007801463650004401541650001101585650001101596650002801607650001401635650002401649651001401673651001801687651002901705653001901734653001901753653001901772653001901791653003501810653001901845653001901864653002801883653001901911653001901930653001901949653003001968653001901998653001402017653001902031653001902050653001902069700001702088700001802105700001502123700001602138773014202154852000902296856008302305930003302388945001302421946001302434655001202447IND2046681220221207134331.0950703e19950606dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204668122DNAL7 a77774972pmid7 aPMC416772pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.12.52782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRico-Hesse, R.10aEmergence of a new epidemic/epizootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus in South America  ap. 5278-5281.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOne of the most important questions in arbovirology concerns the origin of epidemic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) viruses; these viruses caused periodic, extensive epidemics/epizootics in the Americas from 1938-1973 (reaching the United States in 1971) but had recently been presumed extinct. We have documented the 1992 emergence of a new epidemic/epizootic VEE virus in Venezuela. Phylogenetic analysis of strains isolated during two outbreaks indicated that the new epidemic/epizootic virus(es) evolved recently from an enzootic VEE virus in northern South America. These results suggest continued emergence of epizootic VEE viruses; surveillance of enzootic viruses and routine vaccination of equines should therefore be resumed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahumans 3agenome 3astrain differences 3aphylogeny 3adisease outbreaks 3anucleotide sequences 3aviral antigens 3aRNA 3ahorses 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aEncephalitis Virus, Venezuelan Equinexclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aEncephalomyelitis, Venezuelan Equinexepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aHorse Diseasesxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aHorses 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSpecies Specificity 3aVenezuela 0aSouth America 0aVenezuelaxepidemiology. 0agenbank/l41238 0agenbank/l41232 0agenbank/l41239 0agenbank/l41234 0aequine encephalomyelitis virus 0agenbank/l41235 0agenbank/l41241 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l41240 0agenbank/l41233 0agenbank/l41231 0aserological relationships 0agenbank/l41242 0aisolation 0agenbank/l41237 0agenbank/l41236 0agenbank/l412431 aWeaver, S.C.1 aSiger, J. de.1 aMedina, G.1 aSalas, R.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 June 6, v. 92, no. 12 p.5278-5281x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.12.52783Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03202naa a2200829 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245005100150300001600201500001500217520104600232650001801278650002001296650001701316650000901333650002401342650002401366650002001390650001901410650001001429650001001439650002001449650001701469650001401486650002001500650001101520650000801531650002901539650001601568650001201584650002201596650001601618650002401634650002301658650002501681650000901706650001001715650001601725650001601741650002901757650003001786650004601816650001301862650001101875650002201886650001101908650000901919650002501928650000901953650002301962650004001985650001102025650001702036650003902053651001902092651001802111653000902129700001602138700001602154700001702170773009702187852001302284939003302297945000802330946001302338852000902351655001202360991615305440742620221121025250.0920923e199209  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI920030482DNAL7 a15030722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFehily, A.M.10aFactors affecting bone density in young adults  ap. 579-586.  a2019-12-04  aA 14-y follow-up of 581 children who took part in a randomized controlled trial of the effect of a milk supplement on growth of children was conducted to investigate the supplement's effect on adult bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD). BMC and BMD of the nondominant forearm were measured by single-photon absorptiometry in 371 subjects (64%) aged 20-23 y, at a proximal site (shaft of radius and ulna) and at a distal site near the wrist. BMCs and BMDs tended to be higher in the intervention group (NS). Cross-sectionally, BMD was positively associated with body weight (P < 0.01) in both sexes; inversely associated with alcohol consumption (P < 0.05), and positively with manual occupation (NS) in men; positively associated with current intakes of calcium (P < 0.05), vitamin D (P < 0.01). and sports activity during adolescence (P < 0.01), and inversely with parity (NS) in women. In multiple linear-regression analysis body weight and sports activity during adolescence were stronger determinants of female BMD than was diet. 3aenergy intake 3aschool children 3abone density 3amilk 3abone mineralization 3adietary supplements 3anutrient intake 3abreast feeding 3agirls 3awomen 3asmoking (habit) 3ayoung adults 3avitamin D 3amineral content 3asports 3amen 3anutritional intervention 3abody weight 3acalcium 3aphysical activity 3aoccupations 3aalcoholic beverages 3agender differences 3alongitudinal studies 3aboys 2aAdult 2aBody Height 2aBody Weight 2aBone Densityxphysiology 2aBone and Bonesxchemistry 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aExercise 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMenarchexphysiology 2aMilk 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aNutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aParity 2aSocial Class 2aVitamin Dxadministration & dosage 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain 0adiet1 aColes, R.J.1 aEvans, W.D.1 aElwood, P.C.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Sept., v. 56, no. 3 p.579-586x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010800128300001400236500001500250520120800265650002101473650001801494650001501512650002201527650002801549650001701577653001401594653003401608653002501642653001701667653001701684700002001701700002001721700001801741773014601759852000901905930003301914945001301947946001101960655001201971IND2049351120221121025346.0951228e19941101ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204935112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiedler, H.R.10aProton gradient-induced changes in the interaction between CF0 and CF1 as probed by cleavage with NaSCN  ap. 29-34.  a2019-12-05  aTreatment of isolated thylakoids from spinach chloroplasts with the chaotropic salt NaSCN results in release of CF1 together with a variety of other proteins. The detachment of the CF1 polypeptides by 0.5 M NaSCN was much higher in illuminated than in non-illuminated samples. The CF1 subunits are released at about the same molar ratio as in the entire complex, suggesting that NaSCN cleaves primarily between CF0 and CF1. However, subsequent dissociation of CF1 into smaller aggregates or individual subunits may occur. Detachment of CF1 from pea thylakoids requires somewhat higher NaSCN concentrations, but a distinct light/dark difference is nevertheless found. The enhancement of CF1 solubilization by light is largely abolished by the uncoupler nigericin, suggesting that the proton gradient affects the interaction between CF0 and CF1. The enhanced release is also reduced by the CF0 blocker DCCD, indicating that the translocation of protons through CF0 is necessary. The enhancement is partially abolished by the substrates of phosphorylation, ADP and phosphate, suggesting that the change of interaction between the subcomplexes is connected with the process of energy transduction in CF0CF1. 3aprotein subunits 3ahydrogen ions 3athylakoids 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3athiocyanates 0amembranes 0atransmembrane proton gradient 0asubunit interactions 0ainteractions 0achloroplasts1 aPonomarenko, S.1 aGehlen, N. von.1 aStrotmann, H.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1994 Nov. 1, v. 1188, no. 1/2 p.29-34x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02633naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245009300123300001600216520149700232650001201729650002101741650001501762650001801777650002401795650003601819650002001855650001901875650001201894653001501906653001601921653001301937700001401950700001401964700001601978700001501994773014802009852000902157930003302166945001302199946001102212655001202223IND2049346620221121025327.0951228e19950921ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204934662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKo, F.N.10aInhibition of platelet activation by shikonin derivatives isolated from Arnebia euchroma  ap. 329-334.  aAcetylshikonin, teracrylshikonin, beta,beta-dimethylacrylshikonin and shikonin, isolated from Arnebia euchroma, inhibited collagen (10 micrograms/ml)-induced aggregation of washed rabbit platelets in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 2.1 +/- 0.2, 2.8 +/- 0.3, 4.2 +/- 0.5 and 10.7 +/- 0.7 micromolars, respectively. Acetylshikonin also inhibited the aggregation and ATP release of washed rabbit platelets induced by arachidonic acid (AA, 100 micromolars), U46619 (1 micromolar), platelet-activating factor (PAF, 3.6 nM) and thrombin (0.1 U/ml) in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 values of acetylshikonin on the inhibition of these four agonists-induced platelet aggregation were 3.1 +/- 0.4, 2.2 +/- 0.2, 8.0 +/- 0.6 and 12.7 +/- 1.0 micromolars, respectively. The thromboxane B2 formation caused by collagen, PAF and thrombin was inhibited by acetylshikonin, while formations of thromboxane B2 and prostaglandin D2 caused by AA were not inhibited. Acetylshikonin did not inhibit cyclooxygenase activity since it did not attenuate prostaglandin E2 formation after incubation of sheep vesicular gland microsomes with AA. Acetylshikonin suppressed both the rise of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and the generation of [3H]inositol monophosphate caused by these five aggregation inducers. Platelet cyclic AMP level was unaffected by acetylshikonin. These data indicate that acetylshikonin inhibits platelet activation by suppression of phosphoinositide breakdown. 3aArnebia 3amedicinal plants 3acyclic AMP 3aphospholipids 3ainositol phosphates 3achemical constituents of plants 3ablood platelets 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 0ainhibition 0aderivatives 0aalkanium1 aLee, Y.S.1 aKuo, S.C.1 aChang, Y.S.1 aTeng, C.M.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1995 Sept. 21, v. 1268, no. 3 p.329-334x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19960202b19960208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02331naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245012900129300001600258520135300274650001101627650002601638650002001664650001901684650002101703650002301724650001101747650002401758650002401782650001701806650002001823653001101843773007201854852000901926939003301935946001301968655001201981IND9205519220221121015100.0920910e199208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920551922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRehfeldt, G.E.10aEarly selection in Pinus ponderosa: compromises between growth potential and growth rhythm in developing breeding strategies  ap. 661-677.  aShoot elongation of seedlings from 13 wind-pollinated families in each of 3 natural populations was described in years 2 and 5 by a function that allowed calculation of the start, rate, duration, and cessation of elongation. Additive genetic variances for these variables and for height in year 5 were pronounced, heritabilities were high, and expected responses to selection were large. The age-age genetic correlation for each trait was strong, as were the genetic correlations for 5-year height with all traits except the start of shoot elongation. Expected responses to selection suggested that (1) genetic gains in growth can be pronounced; (2) strong selection for increased growth is accompanied by a change in growth rhythm to that typical of unselected populations from much milder environments; (3) selecting for the rate of shoot elongation tends to control the correlated responses in growth rhythm while providing about 70% of gains expected from direct selection on height; and (4) selecting in the greenhouse in year 2 is nearly as effective as selecting the field in year 5. While breeders might choose among strategies that either control correlated responses or optimize gains in growth potential, developing a program that is capable of realizing the expected gains requires an understanding of the system of genetic variability. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aPinus ponderosa 3aplant breeding 3agenetic variance 3agenetic covariance 3ashoots 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic correlation 3aheritability 3aearly selection 0agrowth0 tForest science.g1992 Aug., v. 38, no. 3 p.661-677x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03346naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147072000900156100001600165245008700181300001600268500002400284520161600308650001701924650001901941650002501960650002301985650002602008650002402034650001202058650002902070650001102099650004102110650000902151650003402160650005802194650004002252650002402292651001202316651001402328700001702342700001402359700001602373700001902389700001302408700002302421700001902444773012002463852000902583856009302592930003302685945002502718946001302743655001202756IND4367714320221121025256.0050316e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436771432DNAL7 a152602252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK001 0aL600 0aL0011 aFrancke, W.10aNew type of Sesiidae sex pheromone identified from the hornet moth Sesia apiformis  ap. 805-817.  aIncludes references  aTwo components of the female-produced sex pheromone of the hornet moth, Sesia apiformis, were identified as (3Z,13Z)-octadeca-3,13-dien-1-ol (3Z,13Z-18:OH) and (2E,13Z)-octadeca-2,13-dienal (2E,13Z-18:Al), a pheromone structure new in Sesiidae. Pooled gland extracts showed the two major compounds in a proportion of ca. 2:3, while SPME-investigations on single calling females revealed a ratio of ca. 1:7. Although the single compounds were not attractive, a 2:3 mixture proved to be highly active towards males in field tests. Small amounts of (2E,13Z)-octadecadienol (2E,13Z-18:OH) were found in the sex pheromone gland of females, however, the biological significance of the compound remains unclear. Methyl sulfide was found to readily react with 2-alkenals, providing an effective new method for the characterization of this type of compound upon GC/MS. The derivatives, 1,1,3-tris(methylthio)alkanes, are the products of the addition of methyl sulfide to the double bond and the transformation of the carbonyl group into the corresponding bis(methylthio)acetal. The mass spectra of these compounds are characterized by diagnostic signals at m/z 107 and/or m/z 121. These fragments represent the first carbon unit or the first two carbon units of the derivative, respectively. The parent signal in the spectra of thiomethyl derivatives of 2-alkenals showing no other double bonds is represented by m/z M(+) - 121, formed upon loss of the first two carbon units. By employing a solution of methyl sulfide in dimethyl sulfide, the double bond positions in 2E,13Z-18:Al could be fully characterized by GC/MS. 3ainsect pests 3asex pheromones 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3afield experimentation 2aAldehydesxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aFatty Alcoholsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMale 2aMothsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aSex Attractantsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 0aDenmark 0aLithuania1 aKaralius, V.1 aPlass, E.1 aLehmann, L.1 aSantos, A. dos1 aBuda, V.1 aBorg-Karlson, A.K.1 aMozuraitis, R.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2004 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.805-817dKluwer Academic/Plenum Publishersx0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0098-0331/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle03695naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001200181245011400193300001800307500001500325506007600340520137800416506003701794650001201831650002201843650001301865650002501878650002601903650002301929650002501952650001401977650002801991650002802019650002402047650001202071650006102083650002302144650002302167650002402190650005102214650001802265650006602283650002802349650007402377650003102451650002402482650003402506650006102540653001902601653002102620653002802641653001902669653001902688700002102707773014202728852000902870856008302879930003302962945001302995946001303008655001203021IND2046681920221207133021.0950703e19950606dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204668192DNAL7 a77775182pmid7 aPMC417012pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.12.53962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, B.10aTwo Drosophila nervous system antigens, Nervana 1 and 2, are homologous to the beta subunit of Na+, K+-ATPase  ap. 5396-5400.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA nervous system-specific glycoprotein antigen from adult Drosophila heads, designated Nervana (Nrv), has been purified on the basis of reactivity of its carbohydrate epitope(s) with anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies that are specific markers for Drosophila neurons. Anti-Nrv monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), specific for the protein moiety of Nrv, were used to screen a Drosophila embryo cDNA expression library. Three cDNA clones (designated Nrv1, Nrv2.1, and Nrv2.2) were isolated that code for proteins recognized by anti-Nrv mAbs on Western blots. DNA sequencing and Southern blot analyses established that the cDNA clones are derived from two different genes. In situ hybridization to Drosophila polytene chromosomes showed that the cDNA clones map to the third chromosome near 92C-D. Nrv1 and Nrv2.1/2.2 have open reading frames of 309 and 322/323 amino acids, respectively, and they are 43.4% identical at the amino acid level. The proteins deduced from these clones exhibit significant homology in both primary sequence and predicted topology to the beta subunit of Na+, K+-ATPase. Immunoaffinity-purified Nrv is associated with a protein (Mr 100,000) recognized on Western blots by anti-ATPase alpha-subunit mAb. Our results suggest that the Drosophila nervous system specific antigens Nrv1 and -2 are neuronal forms of the beta subunit of Na+, K+-ATPase.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aneurons 3acomplementary DNA 3aantigens 3aamino acid sequences 3amonoclonal antibodies 3achromosome mapping 3anucleotide sequences 3ascreening 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntigensxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsximmunology. 2aGenes, Insect 2aGlycoproteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aNervous Systemximmunology 2aNeuronsximmunology 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPasexchemistryxgenetics. 0agenbank/u22440 0apyrophosphatases 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u22438 0agenbank/u224391 aSalvaterra, P.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 June 6, v. 92, no. 12 p.5396-5400x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.12.53963Available from publisher's Web site  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03222naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001900154245010200173300001800275500002400293520152600317650002701843650002601870650002201896650001101918650001001929650001501939650002601954650001301980650001401993650001802007650001202025650001202037650001002049650003002059650001302089650001402102650001002116650001202126650002302138650002302161650002102184650002602205650001802231650001302249650003102262650003902293650002202332650003202354700001702386700002002403773012502423852000902548856007502557655001202632IND4460187520221119170048.0110721s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446018752DNAL7 a217359312pmid7 a10.1603/EC102782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPompon, Julien10aResistance Level to an Aphid Potato Pest Varies between Genotypes from the Same Solanum Accession  ap. 1075-1079.  aIncludes references  aPlant resistance to aphids can be improved by introgressing resistant traits from wild Solanum species into the potato germplasm. Breeding parents are commonly selected from the different accessions of each species. Accessions originate from several seeds collected in a restricted area and are conserved as seeds in genebanks. Genetic heterogeneity may be expected between genotypes from the same accession and could influence resistance level. Working with the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas), and the accession PI243340 of Solanum chomatophilum (Bitter), which has been previously rated as resistant to M. euphorbiae, we genetically identified and assessed the resistance level of genotypes within the accession. A combination of two multilplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) discriminated the 13 plant genotypes assessed. Survival of M. euphorbiae, measured using clip cages, varied significantly between five genotypes, randomly selected among the 13 previously assessed, but did not differ between same-genotype plants. Survival among genotypes ranged from 0 to >60% 12 d after adult molt, and the least resistant genotype exhibited survival close to the susceptible standard, Solanum tuberosum L. Our results support the use of PCR multiplex methods to assess genetic heterogeneity in wild Solanum, and suggest that within accession genetic heterogeneity is sufficient to influence resistance level to aphids. Fine screening at the genotype level is preferable when assessing resistance to aphids. 3aMacrosiphum euphorbiae 3aSolanum chomatophilum 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aadults 3acages 3agene banks 3agenetic heterogeneity 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aintrogression 3amolting 3aparents 3apests 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotatoes 3ascreening 3aseeds 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aFeeding Behavior 2aGenetic Heterogeneity 2aGenome, Plant 2aGenotype 2aPlant Diseasesximmunology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aSolanumxgenetics 2aSolanum tuberosumxgenetics1 aLi, Xiu-Qing1 aPelletier, Yvan0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2011 June, v. 104, no. 3 p.1075-1079dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC102783Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02340naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245009900164300001400263520109700277592002801374650002301402650002901425650001301454650001901467650001201486650001901498650002101517650001301538650001501551650002801566650001501594650003301609650003401642700002401676700003101700773012701731856007501858852000901933655001201942IND60536801220180718000000.0160807e20140114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053680122DNAL7 a10.1021/ez40013562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerreault, François10aThin-Film Composite Polyamide Membranes Functionalized with Biocidal Graphene Oxide Nanosheets  ap. 71-76.  aFouling of membranes by microorganisms is a major limiting factor in membrane separation processes. Novel strategies are therefore required to decrease the extent of bacterial growth on membranes. In this study, we confer strong antimicrobial properties to thin-film composite polyamide membranes by a simple graphene oxide surface functionalization. Using amide coupling between carboxyl groups of graphene oxide and carboxyl groups of the polyamide active layer, graphene oxide is irreversibly bound to the membrane. Surface binding of graphene oxide is demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Direct contact of bacteria with functionalized graphene oxide on the membrane surface results in 65% bacterial inactivation after 1 h of contact time. This bactericidal effect is imparted to the membrane without any detrimental effect to the intrinsic membrane transport properties. Our results suggest that functionalization of thin-film composite membranes with graphene oxide nanosheets is a promising approach for the development of novel antimicrobial membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3adirect contact 3afouling 3agraphene oxide 3amicrobial growth 3amoieties 3ananosheets 3aphysiological transport 3apolyamides 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athin film composite membranes1 aTousley, Marissa E.1 aElimelech, M.q(Menachem),0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology Letters.g2014 Jan. 14, v. 1, no. 1 p.71-76dAmerican Chemical Societyx2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fez40013563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010100169300001600270520130800286592002801594650002501622650002101647650001601668650001501684650001001699650002501709650001901734650001101753650001501764650002101779650001001800650001701810650001301827653003001840653003101870653003301901653003201934653003501966700001802001700001802019700001702037773009802054856008702152852000902239655001202248IND60563961920221117013159.0180830e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056396192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWetser, Koen10aElectricity from wetlands: Tubular plant microbial fuels with silicone gas-diffusion biocathodes  ap. 642-649.  aApplication of the plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC) in wetlands should be invisible without excavation of the soil. The preferred design is a tubular design with the anode directly between the plant roots and an oxygen reducing biocathode inside the tube. Oxygen should be passively supplied to the cathode via a gas diffusion layer. In this research silicone was successfully used as gas diffusion layer. The objective of this research is to start-up an oxygen reducing biocathode in situ in a tubular PMFC applied in a Phragmites australis peat soil and a Spartina anglica salt marsh. PMFCs with a biocathode were successfully started in the peat soil. Oxygen reduction is clearly catalysed, likely by microorganisms in the cathodes, as the overpotential decreased resulting in an increased current density and cathode potential. The maximum daily average power generation of the best peat soil PMFC was 22mWm⁻². PMFCs with a biocathode in the salt marsh only started with pure oxygen diffusion reaching a maximum daily average power generation of 82mWm⁻². Both wetland PMFCs were successfully started with natural occurring microorganism in the anode and cathode. Calculations show that the power density can be increased by improving the PMFC design limiting crossover of oxygen and substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aSpartina anglica 3aelectricity 3aelectrodes 3afuels 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amicroorganisms 3aoxygen 3apeat soils 3apower generation 3aroots 3asalt marshes 3asilicone 0aPlant microbial fuel cell 0aOxygen reducing biocathode 0aSilicone gas diffusion layer 0aSpartina anglica salt marsh 0aPhragmites australis peat soil1 aDieleman, Kim1 aBuisman, Cees1 aStrik, David0 tApplied energy.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 185 p.642-649dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008400158500001900242520169700261592002801958650002001986650001702006650001502023650001402038650001302052650001002065650001602075650001302091700001902104700002002123773012802143856007402271852000902345655001202354IND60737133020221122052308.0210514e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073713302DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130916252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDan, Zesheng 10aRobust Multipath-Assisted SLAM with Unknown Process Noise and Clutter Intensity  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn multipath-assisted simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), the geometric association of specular multipath components based on radio signals with environmental features is used to simultaneously localize user equipment and map the environment. We must contend with two notable model parameter uncertainties in multipath-assisted SLAM: process noise and clutter intensity. Knowledge of these two parameters is critically important to multipath-assisted SLAM, the uncertainty of which will seriously affect the SLAM accuracy. Conventional multipath-assisted SLAM algorithms generally regard these model parameters as fixed and known, which cannot meet the challenges presented in complicated environments. We address this challenge by improving the belief propagation (BP)-based SLAM algorithm and proposing a robust multipath-assisted SLAM algorithm that can accommodate model mismatch in process noise and clutter intensity. Specifically, we describe the evolution of the process noise variance and clutter intensity via Markov chain models and integrate them into the factor graph representing the Bayesian model of the multipath-assisted SLAM. Then, the BP message passing algorithm is leveraged to calculate the marginal posterior distributions of the user equipment, environmental features and unknown model parameters to achieve the goals of simultaneous localization and mapping, as well as adaptively learning the process noise variance and clutter intensity. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust against the uncertainty of the process noise and clutter intensity and shows excellent performances in challenging indoor environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3aequipment 3ageometry 3aradio 3auncertainty 3avariance1 aLian, Baowang 1 aTang, Chengkai 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Apr. 21, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130916253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245009700204300001600301520145900317592002801776650000901804650000901813650001601822650001701838650002801855650000901883650001601892650001901908650001401927650001801941650001401959650002601973650001001999650003102009650001002040650001502050650001802065650002302083650001102106650001202117651001202129653000802141653000702149653000802156653000902164653000702173653000702180653000702187653000802194653000902202653000902211653000902220653000902229653000702238653000702245653000802252653001602260653002302276653001402299653001802313653002402331653000902355653001402364653001102378653001102389700001502400700002102415700007102436773011202507856008402619852000902703655001202712IND60625447120221119063916.0190318e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062544712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2018.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6956-972710aSeasonal changes in cold hardiness and carbohydrate metabolism in four garden rose cultivars  ap. 188-199.  aWe studied metabolic adaptations to cold stress in roses and identified genes in the carbohydrate pathway during acclimation and deacclimation. A field experiment with four rose cultivars belonging to different USDA plant hardiness zones was set up in Melle, Belgium (51° 0′ N, 3° 48′ E). The more cold-hardy cultivars (‘Dagmar Hastrup’ and ‘John Cabot’) reached their lowest LT50 value in December, indicating a rapid acclimation after the first occurrence of frost. Less cold-hardy cultivars (‘Abraham Darby’ and ‘Chandos Beauty’) reached their lowest LT50 in January/February when exposed to prolonged freezing temperatures. A cell dehydration pattern was found in the less cold-hardy cultivars ‘Abraham Darby’ and ‘Chandos Beauty’. The expression of dehydrins (RhDHN5 and RhDNH6) was up-regulated during November-January. Carbohydrate metabolism is highly involved in cold acclimation in roses. Starch decreased from November towards January in all four cultivars and the hydrolysis of starch by the β-amylolytic pathway (BAM, DPE2) was identified in ‘Dagmar Hastrup’ from November to January. Oligosaccharides correlated with cold hardiness in three cultivars although no significant upregulation in RhMIPS and RhRS6, key genes in their biosynthesis, was found. Higher sucrose levels were found during acclimation in hardy cultivars, although transcript levels of RhINV2 was more prominent in ‘Chandos Beauty’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa 3aUSDA 3aacclimation 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acold 3acold stress 3acold tolerance 3acultivars 3adeacclimation 3adehydrins 3afield experimentation 3afrost 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3amessenger RNA 3aseasonal variation 3astarch 3asucrose 3aBelgium 0aBAM 0aDA 0aDHN 0aDPE2 0aEL 0aGK 0aIt 0aINV 0aLT50 0aMIPS 0aUSDA 0aRFOs 0aRh 0aRS 0aSUS 0aAcclimation 0aFreezing tolerance 0aDehydrins 0aWater content 0aElectrolyte leakage 0aLT50 0aRaffinose 0aStarch 0aSugars1 aLeus, Leen1 aDe Keyser, Ellen1 aVan Labeke, Marie-Christine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4766-89190 tJournal of plant physiology.g2019 Jan., v. 232 p.188-199dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006000171500001900231520145000250592002801700650001101728650002501739650001301764650001501777650001501792650001901807650000901826650001301835650001801848650001501866651001101881700001901892700001801911700002101929773012601950856008302076852000902159655001202168IND60721601520221122224901.0201224e20201211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072160152DNAL7 a10.3390/environments71201082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhrair, Ayoup  M.10aWaste Wash-Water Recycling in Ready Mix Concrete Plants  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe management of waste wash-water (WWW) is one of the most significant environmental problems associated with ready-mix concrete production worldwide. The problems are exacerbated should it be disposed of in an inappropriate manner. This study evaluated the potential of WWW recycling in ready mix concrete plants in Jordan. A representative waste wash-water sample (400 L) was collected from a basin in a ready-mix concrete company. A pilot plant on the lab scale was fabricated and installed. The treatment system consisted of a concrete washout reclaimer, wedgebed slurry settling pond, slow sand filtration unit, and a neutralization unit. Water samples were collected from all stages of the pilot plant and analyzed. The collected waste wash-water samples were utilized for replacement of well water (mixing water) at various ratios. Fourteen concrete mixtures were produced and cast, as well as tested at various curing ages (7, 28, and 90 days). The results show that the raw WWW was not acceptable as mixing water even after dilution as it led to significant reductions in concrete compressive strength and low workability. However, the WWW from the settling pond, the filtered WWW and the filtered-neutralized WWW at dilution ratios up to 75% were shown to be potential alternatives to fresh water for ready-mixed concrete. Therefore, the current guidelines for mixing water quality should be revised to encourage the reuse of the WWW.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3afiltration 3afreshwater 3aneutralization 3asand 3aslurries 3awater quality 3awell water 3aJordan1 aHeath, Andrew 1 aPaine, Kevin 1 aAl Kronz, Muath 0 tEnvironments.g2020 Dec. 11, v. 7, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27132x2076-32987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/environments71201083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002700181245012700208506007600335520146900411592002801880506003701908650001401945650002501959650000901984650001301993650002802006650002902034650001802063650001102081650001002092650002102102650001502123650001302138650001402151650001802165650002402183650001802207650001302225650001202238700002302250700002302273700002102296700002102317773012202338856007402460852000902534655001202543IND60650737820221207112750.0190710e20190321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065073782DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110306752doi7 aPMC64721952pmcid7 a309018622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGodrich, Stephanie  L.10aCanadian Children from Food Insecure Households Experience Low Self-Esteem and Self-Efficacy for Healthy Lifestyle Choices  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe objectives of this cross-sectional study were to: (i) determine whether there are differences in self-esteem and self-efficacy for healthy lifestyle choices between children living in food secure and food insecure households; and (ii) determine whether the association between household food insecurity (HFI), self-esteem and self-efficacy differs by gender. Survey responses of 5281 fifth-grade students (10 and 11 years of age) participating in the Canadian Children&rsquo;s Lifestyle and School Performance Study II were analyzed using logistic and linear regression. HFI status was determined by the six-item short-form Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM). Students from food insecure households had significantly higher odds of low self-esteem, and significantly lower scores for global self-efficacy to make healthy choices, compared to students from food secure households. These associations were stronger for girls than for boys and appeared independent of parental educational attainment. Household income appeared to be the essential underlying determinant of the associations of food insecurity with self-esteem and self-efficacy. Upstream social policies such as improving the household income of low-income residents will reduce food insecurity and potentially improve self-esteem and self-efficacy for healthy choices among children. This may improve health and learning, and in the long term, job opportunities and household earnings.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCanadians 3aacademic achievement 3aboys 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3aemployment opportunities 3afood security 3agender 3agirls 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3alearning 3alifestyle 3apublic policy 3aregression analysis 3aself-efficacy 3astudents 3asurveys1 aLoewen, Olivia  K.1 aBlanchet, Rosanne 1 aWillows, Noreen 1 aVeugelers, Paul 0 tNutrients.g2019 Mar. 21, v. 11, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110306753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010000168300001300268520194900281592002802230650002202258650002802280650001902308650002602327650002302353650001202376650002402388650001402412650000902426650002402435651001202459653002002471653001602491653001202507700001502519773009502534856008502629852000902714655001202723IND60593430220221117161107.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059343022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2016.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBittner, R.J.10aEfficacy and timing of application of oxathiapiprolin against black shank of flue-cured tobacco  ap. 9-18.  aPhytophthora nicotianae, the causal agent of black shank, is one of the most important soilborne pathogens of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The use of soil applied fungicides has been a significant component of effective black shank management for tobacco growers. Oxathiapiprolin is a new fungicide with a novel mode of action that has shown efficacy against many oomycetes, including P. nicotianae. Studies were conducted in 2012 in fields naturally infested with P. nicotianae to determine the efficacy of different rates, methods, and timing of applications of oxathiapiprolin against black shank. Field trials were conducted in 2013 and 2014 to examine the efficacy of alternating applications of oxathiapiprolin and mefenoxam against black shank. Fungicide treatments were applied to the soil on the day of transplanting tobacco to the field, on the day of first cultivation (14–25 days after transplant), and during last cultivation (46–65 days after transplant). A single application of oxathiapiprolin in the transplant water at 0.07, 0.14, or 0.28 kg a.i./ha significantly decreased area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) compared to the non-treated control in the 2012 field trials. In addition, treatments with three applications of oxathiapiprolin at all tested rates significantly reduced AUDPC compared to non-treated control. In field trials from 2013 and 2014, alternating applications of oxathiapiprolin at transplant, mefenoxam at first cultivation, and oxathiapiprolin at last cultivation significantly lowered AUDPC compared to the non-treated control. In contrast, the AUDPC after three applications of mefenoxam at transplant, first cultivation, and last cultivation did not differ significantly from the non-treated control. Overall, our results indicate that soil-directed applications of oxathiapiprolin, alone or in alternation with mefenoxam are efficacious for the reduction of black shank of tobacco.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aPhytophthora nicotianae 3adisease course 3afield experimentation 3aflue-cured tobacco 3agrowers 3amechanism of action 3amefenoxam 3asoil 3asoil-borne diseases 3aOntario 0aOxathiapiprolin 0aBlack shank 0aTobacco1 aMila, A.L.0 tCrop protection.g2017 Mar., v. 93 p.9-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2016.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01236naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012500157300001800282520019500300592002800495650002300523650001800546650001900564650002100583650001300604650002000617700001600637700002000653700002000673773013300693856007500826852000900901655001200910IND60658809820221120160256.0190826e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065880982DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03581e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawlak, Anna10aSimultaneous molecular imaging based on electron paramagnetic resonance of ¹⁴N- and ¹⁵N-labelled nitroxyl radicals  ap. 3245-3247.  aThe major advancement outlined in this communication is the simultaneous visualisation of two kinds of nitroxyl radicals using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3afree radicals 3aimage analysis 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3astable isotopes1 aIto, Ryohei1 aFujii, Hirotada1 aHirata, Hiroshi0 tChemical communications.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 47, no. 11 p.3245-3247dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc03581e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013000169300001800299520130500317592002801622650001201650650001201662650001601674650001601690650002401706650002201730650001701752650001501769653000901784653002501793653001701818653002301835653000801858653001601866700002001882773011901902856008602021852000902107655001202116IND60788966420221120040525.0220818e20220822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078896642DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2021.18863382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammad, Pir10aSpatial variation of surface urban heat island magnitude along the urban-rural gradient of four rapidly growing Indian cities  ap. 4269-4291.  aThe unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization of Indian cities has put them under different ecological and environmental threats. Urban heat island (UHI) is one such critical ecological hazard, whereby an urban area is experiencing higher land surface temperature (LST) as compared to the surrounding rural area. In the present study, the relationship of LST and surface urban heat island (SUHI) with the degree of impervious surface (IS) and green spaces (GS) in four rapidly growing Indian cities is presented. This study utilizes different geospatial techniques, including urban-rural gradient analysis, surface urban heat island estimation using Landsat OLI/TIRS data. The results signify a strong negative correlation of LST with the IS for Ahmedabad, Jodhpur, and Nagpur, while a positive correlation is seen over Guwahati. The negative correlation is the manifestation of the urban cool island, pertaining to higher LST over rural areas. On the other hand, Guwahati is surrounded by green vegetation, which provides natural cooling and thus lowers the LST, resulting in positive SUHI. The density of GS is found to be a significant contributor of SUHI in Guwahati city, whereas in the other three cities, its impact is insignificant due to its presence in very less amount in rural surroundings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acooling 3aheat island 3arural areas 3asurface temperature 3aurban cool island 3aurbanization 3avegetation 0aSUHI 0aurban-rural gradient 0aLandsat data 0aimpervious surface 0aLST 0agreen space1 aGoswami, Ajanta0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Aug. 22, v. 37, no. 15 p.4269-4291dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.18863383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010300165300001800268520151900286592002801805650001901833650001701852650002801869650000901897650001501906650002101921650002201942650001501964650001301979650002601992653004002018653002202058653001502080653003802095700001702133700001502150700001302165700001402178773013002192856008502322852000902407655001202416IND60570788220221117235406.0170709e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057078822DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b010192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Yuqun10aUnanticipated Strong Blue Photoluminescence from Fully Biobased Aliphatic Hyperbranched Polyesters  ap. 6139-6147.  aNonconventional fluorescent polymers without π-aromatic structure have attracted extensive interest in recent years.

Herein, we synthesized a series of fully biobased aliphatic hyperbranched polyesters via a one-pot A₂ + B₃ esterification reaction. Intriguingly, the resultant hyperbranched polyesters carrying no conventional fluorescent units exhibited unexpected bright blue fluorescence under 365 nm UV light. It was found that the fluorescence intensity was enhanced with increasing solution concentrations and molecular weights of the polyesters. Moreover, the results suggested that the luminescence of polyesters could be controlled by solvents and metal ions. In particular, the fluorescence of the polyesters was extremely sensitive to Fe³⁺. More interesting is that the fluorescence of the polyesters showed an aggregation-induced enhanced emission in the mixture system. Notably, the resulting polyesters displayed a remarkably enhanced quantum yield (16.75%) as compared with that of other types of these polymers. Preliminary results demonstrate that clustering of the carbonyl groups is responsible for the unusual fluorescence in the aliphatic hyperbranched polyesters, namely, clustering-induced emission (CIE). This study provides a novel perspective for the design of biobased luminescent materials to new application areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aesterification 3afluorescence 3aindustrial applications 3airon 3ametal ions 3amolecular weight 3aphotoluminescence 3apolyesters 3asolvents 3aultraviolet radiation 0aFluorescent hyperbranched polyester 0aBiomass materials 0aBlue light 0aClustering-induced emission (CIE)1 aYan, Hongxia1 aHuang, Wei1 aChai, Fu1 aNiu, Song0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2017 July 03, v. 5, no. 7 p.6139-6147dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b010193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03628naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100002000172245016200192300001600354520180800370592002802178650002002206650002702226650001102253650001102264650001702275650003302292650002402325650002202349650000902371650001902380650001302399650001102412650000902423650005502432650003702487650001102524651001002535651001002545653002702555653001602582653001102598653002302609653002102632653002002653700002602673700003302699700003302732700003202765700002302797700002002820773010202840856008702942852000903029655001203038IND50063627020221117010508.0160902e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006362702DNAL7 a234546972pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo, Sonia10aContribution of mine wastes to atmospheric metal deposition in the surrounding area of an abandoned heavily polluted mining district (Rio Tinto mines, Spain)  ap. 363-372.  aThe present study seeks to estimate the impact of abandoned mine wastes on the levels and chemical profile of total atmospheric deposition in one of the oldest and largest mining districts in Europe (Rio Tinto mines, Iberian Pyrite Belt), on the basis of a complete geochemical characterization of particulate matter samples periodically collected in five sampling stations located around the mining district between March 2009 and February 2011.The annual levels of total bulk deposition (soluble and insoluble fractions) registered in the Rio Tinto Mining District ranged between 18 and 43g/m2 depending on the distance from the sampling station with regard to the mine waste deposits. As a general pattern in the area, high mass levels of Zn and Cu were deposited in a range of 9–62mg/m2 not only in the insoluble but also in the soluble fraction. Other potentially toxic trace elements such as As, Sb, Ba, Pb, Sn and Bi showed greater deposition fluxes in the locations closest to the mine waste deposits.A principal component analysis with a Multilinear Regression Analysis certifies the presence of two common sources in the mining area: 1) a mineral factor composed mainly of elements derived from silicate minerals (Al, Ca, Sr, Ti, Li, Mg, Mn, K, Na and Fe), mixed with other anthropogenic species (NH4+, SO42−, NO3−) within the village closest to the mine; and 2) a marine factor composed of Na, Cl, Mg, SO42− and Sr. In addition, a mine waste factor made up of toxic elements (Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Sb, Ba, Pb, Sn, Cd and Bi) has been recognized in the sampling sites exposed to dust-bearing winds downwind of the mining area, suggesting that mine wastes are a relevant source of heavy-mineral particles with potentially adverse environmental effects to surrounding soils, plants and humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aatmospheric deposition 3ahumans 3amining 3aparticulates 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3asilicate minerals 3asoil 3atrace elements 3avillages 3awastes 3awind 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxisolation & purification 2aMetalsxisolation & purification 2aMining 3aSpain 0aSpain 0aAtmospheric deposition 0aMine wastes 0aMetals 0aInsoluble fraction 0aSoluble fraction 0aRio Tinto mines1 ade la Rosa, Jesús D.1 aSánchez de la Campa, Ana M.1 aGonzález-Castanedo, Yolanda1 aFernández-Caliani, Juan C.1 aGonzález, Isabel,1 aRomero, Antonio0 tScience of the total environment.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 449 p.363-372dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.01.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03527naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245011400211300001400325520166000339592002801999650003502027650002302062650000902085650000902094650001202103650001602115650001702131650001202148650001102160650001202171650002002183650002602203650001402229650001602243650001802259650001002277650000902287651001002296653001002306653001602316653002602332653001602358653001802374653000702392653000802399653000702407653000802414653000802422653000702430653000702437653000802444700002202452700005802474700001802532700002402550700002102574700001802595700001802613700002002631773009602651856008502747852000902832655001202841IND60593430420221117161121.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059343042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2016.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlandino, Massimo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3719-252010aControl of western corn rootworm damage by application of soil insecticides at different maize planting times  ap. 19-27.  aThe western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) (WCR), is one of the most damaging maize crop pests. Damage to maize is primarily caused by the larvae feeding on roots, which results in a reduction of water and nutrient uptake and may cause lodging as well as a substantial reduction in grain yield.The effects of soil insecticides, applied at different planting times, on controlling WCR damage were investigated in 76 naturally infested fields in Northern Italy over a 4-year period. Without furrow insecticides, plant density was reduced at all of the considered planting times (−5%). Insecticide application led to a significant reduction in the WCR larval density (−43%). As a consequence, the root injury measured by node injury scale, was reduced (−65%) as was the incidence of plants with “gooseneck” symptoms (−76%). Furthermore, the soil-applied insecticide plots showed a significant increase in plant biomass yield at the dough stage (+6%) and in grain yield at physiological maturity (+8%). The application of soil insecticides showed a positive yield increase in 95% of the compared production situations. The yield increase was higher than 5% in 70% of considered cases. The effect of the soil-applied insecticides on root and plant damage symptoms, and the consequent biomass and grain advantage were steady over the different intervals between planting time and WCR egg hatching.The results of this study have underlined that the application of a soil insecticide to the furrows at planting leads to a clear control of injuries from insects and a consequent maize yield advantage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiabrotica virgifera virgifera 3abiomass production 3acorn 3aeggs 3afurrows 3agrain yield 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alodging 3anutrient uptake 3apesticide application 3aphytomass 3aplant pests 3aplanting date 3aroots 3asoil 3aItaly 0aMaize 0aGrain yield 0aWestern corn rootworm 0aInsecticide 0aPlanting time 0aDM 0aGDD 0aGS 0aIPM 0aNIS 0aPS 0aRR 0aWCR1 aFerracini, Chiara1 aRigamonti, Ivo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3854-25991 aTesta, Giulio1 aSaladini, Matteo A.1 aJucker, Costanza1 aAgosti, Mauro1 aAlma, Alberto1 aReyneri, Amedeo0 tCrop protection.g2017 Mar., v. 93 p.19-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2016.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245008000209300002000289506007600309520182600385592002802211506003702239650002602276650001802302650001902320650001502339650001302354650001102367650001802378650001402396650001302410650003302423650001702456650001302473700002002486700001902506700002302525700002702548700002102575700002302596700001502619700002302634700002402657773017702681856007902858852000902937655001202946IND60173816820221207071648.0150603e20130924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017381682DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13102141102doi7 aPMC37857402pmcid7 a240194682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaufman, Joshua J.10aIn-fiber production of polymeric particles for biosensing and encapsulation  ap. 15549-15554.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolymeric micro- and nanoparticles are becoming a mainstay in biomedicine, medical diagnostics, and therapeutics, where they are used in implementing sensing mechanisms, as imaging contrast agents, and in drug delivery. Current approaches to the fabrication of such particles are typically finely tuned to specific monomer or polymer species, size ranges, and structures. We present a general scalable methodology for fabricating uniformly sized spherical polymeric particles from a wide range of polymers produced with complex internal architectures and continuously tunable diameters extending from the millimeter scale down to 50 nm. Controllable access to such a wide range of sizes enables broad applications in cancer treatment, immunology, and vaccines. Our approach harnesses thermally induced, predictable fluid instabilities in composite core/cladding polymer fibers drawn from a macroscopic scaled-up model called a “preform.” Through a stack-and-draw process, we produce fibers containing a multiplicity of identical cylindrical cores made of the polymers of choice embedded in a polymer cladding. The instability leads to the breakup of the initially intact cores, independent of the polymer chemistry, into necklaces of spherical particles held in isolation within the cladding matrix along the entire fiber length. We demonstrate here surface functionalization of the extracted particles for biodetection through specific protein–protein interactions, volumetric encapsulation of a biomaterial in spherical polymeric shells, and the combination of both surface and volumetric functionalities in the same particle. These particles used in distinct modalities may be produced from the desired biocompatible polymer by changing only the geometry of the macroscopic preform from which the fiber is drawn.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiagnostic techniques 3aencapsulation 3aimage analysis 3aimmunology 3amedicine 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3apolymers 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atherapeutics 3avaccines1 aOttman, Richard1 aTao, Guangming1 aShabahang, Soroush1 aBanaei, Esmaeil-Hooman1 aLiang, Xiangdong1 aJohnson, Steven G.1 aFink, Yoel1 aChakrabarti, Ratna1 aAbouraddy, Ayman F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Sept. 24, v. 110, no. 39 p.15549-15554dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13102141103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245012700166300001600293520100200309592002801311650001601339650001101355650001001366650001501376650002201391650002501413650001301438650001601451653001601467653002701483653001301510653001101523653001601534700001701550700001901567773023401586856008401820852000901904655001201913IND60549694220221120093542.0190411e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054969422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2016.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Min Ji10aMolecular characterization of a chitin-binding protein with the peritrophin-A domain from the Asiatic honeybee Apis cerana  ap. 963-968.  aChitin, a structural component of the insect peritrophic membrane (PM), is associated with chitin-binding proteins (CBPs). Insect CBPs have been studied extensively regarding their interactions with chitin in the structure and functions of the cuticle and PM. However, the functions of bee CBPs are poorly understood. In this study, we present the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a CBP from the Asiatic honeybee Apis cerana. A. cerana CBP (AcCBP) contains the peritrophin-A domain with a six-cysteine motif. AcCBP is exclusively expressed in the midgut and is localized in the PM of A. cerana worker bees. Recombinant AcCBP was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells, and it exhibited chitin-binding ability, thus indicating a role for AcCBP as a CBP in the PM of A. cerana worker bees. Furthermore, AcCBP bound to entomopathogenic fungal surfaces but did not show anti-fungal activity. Taken together, our data demonstrate that AcCBP functions as a CBP of the bee PM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis cerana 3achitin 3afungi 3ahoney bees 3amolecular cloning 3aperitrophic membrane 3aproteins 3aworker bees 0aApis cerana 0aChitin-binding protein 0aHoneybee 0aMidgut 0aPeritrophin1 aKim, Bo Yeon1 aJin, Byung Rae0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2016 Dec., v. 19, no. 4 p.963-968dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection SocietywJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2016.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245021400177300002000391520135500411592002801766650001601794650001201810650001101822650001901833650004901852650001201901650002201913650001101935650001101946650001301957650004401970650001402014650001202028650002002040700002302060700002502083700001902108700006202127700006002189773012302249856008802372852000902460655001202469IND60616653620221120105211.0181020e20180913xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061665362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b023422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpiegel, Michael T.10aReactivities of Aromatic Protons in Crude Oil Fractions toward Br₂ Tagging for Structural Characterization by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry  ap. 10549-10555.  aComprehensive characterization and structural elucidation of specific chemical subclasses within a complex mixture often require analyte separation, a variety of spectroscopic techniques, and inquiry into reactivity patterns. Crude oil is one of the most challenging and highly complex mixtures, and for classification purposes, it is typically separated into low-weight n-heptane-soluble and high-weight toluene-soluble (or asphaltene) fractions. Both fractions of crude oil have been studied previously using various spectroscopic methods, but their complete characterization remains elusive. In this work, we use selective functional group derivatization of both n-heptane and asphaltene fractions of crude oil for unprecedented identification of chemical functional groups by a combination of high-resolution mass spectrometry, ¹H and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy methods. Chemical tagging with elemental bromine suggests that the aromatic protons within the asphaltene fraction are less abundant and more sterically hindered than previous models might suggest. An efficient column purification was used to remove paramagnetic metals and allow for the identification of crude oil functional groups via analysis of spectrometry and spectroscopy data combined with chemical reactivity studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasphaltenes 3abromine 3acarbon 3aderivatization 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aheptane 3amass spectrometry 3ametals 3amodels 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apetroleum 3aprotons 3astable isotopes1 aAnthony, Ian G.

Environmental participatory monitoring has been particularly effective in providing useful information for forest management and decision-making processes directed at formulating policy. However, recent studies have identified a recurrent participation pattern: citizen science appears to concentrate on affluent municipalities while excluding highly marginalized regions. For this research, a non-parametric analysis of the distribution of observations collected via iNaturalist, a citizens science app for participatory monitoring, is presented. Spearman correlations and a Kruskal-Wallis test were conducted for plant species observations in three states of central Mexico. Results suggest that participatory monitoring patterns are influenced by the marginalization degree of municipalities. Percentage of natural protected areas and forested surface per municipality were also analyzed as variables useful to explain the spatial concentration of participation. Evidence shows that, contrary to observed patterns of exclusion, marginalized municipalities with a designated natural protected area concentrate more participation. Participatory monitoring via citizen science programs is discussed as a valuable tool for developing countries challenged with restricted budgets for environmental management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitizen science 3aconservation areas 3adecision making 3aenvironmental management 3aforest management 3aissues and policy 3aurban forestry 3aMexico 0aCitizens science 0aParticipatory monitoring 0aForestry 0aEnvironmental justice 0aEnvironmental management1 aGutiérrez Ladrón de Guevara, Miguel de J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3700-65640 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2022 Apr., v. 70 p.127513-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.1275133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245012900164300001600293520141600309592002801725650002201753650001101775650001501786650001701801653002201818653003101840653001801871653003201889653002501921653002501946700001601971700001501987700001602002773009802018856008702116852000902203655001202212IND60563962320221118133407.0180830e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056396232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Yu12aA comprehensive model for analysis of real-time optical performance of a solar power tower with a multi-tube cavity receiver  ap. 589-603.  aA comprehensive model and corresponding code named after SPTOPTIC for analysis of the real-time optical performance of a Solar Power Tower (SPT) with a Multi-Tube Cavity Receiver (MTCR) were developed using Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) method. After validation, the model was used to study the optical performance of the DAHAN plant. The model-obtained results show that the solar flux in the MTCR exhibits a significant non-uniformity, showing a maximum flux of 5.141×10⁵Wm⁻² on the tubes. A comparison of the tracking models indicates that it is a good practice to treat the tracking errors as the random errors of the tracking angles when considering the random effect on the solar flux distribution. Study also indicates that multi-point aiming strategy of tracking helps homogenizing the flux and reducing the energy maldistribution among the tubes. Additionally, time-dependent optical efficiencies were investigated, and the yearly efficiency for the energy absorbed by the tubes was found to be 65.9%. At the end of the study, the cavity effect on the efficiency was revealed quantitatively, which indicates that the optical loss can be reduced significantly by the cavity effect, especially when the coating absorptivity is relatively low. It is concluded that the present model is reliable and suitable for predicting both the detailed real-time solar flux and the real-time efficiency of SPT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy efficiency 3amodels 3aprediction 3asolar energy 0aSolar power tower 0aMulti-tube cavity receiver 0aOptical model 0aMulti-point aiming strategy 0aReal-time solar flux 0aReal-time efficiency1 aHe, Ya-Ling1 aLi, Peiwen1 aDu, Bao-Cun0 tApplied energy.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 185 p.589-603dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002800141245010500169520110200274592002801376650002301404650002901427650002101456650001201477650001901489650002201508650001501530650001301545650002501558650001501583650002201598650001601620650001501636651001101651700002501662700002601687700002501713773011701738856007501855852000901930655001201939IND60649727120221119041208.0190705e20160126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064972712DNAL7 a10.3390/land50100032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Mela Veca, Donato S.10aAnthropogenic Influences in Land Use/Land Cover Changes in Mediterranean Forest Landscapes in Sicily  aThis paper analyzes and quantifies the land use/land cover changes of the main forest and semi-natural landscape types in Sicily between 1955 and 2012. We analyzed seven representative forest and shrubland landscapes in Sicily. These study areas were chosen for their importance in the Sicilian forest panorama. We carried out a diachronic survey on historical and current aerial photos; all the aerial images used to survey the land use/land cover changes were digitalized and georeferenced in the UTM WGS84 system. In order to classify land use, the Regional Forest Inventory 2010 legend was adopted for the more recent images, and the CORINE Land Cover III level used for the older, lower resolution images. This study quantifies forest landscape dynamics; our results show for almost all study areas an increase of forest cover and expansion, whereas a regressive dynamic is found in rural areas due to intensive agricultural and pasturage uses. Understanding the dynamics of forest landscapes could enhance the role of forestry policy as a tool for landscape management and regional planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3aanthropogenic activities 3aforest inventory 3aforests 3ageoreferencing 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aland use 3alandscape management 3alandscapes 3aregional planning 3arural areas 3ashrublands 3aSicily1 aCullotta, Sebastiano1 aSferlazza, Sebastiano1 aMaetzke, Federico G.0 tLand.g2016 Jan. 26, v. 5, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land50100033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010400159500001900263520158900282592002801871650001001899650002001909650001101929650001201940700002101952700001501973700001801988700001802006700001602024773012702040856007402167852000902241655001202250IND60737133620221122052450.0210514e20210507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073713362DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130918282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Hongjian 10aMotion Estimation Using Region-Level Segmentation and Extended Kalman Filter for Autonomous Driving  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMotion estimation is crucial to predict where other traffic participants will be at a certain period of time, and accordingly plan the route of the ego-vehicle. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the motion state by using region-level instance segmentation and extended Kalman filter (EKF). Motion estimation involves three stages of object detection, tracking and parameter estimate. We first use a region-level segmentation to accurately locate the object region for the latter two stages. The region-level segmentation combines color, temporal (optical flow), and spatial (depth) information as the basis for segmentation by using super-pixels and Conditional Random Field. The optical flow is then employed to track the feature points within the object area. In the stage of parameter estimate, we develop a relative motion model of the ego-vehicle and the object, and accordingly establish an EKF model for point tracking and parameter estimate. The EKF model integrates the ego-motion, optical flow, and disparity to generate optimized motion parameters. During tracking and parameter estimate, we apply edge point constraint and consistency constraint to eliminate outliers of tracking points so that the feature points used for tracking are ensured within the object body and the parameter estimates are refined by inner points. Experiments have been conducted on the KITTI dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method presents excellent performance and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods either in object segmentation and parameter estimate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adata collection 3amodels 3atraffic1 aHuang, Yingping 1 aHu, Fuzhi 1 aZhao, Baigan 1 aGuo, Zhiyang 1 aZhang, Rui 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 May 07, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130918283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012100165300001400286520087400300592002801174650001501202650001701217650001201234650002001246650002001266650001601286650000901302650001901311650001901330650001101349650001701360651002001377651002001397653001201417653002001429653001501449653001901464653001501483653002201498653002501520700001301545700001501558773009601573856008501669852000901754655001201763IND60593430720221117161150.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059343072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2016.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, A.10aManaging leaf diseases of carrots with traditional and alternative fungicides including baseline sensitivity studies  ap. 52-59.  aField research was conducted to examine traditional and alternative fungicide options for controlling leaf diseases of carrots caused by powdery mildew and Cercospora. Wet conditions favoured leaf blights caused by Cercospora and dry favoured powdery mildew. Pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin, and tebuconazole controlled both Cercospora leaf blight and powdery mildew whereas sulphur on its own controlled only powdery mildew compared to untreated plots. Spray oils did not improve powdery mildew control, but when combined with sulphur, improved Cercospora leaf blight control. A baseline sensitivity study indicated a powdery mildew isolate from South Australia, sourced from carrots sprayed with a fungicide containing azoxystrobin over several seasons, was less sensitive to azoxystrobin than an isolate from New South Wales which had not been exposed to the fungicide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCercospora 3aazoxystrobin 3acarrots 3adisease control 3afoliar diseases 3aleaf blight 3aoils 3apowdery mildew 3apyraclostrobin 3asulfur 3atebuconazole 3aNew South Wales 3aSouth Australia 0aCarrots 0aFoliar diseases 0aCercospora 0aPowdery mildew 0aFungicides 0aErysiphe heraclei 0aBaseline sensitivity1 aPung, H.1 aHall, B.H.0 tCrop protection.g2017 Mar., v. 93 p.52-59dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2016.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245014200166300001600308520117800324592002801502596012301530650001401653650002501667650001701692650002001709650002901729650001301758650001201771650001901783650001801802650001901820650003701839650002901876650001301905653001901918653002701937653002901964653001301993700002402006700002902030773013802059856008002197852000902277655001202286IND60645196220221119073822.0190528e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064519622DNAL7 a10.1177/10820132187990272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuendera, Ana P10aAntimicrobial activity of essential oils against foodborne multidrug-resistant enterococci and aeromonads in planktonic and biofilm state  ap. 101-108.  aThe selection and use of natural compounds with antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens is of major importance. The present study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of commercial essential oils against multidrug-resistant Enterococcus spp. and Aeromonas spp. Cymbopogon flexuosus and Thymus vulgaris essential oils presented the highest inhibitory zones against both bacterial groups (p < 0.05). Subsequent determination of the minimum inhibitory concentrations showed values between 0.47 and 1.9 mg/ml for Aeromonas spp. and from 1.9 to 15 mg/ml for Enterococcus spp. The antimicrobial effect of C. flexuosus and T. vulgaris essential oils was also assessed against biofilms. Bacteria in biofilm state were subjected to 30 min or 1 h of exposure to each essential oil and eradication ability estimated by colony counting. Both essential oils exhibited antimicrobial activity against preformed Aeromonas biofilms, but were unable to successfully eradicate biofilms produced by enterococci, in the conditions under investigation. Nonetheless, the presumptive use of essential oils in the food industry should be considered in further investigations.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFRH/BPD/108123/2015cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001871 3aAeromonas 3aCymbopogon flexuosus 3aEnterococcus 3aThymus vulgaris 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aessential oils 3afood industry 3afood pathogens 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amultiple drug resistance 3aplankton 0aEssential oils 0aantimicrobial activity 0afoodborne microorganisms 0abiofilms1 aBarreto, António S1 aSemedo-Lemsaddek, Teresa0 tFood science and technology international.g2019 Mar., v. 25, no. 2 p.101-108dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1532-17387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10820132187990273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003200137245012400169300001600293520134600309592002801655650001901683650001701702650001201719650002601731650001201757650001501769650000901784650001501793650001601808650002101824651001101845653001701856653002601873653002401899653002001923653002401943653000901967653001301976700003001989700003002019773008802049856007102137852000902208655001202217IND60082548420221118181450.0141029s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008254842DNAL7 a10.1071/RJ140472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres-Meza, Maria de Jesus10aClimatic indices for determining risks to the distribution and maintenance of Quercus emoryi Torr. (Fagaceae) in Mexico  ap. 483-492.  aMexico is one of the two centres of diversification of oaks (Quercus spp.) in the world, with 161 species, 66% of which are endemic. The local-scale analysis of trends in climate variables, using climate indices, can be useful in estimating both the potential benefits and risks presented by climate to oak populations. Since the minimum January temperature is an important limiting factor in the distribution of Quercus emoryi Torr. in Mexico, this study analysed trends in this variable in the area of distribution of the species and identified the populations likely to be affected by them. The RClimDex 1.0 software was used to analyse trends of nine climate indices related to minimum temperature recorded in 14 weather stations in the area of the species’ potential distribution in Mexico. Data from five stations showed significant trends related to an increase in minimum January temperature, whereas data from seven stations showed trends of a decrease in this variable. Populations of the species, mainly in the ecoregion containing piedmonts and plains with grassland, scrubland and forests in the Cuauhtemoc region in Chihuahua state, and Cuencame and Canatlan regions in Durango state, could be affected by these trends. The information on at-risk populations may be used for in situ and ex situ species conservation programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuercus emoryi 3abiogeography 3aclimate 3aconservation programs 3aforests 3agrasslands 3arisk 3ashrublands 3atemperature 3aweather stations 3aMexico 0abiogeography 0aclimate change trends 0aforest conservation 0aMexican forests 0aminimum temperature 0aoaks 0aRClimDex1 aBaez-Gonzalez, Alma Delia1 aRamos-Gonzalez, Jose Luis0 tRangeland journal.g2014, v. 36, no. 5 p.483-492dCSIRO Publishingx1036-98727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ140473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01792naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245007500154300002000229520085600249592002801105650003001133650001301163650001201176650001801188650001601206700001701222700001401239700001801253773012401271856007401395852000901469655001201478IND60625469220221119194417.0181208e20181130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062546922DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra07824f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnsal, E.10aHydrogenated derivatives of hexacoordinated metallic Cu₂Si monolayer  ap. 39976-39982.  aHerein, we carried out first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to investigate the effects of surface functionalization with hydrogen atoms on structural, dynamical and electronic properties of Cu₂Si monolayer. Pristine Cu₂Si, a metallic monolayer, has a planar hexacoordinate structure. Calculations revealed that the most favorable position of a single H atom on the Cu₂Si monolayer is at the top of a Si site. Derivatives of Cu₂Si monolayer with various H concentrations were investigated, and by performing phonon calculations, it was found that there are three stable hydrogenated structures. Specific heat of these monolayers was found to increase with the hydrogen concentration at temperatures higher than 100 K.

The analysis framework of Social Judgement Theory (SJT)—i.e., (a) economic benefits, (b) environmental health, and (c) social and political factors—was used to design the research. SJT is a widely recognized theoretical framework that includes experimental approaches to the study of cognitive conflicts. An experimental survey was conducted to collect data in order to make a comparison of the weight of different elements. Results demonstrate that there are perception differences between the general public and local officials on controversial facilities. Local officials responsible for endorsing and supervising plants attach more significance to environmental factors than the public, while the public focuses more on social and political factors than officials. There is no significant difference in the cognition of economic benefits. Factors such as demolition compensation and legitimacy may provoke these perception gaps. This paper enriches the current understanding of SJT and policy making for controversial facilities by investigating the perception gaps between officials and the general public.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental health 3afinancial economics 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3apolitics 3arisk perception 3asurveys 3aChina1 aZhang, Manli1 aMa, Ben0 tSustainability.g2018 Apr. 05, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100410923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245006900165300001600234520129100250592002801541650001401569650001901583650001301602650001001615650001201625650001201637653001001649653002801659653001801687653001701705653002701722700001701749700001701766700001901783773009901802856008401901852000901985655001201994IND60601165020221118061000.0180706e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060116502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.07.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meng12aA DEM simulation of dry and wet particle flow behaviors in riser  ap. 221-233.  aIn the present paper, the flow characteristics of dry and wet particles in circulating fluidized bed riser are simulated by using the Euler–Lagrange approach, in which the solid phase is modeled by the discrete element method (DEM) and the gas phase is solved by the Navier–Stokes equations. The forces acting on particles include contact force, friction force, van der Waals force, liquid bridge force, gravitational force, drag force, and pressure gradient force. The flow behaviors of dry and wet particles are compared, and the agglomerate characteristics of wet particles are also analyzed quantitatively. Numerical results indicate that a remarkable heterogeneity is observed from both dry and wet particles in the riser. However, a major difference exists for the flow between dry and wet particles, which shows that the flow structure with a dilute region in the upper zone and a dense region near the bottom is formed for the dry particles and the wet particles show the opposite way. The results show a significant influence of the physical parameters of particles on the formation of particle clusters in the riser. The wet particles move in two forms: the single-particle and agglomerate. The effect of the moisture contents is remarkable on agglomerate characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3afluidized beds 3afriction 3agases 3aliquids 3apowders 0aRiser 0aDiscrete element method 0aHeterogeneity 0aWet particle 0aParticle agglomeration1 aZhu, Weibing1 aSun, Qiaoqun1 aZhang, Xiaobin0 tPowder technology.g2014 Nov., v. 267 p.221-233dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.07.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245012900157300001400286520145900300592002801759650002101787650001701808650001201825650001301837650001101850650001101861650001801872650001001890700001901900773009201919856004802011852000902059655001202068IND4472213920221123040034.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447221392DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-011-0864-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Li10aSelf-thinning lines of organs and aboveground parts based on allometric relationships in overcrowded Pinus densiflora stands  ap. 15-21.  aThe allometric relationships of mean tree height [Formula: see text] and of organ mass density [Formula: see text] to mean organ mass [Formula: see text] were studied in self-thinning Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc. stands. Tree height increased significantly with increasing mean mass of organs and aboveground parts on logâlog coordinates. The value of the allometric constant Î¸ ranged from 0.2878 to 0.3349. On the other hand, the constant value Î´ was not significantly different from zero, except for leaves. The value of the allometric constant Î´ ranged from â0.2926 to 0.0120. According to Wellerâs allometric model, the slope of the self-thinning line was calculated from the allometric constants Î¸ and Î´. The thinning slope was estimated to be â1.51 in stem, â1.39 in branches, â1.00 in leaf and â1.41 in aboveground parts, respectively. Mass density was high in stem, medium in branches and low in leaves. Mean leaf mass density decreased significantly with decreasing stand density on logâlog coordinates, which could be interpreted as indicating the importance of the constant final leaf biomass in overcrowded P. densiflora stands. The self-thinning exponents of branch, stem and aboveground parts were not significantly different from 3/2, which indicated that the 3/2 power law of self-thinning holds for stem mass, branch mass and aboveground mass in overcrowded P. densiflora stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus densiflora 3aaerial parts 3abiomass 3abranches 3aleaves 3amodels 3astand density 3atrees1 aHagihara, Akio0 tEcological research.g2012 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.15-21dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-011-0864-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245016600168300001400334520185500348592002802203650000902231650001402240650001302254650001402267650002302281650001002304650001402314650001102328650001202339650002402351650002602375650001002401651001102411653002102422653003102443653002202474653004002496653002302536700001902559773009302578856008402671852000902755655001202764IND60584758020221117200150.0190401e20180201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058475802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2017.10.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Junyuan,10aDual trajectories of breakfast eating and fruit and vegetable intake over a 5-year follow-up period among economically disadvantaged children: Gender differences  ap. 41-49.  aBreakfast eating (BE) seems to be cross-sectionally associated with fruit and vegetable intake (FVI). To date, gender differences in any codevelopment between BE and FVI, as well as their associated factors, have not been examined. The objectives of this study were (1) to identify dual trajectories of BE and FVI among economically disadvantaged boys and girls; and (2) to examine potential associated factors of identified dual trajectories by gender. Children from economically disadvantaged families were enrolled in this prospective multicity study of the Taiwan Database of Children and Youth in Poverty between July 6 and October 31, 2009 and followed up biannually (2009, 2011, and 2013). One thousand one children (50.2% girls, mean ages at each time point being 9.1, 11.2 and 13.1 years, respectively; 49.8% boys, 9.0, 11.0 and 13.0 years) who completed at least two of the three assessments were included. Dual trajectories of BE and FVI over a 5-year follow-up period were identified as the outcome variables of interest by using mainly group-based dual trajectory modeling. Nine potential associated factors were then examined using logistic regression models. Two distinct dual trajectories of BE and FVI were identified among the girls: longitudinally irregular (68.8%) and shift to irregular (31.2%). Two distinct dual trajectories of BE and FVI were identified among the boys: longitudinally irregular (90.2%) and consistently regular (9.8%). Age was the significantly associated factor for boys. The findings confirmed a heterogeneous codevelopment between BE and FVI that may indicate different underlying mechanisms. Most children with a longitudinally irregular BE pattern had a similar pattern of FVI. Future research should comprehensively explore the gender differences in the determinants of codevelopment between BE and FVI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboys 3abreakfast 3achildren 3adatabases 3agender differences 3agirls 3aingestion 3amodels 3apoverty 3aregression analysis 3avegetable consumption 3ayouth 3aTaiwan 0aBreakfast eating 0aFruit and vegetable intake 0aDual trajectories 0aEconomically disadvantaged children 0aGender differences1 aHsiao, Yi-Chen0 tAppetite.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 121 p.41-49dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2017.10.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014900173300001800322520189400340592002802234650003002262650001102292650001402303650001302317650002902330650001702359650002402376650001302400653000802413653001402421653001902435653002102454653002602475653002402501653002302525653002302548700001702571773009902588856008602687852000902773655001202782IND60532045120221119222149.0190319e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053204512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.07.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalkonyay, Laszlo12aA decade of adaptation: Regulatory contributions of the World Health Organization to the Global Action Plan for Influenza Vaccines (2006–2016)  ap. 5414-5419.  aThe Global Action Plan (GAP) for Influenza Vaccines is a decade-long initiative that brings together a diverse range of stakeholders to work towards reducing anticipated global shortage of influenza vaccines and ensuring more equitable access to vaccines during the next influenza pandemic. Since its inception in 2006, significant progress has been made towards all the main objectives of GAP, namely: (1) an increase in seasonal vaccine use, (2) an increase in vaccine production, and (3) progress in research and development of more effective vaccines. The Technology Transfer Initiative (TTI), conceived and managed by WHO under the GAP, contributed to increasing regional influenza vaccine production capacity. This was achieved by facilitating technology transfer in 14 low- and middle-income countries, through grants to manufacturers to establish or strengthen influenza vaccine production capacity and support to their national regulatory authorities. Five of the countries subsequently licensed locally produced influenza vaccines; two pandemic and three seasonal vaccines received WHO prequalification. The success of GAP can be largely attributed to the regulatory support provided by WHO to both manufacturers and regulators. This support had two components: (1) direct regulatory support to GAP/TTI, and (2) support to GAP-related WHO programmes, such as the Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Deployment Initiative in 2010 and the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework since 2013, especially in non-vaccine-producing countries. Temporary adaptation of the assessment process for influenza vaccines in the WHO Vaccine Prequalification Programme to the A(H1N1) pandemic situation in 2009 was instrumental to the success of the WHO Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Deployment Initiative in its attempt to meet the demand for pandemic vaccines in countries that received donated vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3agrants 3ainfluenza 3apandemic 3aresearch and development 3astakeholders 3atechnology transfer 3avaccines 0aWHO 0aInfluenza 0aVaccine supply 0aPandemic vaccine 0aVaccine manufacturing 0aTechnology transfer 0aVaccine regulation 0aRegulatory support1 aFatima, Hiba0 tVaccine.g2016 Oct. 26, v. 34, no. 45 p.5414-5419dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245009500172300001600267520128600283592002801569650002301597650001401620650002901634650001701663650001401680653001001694653002901704653002601733700002201759773009301781856008301874852000901957655001201966IND60606915020221119023158.0180730e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060691502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMardones, Cristian10aComparison of economic instruments to reduce PM2.5 from industrial and residential sources  ap. 443-452.  aIn the literature, it is possible to find different studies that compare economic instruments performance applied to the industrial sources regulation; however, evidence about pollution from residential sources is scarce. For this reason, the present study simulates and compares an emission permit system (EPS) and an ambient permit system (APS) when fine particulate matter pollution (PM2.5) is generated from industrial and residential sources. Thus, this research contributes to the spatial, economic and environmental assessment of industrial and residential emissions. The options to reduce pollution include replacement of heating devices in residential sources and installing end-of-pipe technologies in industrial sources. The results in terms of total cost and technological chosen options are similar under an APS and EPS for targets lesser to 80%. This is explained because it is more cost-effective to reduce emissions in residential sources than in industrial sources, and additionally, residential pollution has only local impact. However, some industrial sources should install abatement technologies for more demanding targets; in this case as industrial pollution are scattered in different areas, the total cost of an APS are lower than the total cost of an EPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aemissions 3aenvironmental assessment 3aparticulates 3apollution 0aPM2.5 0aEmission tradable system 0aAmbient permit system1 aSaavedra, Andrés0 tEnergy policy.g2016 Nov., v. 98 p.443-452dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245014400176520103500320592002801355650004301383650001601426650001601442650001201458650001701470650001701487650001201504650000701516653002501523653004301548653002301591653002601614653003201640700002201672700002201694773010601716856008701822852000901909655001201918IND60733197620221118014503.0211015e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073319762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1250572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGattermayr, Florian10aEffect of changes in continuous carboxylate feeding on the specific production rate of butanol using Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum  aSubstrate variability in multi-feedstock biorefineries has implications for the stability of downstream bioprocesses. Here, we studied potential effects of fluctuating feed rates and pH on substrate uptake and butanol production by Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum during continuous co-feeding with butyric and acetic acid. Monitoring the fermentation extensively and at high frequency, enabled us to perform irregular fraction experimental designs. The total acid feed rate and the ratio of butyric acid to acetic acid in the feed were found to be significant factors in their uptake by the culture. Furthermore, to maximize the specific butanol production rate, glucose may not be limited and butyric acid should be supplied at a rate of 7.5 mmol L⁻¹ h⁻¹. Surprisingly, pH played a role only indirectly, in its effect on process stability.

In one treatment, all individuals of each species were genetically unique. The second contained four randomly selected genotypes of each species. In the third, there was no genetic diversity in any of the species but each community contained a unique combination of genotypes. 3 Over a period of 5 years the communities were allowed to develop in microcosms containing natural rendzina soil and exposed to a standardized regime of simulated grazing and trampling. The treatments were maintained by the removal of flowers, immature seed‐heads and seedlings originating from the seed‐bank and seed rain. Point quadrat surveys were used to monitor changes in species composition and diversity in the three experimental treatments. 4 During the experiment a distinction rapidly developed between five canopy dominants and five subordinates, a process that caused the vegetation structure to closely resemble that occurring at Cressbrookdale. 5 A gradual loss of species diversity occurred in all three treatments but by the end of the fifth growing season species diversity was higher in the most genetically diverse communities. 6 Ordination of the 36 communities at intervals over a 5‐year period revealed a gradual convergence in the species composition of the 4‐genotype and 16‐genotype communities and this effect was more strongly developed in the latter. A comparable process was not observed in the 1‐genotype communities, suggesting that interaction between particular genotypes of different species in local neighbourhoods may be an essential part of the mechanism that determines the predictable composition of a mature pasture community. 7 It is concluded that, under the conditions of this experiment, genetic diversity within component species reduced the rate at which species diversity declined. The relative importance in this effect of factors such as greater disease resistance and moderated competitive interactions remains uncertain.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3adisease resistance 3aflowers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agrazing 3agrowing season 3alimestone 3amodels 3apastures 3aplant communities 3aseed dispersal 3aseedlings 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atrampling damage1 aGrime, J.

Many viruses eliminate DCs to prevent host response, induce immunosuppression and to maintain chronic infection. In this study, we examined apoptotic response of dendritic cells during in vitro and in vivo infection with ectromelia virus (ECTV), the causative agent of mousepox. ECTV-infected bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) from BALB/c mice underwent apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway at 48 h post infection, up-regulated FasL and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic Fas. Similar pattern of Bcl-2, Fas and FasL expression was observed for DCs early during in vivo infection of BALB/c mice. Both BMDCs and DCs from BALB/c mice showed no maturation upon ECTV infection. We conclude that ECTV-infected DCs from BALB/c mouse strain help the virus to spread and to maintain infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEctromelia virus 3aadaptive immunity 3aapoptosis 3abone marrow 3adendritic cells 3aimmunosuppression 3ainnate immunity 3amice 3amitochondria 3apathogenesis 3aviruses 0aEctromelia virus 0aFas/FasL 0aDendritic cells1 aPardecka, Maja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6937-10781 aCymerys, Joanna1 aKrzyzowska, Malgorzata0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2017 Aug., v. 109 p.99-109dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.05.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014900160300002000309500001900329520170400348592002802052650003402080650001402114650001602128653002402144653002602168653002202194653001602216653001802232700006102250700001702311700001702328700001602345700005802361773014302419856007802562852000902640655001202649IND60713741020221119134700.0201023e20200924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071374102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c063012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Bo-Ren10aEnhanced Functionality of Dual-Gate Organic Transistors Based on Semiconducting/Insulating Polyblend-Induced Asymmetric Charge Modulation Layers  ap. 47763-47773.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDual-gate organic thin-film transistors (DG-OTFTs) with enhanced functionality, including large current enhancement behavior, highly efficient threshold voltage controllability, and self-contained dual-mode logic gate features, are reported. These DG-OTFTs are based on a semiconducting/insulating polyblend-based active layer with asymmetric top and bottom charge modulation layers (atb-CMLs). The atb-CMLs are automatically generated through the preparation of multilayer stacks of phase-separated semiconducting poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):insulating poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) polyblend layer, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) layer, and cross-linked-poly(4-vinylphenol) (cPVP) layer. They consist of a thin PMMA bottom layer and an uneven-shaped PMMA:PVDF miscible mixture-based top layer. The presence of the polarizable insulating PMMA, PVDF, and PMMA:PVDF mixture regions causes the bottom and top CMLs to experience electrical polarization, which induces the dipole field to achieve efficient charge modulation functions in DG-OTFTs. Owing to the presence of atb-CMLs, the DG-OTFTs exhibit unprecedented electrical characteristics, such as the easy depletion of the bottom channel by the top gate potential. However, the top channel can work properly only when given a bottom gate potential (either positive or negative). Given these unusual electrical features, the design of the fundamental dual-mode logic gates (e.g., AND and OR gates) can be achieved with just one DG transistor. This finding opens an interesting direction for the preparation of DG-OTFTs with diverse operating modes and increasing functionality, thereby widening the application potential of such transistors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3afluorides 3atransistors 0aorganic electronics 0adual-gate transistors 0athreshold voltage 0alogic gates 0aRaman mapping1 aCheng, Horng-Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1631-22311 aLin, Jia-Hui1 aWu, Fu-Chiao1 aWang, Yu-Wu1 aZhou, Weiyang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7221-57620 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Sept. 24, v. 12, no. 42 p.47763-47773dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c063013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02615naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002100140245011300161300001600274500000900290520151700299592002801816650001501844650002401859650002501883650002201908650001401930650001601944650002501960650001601985650001202001651001502013700002102028773011802049852000902167856007702176655001202253IND4460639420221116141633.0191126e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446063942DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2010.00492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPidlisecky, Adam14aThe Use of Wavelet Analysis to Derive Infiltration Rates from Time-Lapse One-Dimensional Resistivity Records  ap. 697-705.  aepub  aAs part of a study to understand factors impacting the efficiency of an artificial recharge pond in Watsonville, CA, a time series of resistivity measurements was made using a permanently installed one-dimensional resistivity probe. Measurements were made in the top 2 m of sediment with data acquired every 30 min. There was an observed diurnal signal in these data due to daily temperature fluctuations in the pond water. By viewing this signal as a thermal tracer, we used the movement of the associated thermal front to estimate infiltration rates from the resistivity data. We developed a wavelet-based method for calculating lag times of the thermal front between measurement locations. As part of this algorithm, we tested the statistical significance of a given signal and automatically rejected calculated lag times that were associated with signals below a given confidence interval. We included a linear inversion routine for calculating the velocity of the thermal front from the calculated lag times. Using the thermal velocity, we estimated an infiltration rate at the resistivity probe that decreased from approximately 3.5 to 1 m d⁻¹ during a period of 18 d. Resistivity data have a distinct advantage over direct temperature measurements: a resistivity measurement is sensitive to changes outside the region disturbed by instrument emplacement. While our processing approach was demonstrated on the presented resistivity data, it is equally valid for use with direct temperature measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aconfidence interval 3agroundwater recharge 3ainfiltration rate 3asediments 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3avadose zone 3awavelet 3aCalifornia1 aKnight, Rosemary0 tVadose zone journal.g2011 May, v. 10, no. 2 p.697-705dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2010.00493Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02542naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245014000163520143500303592002801738650001601766650000901782650000901791650001401800650002901814650001201843650001301855650001601868700003401884700001901918700002701937700002101964773012301985856007502108852000902183655001202192IND60760800220221119133155.0211223e20211125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076080022DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131242332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalvo-Malvar, Mar 10aChanges in Dietary Patterns through a Nutritional Intervention with a Traditional Atlantic Diet: The Galiat Randomized Controlled Trial  aUnhealthy dietary patterns (DPs) can lead to cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. We assessed the effects of a community-focused intervention with a traditional Atlantic diet on changes in DPs in families and the associations of these changes with weight loss. The Galiat study is a randomized, controlled trial conducted in 250 families (720 adults and children) and performed at a primary care setting with the cooperation of multiple society sectors. Over 6 months, families randomized to the intervention group received educational sessions, cooking classes, written supporting material, and foods that form part of the Atlantic diet, whereas those randomized to the control group followed their habitual lifestyle. At baseline, five DPs that explained 30.1% of variance were identified: “Caloric”, “Frieds”, “Fruits, vegetables, and dairy products”, “Alcohol”, and “Fish and boiled meals.” Compared to the controls, the intervention group showed significant improvements in “Fruits, vegetables, and dairy products” and “Fish and boiled meals” and reductions in the “Caloric” and “Frieds”. Changes in bodyweight per unit increment of “Frieds” and “Fruits, vegetables, and dairy products” scores were 0.240 kg (95% CI, 0.050–0.429) and −0.184 kg (95% CI, −0.379–0.012), respectively. We found that a culturally appropriate diet improved DPs associated with weight loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3adiet 3afish 3alifestyle 3anutritional intervention 3asociety 3avariance 3aweight loss1 aBenítez-Estévez, Alfonso J.1 aLeis, Rosaura 1 aSánchez-Castro, Juan 1 aGude, Francisco 0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131242333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245008900211300001800300506007600318520105300394592002801447506003701475650001301512650000801525650001501533650001501548650001401563650002401577650001501601650002701616650001601643650001301659650001201672650001701684650001401701650002001715650002701735700001801762773011401780856008101894852000901975655001201984IND60082548820221207144322.0141029e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008254882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-013-1555-22doi7 aPMC40325922pmcid7 a244489032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolier, Stéphanie14aThe nuclear γ-H2AX apoptotic ring: implications for cancers and autoimmune diseases  ap. 2289-2297.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aApoptosis is a fundamental process for metazoan development. It is also relevant to the pathophysiology of immune diseases and cancers and to the outcome of cancer chemotherapies, as well as being a target for cancer therapies. Apoptosis involves intrinsic pathways typically initiated by DNA damaging agents and engaging mitochondria, and extrinsic pathways typically initiated by “death receptors” and their ligands TRAIL and TNF at the cell surface. Recently, we discovered the apoptotic ring, which microscopically looks like a nuclear annular staining early in apoptosis. This ring is, in three-dimensional space, a thick intranuclear shell consisting of epigenetic modifications including histone H2AX and DNA damage response (DDR) proteins. It excludes the DNA repair factors usually associated with γ-H2AX in the DDR nuclear foci. Here, we summarize our knowledge of the apoptotic ring, and discuss its biological and pathophysiological relevance, as well as its value as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker for anticancer therapies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnimalia 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aapoptosis 3aautoimmune diseases 3abiomarkers 3adeath domain receptors 3aepigenetics 3ahistones 3aligands 3amitochondria 3aneoplasms 3apathophysiology 3atumor necrosis factors1 aPommier, Yves0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2014 June, v. 71, no. 12 p.2289-2297dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-013-1555-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245011400177520103100291592002801322650002401350650002901374650001901403650001201422650001401434650001001448650002101458650001301479650001401492650000901506653002701515653002001542653002101562653002201583700001701605700001301622700002101635700001901656700001801675700001701693773010601710856008701816852000901903655001201912IND60733197820221118014519.0210527e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073319782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1250692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaballah, Mohamed S.12aA review targeting veterinary antibiotics removal from livestock manure management systems and future outlook  aVeterinary antibiotics (VAs) contamination has been considered as a worldwide environmental and health concern in recent decades. This paper reviewed the variability of contents of VAs and their release from the animal breeding industry into the surrounding environment along with the performance of the manure treatment technologies. The data collected revealed that VAs were mostly excreted in animal feces and observed in manure, soil, water, and sediment. The findings illustrate the disparity of VAs in excretion rates, consumption, and their residues in the environment with relatively high distribution for tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and sulfonamides. Anaerobic digestion has a capacity to remove of 73% VAs while manure composting and constructed wetlands can remove 84.7%, and 90% VAs. Due to the profound effect of antibiotics on the environment, further research and intensive management strategies for livestock manure need to be designed to improve the removal efficiency and manure management technologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanimal manure management 3aanimal manures 3aanimals 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afluoroquinolones 3aindustry 3asediments 3asoil 0aVeterinary antibiotics 0aLivestock farms 0aRemoval pathways 0aManure management1 aGuo, Jianbin1 aSun, Hui1 aAboagye, Dominic1 aSobhi, Mostafa1 aMuhmood, Atif1 aDong, Renjie0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Aug., v. 333 p.125069-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1250693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03674naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100001400170245011900184300001400303520194300317592002802260650001602288650001602304650001302320650001102333650001902344650000902363650001402372650001302386650001602399650001302415650001002428650002002438650001502458650003302473650001402506650003802520650003402558650001302592650005202605651001302657651001202670651001202682653001002694653001402704653001302718653000802731653001402739653001502753653001902768700001702787700003102804700001502835773011502850856008602965852000903051655001203060IND50070657220221118104136.0190318e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007065722DNAL7 a241211392pmid7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2013.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Y.10aDiffusive anisotropy in low-permeability Ordovician sedimentary rocks from the Michigan Basin in southwest Ontario  ap. 31-45.  aDiffusive anisotropy was investigated using samples from Upper Ordovician shale and argillaceous limestone from the Michigan Basin of southwest Ontario, Canada. Effective diffusion coefficients (De) were determined for iodide (I−) and tritiated water (HTO) tracers on paired cm-scale subsamples oriented normal (NB) and parallel to bedding (PB) prepared from preserved drill cores within one year from the date of drilling. For samples with porosity >3%, an X-ray radiography method was used with I− tracer for determination of De and porosity accessible to I− ions. A through-diffusion method with I− and HTO tracers was used for most siltstone and limestone samples with low-porosity (<3%). The De values range from 7.0×10−13 to 7.7×10−12m2·s−1 for shale, 2.1×10−13 to 1.3×10−12m2·s−1 for limestone, and 5.3×10−14 to 5.6×10−13m2·s−1 for siltstone and limestone interbeds within the Georgian Bay Formation shale. The sample-scale anisotropy ratios (De-PB:De-NB) for De values obtained using the I− tracer are 0.9 to 4.9, and the anisotropy ratios for the HTO tracer are in the range of 1.1 to 7.0.The influence of porosity distribution on diffusive anisotropy has been investigated using one-dimensional spatially-resolved profiles of I−-accessible porosity (shale only) and the use of AgNO3 for fixation of I− tracer in the pores, allowing for SEM visualization of I−-accessible pore networks. The porosity profiles at the sample scale display greatest variability in the direction normal to bedding which likely reflects sedimentary depositional processes. The SEM imaging suggests that diffusion pathways are preferentially oriented parallel to bedding in the shale and that diffusion occurs dominantly within the argillaceous component of the limestone. However, the fine clay-filled intergranular voids in the dolomitic domains of the limestone are also accessible for diffusive transport.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3adiffusivity 3adrilling 3adrills 3aimage analysis 3aions 3alimestone 3aporosity 3aradiography 3asampling 3ashale 3atritiated water 2aAnisotropy 2aCalcium Carbonatexchemistry 2aDiffusion 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aPorosity 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxprevention & control 3aMichigan 3aOntario 0aOntario 0aShale 0aLimestone 0aPorosity 0aSEM 0aDiffusion 0aAnisotropy 0aMichigan Basin1 aTroshin, V.,1 aScott, L.q(Larry),d1935-1 aLoomer, D.0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2013 Dec., v. 155 p.31-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2013.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04053naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245017700168300001400345520163400359592002801993650001802021650004402039650001102083650002402094650002202118650001102140650001502151650001702166650001202183650001102195650002002206650003702226650001402263650002002277650001302297650001902310650001702329650001202346650001102358650001502369650001802384650002802402650001402430650001502444650001502459650001702474650001002491650001002501650003302511650003002544650001302574650003702587653002002624653002002644653002202664653001702686653001202703700002402715700003002739700002502769700002402794700002402818700002202842700002002864700002102884700001302905700001902918700002502937700002502962700001802987700002203005773010303027856008403130852000903214655001203223IND60545864520221118222538.0160903e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054586452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoni, Mathath10aCharacterization and biotoxicity of Hypnea musciformis-synthesized silver nanoparticles as potential eco-friendly control tool against Aedes aegypti and Plutella xylostella  ap. 31-38.  aTwo of the most important challenges facing humanity in the 21st century comprise food production and disease control. Eco-friendly control tools against mosquito vectors and agricultural pests are urgently needed. Insecticidal products of marine origin have a huge potential to control these pests. In this research, we reported a single-step method to synthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using the aqueous leaf extract of the seaweed Hypnea musciformis, a cheap, nontoxic and eco-friendly material, that worked as reducing and stabilizing agent during the biosynthesis. The formation of AgNP was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance band illustrated in UV–vis spectrophotometer. AgNP were characterized by FTIR, SEM, EDX and XRD analyses. AgNP were mostly spherical in shape, crystalline in nature, with face-centered cubic geometry, and their mean size was 40–65nm. Low doses of H. musciformis aqueous extract and seaweed-synthesized AgNP showed larvicidal and pupicidal toxicity against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the cabbage pest Plutella xylostella. The LC50 value of AgNP ranged from 18.14 to 38.23ppm for 1st instar larvae (L1) and pupae of A. aegypti, and from 24.5 to 38.23ppm for L1 and pupae of P. xylostella. Both H. musciformis extract and AgNP strongly reduced longevity and fecundity of A. aegypti and P. xylostella adults. This study adds knowledge on the toxicity of seaweed borne insecticides and green-synthesized AgNP against arthropods of medical and agricultural importance, allowing us to propose the tested products as effective candidates to develop newer and cheap pest control tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHypnea 3aPlutella xylostella 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadults 3aarthropods 3abiosynthesis 3acabbage 3adengue 3adisease control 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afecundity 3afood production 3ageometry 3ainsect vectors 3ainsecticides 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alarvicides 3aleaf extracts 3alethal concentration 50 3alongevity 3amacroalgae 3ananosilver 3apest control 3apests 3apupae 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aBio-fabrication 0aGreen-synthesis 0aNanobiotechnology 0aPest control 0aSeaweed1 aMurugan, Kadarkarai1 aPanneerselvam, Chellasamy1 aSubramaniam, Jayapal1 aNicoletti, Marcello1 aMadhiyazhagan, Pari1 aDinesh, Devakumar1 aSuresh, Udaiyan1 aKhater, Hanem F.1 aWei, Hui1 aCanale, Angelo1 aAlarfaj, Abdullah A.1 aMunusamy, Murugan A.1 aHiguchi, Akon1 aBenelli, Giovanni0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2015 Nov., v. 121 p.31-38dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001200141245020000153300001600353500001900369520202600388592002802414650002202442650002402464650001802488650001002506650002402516650001202540650001802552650001202570650002002582650002302602650003002625650001502655650001502670650001302685650001402698650001802712653002302730653001302753653002502766700001402791700001502805700001402820700001402834773012902848856007502977852000903052655001203061IND60727185120221121222657.0210209e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072718512DNAL7 a10.3382/japr/pfx0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYun, W.10aEffects of supplementation of probiotics and prebiotics on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, organ weight, fecal microbiota, blood profile, and excreta noxious gas emissions in broilers  ap. 584-592.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of supplementation of probiotics and prebiotics on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, relative organ weight, fecal microbiota, blood profile, and excreta noxious gas emissions in broilers. A total of 714 one-day-old mixed sex ROSS 308 broilers with the initial BW = 40 ± 0.69 g was used in a 4-week trial. All birds were raised in wire cages. Birds were randomly allotted to 7 treatments with 6 replicates per treatment and 17 broilers per pen. Dietary treatments included: 1) T1 (control), 2) T2 [T1 + 0.2% probiotics (Bacillus sp. 1 × 10⁹ CFU, Lactobacillus sp. 1 × 10⁸ CFU, Aspergillus niger. 1 × 10⁷ CFU)], 3) T3 (T1 + 1% chicory fiber), 4) T4 (T1 + 1% rice bran), 5) T5 (T1+ 0.2% probiotics + 1% chicory fiber), 6) T6 (T1 + 0.2% probiotics + 1% rice bran), and 7) T7 (T1 + 0.2% probiotics + 1% chicory fiber + 1% rice bran). During d 1 to 14, broilers fed the T5, T6, and T7 diets had greater body weight gain (BWG) compared with the T1 diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, probiotics-included treatments resulted in higher BWG compared with the probiotics-free diets (P < 0.05). Broilers fed the T7 diet increased more in BWG compared with those fed the T1 diet, whereas feed conversion ratio (FCR) decreased more in the T7 diet than the T1 diet overall (P < 0.05). Dry matter (DM) digestibility increased more in the T5, T6, and T7 diets compared with the T1 diet (P < 0.05). Broilers fed probiotics-based diets had more improved DM digestibility compared with those fed probiotics-free diets (P < 0.05). Excreta Lactobacillus counts increased more in the T7 diet compared with the T1 diet (P < 0.05). Broilers fed with probiotics diets had higher excreta Lactobacillus counts compared with those fed the probiotics-free diets (P < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation with 0.2% probiotics and 1% dietary fiber as prebiotics could improve the growth performance, DM digestibility, and excreta Lactobacillus counts in broilers raised in wire cages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aLactobacillus 3ablood 3abody weight changes 3achicory 3adietary fiber 3aexcreta 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aresearch 3arice bran 3atissue weight 0aexcreta microbiota 0abroilers 0aLactobacillus counts1 aLee, D.H.1 aChoi, Y.I.1 aKim, I.H.1 aCho, J.H.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 26, no. 4 p.584-592dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr/pfx0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010500169300001400274520173100288592002802019650000802047650002102055650002602076650001202102650002902114650002102143650002302164650001602187651001002203653003202213653003202245653002002277653001902297653002402316700001702340700001102357700001602368700001602384700001602400700001602416700001802432773010102450856008702551852000902638655001202647IND60531984720221118223542.0180904e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053198472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.02.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ziyuan10aHistorical and projected emissions of HCFC-22 and HFC-410A from China's room air conditioning sector  ap. 30-35.  aRecent decades witnessed the increase in production and uses of HCFC-22 (chlorodifluoromethane, CHClF2) and its alternative, HFC-410A (a blend of difluoromethane and pentafluoroethane), in China in response to the booming of room air conditioners (RACs) for both domestic use and exports. HCFC-22 is an ozone-depleting substance under the Montreal Protocol, while both HCFC-22 and HFC-410A are greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study provides a most comprehensive consumption and emission inventory of refrigerants emissions (HCFC-22 and HFC-410A) from RAC sector during 1995–2014, for the first time. Our estimates show that HCFC-22 emissions increased from 0.7 Gg/yr in 1995 to 48.2 Gg/yr in 2014. The accumulative emissions contributed to global total HCFCs emissions by 4.4% (3.3%–6.1%) CFC-11-equivalent (CFC-11-eq) and 5.4% (4.1%–7.5%) CO2-equivalent (CO2-eq) during 1995–2012. If left uncontrolled, accumulative emissions of HFC-410A will be12.4 (7.1–20.2) CO2-eq Pg during 2015–2050, which can offset the global climate benefits achieved by the Montreal Protocol. The HFC-410A emissions from China's RAC sector are estimated to be of importance to both global HFCs emissions and China's GHG emissions. Further, we probed the emission mitigation performances of the current 2014 North American Proposal scenario and a modified more ambitious scenario. The emissions of two mitigation scenarios are only 28% and 22% of the emissions without mitigation actions, respectively. This study is the first effort to map the transition of eliminated substance HCFC-22 and its alternative HFC-410A in RAC sector. Therefore, alternative chemicals should be scrutinized with cautions before they are promoted and applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aclimate 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrofluorocarbons 3ainventories 3aChina 0aRAC refrigerant alternation 0aNational emission inventory 0aOzone depletion 0aClimate change 0aMitigation scenario1 aFang, Xuekun1 aLi, Li1 aBie, Pengju1 aLi, Zhifang1 aHu, Jianxin1 aZhang, Boya1 aZhang, Jianbo0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 May, v. 132 p.30-35dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.02.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009300162300001600255500001900271520168000290592002801970650001101998650002002009650000902029650001602038650001302054650001402067650000902081650002002090650002302110650001302133651001302146653001902159653002302178653001202201700001602213700001702229700001502246773012902261856007902390852000902469655001202478IND60727196020221118050937.0210209e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072719602DNAL7 a10.3382/japr.2013-008432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCrea, B.A.10aPerformance and carcass characteristics of Delaware chickens in comparison with broilers  ap. 586-592.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe recent resurgence in the popularity of keeping small flocks of chickens has brought with it an interest in the production characteristics of heritage breeds of chicken. The Delaware breed was developed in the state of Delaware for meat production and is considered a heritage breed because it has long been passed over in favor of the Cornish cross. The definition of a heritage chicken breed is one that physically conforms to the standards of the American Poultry Association, mates naturally, has a long, productive outdoor lifespan, and a slow growth rate. Production information on raising meat Delawares is lacking, as recent research has focused on diet formulation and genetics for broiler production. This study was undertaken to determine the production efficiency of Delawares as compared with broilers in BW, feed intake, FCR, and carcass dressing percentage. Significant differences in BW were noted between broilers and Delawares throughout the study; this was evident even with chick weights. Delawares took 15 wk to reach the same live BW as that of a broiler at 6 wk. The feed intake was greater for the broilers over Delawares during their 6-wk grow-out. The Delawares required twice as much feed to reach the same BW as that of the broiler. Significant differences between the 2 breeds were observed with regard to FCR, the broilers being the more efficient breed. The Delawares had a significantly lower carcass dressing percentage, just under 65%, as compared with broilers, just over 68%. It is hoped that this information will aid producers of niche-market heritage chickens in their decision-making when considering this breed for meat production.  aPublisher supplied data 3achicks 3adecision making 3adiet 3afeed intake 3agenetics 3alongevity 3ameat 3ameat production 3apoultry production 3aresearch 3aDelaware 0aheritage breed 0agrowth performance 0abroiler1 aMills, A.F.1 aMatthews, K.1 aHutson, J.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 23, no. 4 p.586-592dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr.2013-008433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007600174300001600250520104300266592002801309650001601337650000901353650001901362650001401381650001101395650001801406650001701424700002501441700005801466773012001524856005101644852000901695655001201704IND60767923820221120054207.0220222e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076792382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2021.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Raphaël10aPersister cancer cells: Iron addiction and vulnerability to ferroptosis  ap. 728-740.  aFerroptosis is a unique type of non-apoptotic cell death resulting from the unrestrained occurrence of peroxidized phospholipids, which are subject to iron-mediated production of lethal oxygen radicals. This cell death modality has been detected across many organisms, including in mammals, where it can be used as a defense mechanism against pathogens or even harnessed by T cells to sensitize tumor cells toward effective killing. Conversely, ferroptosis is considered one of the main cell death mechanisms promoting degenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents a vulnerability in certain cancers. Here, we critically review recent advances linking ferroptosis vulnerabilities of dedifferentiating and persister cancer cells to the dependency of these cells on iron, a potential Achilles heel for small-molecule intervention. We provide a perspective on the mechanisms reliant on iron that contribute to the persister cancer cell state and how this dependency may be exploited for therapeutic benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aferroptosis 3airon 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aoxygen 3aphospholipids 3atherapeutics1 aSchreiber, Stuart L.1 aConrad, Marcus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1140-56120 tMolecular cell.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 82, no. 4 p.728-740dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2021.12.001  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245010300167300001600270520097400286592002801260650001601288650001701304650001501321650001201336650001401348650001301362650001801375650002301393650001201416650001301428653003001441653003201471653002501503653002901528653002501557700002001582773013701602856007701739852000901816655001201825IND60522026320221120045715.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052202632DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1995-03092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd-Jones, Guy C.10aSynthesis and Structures of Low-Valent Tungsten Complexes Bearing Chiral Oxazoline-Derived Ligands  ap. 361-367.  aThe synthesis of low-valent tungsten (0 and II) complexes bearing chiral bidentate phosphino- oxazoline or bisoxazoline ligands is described. The structures of four of the complexes have been determined by single crystal X-ray analyses. Tungsten(II)-allyl complexes of the type [W(CO)₂(PN)(C₃H₅)Cl] (PN = phosphino-oxazoline) are fluxional in solution, but can be crystallized as single diastereoisomers. The complex [W(CO)₃(PN)(CH₃CN)], which also crystallizes as a single diastereoisomer, is readily oxidized in solution and solid state, in stark contrast to analogous compounds bearing four carbonyl ligands [W(CO)₄(PN)] or [W(CO)₄(NN)] (NN = bisoxazoline) which were found to be stable. [W(CO)₃(PN)(CH₃CN)] functions as a highly enantioselective catalyst in allylic substitution reactions with dimethyl sodiomalonate, whereas complexes of the type [W (CO)₂(PN)(Z -C₃H₄)X)] (Z = H, Ph; X = Cl, Br) failed to yield allylic alkylation products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aacetonitrile 3aalkylation 3abromine 3acatalysts 3achlorine 3adiastereomers 3aenantioselectivity 3aligands 3atungsten 0aChiral Tungsten Complexes 0aPhosphino-oxazoline Ligands 0aBisoxazoline Ligands 0aTungsten Allyl Complexes 0aAsymmetric Catalysis1 aPfaltz, Andreas0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 50, no. 3 p.361-367dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1995-03093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03234naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002300185245014900208506007600357520155400433592002801987506003702015650001802052650002302070650002102093650001102114650001502125650001402140650001402154650002502168650001902193650000902212650001402221650001202235650001802247650002002265650001002285650001302295650001802308650000902326650001802335650001102353650001402364650004302378650001202421650001602433700002502449773011902474856007802593852000902671655001202680IND60649357120221207112312.0190704e20171106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064935712DNAL7 a10.3390/insects80401222doi7 aPMC57468052pmcid7 a291130992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalkins, Travis L.12aA Blood Meal Enhances Innexin mRNA Expression in the Midgut, Malpighian Tubules, and Ovaries of the Yellow Fever Mosquito <em>Aedes aegypti</em>  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMosquitoes are vectors of pathogens that cause diseases of medical and veterinary importance. Female mosquitoes transmit these pathogens while taking a blood meal, which most species require to produce eggs. The period after a blood meal is a time of extreme physiological change that requires rapid coordination of specific tissues. Gap junctions (GJ) are intercellular channels that aid in the coordination of cells within tissues via the direct transfer of certain small molecules and ions between cells. Evolutionarily distinct groups of proteins form the gap junctions of vertebrate and invertebrate animals (connexins and innexins, respectively). Aedes aegypti mosquitoes possess six genes encoding innexins: inx1, inx2, inx3, inx4, inx7, and inx8. The goal of this study was to identify potential roles of innexins in the physiology of mosquitoes after a blood meal by using qPCR to quantify their mRNA expression in adult females at 3 h and 24 h post-blood meal (PBM) relative to non-blood-fed controls. We found that at 24 h PBM, expression levels of inx2, inx3, and inx4 mRNAs increased; inx2 was the most highly upregulated innexin in key tissues associated with blood-meal digestion and egg production (i.e., the midgut and ovaries, respectively). However, knocking down inx2 mRNA levels by over 75% via RNA interference had no significant effect on fecundity. Altogether, our results suggest that a blood meal influences the molecular expression of innexins in mosquitoes, but their specific physiological roles remain to be elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aMalpighian tubules 3aRNA interference 3aadults 3ablood meal 3aconnexins 3adigestion 3adisease transmission 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3agap junctions 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainnexins 3ainvertebrates 3aions 3amessenger RNA 3amidgut 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atissues 3avertebrates1 aPiermarini, Peter M.0 tInsects.g2017 Nov. 06, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects80401223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01318naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012200156300002000278520020300298592002800501650002800529650001100557650001400568650001300582650002200595650001600617650001000633650001900643650001400662700001800676700001700694700001300711700001300724773012400737856007400861852000900935655001200944IND60669162820221119224001.0190920e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066916282DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra13269j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiura, Y.10aSynthesis of benzoyl cyanide through aerobic photooxidation of benzyl cyanide using carbon tetrabromide as a catalyst  ap. 70883-70886.  aWe developed a synthetic method toward benzoyl cyanide through aerobic photooxidation of benzyl cyanide in the presence of carbon tetrabromide under visible light irradiation with fluorescent lamps.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrominated hydrocarbons 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acyanides 3afluorescent lamps 3airradiation 3alight 3aphotooxidation 3asynthesis1 aTachikawa, Y.1 aNagasawa, Y.1 aTada, N.1 aItoh, A.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 19, v. 5, no. 87 p.70883-70886dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra13269j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016400172300001400336520169800350592002802048650001802076650001502094650001702109650001902126650002402145650001402169650001102183650001802194650002402212650002102236650006202257650002702319653001602346653002402362653001802386653002602404653002102430653001602451653001002467653001002477653001002487653001502497653001502512653001502527653000802542700001602550700002402566773008802590856008402678852000902762655001202771IND60606895820221120165648.0180730e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060689582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2016.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakahashi, Masaki14aThe efficient cell-SELEX strategy, Icell-SELEX, using isogenic cell lines for selection and counter-selection to generate RNA aptamers to cell surface proteins  ap. 77-84.  aAptamers are short single-stranded nucleic acid molecules that are selected in vitro from a large random sequence library based on their high and specific affinity to a target molecule by a process known as SELEX. Cell-SELEX that employs whole living cells overexpressing the defined cell surface proteins (for selection) and appropriate mock cells (for counter-selection) has been widely used as a valid and feasible method for generating aptamers against specific cell surface proteins. However, the endogenous expression of target proteins in mock cells or the heterogeneity of surface proteins between selection and counter-selection cells often impeded the isolation of proper aptamers against target proteins. To solve this problem, we developed “Isogenic cell-SELEX” (Icell SELEX in short) method, in which isogenic cell lines were manipulated for counter-selection by microRNA-mediated silencing and for selection by overexpression of target proteins. As a model experiment, we targeted integrin alpha V (ITGAV), which is a major transmembrane receptor expressed in almost all the cells, and established ITGAV-overexpressed and -downregulated HEK293 cells for selection and counter-selection, respectively. By taking advantage of a hundred-fold difference in the expression level of ITGAV between these two isogenic cell lines, we easily isolated several anti-ITGAV aptamers, whose binding to the cell-surface ITGAV was confirmed by flow cytometry with the dissociation constant of 300–400 nM range. We assume that Icell-SELEX could be applicable to a wide range of cell-surface proteins including various transmembrane proteins of biological and pharmacological significance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA libraries 3acell lines 3adissociation 3aflow cytometry 3agene overexpression 3aintegrins 3amodels 3anucleic acids 3anucleotide aptamers 3asurface proteins 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment 3atransmembrane proteins 0aRNA aptamer 0aIsogenic cell-SELEX 0aRNA silencing 0aCell surface proteins 0aIntegrin alpha V 0aIcell-SELEX 0aSELEX 0aITGAV 0amiRNA 0aO.E.-cells 0aK.D.-cells 0arhITGAV-B6 0aSPR1 aSakota, Eri1 aNakamura, Yoshikazu0 tBiochimie.g2016 Dec., v. 131 p.77-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2016.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01353naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245014100161300001800302520023900320592002800559650002300587650002300610650002300633653003400656653003000690653003700720700002600757700001700783773015300800856007700953852000901030655001201039IND60522046320221120105958.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052204632DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1996-10242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Noshena10aSynthesis of Cyclopropanated Dimethyl Mercaptal Sulfoxide Pyranoses from Epoxytriflate Pyranosides and Methyl Methylthiomethyl Sulfoxide  ap. 1517-1520.  aThe reaction of 4-O-triflyl-2-3-anhydropyranosides with metyl methylthiomethyl sulfoxide in the presence of n-BuLi or NaH affords 3,4-cyclopropanated pyranosides via triflate substitution and subsequent intramolecular epoxide opening.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 0aCyclopropanated Carbohydrates 0aEpoxytriflate Pyranosides 0aMetyl Methylthiomethyl Sulfoxide1 aKohlbau, Hans-Jürgen1 aVoelter, W.,0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 51, no. 10 p.1517-1520dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1996-10243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011300173520112500286592002801411650001501439650001101454650001601465650001101481650001501492650002001507650002701527650001701554650002101571650001401592650002701606650001501633650002101648650001801669653002901687653001201716653001101728653001501739653001601754653002101770700002001791700006701811700005701878773010601935856008702041852000902128655001202137IND60794658920221120154052.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079465892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1280122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeong, Yoong Kit10aValorization of spent mushroom substrate for low-carbon biofuel production: Recent advances and developments  aDue to the nutritional values and functional bioactivities of mushrooms, the global market value of the edible mushroom industry has been growing steadily. However, the production of 1 kg of fresh mushroom generates about 5 kg of wet byproducts (known as spent mushroom substrate; SMS). This necessitates proper waste management to mitigate potential environmental threats. Embracing the “waste-to-fuel” concept, SMS as lignocellulosic waste can serve as cheap and abundant feedstock for the production of a variety of biofuels, including biogas, biohydrogen, bioethanol, bio-oil, and solid-biofuels. Mushroom cultivation serves as efficient biological pretreatment for biofuel production, promoting biofuel yield and improving the overall economy. Therefore, integrated mushroom cultivation and biofuel production can simultaneously satisfy the rapidly rising food and energy demand. The article systematically reviewed the recycling and re-utilization of SMS in sustainable biofuel production, discussing the possible challenges and proposing future directions for the green development of the mushroom industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioethanol 3abiogas 3abiohydrogen 3aenergy 3afeedstocks 3afuel production 3alignocellulosic wastes 3amarket value 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3aspent mushroom compost 3atechnology 3awaste management 3aworld markets 0aSpent mushroom substrate 0aBiofuel 0aBiogas 0aBioethanol 0aBiohydrogen 0aCircular economy1 aVarjani, Sunita1 aLee, D.

Increased switching speed is possible by applying a large amplitude writing pulse as the resistive switching is tunable by both the amplitude and length of the writing pulse.

Our previous study showed that naringin, a citrus flavonoid, can enhance the bone mass in ovariectomized rats. In this study, we further elucidated the mechanisms of naringin-induced osteoblast maturation and bone healing. Treatment of human osteoblasts with naringin increased cell viability and proliferation. In parallel, exposure to naringin enhanced translocation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) to nuclei and its transactivation activity. Sequentially, naringin induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) mRNA and protein expression and its enzyme activity. Pretreatment with methylpiperidinopyrazole (MPP), a specific inhibitor of ERα, attenuated naringin-induced augmentations in ERα transactivation activity, ALP gene expression, and cell mineralization. The beneficial effects of naringin were also confirmed in mouse MC3T3-E1 cells. Moreover, administration of mice with a bone defect with naringin increased levels of ERα and ALP in damaged sites and simultaneously enhanced the healing rate and bone strength. Nevertheless, treatment with MPP weakened naringin-triggered expression of ERα and ALP and improved bone healing and mass. Therefore, naringin could improve osteoblast mineralization and bone healing via regulating ERα-dependent ALP gene expression. Naringin can be clinically applied for treatment of osteoporosis-related bone diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone density 3abone strength 3acell viability 3aenzyme activity 3aestrogen receptors 3afood chemistry 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amice 3amineralization 3anaringin 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3aplant estrogens 3aprotein synthesis 3atranscriptional activation 0aERα 0aALP gene expression 0aosteoblast mineralization 0abone healing1 aChen, Kung-Yen1 aYang, Jr-Di1 aLiu, Shing-Hwa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9976-11971 aChen, Ruei-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5728-05710 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 69, no. 44 p.13020-13033dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c043533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013000173520111300303592002801416650001501444650001801459650002101477650001101498650001901509650001201528650001501540650002501555650001401580650002601594650001101620653001901631653002401650653002501674653001301699653002601712653002201738700002201760773010601782856008701888852000901975655001201984IND60794659020221120165954.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079465902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1280132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlthuri, Avanthi10aEmerging innovations for sustainable production of bioethanol and other mercantile products from circular economy perspective  aBiogenic municipal solid waste (BMSW) and food waste (FW) with high energy density are ready to tap renewable resources for industrial scale ethanol refinery foreseen for establishing bio-based society.

Herein, a 3D printed real-time optical density monitoring device (RTOMD) combined platform was presented. This platform enables precise kinetics analysis by maintaining high accuracy (over 95 %) under raucous outdoor conditions. Through RTOMD-based high-frequency measurements, it was observed that maximum biomass productivity of 4.497 g L⁻¹ d⁻¹ was reached, which greatly exceeds the requirements for a feasible microalgae process. We discovered that the CO₂ fixation efficiency could be achieved to 70.75 %, indicating the potential of a bioconversion process to realize a carbon–neutral society. Consequently, the RTOMD system can contribute to promoting microalgae cultivation as an attractive carbon mitigation technology based on an improved understanding of the photosynthetic CO₂ fixation kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abiomass production 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3akinetics 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3aprocess control 3asociety 3athree-dimensional printing 0aMicroalgae 0aCO2 bioconversion 0a3D printing 0aProcess real-time monitoring 0aFlue gas1 aSung, Young Joon1 aSim, Sang Jun0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Nov., v. 364 p.128014-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1280143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002200140245011000162300001600272500000900288520165200297592002801949650000801977650001301985650002501998650001302023650002202036650000902058650000902067650002002076650001602096700002202112700002602134773011802160852000902278856007702287655001202364IND4460639520221116141627.0191126e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446063952DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2010.01212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakaki, Toshihiro13aAn Improved Air Pressure Measuring Method and Demonstrated Application to Drainage in Heterogeneous Soils  ap. 706-715.  aepub  aWater flow in the vadose zone is often modeled as a single-phase flow where the air phase is assumed to be free to flow. Although this is a fair assumption in many practical cases, there are a number of applications where the free flow of air is hindered due to various causes. Air phase that is not free to flow in the subsurface can lead to a decreased infiltration rate or changes in water flow paths. In this study, we improved methods for measuring air pressure in wet soil, and demonstrated its applicability to investigate how the air phase can play a critical role in heterogeneous soil under certain conditions. To achieve this, we performed two sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we tested seven different porous material–hydrophobic treatment combinations for air pressure measurement in soils that were initially water saturated. In the second set of the experiment, drainage was induced in a layered column where a layer of coarse sand was overlaid by finer sand. Air pressure was monitored using the method selected based on the results of the first experiment. As the drainage proceeded, the layer of coarse sand released water when the air phase penetrated through the fine sand layer. The air pressure in the coarse layer rapidly decreased (became negative) as the water was released. The results demonstrated that the improved air pressure measuring method successfully indicated a decrease in air pressure during the drainage, and that the single-phase approach where only the water pressure is considered becomes invalid for cases where free air flow is hindered and water–air interaction is significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3aatmospheric pressure 3adrainage 3ainfiltration rate 3asand 3asoil 3asubsurface flow 3avadose zone1 aLimsuwat, Anuchit1 aIllangasekare, T.

Herein, we describe a novel impedimetric aptasensor based on Pencil Graphite Electrodes (PGE) for the analysis of OTA. Taking advantage of its affordability and high active surface area, a PGE was modified with a specific aptamer, to achieve sensitive detection of OTA. This strategy relies on the target-induced increase in the electron transfer resistance (Rcₜ) upon OTA recognition using ferro/ferricyanide as a redox probe. With the addition of OTA, the formation of OTA–aptamer complex resulted in an increase of Rct. The change of Rcₜ strongly depends on OTA concentration, which is applied for mycotoxin quantification. An acceptable linear range was obtained from 0.1 to 2.0 ng mL⁻¹ with a very good limit of detection as low as 0,1 ng mL⁻¹. This simple-to-design aptasensor was successfully tested in spiked beer samples, with OTA concentrations in the range of 0.4–1.6 ng mL⁻¹, attesting a recovery percentage of 93.4 ± 6.6%. It also showed a high level of stability and reproducibility thanks to the electro-grafting method via in-situ generation of 4-carboxyphenyl diazonium salts. This PGE-based platform is a versatile approach for the design of low-cost aptasensors for food safety control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3aaptasensors 3abeers 3acarbon electrodes 3adetection limit 3adiazonium compounds 3aelectron transfer 3afood contamination 3aochratoxin A 3aoligonucleotides 3asalts 0aElectrochemical aptasensor 0aPencil graphite electrode 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy 0aDiazonium electrografting 0aOchratoxin A1 aBen Aissa, Sondes1 aNemčeková, Katarína1 aCatanante, Gaëlle1 aRaouafi, Noureddine1 aMarty, Jean-Louis0 tFood control.g2020 Sept., v. 115 p.107271-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.1072713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012300162300001600285520165500301592002801956650002301984650002402007650002402031650001502055650002402070650001602094650001102110650002202121650001902143650001102162650001402173650002202187650001902209651001002228700001902238700001702257700001802274700001202292773009202304856008102396852000902477655001202486IND60477954120221120035643.0160108e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047795412DNAL7 a10.1007/s40333-015-0019-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Guilin10aCompetition between Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima seedlings under simulated high groundwater availability  ap. 293-303.  aDesert riparian plants experience high variability in water availability due to hydrological fluctuations. How riparian plants can survive with low water availability has been well studied, however, little is known about the effects of high water availability on plant community structuring. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to test whether seedling competition under simulated high groundwater availability can explain the shift of co-dominance of Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima in early communities to P. euphratica dominance in mature ones along the Tarim River in northwestern China. Seedlings of these two plant species were grown in monoculture and mixture pools with high groundwater availability. Results indicated that the above-ground biomass and relative yield of T. ramosissima were higher than those of P. euphratica. The competitive advantages of T. ramosissima included its rapid response in growth to groundwater enrichment and its water spender strategy, as evidenced by the increased leaf biomass proportion and the inert stomatal response to leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In comparison, P. euphratica showed a conservative strategy in water use, with a sensitive response to leaf-to-air VPD. Result of the short-term competition was inconsistent with the long-term competition in fields, suggesting that competition exclusion is not the mechanism structuring the desert riparian plant communities. Thus, our research highlights the importance of mediation by environmental fluctuations (such as lessening competition induced by disturbance) in structuring plant communities along the Tarim riparian zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus euphratica 3aTamarix ramosissima 3aaboveground biomass 3aarid lands 3acommunity structure 3agroundwater 3aleaves 3aplant communities 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3aseedlings 3astomatal movement 3avapor pressure 3aChina1 aJiang, Shaowei1 aLiu, Weiyang1 aZhao, Chengyi1 aLi, Jun0 tJournal of Arid Land.g2016 Apr., v. 8, no. 2 p.293-303dScience Pressx1674-67677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-015-0019-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015400166300001600320520141400336592002801750650002101778650002501799650001801824650002501842650001701867650002701884650002501911650001301936650001501949650001301964650001901977650001901996650001702015650001202032650002002044650001502064650001902079650002102098650001102119650002002130650001902150650002502169650001102194653002802205653001902233653001602252653001702268653003502285700001802320700001302338700002202351700002002373700001602393773010302409856008602512852000902598655001202607IND60570338720221121235403.0190325e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057033872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micpath.2017.05.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVysakh, A.10aRole of antioxidant defence, renal toxicity markers and inflammatory cascade in disease progression of acute pyelonephritis in experimental rat model  ap. 189-194.  aUrinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections affecting millions of people each year worldwide. The animal model provides an excellent and suitable system for studying cystitis and pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli and other uropathogens. Using this established model, we evaluate the role of antioxidant defence system, renal injury markers, and blood parameters in the diseases progression during Escherichia coli infection on 0th day, 12h and 7th day. The antioxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx, GR levels were evaluated. The blood parameters like AST, ALT, ALP, Total protein, BUN, creatinine level were estimated in infection model. The relative organ weights, anti microbial status of kidney, CRP, WBC count were done for the evaluation of inflammatory response associated with the infection. The oxidative stress marker like MDA was also evaluated. Histopathological analysis of renal tissue provides direct vision to tissue damage. The antioxidant status of renal tissue was decreased during the 7th day of infection. Likewise, renal toxicity markers were significantly increased during bacterial infection. The inflammatory markers like CRP, WBC count and oxidative stress marker like MDA were significantly increased by the infection on 7th day. The histopathology of renal tissue also reveals the inflammation and tissue damage associated with acute pyelonephritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aalanine transaminase 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaspartate transaminase 3abacterial infections 3acatalase 3acreatinine 3acystitis 3adisease course 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3akidneys 3aleukocyte count 3aleukocytes 3anephrotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3apeople 3aprotein content 3apyelonephritis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avision 0aUrinary tract infection 0aPyelonephritis 0aAntioxidant 0aInflammation 0aUropathogenic Escherichia coli1 aRaji, Nair R.1 aSuma, D.1 aJayesh, Kuriakose1 aJyothis, Mathew1 aLatha, M.S.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2017 Aug., v. 109 p.189-194dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2017.05.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01407naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002000138245008700158300001200245520044500257592002800702650000800730650002200738650001200760650003000772650001800802650001400820650002200834700001900856700001700875700002000892773010700912856004101019852000901060655001201069IND4473335020221118055348.0130402e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447333502DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027728392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Rong-Cheng12aA rapid and efficient DNA minipreparation suitable for screening transgenic plants  ap. 379.  aWe present a modified method for DNA minipreparation suitable for large-scale screening of transgenic plants.

These insects are important parasites of birds affecting them as blood feeders and as vectors of a diversity of pathogens. When nestling were 10 days old, we assigned wild great tit Parus major nests to one of two treatments, control and fumigated nests. The abundance of biting midges and blackflies captured during 3 days following the treatment application were lower in fumigated nests with respect to control ones. By contrast, the abundance of blowfly pupae measured when nestlings left their nests was not affected by the treatment. Although many experimental studies modify the abundance of nest-dweller ectoparasites, to our knowledge, this is the first one describing an easy, safe, and effective method, reducing the total abundance of both biting midges and blackflies in wild avian nests. Our results could be used in future conservation projects and experimental studies on host–parasite evolution affecting the abundance of flying blood-feeder insects under natural conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalliphoridae 3aCeratopogonidae 3aParus major 3aSimuliidae 3abirds 3ablood 3aectoparasites 3aevolution 3aflight 3ahematophagous insects 3anests 3apathogens 3apupae1 aMerino, Santiago1 aLobato, Elisa1 aRivero-de Aguilar, Juan1 adel Cerro, Sara1 aRuiz-de-Castañeda, Rafael0 tParasitology research.g2009 Apr., v. 104, no. 5 p.1233-1236dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-009-1353-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007500159300002000234520158900254592002801843650001501871650001501886650002301901650001401924650002101938650001701959650001601976650001201992650001502004650002002019650001602039700002502055700001902080773012502099856007402224852000902298655001202307IND60669154820221119220200.0190920e20151109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066915482DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra13088c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPashaei, Babak10aTransition metal complex redox shuttles for dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 94814-94848.  aAn important link exists between the selected molecular structure of a sensitizer and the employed shuttle electrolyte to achieve high conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). So far, the most commonly used redox mediator is iodide/triiodide (I⁻/I₃⁻), which has shown advantages such as desirable kinetic properties and high carrier collection efficiencies. However, it has several disadvantages including a low redox potential, corrosion toward metal materials and competitive blue light absorption. In this respect, the transition metal complex electrolytes represent valuable alternatives to replace traditional I⁻/I₃⁻ couples, and can overcome the drawbacks of the I⁻/I₃⁻ electrolyte. In recent years, the best efficiency of a DSSC was achieved with a porphyrin-sensitized solar cell with a transition metal complex-based redox electrolyte. In particular, in 2014, the Gratzel group published a record DSSC efficiency of 13% using a new porphyrin sensitizer with a Co-polypyridyl-based electrolyte. Here, we describe the engineering of the structure of a new transition metal complex electrolyte and the design of the molecular structure of a sensitizer at the same time. The main focus will be on the correlation between photophysical and electrochemical properties of the metal complex mediators and their DSSC performances. This review provides an in-depth investigation into exciting alternative electrolyte shuttles in DSSCs and the various advantages that they provide, including high conversion efficiency and non-corrosive properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablue light 3achemical structure 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aengineering 3aiodides 3aporphyrins 3aredox potential 3asolar cells1 aShahroosvand, Hahsem1 aAbbasi, Parisa0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 09, v. 5, no. 115 p.94814-94848dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra13088c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011000160300001600270520187400286592002802160650001302188650001202201650002002213650001502233650001902248650001702267650001302284650001402297650001102311650001202322650000902334650001902343650002702362700001902389700002102408773010202429856007502531852000902606655001202615IND60534115320221120085802.0160802e20140116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053411532DNAL7 a10.1021/ef401479s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadala, Srinivas10aEffect of Ethanol Port-Fuel-Injector Position on Dual-Fuel Combustion in an Automotive-Size Diesel Engine  ap. 340-348.  aIn contrast to the conventional approach of using ethanol in spark-ignition engines, this study demonstrates the potential of ethanol utilization in diesel engines using dual-fuel combustion, where ethanol is injected into the intake manifold and diesel is directly injected into the engine cylinder. The main focus is the effect of the ethanol port-fuel-injector (PFI) position on dual-fuel combustion and engine-out emissions. In this study, Mie-scattering spray imaging and engine tests were performed in an optical spray chamber simulating the intake manifold condition and a single-cylinder, automotive-size diesel engine, respectively. Two PFI positions are selected: one close to the hot intake valves, so that the sprays impinged upon the hot valve surface (position A), and the other further upstream of the intake valves, allowing increased residence time for interactions between ethanol droplets and intake airflow (position B). From ethanol spray images, it is suggested that the droplet size is smaller for PFI position B because of enhanced droplet–airflow interaction. However, the measured engine-out emissions show lower unburnt hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions for PFI position A. This is argued to be due to reduced wall wetting because the surface boiling of ethanol droplets occurred on the hot valve seat and intake port wall. It is also found that the effect of the PFI position on global parameters, such as in-cylinder pressure, apparent heat release rate, and mean effective pressure, is much less significant than the effect of ethanol energy fraction. The maximum ethanol fraction is limited by misfiring associated with over-retarded combustion phasing. This limit is found to be higher for PFI position A because the wall-wetting is less problematic, consistent with the carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions trend.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3aboiling 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3adroplet size 3adroplets 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aheat 3aimage analysis 3aspark ignition engines1 aKook, Sanghoon1 aHawkes, Evatt R.0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Jan. 16, v. 28, no. 1 p.340-348dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef401479s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06490naa a2201165 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005600146245022900202300002000431520257400451592002803025650001103053650001203064650001303076650001203089650002203101650002003123650001403143650001903157650001103176650001203187650001503199650001303214650001803227650001703245650002903262650001303291650004403304653005903348653007903407653003703486653003603523653003903559653006303598700005403661700002003715700001703735700002003752700002003772700007003792700005503862700002203917700002503939700002303964700002403987700001804011700002004029700001604049700002504065700001904090700001504109700001504124700001404139700002304153700002004176700001604196700001904212700001704231700002004248700002104268700001904289700001804308700001504326700001904341700001404360700003404374700002504408700002104433700005804454700002204512700006004534700001904594700001704613700001904630700002104649700002704670700001404697700002604711700002104737700002104758700002204779700002004801700001704821700001804838700002104856700002004877700001904897700002604916700005204942700005404994700002405048773015005072856008105222852000905303655001205312IND60756054420220219000000.0211110e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075605442DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c044372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Jon W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0116-288010aMultilaboratory Collaborative Study of a Nontarget Data Acquisition for Target Analysis (nDATA) Workflow Using Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Accurate Mass Spectrometry for Pesticide Screening in Fruits and Vegetables  ap. 13200-13216.  aNontarget data acquisition for target analysis (nDATA) workflows using liquid chromatography-high-resolution accurate mass (LC-HRAM) spectrometry, spectral screening software, and a compound database have generated interest because of their potential for screening of pesticides in foods. However, these procedures and particularly the instrument processing software need to be thoroughly evaluated before implementation in routine analysis. In this work, 25 laboratories participated in a collaborative study to evaluate an nDATA workflow on high moisture produce (apple, banana, broccoli, carrot, grape, lettuce, orange, potato, strawberry, and tomato). Samples were extracted in each laboratory by quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS), and data were acquired by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to a high-resolution quadrupole Orbitrap (QOrbitrap) or quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer operating in full-scan mass spectrometry (MS) data-independent tandem mass spectrometry (LC-FS MS/DIA MS/MS) acquisition mode. The nDATA workflow was evaluated using a restricted compound database with 51 pesticides and vendor processing software. Pesticide identifications were determined by retention time (tR, ±0.5 min relative to the reference retention times used in the compound database) and mass errors (δM) of the precursor (RTP, δM ≤ ±5 ppm) and product ions (RTPI, δM ≤ ±10 ppm). The elution profiles of all 51 pesticides were within ±0.5 min among 24 of the participating laboratories. Successful screening was determined by false positive and false negative rates of <5% in unfortified (pesticide-free) and fortified (10 and 100 μg/kg) produce matrices. Pesticide responses were dependent on the pesticide, matrix, and instrument. The false negative rates were 0.7 and 0.1% at 10 and 100 μg/kg, respectively, and the false positive rate was 1.1% from results of the participating LC-HRAM platforms. Further evaluation was achieved by providing produce samples spiked with pesticides at concentrations blinded to the laboratories. Twenty-two of the 25 laboratories were successful in identifying all fortified pesticides (0–7 pesticides ranging from 5 to 50 μg/kg) for each produce sample (99.7% detection rate). These studies provide convincing evidence that the nDATA comprehensive approach broadens the screening capabilities of pesticide analyses and provide a platform with the potential to be easily extended to a larger number of other chemical residues and contaminants in foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapples 3abananas 3abroccoli 3acarrots 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3afood chemistry 3agrapes 3alettuce 3apesticides 3apotatoes 3aspectrometers 3astrawberries 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atomatoes 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0anontarget data acquisition for target analysis (nDATA) 0aliquid chromatography-high-resolution accurate mass (LC-HRAM) spectrometry 0aquadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) 0aquadrupole Orbitrap (QOrbitrap) 0adata-independent acquisition (DIA) 0aquick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS)1 aWang, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5402-12191 aChang, James S.1 aChow, Willis1 aCarlson, Roland1 aRajski, Łukasz1 aFernández-Alba, Amadeo R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9715-34891 aSelf, Randy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8806-65461 aCooke, William K.1 aLock, Christopher M.1 aMercer, Gregory E.1 aMastovska, Katerina1 aSchmitz, John1 aVaclavik, Lukas1 aLi, Lingyun1 aPanawennage, Deepika1 aPang, Guo-Fang1 aZhou, Heng1 aMiao, Shui1 aHo, Clare1 aLam, Tony Chong-Ho1 aTo, Yim-Bun Sze1 aZomer, Paul1 aHung, Yu-Ching1 aLin, Shu-Wei1 aLiao, Chia-Ding1 aCulberson, Danny1 aTaylor, Tameka1 aWu, Yuansheng1 aYu, Dingyi1 aLim, Poh Leong1 aWu, Qiong1 aSchirlé-Keller, Jean-Paul X.1 aWilliams, Sheldon M.1 aJohnson, Yoko S.1 aNason, Sara L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3866-63991 aAmmirata, Michael1 aEitzer, Brian D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7760-68931 aWillis, M.

Over the past decade, our knowledge about the mayfly fauna and its ecology in South-East Europe has been growing, yet the data related to lentic assemblages remain very scarce. In this study, littoral mayfly assemblages were investigated at artificial and heavily modified lentic habitats in the Dinaric Western Balkan (n=21) and Pannonian Lowland (n=15) ecoregions. Mayfly nymphs were sampled during the summer months of 2016 or 2017. At each sampling site, ten samples were collected using a benthos hand net. A total of 21 mayfly species were recorded, though species richness per site was rather low (i.e., between zero and seven species). Cloeon dipterum (Linnaeus, 1761) was the most frequent species recorded, while Caenis horaria Linnaeus, 1758 was the most abundant. This study showed that the Croatian mayfly fauna is still growing, with the first record of Siphlonurus aestivalis Eaton, 1903 for the country. The assemblage structure was mainly dominated by lower reaches and lentic (potamal and littoral) elements and detritivores (gatherers/collectors and active filter feeders). Orthophosphates and chemical oxygen demand had the highest influence on mayfly assemblages, reflecting a higher level of pollution at sites in the Pannonian Lowland ecoregion, and consequently markedly lower mayfly abundances. As mayflies are widely used as bioindicators of freshwater ecosystems, detailed information about their assemblages in heavily modified and artificial habitats could contribute to future conservation activities of freshwater habitats and their communities. Additionally, these results could be applied in creating a monitoring system for artificial lakes according to the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenis 3abenthic organisms 3achemical oxygen demand 3acollectors 3adetritivores 3aecoregions 3aelectricity generation 3afauna 3aflood control 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3airrigation 3alakes 3alentic systems 3alittoral zone 3amonitoring 3anymphs 3aorthophosphates 3aspecies richness 3asummer 3aEurope 0aHabitat degradation 0alentic habitats 0aspecies richness 0aenvironmental factors 0anew records1 aVUČKOVIĆ, Natalija1 aMIHALJEVIĆ, Zlatko0 tJournal of limnology.g2019 Jan. 02, v. 78, no. 1dPAGEPress PublicationswJournal:12019x1129-57677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2019.18533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001800192245008000210500001900290506007600309520174800385592002802133506003702161650002202198650001602220650001002236650001802246650000902264650001802273650002602291650001502317650001402332650002702346650002002373650001302393653001702406653001502423653002802438653003102466653001902497653002002516653001402536653002302550653001802573700001702591700001902608700002002627700001702647700005802664700005502722700002502777700006002802700001602862773009402878856008602972852000903058655001203067IND60690942020221207062153.0200508e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069094202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e024752doi7 aPMC68198332pmcid7 a316875702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsser, Andres10aAcute effects of methcathinone and manganese in mice: A dose response study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAn intravenously injectable illicit drug made by mixing pseudoephedrine, potassium permanganate, vinegar and water, yielding methcathinone (Mcat) and manganese (Mn), induces an extrapyramidal syndrome with parkinsonism, dystonia, gait and balance disorders similar to manganism. Although the cause of the syndrome is largely attributed to Mn, the interaction of the drug's individual components is not known and the role of Mcat is possibly underestimated. Aim of the present study was to analyze dose-dependent behavioral effects of the mixture and its two main active components Mcat and Mn in an acute setting and determine the lethal doses of each substance.Three groups of C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with (1) the drug mixture containing 10, 25, 50, 100 or 150 mg of Mcat and respectively 1.6, 3.8, 6.9, 17.1 and 22.6 mg of Mn per kilogram of body weight; (2) 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200 or 300 mg of racemic Mcat/kg of body weight; (3) MnCl₂ 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg of body weight. Locomotor activity of the animals, various signs and time of death were recorded.Lower doses (10 and 25 mg/kg) of Mcat had a clear motor activity stimulating effect and this was clearly dose-dependent. High doses of Mcat produced epileptic seizures in 74% of the animals and became lethal with the highest doses. Similarly, the mixture had a clear dose-dependent stimulating effect and the higher doses became lethal. The LD₅₀ of the pseudoephedrine mixture was 110.2 mg of Mcat/kg and for pure Mcat 201.7 mg/kg. Mn did not prove to be lethal in doses up to 50 mg/kg, but had a strong dose dependent inhibitory effect on the animals’ behavior. Our data reveal that both Mn and Mcat have a significant role in the toxicity of the mixture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aParkinson disease 3abody weight 3adeath 3adose response 3agait 3aillicit drugs 3aintravenous injection 3alocomotion 3amanganese 3apotassium permanganate 3apseudoephedrine 3avinegars 0aNeuroscience 0aToxicology 0aBehavioral neuroscience 0aDose-response relationship 0aNervous system 0aNeurotoxicology 0aEphedrone 0aToxic parkinsonism 0aMethcathinone1 aKõks, Sulev1 aSoomets, Ursel1 aTerasmaa, Anton1 aSauk, Martin1 aEltermaa, Mall1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9651-41071 aPiip, Piret1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0496-92951 aUbhayasekera, Kumari1 aBergquist, Jonas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4597-041X1 aTaba, Pille0 tHeliyon.g2019 Sept., v. 5, no. 9 p.e02475-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e024753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007400168300001600242520108200258592002801340650001401368650001601382650001001398650004201408650001401450650003101464650001901495650001701514700002401531700002701555773009301582856008101675852000901756655001201765IND60477946020221122035022.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047794602DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-015-0561-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKAZEMZADEH, MINA10aLncRNAs: emerging players in gene regulation and disease pathogenesis  ap. 771-784.  aThe advent of next-generation sequencing has demonstrated that eukaryotic genomes are extremely complex than what were previously thought. Recent studies revealed that in addition to protein-coding genes, nonprotein-coding genes have allocated a large fraction of the genome. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes are classified as nonprotein-coding genes, serving as a molecular signal, decoy, guide and scaffold. They were suggested to play important roles in chromatin states, epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation of genes. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs and changes in their structure are associated with a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from different types of cancer and neurodegeneration to α-thalassaemia.

Natural dyeing technology, however, generally require toxic metal salt mordants to improve fastness and other functional properties; a large amount of mordants are unfixed and are discarded into wastewaters which represent dramatic environmental problems. The present work represents a cleaner production strategy by reusing wastewater of henna dyebath for the development of functional and coloured linen fabrics. The reuse of dyeing liquor was done in a systematic way and the dyed linen was characterized by several spectroscopic techniques. The analysed colour measurements, UV protection, and antioxidant property of dyed linen were very good. The obtained data in terms of chemical oxygen demand, TDS, conductivity, redox potential and pH of the bath showed that almost zero percentage of mordant salt remains in exhaust bath after three successive dyeing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3achemical oxygen demand 3acolor 3adyeing 3afunctional properties 3agreen chemistry 3alinen fabric 3amordants 3anatural dyes 3apH 3aredox potential 3aspectroscopy 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aReuse of dyebath 0aLinen 0aDyeing 0aFunctional finishing1 aKadam, Satish1 aMathur, Prasun1 aShahid-ul-Islam, 1 aSheikh, Javed0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2019 Mar., v. 11 p.17-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014000164300001400304520126300318592002801581650003601609650002001645650001801665650001901683650001601702650001101718650002101729650001701750650002001767650001401787650001401801650001401815650001001829653003501839653000901874653001001883653001401893653000901907773011901916856008202035852000902117655001202126IND60613219920221118224326.0190321e20190105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061321992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2018.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMerhi, Zaher10aCrosstalk between advanced glycation end products and vitamin D: A compelling paradigm for the treatment of ovarian dysfunction in PCOS  ap. 20-26.  aWomen with PCOS have elevated levels of the harmful advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and low serum levels of vitamin D. AGEs and their receptors may contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS and its metabolic and reproductive consequences. On the other hand, vitamin D might improve PCOS phenotype and could alleviate the detrimental effects of AGEs. A literature review using PubMed was performed. Critical analysis was carried out for articles pertaining to: 1) the role of AGEs and their receptors in the pathophysiology of PCOS, in particular ovarian dysfunction, and 2) the action of vitamin D in attenuating the adverse effects of AGEs in women with PCOS at both the serum and the cellular levels. Data from in vitro experiments, animal models, and human studies provide compelling evidence that AGEs and their receptors may contribute to the pathogenesis of ovarian dysfunction in PCOS. The actions of AGEs in PCOS might be attenuated and/or reversed by the presence or supplementation of vitamin D. Once a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between AGEs and vitamin D is established, this knowledge might contribute to the subsequent development of new-targeted pharmacological therapies for improving ovarian health in women with PCOS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aadverse effects 3aanimal models 3aanimal ovaries 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3avitamin D 3awomen 0aAdvanced glycation end product 0aRAGE 0asRAGE 0aVitamin D 0aPCOS0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2019 Jan. 05, v. 479 p.20-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2018.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012300161300001600284520136400300592002801664650001101692650001601703650001201719650001801731650001901749650002001768650001301788650001001801650002201811650001001833650001001843650002101853650001501874651001301889700002401902700002501926700002501951773017101976856007302147852000902220655001202229IND60478973020221120193938.0160116e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047897302DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.122342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoche, Kristen N.10aVertical distribution of fruit‐feeding butterflies with evidence of sex‐specific differences in a Tanzanian forest  ap. 480-486.  aTropical forests accommodate rich species diversity, particularly among insects. Habitat heterogeneity along the vertical gradient extending from the forest understorey to the tree canopy influences diversity. The vertical distribution of forest insects is poorly understood across Africa, most especially eastern Africa. Food‐baited traps were used to study the vertical stratification of adult fruit‐feeding nymphalid butterflies in Mtai Forest Reserve, north‐eastern Tanzania. Traps were located in the forest canopy and understorey. A total of 277 individuals of 24 species were captured. Species composition differed by trap locations: 33% of the species captured were found in both the canopy and understorey strata; however, significantly more species were captured in the understorey (54%) than canopy (13%). Males were significantly more abundant than females and captured in both strata. A greater proportion of females were captured in the understorey than the canopy. The time of day affected capture rates, with more individuals caught in the afternoon; however, there was no association between the time period and the sex of individuals captured in canopy versus understorey locations. Understanding how the sexes of butterflies vary in understorey versus canopy offers new biological insights into the vertical stratification of insects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abutterflies 3afemales 3aforest canopy 3aforest insects 3aforest reserves 3ahabitats 3amales 3aspecies diversity 3atraps 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aunderstory 3aTanzania1 aPiorkowski, Jill M.1 aSanyaolu, Rasheed A.1 aCordeiro, Norbert J.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 53, no. 4 p.480-486dPublished for the East African Wild Life Society by Blackwell Scientific Publicationsx0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.122343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02111naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245012100206300001800327506007600345520084500421592002801266506003701294650002501331650001101356650003501367650001301402650001101415650001301426650001801439650002201457700001801479700002401497773011401521856008101635852000901716655001201725IND60082549920221207143400.0141029e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008254992DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-013-1554-32doi7 aPMC40313942pmcid7 a244424772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinha, Sanjay10aEmbryonic origins of human vascular smooth muscle cells: implications for in vitro modeling and clinical application  ap. 2271-2288.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) arise from multiple origins during development, raising the possibility that differences in embryological origins between SMCs could contribute to site-specific localization of vascular diseases. In this review, we first examine the developmental pathways and embryological origins of vascular SMCs and then discuss in vitro strategies for deriving SMCs from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We then review in detail the potential for vascular disease modeling using iPSC-derived SMCs and consider the pathological implications of heterogeneous embryonic origins. Finally, we touch upon the role of human ESC-derived SMCs in therapeutic revascularization and the challenges remaining before regenerative medicine using ESC- or iPSC-derived cells comes of age.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aembryonic stem cells 3ahumans 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amedicine 3amodels 3amyocytes 3asmooth muscle 3avascular diseases1 aIyer, Dharini1 aGranata, Alessandra0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2014 June, v. 71, no. 12 p.2271-2288dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-013-1554-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010900153300001600262520151300278592002801791650000801819650001901827650001501846650001701861650001701878650002001895650001301915650002001928650001101948650001101959650001001970650002701980650001602007650002102023700001702044700002102061700002302082773010202105856007502207852000902282655001202291IND60534115520221120095329.0160802e20140116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053411552DNAL7 a10.1021/ef401485p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Hui10aDevelopment of a Cu–Mg-Based Oxygen Carrier with SiO2 as a Support for Chemical Looping Air Separation  ap. 163-172.  aChemical looping air separation (CLAS) is considered as a novel process for the economic production of oxygen in the advanced clean coal technologies, such as oxy-fuel combustion and integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC). In the CLAS process, oxygen is separated from air via the cyclic redox reactions of oxygen carriers, i.e., the oxidation in air and the reduction under the inert gases, such as steam and/or CO₂. The performance of the oxygen carrier, therefore, plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of the CLAS process and its operating costs. The present study is aiming for the development of an impregnated Cu–Mg-based oxygen carrier with SiO₂ as a support for CLAS, with a particular focus on improving the long-term stability of the CuO/SiO₂ carrier. The reactivity of Cu–Mg–SiO₂ oxygen carriers was evaluated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at the temperatures between 850 and 950 °C in air and N₂ environments for the oxidation and reduction, respectively. The results indicated that all Cu–Mg-based oxygen carriers appear to have better stability compared to the CuO/SiO₂ monometallic oxygen carriers. Generally, it was observed that the oxygen carriers with a higher MgO content had a higher reactivity, in particular, for the reduction process. The Cu–Mg-based oxygen carriers with an optimum weight ratio of MgO/CuO, viz., no less than 1:2, exhibited the most stable performance among all of the studied carriers for 41 redox cycles test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3acupric oxide 3agasification 3amagnesium oxide 3anitrogen 3aoperating costs 3aoxygen 3asilica 3asteam 3asustainable technology 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aShah, Kalpit1 aDoroodchi, Elham1 aMoghtaderi, Behdad0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2014 Jan. 16, v. 28, no. 1 p.163-172dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fef401485p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013200170500002200302520103400324592002801358650001501386650002901401650001901430650001701449650002001466650002201486650002501508650001401533650001801547650000901565650001001574651001001584651001101594651001601605653001801621653003201639653002801671653003101699653003001730700006001760700001501820700002001835700001901855773018901874856008302063852000902146655001202155IND60625452020221117000841.0190417e20181126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062545202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japb.2018.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsubota, Kazumasa10aMolecular phylogenetic relationships among populations of Sagittaria aginashi Makino (Alismataceae) and endemic Chinese species  aPre-press version  aThe aquatic plant Sagittaria aginashi, which is an endangered emergent species distributed in South Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East, has an unclear phylogeny and genetic structure. Phylogenetic trees of Sagittaria were constructed based on one nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) region and on three chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) regions. S. aginashi was included in a clade comprising three endemic Chinese Sagitarria species characterized by the presence of small tubercles at the base of the axils. Furthermore, phylogenetic trees based on cpDNA sequences indicated that S. aginashi was more closely related to S. tengtsungensis than to two other species. S. aginashi exhibited little genetic variation, suggesting that this species had rapidly spread in these areas. With regard to factors associated with the rapid spread, we considered that multiple dispersal methods were involved, namely hydrochory via tubercles, endozoochorous long-distance dispersal, and anthropogenic impacts of rice farming on S. aginashi dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSagittaria 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic plants 3abiodiversity 3achloroplast DNA 3agenetic variation 3anucleotide sequences 3aparaphyly 3aribosomal DNA 3arice 3atrees 3aJapan 3aRussia 3aSouth Korea 0aAquatic plant 0aInternal-transcribed spacer 0aSagittaria lichuanensis 0aSagittaria potamogetifolia 0aSagittaria tengtsungensis1 aShutoh, Kohtaroh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2601-43741 aKato, Syou1 aChoi, Hyeok Jae1 aShiga, Takashi0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific biodiversity(Online).g2018 Nov. 26, dElsevier B.V.aNational Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)wJournal:23211x2287-884X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2018.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04088naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245008300178300001600261500002000277520255500297592002802852650002302880650002002903650001202923650002102935650002002956650001302976650002202989650001503011650002403026650000903050650001703059650001803076650001603094650001003110650002103120650002003141651001303161700002603174700002903200700002403229700003103253700003403284700002403318700001403342773011703356856008803473852000903561655001203570IND60596395420221122231924.0180619e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059639542DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00815.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhillips, Oliver L.10aHabitat association among Amazonian tree species: a landscape‐scale approach  ap. 757-775.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1 Unravelling which factors affect where tropical trees grow is an important goal for ecologists and conservationists. At the landscape scale, debate is mostly focused on the degree to which the distributions of tree species are determined by soil conditions or by neutral, distance‐dependent processes. Problems with spatial autocorrelation, sparse soil sampling, inclusion of species‐poor sites with extreme edaphic conditions, and the difficulty of obtaining sufficient sample sizes have all complicated assessments for high diversity tropical forests. 2 We evaluated the extent and pervasiveness of habitat association of trees within a 10 000 km² species‐rich lowland landscape of uniform climate in south‐west Amazonia. Forests growing on two non‐flooded landscape units were inventoried using 88 floristic plots and detailed soil analyses, sampling up to 849 tree species. We applied single‐species and community‐level analytical techniques (frequency‐distributions of presence records, association analysis, indicator species analysis, ordination, Mantel correlations, and multiple regression of distance matrices) to quantify soil/floristic relationships while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. 3 Obligate habitat‐restriction is very rare: among 230 tree species recorded in ≥ 10 localities only five (2.2%) were always restricted to one landscape unit or the other. 4 However, many species show a significant tendency to habitat association. For example, using Monte Carlo randomization tests, of the 34 most dominant species across the landscape the distributions of 26 (76.5%) are significantly related to habitat. We applied density‐independent and frequency‐independent estimates of habitat association and found that rarer species tend to score higher, suggesting that our full community estimates of habitat association are still underestimated due to the inadequate sampling of rarer species. 5 Community‐level floristic variation across the whole landscape is related to the variation in 14 of 16 measured soil variables, and to the geographical distances between samples. 6 Multiple regression of distance matrices shows that 10% of the floristic variation can be attributed to spatial autocorrelation, but even after accounting for this at least 40% is attributable to measured environmental variation. 7 Our results suggest that substrate‐mediated local processes play a much more important role than distance‐dependent processes in structuring forest composition in Amazonian landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aautocorrelation 3aclimate 3adominant species 3aedaphic factors 3ahabitats 3aindicator species 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3atree growth 3atrees 3atropical forests 3atropical plants 3aAmazonia1 aVargas, Percy Núñez1 aMonteagudo, Abel Lorenzo1 aCruz, Antonio Peña1 aZans, Maria‐Elena Chuspe1 aGaliano Sánchez, Washington,1 aYli‐Halla, Markku1 aRose, Sam0 tjournal of ecology.g2003 Oct., v. 91, no. 5 p.757-775dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00815.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245007200179300001800251500000900269500001500278520230800293592002802601650002202629650002302651650001902674650002202693650001402715650001402729650001502743650002102758650001702779650002302796653001402819653001002833700001702843700002002860773012302880852000903003856009803012655001203110IND9000710320221119164933.0191122e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900071032DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1989.0011183X002900060011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArrendell, S.10aGenetic Variability and Selection for Acetylene Reduction in Peanut  ap. 1387-1392.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aEffective manipulation of the symbiotic relationship between peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and Bradyrhizobium is aided by an understanding of the genetic mechanisms governing the host contribution. This study was conducted to obtain genetic variance estimates and evaluate the effectiveness of selection for acetylene reduction. The population under study consisted of 80 F₅ lines derived from the single cross of the Virginia-type ‘Florigiant’ and the Spanish-type ‘CES 101’. Estimates of genetic variance components for acetylene reduction were obtained at three sampling dates at each of two locations. Standard errors of the estimates were generally large; however, the tendency was for additive genetic variance to be important at Dates 1 and 3 and for the additive ✕ additive genetic variance to be important at Date 2. The five lines with the highest mean acetylene reduction and the five with the lowest mean acetylene reduction were selected and evaluated in the F₆ generation. The mean acetylene reduction of the high selection group, 79.1 μmoles C₂H₄ plant⁻¹ h⁻¹, was significantly greater than the mean of the low selection group, 52.2 μmoles C2H4 plant-1 h-1, but not different from the mean of the better parent, 89.9 μmoles C₂H₄ plant⁻¹ h⁻¹. Twenty-eight vegetative, fruit, and seed characters were used to assign the selected lines and original parents to morphological groups. Variability for these traits existed within each of the selection groups. selected lines, regardless of selection group, did not group with either parent. Adequate genetic variability existed in this late generation population and host genotypes with differing abilities to fix N₂ were identified by selection. When the breeding objective is improvement of the N₂-fixing ability of Spanish-type peanuts, direct selection for morphological characters may be required if the base population has been derived from a Virginia ✕ Spanish cross.

Despite this, environmental management is still dominated by a natural science approach with little input from disciplines that are concerned with the relationship between humans and the natural environment such as environmental psychology. Within the marine and freshwater environments, this is particularly concerning given the cultural and aesthetic significance of these environments to the public, coupled with the services delivered by freshwater and marine ecosystems, and the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to human-driven environmental perturbations. This paper documents nine case studies which use environmental psychology methods to support a range of aquatic management goals. Examples include understanding the drivers of public attitudes towards ecologically important but uncharismatic river species, impacts of marine litter on human well-being, efficacy of small-scale governance of tropical marine fisheries and the role of media in shaping attitudes towards. These case studies illustrate how environmental psychology and natural sciences can be used together to apply an interdisciplinary approach to the management of aquatic environments. Such an approach that actively takes into account the range of issues surrounding aquatic environment management is more likely to result in successful outcomes, from both human and environmental perspectives. Furthermore, the results illustrate that better understanding the societal importance of aquatic ecosystems can reduce conflict between social needs and ecological objectives, and help improve the governance of aquatic ecosystems. Thus, this paper concludes that an effective relationship between academics and practitioners requires fully utilising the skills, knowledge and experience from both sectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aaquatic environment 3acase studies 3aenvironmental management 3afreshwater 3agovernance 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine fisheries 3apsychology 3apublic opinion 3arivers 0aConservation 0aMarine 0aFreshwater 0aEnvironmental management 0aHuman well-being 0aEnvironmental values1 aJefferson, Rebecca1 aBöck, Kerstin1 aBreckwoldt, Annette1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5976-45371 aComby, Émeline,1 aCottet, Marylise1 aHübner, Gundula1 aLe Lay, Yves-François1 aShaw, Sylvie1 aWyles, Kayleigh0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Jan. 15, v. 166 p.525-536dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245022800169520128000397592002801677650002401705650000801729650002101737650002301758650001501781650001001796650001801806650002701824650001301851651001701864700002201881700002401903700001901927700001701946700002301963773012301986856008202109852000902191655001202200IND60781052920221117234141.0220623e20220620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078105292DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens110607092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoosen, Wynand J.10aCulture-Independent PCR Detection and Differentiation of Mycobacteria spp. in Antemortem Respiratory Samples from African Elephants (Loxodonta Africana) and Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium Simum, Diceros Bicornis) in South Africa  aSince certain Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) members, such as M. bovis, are endemic in specific South African wildlife reserves and zoos, cases of clinically important nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in wildlife may be neglected. Additionally, due to the inability of tests to differentiate between the host responses to MTBC and NTM, the diagnosis of MTBC may be confounded by the presence of NTMs. This may hinder control efforts. These constraints highlight the need for enhanced rapid detection and differentiation methods for MTBC and NTM, especially in high MTBC burden areas. We evaluated the use of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF Ultra, the Hain CMdirect V1.0 line probe assay, and novel amplicon sequencing PCRs targeting the mycobacterial rpoB and ku gene targets, directly on antemortem African elephant (n = 26) bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (n = 22) and trunk washes (n = 21) and rhinoceros (n = 23) BALF (n = 23), with known MTBC culture-positive and NTM culture-positive results. Our findings suggest that the Ultra is the most sensitive diagnostic test for MTBC DNA detection directly in raw antemortem respiratory specimens and that the rpoB PCR is ideal for Mycobacterium genus DNA detection and species identification through amplicon sequencing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeratotherium simum 3aDNA 3aDiceros bicornis 3aLoxodonta africana 3aRhinoceros 3agenes 3arapid methods 3aspecies identification 3awildlife 3aSouth Africa1 aClarke, Charlene 1 aKleynhans, Léanie 1 aKerr, Tanya J.1 aBuss, Peter 1 aMiller, Michele A.0 tPathogens.g2022 June 20, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens110607093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245010000165520101100265592002801276650002101304650002401325650001201349650001201361650002301373650001801396650001901414650002101433653001801454653002201472653001901494653001001513653001101523653002101534700001801555700001801573700001801591700001601609700001701625700001801642700001901660700002001679773010601699856008701805852000901892655001201901IND60733199020221118014512.0210527e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073319902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1251072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jing10aGreen, efficient extraction of bamboo hemicellulose using freeze-thaw assisted alkali treatment  aThe premise of high value utilization of lignocellulosic biomass is effective separation of hemicellulose. In this paper, the extraction of bamboo hemicellulose using freeze-thaw assisted alkali treatment (FAT) was studied. The effect of alkali concentration, alkali treatment time, freezing temperature, and freeze-thaw time on the main components was studied. Bamboo was frozen at −30 °C for 12 h, thawed at room temperature, and then treated at 75 °C for 90 min with 7.0% alkali. The extraction rate of hemicellulose was as high as 64.71%. The purity of hemicellulose samples using conventional AT decreased from 82.63% to 78.56%. Hemicellulose with the same yield as that of conventional alkali treatment was obtained by further reducing the alkali concentration. The purity of hemicellulose samples increased from 82.63% to 89.45%. It had a higher purity, higher molecular weight, and lower polydispersity. A new, green and efficient alkaline extraction method for hemicellulose was developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkali treatment 3aambient temperature 3abamboos 3abiomass 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahemicellulose 3alignocellulose 3amolecular weight 0aHemicellulose 0aAlkali extraction 0aFreeze thawing 0aYield 0aPurity 0aMolecular weight1 aLiu, Zhaomeng1 aFeng, Chengqi1 aLiu, Xiaoying1 aQin, Fangyu1 aLiang, Zhen,1 aBian, Huiyang1 aQin, Chengrong1 aYao, Shuangquan0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Aug., v. 333 p.125107-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1251073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245009300206300002000299520134000319592002801659650001701687650001501704650001901719650001201738650001901750650002201769650001601791650001501807650001601822650001401838650001301852650001301865650001601878653001701894653002001911653002501931653002001956700001601976700001701992700001102009700001802020700001602038700005702054700001902111700001602130773015002146856008102296852000902377655001202386IND60756054720221120114421.0211110e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075605472DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.1c047252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jing Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5293-126710aS-Glycosylation of Fluensulfone in Tomatoes: An Important Way of Fluensulfone Metabolism  ap. 12974-12984.  aFluensulfone (FSF) becomes increasingly popular because of its nonfumigation application method. However, studies on the metabolic mechanism of FSF in plants are lacking. Here, tomato seedling was cultivated in hydroponic media to investigate the connection among FSF’s metabolism in tomato, the regulation of tomato endogenous glycosides, and the elimination of hydrogen peroxide in tomato cells. The accumulation of FSF was only detected in the lower stems of tomatoes; FSF was mainly metabolized into S-glycosylated conjugates in the roots, and the roots were the tissues with the highest metabolite content; and no FSF and metabolites were detected in the upper leaves. In response to FSF stress (2 mg/L for 7 d), the content of sugar and glycosides in the stems of tomato seedlings significantly increased. The amount of some compounds on the pathway related to glucose was affected by FSF. The three precursor compounds (homomethioine, isoleucine, and l-tyrosine) in the pathway of glucosinolate biosynthesis increased significantly under the stress of FSF, which indicates that FSF may compete with them for UGT74B1. Besides, FSF-induced flavonoid glycosides may play a role in the process of removing hydrogen peroxide. This research provides inspiration for the fate of many xenobiotics containing sulfonyl groups in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3aflavonoids 3afood chemistry 3aglucose 3aglucosinolates 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydroponics 3aisoleucine 3ametabolites 3aseedlings 3atomatoes 3atyrosine 3axenobiotics 0afluensulfone 0aS-glycosylation 0aflavonoid glycosides 0arisk assessment1 aCao, Wanxue1 aXi, Pengxuan1 aLi, Li1 aQiao, Songtao1 aLuo, Huawei1 aZhang, Jianye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3801-78901 aLiu, Xiangyang1 aDu, Nanshan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 69, no. 44 p.12974-12984dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c047253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03824naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003800132024002200170024001900192040001800211100002200229245006700251506007600318506017300394520193800567506003702505650002602542650001602568650002002584650002102604650001002625650001502635650001002650650002702660650001902687650002602706650002202732651001602754700002102770700002502791700002102816700002002837700002002857773008202877856011202959856008403071956013303155961000903288852000903297655001203306IND60006132120221214225010.0150901e20150826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000613212DNAL7 a3163652aris7 a10113/613212hdl7 a10.1371/journal.pone.01365802doi7 aPMC45504202pmcid7 a263085522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar, Jonathan10aCrop species diversity changes in the United States: 1978-2012  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aAnecdotal accounts regarding reduced US cropping system diversity have raised concerns about negative impacts of increasingly homogeneous cropping systems. However, formal analyses to document such changes are lacking. Using US Agriculture Census data, which is collected on 5-year intervals, we quantified crop species diversity from 1978 to 2012, for the contiguous US on a county level basis. We then evaluated changes in county level crop diversity both nationally and for each of the eight Farm Resource Regions developed by the National Agriculture Statistics Service. We used Shannon diversity index values expressed as effective number of crop species (ENCS) to determine crop diversity. Over the 34 years, both national and regional ENCS changed. Nationally, crop diversity was lower in 2012 than in 1978. However, the analysis also revealed interesting trends between and within different Resource Regions. The Heartland Resource Region was generally had the lowest crop diversity while the Fruitful Rim and Northern Crescent had the highest. In contrast to the other Resource Regions, the Mississippi Portal had significantly higher crop diversity in 2012 than in 1978. There were also differences within regions with some counties having greater diversity than others within a region. Spatial autocorrelation revealed clustering of low and high ENCS and this trend became stronger over time. This suggests, that nationally, counties are clustering into areas of either low diversity or high diversity. Moreover, a significant trend of more counties shifting to lower rather than to higher crop diversity was detected. This clustering and shifting demonstrates a trend toward crop diversity loss and attendant homogenization of agricultural production systems, which could have far-reaching consequences for provision of ecosystem system services associated with agricultural systems as well as food system sustainability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCensus of Agriculture 3aagriculture 3aautocorrelation 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aecosystems 3afarms 3ageographical variation 3ahomogenization 3aproduction technology 3aspecies diversity 3aMississippi1 aGramig, Greta R.1 aHendrickson, John R.1 aArcher, David W.1 aForcella, Frank1 aLiebig, Mark A.0 tPLosOne.g2015, v. 10, no. 8 p.e0136580-wJournal:jnl4277198x1932-62037nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/613213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.01365803Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Publ1203%20JA%2C%20JRH%2C%20DWA%2C%20MAL%2C%20et%20al.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245009400185500002200279520111800301592002801419650002401447650001701471650001801488650001901506650001101525650002101536650002301557650002801580650001501608650001801623650002101641650002201662650001201684650001301696650002001709653001501729653002201744653002101766653002901787653001901816700002501835700002001860700002001880700001901900700001201919700002901931773010401960856008702064852000902151655001202160IND60794659820221120165922.0220929e20220921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079465982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1280212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinda Mgbechidinma, Chiamaka10aIntegration of Green Economy Concepts for Sustainable Biosurfactant Production - A Review  aPre-press version  aThe link between increasing global population, food demand, industrialization, and agricultural waste is strong. Decomposing by-products from food cycles can introduce harmful toxic heavy metals, active degrading microbes, and enzymes to the environment. Additionally, high greenhouse gas emissions from the decomposing wastes contribute to global change and a high carbon economy. The bioeconomy and circular economy of biosurfactant production utilize these cheap feedstocks and promote waste to valuable product initiatives. Waste reduction, reuse, and recycling in an integrating green economy bioprocess ensure the sustainability of novel, cost-effective, safe, and renewable health-grade biosurfactants. This work reviews green economy concepts integration with sustainable biosurfactant production and its application in health-related industries. Benefits from recent advances in the production, characterization, and health-wise classification of biosurfactants were further discussed, including its limitations, techno-economic assessment, market evaluations, possible roadblocks, and future directions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3abioeconomics 3abioprocessing 3abiosurfactants 3acarbon 3acircular economy 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic sustainability 3afeedstocks 3aglobal change 3agreenhouse gases 3aindustrialization 3amarkets 3atoxicity 3awaste reduction 0aBioeconomy 0aCarbon neutrality 0aCircular economy 0aIntegrated green economy 0aSustainability1 aDonald Akan, Otobong1 aZhang, Chunfang1 aHuang, Mengzhen1 aLinus, Nsemeke1 aZhu, He1 aMonilola Wakil, Sherifah0 tBioresource technology.g2022 Sept. 21,  p.128021-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1280213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006800156300002000224520135100244592002801595650001301623650001401636650002201650650002001672650001101692650001501703650001301718650001301731650001601744650001101760653002601771653002801797653001601825700001901841700001701860700002001877700001701897700001701914773012901931856007302060852000902133655001202142IND60527761020221121024601.0160715e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052776102DNAL7 a10.1021/am50552992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jinghang10aSolvent Vapor Annealing of Ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) Thin Films  ap. 18312-18318.  aFerroelectric polymers are a kind of promising materials for low-cost flexible memories. However, the relatively high thermal annealing temperature restricts the selection of some flexible polymer substrates. Here we report an alternative method to obtain ferroelectric poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) thin films under low process temperatures. Spin-coated P(VDF-TrFE) thin films were solvent vapor processed at 30 °C for varied times. Structural analyses indicated that solvent vapor annealing induced crystallization to form a ferroelectric β phase, and electrical measurements from both macroscopic ferroelectric switching and microscopic vertical piezoresponse force microscopy further proved the films enduring solvent vapor annealing for suitable short times possessed good ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. To illuminate the application of solvent vapor annealing on ferroelectric devices, we further fabricated ferroelectric capacitor memory devices with a structure of Al/P(VDF-TrFE)/Al₂O₃/p-Si/Al where the ferroelectric layer was solvent vapor annealed. Ferroelectric capacitors showed obvious bistable operation and comparable ON/OFF ratio and retention performance. Our work makes it possible to structure ferroelectric devices on flexible substrates that require low process temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aannealing 3acomputer hardware 3acrystallization 3amemory 3amicroscopy 3apolymers 3asolvents 3atemperature 3avapors 0aferroelectric polymer 0asolvent vapor annealing 0aP(VDF-TrFE)1 aZhang, Jianchi1 aFu, Zongyuan1 aJiang, Youlong,1 aDing, Shijin1 aZhu, Guodong0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Oct. 22, v. 6, no. 20 p.18312-18318dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am50552993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002700124024003400151040001800185100001600203245012400219300001600343500002000359506002800379506003000407520137100437592002801808596005501836596004501891596006101936506003701997650001602034650001302050650000802063650002502071650001902096650002002115650001002135650001402145650001502159650001202174650002402186650001502210650001302225650002302238650001702261650002902278700001502307700002302322700001502345700002302360700001702383700002402400700001702424700002102441700002002462700001802482700002002500700001902520700002002539700006202559773011602621856007302737903002202810852000902832655001202841IND60596954720221207085052.0180622e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059695472DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.151792chorus7 a10.1111/nph.151792doi7 a10.1111/nph.151792chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Anju14aThe novel cyst nematode effector protein 30D08 targets host nuclear functions to alter gene expression in feeding sites  ap. 697-713.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aCyst nematodes deliver effector proteins into host cells to manipulate cellular processes and establish a metabolically hyperactive feeding site. The novel 30D08 effector protein is produced in the dorsal gland of parasitic juveniles, but its function has remained unknown. We demonstrate that expression of 30D08 contributes to nematode parasitism, the protein is packaged into secretory granules and it is targeted to the plant nucleus where it interacts with SMU2 (homolog of suppressor of mec‐8 and unc‐52 2), an auxiliary spliceosomal protein. We show that SMU2 is expressed in feeding sites and an smu2 mutant is less susceptible to nematode infection. In Arabidopsis expressing 30D08 under the SMU2 promoter, several genes were found to be alternatively spliced and the most abundant functional classes represented among differentially expressed genes were involved in RNA processing, transcription and binding, as well as in development, and hormone and secondary metabolism, representing key cellular processes known to be important for feeding site formation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the 30D08 effector is secreted from the nematode and targeted to the plant nucleus where its interaction with a host auxiliary spliceosomal protein may alter the pre‐mRNA splicing and expression of a subset of genes important for feeding site formation.  aPublisher supplied data  cDuPont Pioneerdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010263  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUnited Soybean Boarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000120090 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aNematoda 3aRNA 3aalternative splicing 3acyst nematodes 3agene expression 3agenes 3ajuveniles 3ametabolism 3amutants 3anematode infections 3aparasitism 3aproteins 3asecretory granules 3aspliceosomes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLee, Chris1 aMorriss, Stephanie1 aOdu, Fiona1 aKenning, Charlotte1 aRizzo, Nancy1 aSpollen, William G.1 aLin, Marriam1 aMcRae, Amanda G.1 aGivan, Scott A.1 aHewezi, Tarek1 aHussey, Richard1 aDavis, Eric L.1 aBaum, Thomas J.1 aMitchum, Melissa G.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9086-63120 tnew phytologist.g2018 July, v. 219, no. 2 p.697-713dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.151793Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013700171300001600308520122600324536021001550592002801760596012901788650002001917650002101937650001801958650002801976650002202004650002502026650001802051653002102069653001402090653002402104653001502128700002002143700001202163700001602175773015202191856008502343852000902428655001202437IND60596948020221116145314.0180622e20180409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059694802DNAL7 a10.1080/03067319.2018.14789682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tong-Tong10aSimple and sensitive determination of hydroxyl radical in atmosphere based on an electrochemically activated glassy carbon electrode  ap. 477-491.  aThe hydroxyl radical (•OH) plays important roles in environment and health problems. However, the short life time and low concentrations of •OH limited its detection. In this work, a simple method has been successfully performed for the sensitive detection of hydroxyl radical based on an activated glassy carbon electrode (AGCE).4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) was used as a trapping agent for •OH radicals, leading to the production of electroactive 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHBA). Different procedures including polarisation and cyclic voltammetry in acid or base solutions have been used to activate the glassy carbon electrodes. The electrochemical behaviours of 3,4-DHBA on these activated electrodes were studied and compared. Experimental results showed that the glassy carbon electrode polarised in H₂SO₄ (AGCE-P/H₂SO₄) has the greatest sensitivity and reproducibility to 3,4-DHBA. 3,4-DHBA performed a linear relationship from 1.0 × 10⁻⁷ to 1.0 × 10⁻⁴ M on the AGCE-P/H₂SO₄. The detection limit was down to 6.2 × 10⁻⁸ M. This method has been successfully applied for the detection of hydroxyl radical levels in atmosphere without separation and purification process.  aThe authors gratefully acknowledge NSFC [21575124, 21675140, 21275124 and 21275125], the High-end Talent Project of Yangzhou University and the 14th Six talent peaks project in Jiangsu Province [SWYY-085].  aPublisher supplied data  a21575124 21675140 21275124 and 21275125cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3afree radicals 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ahydroxyl radicals 3apurification methods 3asulfuric acid 0aHydroxyl radical 0adetection 0aactivated electrode 0aatmosphere1 aHuang, Zhi-Ling1 aXu, Qin1 aHu, Xiao-Ya0 tInternational journal of environmental analytical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 9, v. 98, no. 5 p.477-491dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12218x1029-03977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2018.14789683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245015300168300001800321520166000339592002801999596005702027596004802084596006002132596003402192596002902226650001502255650001602270650001002286650001402296650001302310650001502323650002302338650001402361650002802375650001102403650001602414650002602430650001602456650001702472650001402489650001402503650002202517650001702539650001002556650002902566651001102595653002102606653002702627653002502654653001702679653002502696653001302721700001702734700001402751700001802765700001802783700002002801700002202821700001902843700001902862773014502881856007903026852000903105655001203114IND60751199320221122183312.0210923e20171201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075119932DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.117.1643842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSemba, Richard D.,10aLow serum ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and other metabolites are associated with poor linear growth in young children from rural Malawi  ap. 1490-1499.  aBackground: Stunting affects ∼25% of children <5 y of age and is associated with impaired cognitive and motor development and increased morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of stunting is poorly understood. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify altered metabolic pathways associated with child stunting. Design: We measured 677 serum metabolites using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry in a cross-sectional study of 400 Malawian children aged 12–59 mo, of whom 62% were stunted. Results: A low height-for-age z score (HAZ) was associated with lower serum concentrations of 1) ω-3 (n–3) and ω-6 (n–6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), 2) sulfated neurosteroids, which play a role in brain development, 3) carnitine, a conditionally essential nutrient with an important role in the carnitine shuttle for the metabolism of fatty acids and energy production, and 4) γ-glutamyl amino acids, which represent an altered γ-glutamyl cycle of glutathione metabolism. A low HAZ was associated with significantly higher serum concentrations of 5 biomarkers related to cigarette smoke exposure.

Its functional diversity is related to a conserved seven-transmembrane core and invariant set of intracellular signaling mechanisms. The interplay between these properties is key to the evolutionary success of GPCR. As this superfamily originated from a common ancestor, GPCR genes have evolved via lineage-specific duplications through the process of adaptation. Here we summarized information on GPCR gene families in rotifers and cladocerans based on their evolutionary position in aquatic invertebrates and their potential application in ecotoxicology, ecophysiology, comparative endocrinology, and pharmacology. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted to examine the evolutionary significance of GPCR gene families and to provide structural insight on their role in aquatic invertebrates. In particular, most GPCR gene families have undergone sporadic evolutionary processes, but some GPCRs are highly conserved across species despite the dynamics of GPCR evolution. Overall, this review provides a better understanding of GPCR evolution in aquatic invertebrates and expand our knowledge of the potential application of these receptors in various fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladocera 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aRotifera 3aancestry 3aecophysiology 3aecotoxicology 3aendocrinology 3aeukaryotic cells 3afunctional diversity 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3apharmacology 3aphylogeny 0aG protein-coupled receptor 0aAquatic invertebrates 0aRotifers 0aCladocerans1 aPark, Jun Chul1 aLee, Jae-seong,0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 June, v. 256 p.109297-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2022.1092973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245010200177520205500279592002802334650001402362650001702376650001202393650001102405650002202416650002502438650001602463653020302479700002502682700002802707773010702735856008802842852000902930655001202939IND60716136320221117184441.0210619e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071613632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1092842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLogofet, Dmitrii O.10aSeed bank as a persistent problem in matrix population models: From uncertainty to certain bounds  aErrors in the construction of matrix population models may lead to erroneous conclusions from modeling case studies, and neglecting the seed bank as a stage in the stage-structured model is a kind of ‘persistent problem’ common to many models of plant species. The problem arises due to uncertainties in the seed-related parameters that cannot be reliably estimated from empirical data. We investigate the consequences that including a seed bank into the underlying life cycle graph may have on λ₁, the dominant eigenvalue of the calibrated matrix in the “no-seeds” model. Vital rates of that model were calibrated on a time series of data of the 'identified individuals’ type gained in our former, 11-year case study on a local population of Androsace albana, a short-lived perennial inhabiting alpine heaths. The calibration has resulted in 10 successive population projection matrices expressed in rational numbers, with a variety of λ1s distant from 1 by various amounts in both directions. To include the seed bank, we propose an integer-valued formalism with the following three unknown S-related parameters: S(t), the number of dormant seeds able to germinate at the current year of observation, t; Sₚ(t), the number of seeds produced this year, and Sₘ(t), the total number of seeds lost this year for various reasons. These preserve the rational form of all the other vital rates and holding the calibration equations true in the integer numbers, too. Some observable traits of A. albana plants help establish certain finite ranges of the three S-related parameters, and they enable finding the ensuing ranges of model outcomes by merely enumerating all the feasible triples. In this way, we get answers to pertinent questions about the λ₁ of the seed model vs. its “no-seeds” counterpart and give a mathematical explanation of what we have obtained. An important conclusion is that the seed bank can principally not change the population growth into decline, nor vice versa, within the feasible ranges of parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrosace 3acase studies 3adecline 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 0aDiscrete-structured population • Life cycle graph • Matrix population model • Dominant eigenvalue • Seed production/mortality • Integer-valued parameters • Potential-growth indicator •1 aKazantseva, Elena S.1 aOnipchenko, Vladimir G.0 tEcological modelling.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 438 p.109284-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1092843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100001800181245010600199300001800305506007600323520197400399592002802373506003702401650002402438650001102462650001702473650001502490650002002505650002602525650001402551650001302565650001902578650001302597650001402610650001902624650001202643650001602655650003102671650001402702650002002716650001702736650002502753650001702778651001002795651001002805653002002815653002102835653001402856653001302870653002702883653001602910700001802926773010202944856007403046852000903120655001203129IND60115118220221207075935.0150202e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011511822DNAL7 a235854962pmid7 aPMC36625202pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mct0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Jianyang10aIndependent effects of warming and nitrogen addition on plant phenology in the Inner Mongolian steppe  ap. 1207-1217.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Phenology is one of most sensitive traits of plants in response to regional climate warming. Better understanding of the interactive effects between warming and other environmental change factors, such as increasing atmosphere nitrogen (N) deposition, is critical for projection of future plant phenology. Methods A 4-year field experiment manipulating temperature and N has been conducted in a temperate steppe in northern China. Phenology, including flowering and fruiting date as well as reproductive duration, of eight plant species was monitored and calculated from 2006 to 2009. Key Results Across all the species and years, warming significantly advanced flowering and fruiting time by 0·64 and 0·72 d per season, respectively, which were mainly driven by the earliest species (Potentilla acaulis). Although N addition showed no impact on phenological times across the eight species, it significantly delayed flowering time of Heteropappus altaicus and fruiting time of Agropyron cristatum . The responses of flowering and fruiting times to warming or N addition are coupled, leading to no response of reproductive duration to warming or N addition for most species. Warming shortened reproductive duration of Potentilla bifurca but extended that of Allium bidentatum , whereas N addition shortened that of A. bidentatum . No interactive effect between warming and N addition was found on any phenological event. Such additive effects could be ascribed to the species-specific responses of plant phenology to warming and N addition. Conclusions The results suggest that the warming response of plant phenology is larger in earlier than later flowering species in temperate grassland systems. The effects of warming and N addition on plant phenology are independent of each other. These findings can help to better understand and predict the response of plant phenology to climate warming concurrent with other global change driving factors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgropyron cristatum 3aAllium 3aHeteropappus 3aPotentilla 3aadditive effect 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3afruiting 3aglobal warming 3anitrogen 3aphenology 3aplant response 3asteppes 3atemperature 2aMagnoliopsidaxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aHot Temperature 2aMicroclimate 2aNitrogenxphysiology 2aReproduction 3aChina 0aChina 0aClimate warming 0afunctional group 0agrassland 0anitrogen 0areproductive phenology 0atemperature1 aWan, Shiqiang0 tAnnals of botany.g2013 June, v. 111, no. 6 p.1207-1217dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mct0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010100169300001200270520125800282592002801540650001701568650002501585650001701610650002201627650002301649650001601672650002801688650001801716650001301734650001001747650001401757650001101771650001101782650002001793650001001813650001401823650001901837650002801856650000901884650001601893700006001909700005801969773010802027856008202135852000902217655001202226IND60649399920221117235531.0190722e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064939992DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-019-2460-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Chong-wŏn,10aAnalysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with wettability in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 137.  aGlobal warming has been threatening agro-ecosystems followed with a rising pest problem. Many studies have proven that resistance is the most practical and economical approach. Some studies showed that there is a positive correlation between wettability and lignin which can play an important role as a physical barrier against pests. Therefore, identifying QTLs influencing leaf surface wettability is an important objective in order to enhance pest resistance in rice. The droplet method was introduced and collected contact angle data as a phenotype data in a CNDH population. In this study, we generated a physical map and analysis of gene information. One QTL was identified on chromosome 6. We used candidate gene approach for identifying the target gene. Although there were many other genes between the RM20355 and RM528 markers to check for selection, we however selected Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) enzyme due to its key role in lignin biosynthesis. The result of protein sequence showed NADP-binding sites which is an essential component of the CCR gene. We have to confirm the stability of genetic characteristics for further study. Then a breeding program on incorporating a CCR gene for pest resistance into germplasm could be initiated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aamino acid sequences 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding programs 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acinnamoyl-CoA reductase 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3agenes 3agermplasm 3aleaves 3alignin 3apest resistance 3apests 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3awettability1 aJan, Rahmatullah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5788-30171 aKim, Kyung-Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4812-62970 tEuphytica.g2019 July, v. 215, no. 7 p.137-137dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl52912x0014-23367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-019-2460-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013500154300002000289520097900309592002801288650001601316650001701332650002201349650001301371650002301384650001601407653002601423653002201449653001001471653001901481653001101500653001101511700002201522700002001544700002301564700001701587700001701604700003601621773012901657856007301786852000901859655001201868IND60527750720170818000000.0160715e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052775072DNAL7 a10.1021/am504608p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Shuai10aFirst Step into Space: Performance and Morphological Evolution of P3HT:PCBM Bulk Heterojunction Solar Sells under AM0 Illumination  ap. 17902-17910.  aP3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)):PC₆₁BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester) bulk heterojunction solar cells are fabricated and characterized as a function of solar intensity, temperature, and aging at vacuum conditions under illumination with AM0 illumination for testing potential use in space applications. The evolution of the inner film morphology is probed with grazing incidence X-ray scattering techniques and correlated with the evolution of the efficiency during aging. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering shows almost no change of the crystalline structure of the P3HT:PCBM films due to aging. In contrast, the morphological evolution on the mesoscale extracted from grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering can explain the observed decay of the overall efficiency. The behavior at high solar intensities as well as elevated temperatures suggests that organic solar cells have high potential for space applications in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abutyric acid 3acrystal structure 3alighting 3aphotovoltaic cells 3atemperature 0aorganic photovoltaics 0asolar intensities 0aaging 0ananomorphology 0aGISAXS 0aGIWAXS1 aBrandt, Christian1 aAndreev, Thomas1 aMetwalli, Ezzeldin1 aWang, Weijia1 aPerlich, Jan1 aMüller-Buschbaum, P.q(Peter),0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Oct. 22, v. 6, no. 20 p.17902-17910dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am504608p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245008600165300001300251520088800264592002801152650001201180650000901192650001501201650002501216650002901241650002201270650001901292650001101311650001401322650001801336651002101354653000801375653000801383653000801391653000801399653002301407653001901430653002901449653003501478653001101513700002101524773009001545856008301635852000901718655001201727IND60606899920221120201714.0180730e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060689992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcar, Sevil10aEnvironmental impacts of coal subsidies in Turkey: A general equilibrium analysis  ap. 1-15.  aIn this study we aim at providing an analytical framework for Turkey to study the macroeconomics and environmental impacts of the existing coal subsidization scheme.

With the aid of a set of alternative policy scenarios against a “business as usual” path, we study the regional and sectorial performances of growth, employment, investment and capital accumulation, consumption/welfare and trade balance. Our results indicate that by simple elimination of the coal subsidization scheme, Turkey can reduce its aggregate gaseous emissions by as much as 5% without a significant loss in its GDP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3acoal 3aemployment 3aenvironmental impact 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3amacroeconomics 3amodels 3asubsidies 3atrade balance 3aTurkey (country) 0aC68 0aO44 0aQ56 0aQ58 0aCoal subsidization 0aClimate change 0aRenewable energy sources 0aComputable general equilibrium 0aTurkey1 aYeldan, A.

Amino, thiol, hydroxyl and phenolic groups are all modified during acylation, but our results show that the decrease in settability can be attributed mainly to the modification of amino groups and to the effect that this has on the overall electrical charge on the fiber. The partial modification of thiol groups causes some decrease in settability, but only when setting is carried out in the absence of a reducing agent. Treatments with bifunctional acylating agents decrease settability further by introducing cross links between protein chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorganic production 3aalternative farming 0aSetting (Except Synthetics) 0aWool Fabrics 0aChemically Modified Protein Fibers 0aAcylation 0aChemical Modification (Fibers) 0aAmino Groups 0apH 0aSetting 0aElectrical Properties 0aCrease Retention1 aLeach, S.

A method based on simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers, occurring in the yeast genome, was developed to differentiate the collected S.cerevisiae strains. For the amplification of the polymorphic SSR markers performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), two primer sets showing different size products for different S. cerevisiae strains were designed. The PCR-method with gel electrophoresis was validated using capillary sequencing and then used as a service for winegrowers combined with a sensory analysis via napping. This approach can be used for the preservation of the yeast diversity associated with given terroirs and as an option for an increased safety of fermentations. The application of S. cerevisiae strains collected in spontaneous fermentations and used for fermentation sustains the initial character of the wine and ensures a secure fermentation at the same time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afermentation 3aflavor 3agel electrophoresis 3agenome 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asensory evaluation 3astrains 3awine industry 3awines 3ayeasts1 aHirschler, Adeline 1 aScharfenberger-Schmeer, Maren 0 tFermentation.g2020 Oct. 26, v. 6, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26730x2311-56377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation60401013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245017600174300001600350520142700366592002801793650002401821650001901845650002401864650002201888650002501910650001201935653001601947653002301963653002001986653001502006653001402021653002702035653001602062653001702078700002402095700001602119773009802135856008702233852000902320655001202329IND60563959220221121042150.0180830e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056395922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCadini, Francesco12aA modeling and simulation framework for the reliability/availability assessment of a power transmission grid subject to cascading failures under extreme weather conditions  ap. 267-279.  aElectrical power transmission networks of many developed countries are undergoing deep transformations aimed at (i) facing the challenge offered by the stochastically fluctuating power contributions due to the continuously growing connections of renewable power generating units and (ii) decreasing their vulnerability to failures or malicious attacks and improving their resilience, in order to provide more reliable services, thus increasing both safety and profits. In this complex context, one of the major concerns is that related to the potentially catastrophic consequences of cascading failures triggered by rare and difficult to predict extreme weather events. In this work, we originally propose to combine an extreme weather stochastic model of literature to a realistic cascading failure simulator based on a direct current (DC) power flow approximation and a proportional re-dispatch strategy. The description of the dynamics of the network is completed by the introduction of a novel restoration model accounting for the operating conditions that a repair crew may encounter during an extreme weather event. The resulting model is solved by a customized sequential Monte Carlo scheme in order to quantify the impact of extreme weather events on the reliability/availability performances of the power grid. The approach is demonstrated with reference to the test case of the IEEE14 power transmission network.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloped countries 3aelectric power 3aprofits and margins 3asimulation models 3astochastic processes 3aweather 0aPower grids 0aCascading failures 0aExtreme weather 0aWind storm 0aLightning 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aReliability 0aAvailability1 aAgliardi, Gian Luca1 aZio, Enrico0 tApplied energy.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 185 p.267-279dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.10.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03501naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011600168500001900284520181100303592002802114650002602142650001202168650001502180650002902195650002102224650002602245650001302271650001302284650002802297650001402325650001102339650000902350650001202359650001902371653002402390653001702414653000902431653001002440653003202450700001602482700002302498700002702521700001702548700001802565700001602583700001402599700001602613700001602629700001702645700001902662700001702681773011802698856008602816852000902902655001202911IND60716131220221119112337.0201209e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071613122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1114932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fulin10aJoint analytical hierarchy and metaheuristic optimization as a framework to mitigate fertilizer-based pollution  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe emission of nitrogenous pollution from agricultural lands in form of ammonia volatilization, leaching, runoff, N₂O emissions, etc. is still a serious challenge to which agricultural sector faces. In this context, a vast number of decision support systems have been developed and tested to find the best nitrogen application rate. These models are highly dependent on crop simulation models, mathematical and regression models, evolutionary algorithms and artificial intelligent, GIS-based models, etc., while in most cases have ignored to be interfered with regional and national regulations established by experts in the field. In this study, a new framework combining analytical hierarchy (AHP)/modified AHP methods (MAHP) plus metaheuristic optimization techniques has been suggested to find the best nitrogen application rate considering regional capacities and requirements. To reach the objectives of the present study a three yield field experiment was conducted upon which crop yield, nitrogen use efficiency, nitrogen uptake, soil nitrate, ammonia volatilization, N₂O emissions, and N leaching were monitored or measured. Using the results from the field experiments and a survey from local experts, the models were developed. AHP-assisted optimization model could cause some biases in the final results due to its intrinsic nature which avoids direct pairwise comparison among indicators (so called sub-criteria) under two different main-criteria. On the contrary, MAHP-assisted model could well reflect the concerns of experts and notably decrease hotspot pollution. Such decision support system can satisfy both farmers and environmentalists’ need because of the created high profit and low environmental pollution, while saving resources and ensuring a sustainable production system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aammonia 3acrop yield 3adecision support systems 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3apollution 3arunoff 3asoil 3asurveys 3avolatilization 0aNitrogen fertilizer 0aOptimization 0aRice 0aWheat 0aSustainable cropping system1 aSun, Qiaoyu1 aMehrabadi, Mohamad1 aKhoshnevisan, Benyamin1 aZhang, Yitao1 aFan, Xianpeng1 aZhai, Limei1 aXia, Ying1 aWu, Maoqian1 aLiu, Dongbi1 aPan, Junting1 aRafiee, Shahin1 aLiu, Hongbin0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 278 p.111493-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1114933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245008400179300001800263500000900281500001500290520181700305592002802122650001402150650002102164650001702185650002702202650001002229650002102239650001502260650001802275650001502293650001702308650002202325650002302347653001102370700002202381700001802403773012402421852000902545856009802554655001202652IND8906302120221122041817.0191122e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890630212DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1989.0011183X002900050012x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGraw, R.

Our objective was to determine whether variability exists among a large sample of these accessions for selected agronomic and forage quality traits. Forty-eight entries from 21 countries were evaluated in a 2-yr field study. Entries included 43 foreign accessions obtained from the USDA Plant Introduction Station at Geneva, NY, two germplasms, and three cultivars. Entries were evaluated at Rosemount, MN forherbage yield, seed yield, 1000-seed mass, fall decumbency, and winter injury; at St. Paul, MN for palatability, in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM), crude protein (CP), and winter injury; and at Columbia, MO for chalcid damage and root and crown rotting disease. Entries from the USA and Canada tended to have the greatest herbage yield, seed yield, and lowest degree of winter injury when compared to other accessions. Several foreign accessions, however, performed as well as or better than the USA or Canadian entries for these agronomic traits. Differences were found among entries for IVDDM in 1984, fall decumbency, and palatability. No significant differences were found among entries for chalcid damage, root and crown rotting disease, and forage CP concentration. Although the USA and Canadian entries tended to have superior performance for many of the traits measured, the performance of individual foreign accessions warrants further evaluation and use of foreign birdsfoot trefoil germplasm.

Platinum/gold nanoparticles were easily prepared by reducing the mixture solution of K₂PtCl₆ and HAuCl₄ using sodium citrate in a one-pot synthesis. Next, graphene oxide/platinum/gold nanoparticle hybrids (GO/PDDA/PtAuNPₛ) were fabricated using a self-assembly procedure. Ultrasensitive and enzyme-free detection of ATP in fetal bovine serum was achieved using split aptamer-modified magnetic beads as a separating unit and split aptamer-modified GO/PDDA/PtAuNPₛ as a catalyst-detecting platform. The specific binding of ATP and its aptamer linked the split aptamer-modified GO/PDDA/PtAuNPₛ and magnetic beads together. Using magnetic separation, achromatous tetramethylbenzidine was catalyzed into a colored product by separated nanocomposites, which enabled rapid detection of ATP. The color change caused by the low concentration ATP (50 nM) was clearly distinguished by direct observation. The detection limit of the colorimetric assay for ATP was 0.2 nM, which is close to the lowest detection limit for colorimetric detection of ATP. This assay showed excellent selectivity against guanosine triphosphate, uridine triphosphate, and cytosine triphosphate and can be applied in real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acatalytic activity 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acytosine 3adetection limit 3afetal bovine serum 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aguanosine triphosphate 3amagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3aplatinum 3arapid methods 3asodium citrate 3asynthesis 3auridine triphosphate1 aWang, Kun1 aLi, Jiali1 aLi, Zhenyu1 aSun, Ting0 tRSC advances.g2015 Sept. 08, v. 5, no. 92 p.75746-75752dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra13550h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009500160500001900255520136400274592002801638650002601666650001301692650001601705650001001721650001901731650000901750650001901759650001501778650001501793650001501808651001301823700002601836700002301862700002901885773012701914856007402041852000902115655001202124IND60737129920221117171524.0210514e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073712992DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130917942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuneeb, Fakhra 10aInventory and GLOF Susceptibility of Glacial Lakes in Hunza River Basin, Western Karakorum  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNorthern latitudes of Pakistan are warming at faster rate as compared to the rest of the country. It has induced irregular and sudden glacier fluctuations leading to the progression of glacial lakes, and thus enhancing the risk of Glacier Lake Outbursts Floods (GLOF) in the mountain systems of Pakistan. Lack of up-to-date inventory, classification, and susceptibility profiles of glacier lakes and newly formed GLOFs, are few factors which pose huge hindrance towards disaster preparedness and risk reduction strategies in Pakistan. This study aims to bridge the existing gap in data and knowledge by exploiting satellite observations, and efforts are made to compile and update glacier lake inventories. GLOF susceptibility assessment is evaluated by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multicriteria structured technique based on three susceptibility contributing factors: Geographic, topographic, and climatic. A total of 294 glacial lakes are delineated with a total area of 7.85 ± 0.31 km² for the year 2018. Analysis has identified six glacier lakes as potential GLOF and met the pre-established criteria of damaging GLOFs. The historical background of earlier GLOF events is utilized to validate the anticipated approach and found this method appropriate for first order detection and prioritization of potential GLOFs in Northern Pakistan.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisaster preparedness 3aglaciers 3ainventories 3alakes 3aprioritization 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asatellites 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aPakistan1 aBaig, Siddique  Ullah1 aKhan, Junaid  Aziz1 aKhokhar, Muhammad  Fahim0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 May 05, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130917943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015000171300001600321520117100337592002801508650001301536650003301549650002001582650001001602650001301612650002401625650001301649650002001662650001801682650001501700650001101715650001101726650001101737653006201748653002001810653001901830653004301849653003301892700001701925700001401942700001901956700001501975700001601990700001902006773010602025856008702131852000902218655001202227IND60570760520221118211717.0190409e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057076052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jianhua10aRapid start-up of partial nitritation and simultaneously phosphorus removal (PNSPR) granular sludge reactor treating low-strength domestic sewage  ap. 660-666.  aObtaining desirable partial nitritation (PN) is crucial for successful application of the combined PN and anammox process. In this study, the partial nitritation and simultaneously phosphorus removal (PNSPR)1PNSPR: Partial nitritation and simultaneously phosphorus removal.1 granular sludge reactor treating low-strength domestic sewage was rapidly started up in 67days through seeding denitrifying phosphorus removal (DPR)2DPR: denitrifying phosphorus removal.2 sludge. The nitrite/ammonium ratio in effluent was approximately 1 and the nitrite accumulation rate (NAR) was more than 95%, about 93% of orthophosphate was removed. The DPR sludge rich in phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) with few nitrifying bacteria could promote the achievement of PNSPR. Quantitative microbial analysis showed that the ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) gene ratio in sludge increased from 0.21% to 3.43%, while nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) gradually decreased to 0.07%. The average particle size of sludge increased from 114 to 421μm, indicating the formation of PNSPR granules. The high phosphorus content in sludge and phosphorus removal facilitated rapid granulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3agenes 3agranules 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrites 3aorthophosphates 3aparticle size 3aphosphorus 3asewage 3asludge 3asowing 0aPartial nitritation and simultaneously phosphorus removal 0aGranular sludge 0aRapid start-up 0aDenitrifying phosphorus removal sludge 0aLow-strength domestic sewage1 aZhang, Qiong1 aLi, Xiyao1 aMiao, Yuanyuan1 aSun, Yawen1 aZhang, Miao1 aPeng, Yongzhen0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Nov., v. 243 p.660-666dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.06.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03801naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245018600171300001600357520204800373592002802421650002702449650001202476650001702488650001602505650002302521650002702544650001802571650002302589650001802612650001602630650004302646650001202689650002402701650002402725650003202749650002502781650001802806653001902824653001602843653003002859653001202889653002002901700001702921700001602938700001202954700001202966700001902978700001902997700001703016773010303033856009003136852000903226655001203235IND50068120220221119111602.0190318e20130825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006812022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Mingzhu10aEffects of dietary grape seed oil and linseed oil on growth, muscle fatty acid composition and expression of putative Δ5 fatty acyl desaturase in abalone Haliotis discus hannai Ino  ap. 105-114.  aA 120-day feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary increasing levels of grape seed oil (GO) and linseed oil (LO), rich in linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) respectively, on growth, fatty acid composition and expression levels of putative Δ5 fatty acyl desaturases (Fads) in muscle of juvenile abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino). Seven experimental diets were formulated to contain increasing amounts (0%, 0.875%, 1.75% and 3.5%) of GO or LO as dietary lipids. Tripalmitin (TP), rich in 16:0, was supplemented to reach 3.5% (dry weight) total lipid. These diets were named as 0%GO/LO (TP), 25%GO, 50%GO, 100%GO, 25%LO, 50%LO and 100%LO. With the increase of dietary GO or LO inclusion, growth parameters (such as specific growth rate of weight) first increased and then decreased (R2>0.72, P=0.000). The survival rate of abalone was not significantly correlated with dietary GO (R2=0.04, P=0.815) or LO inclusion (R2=0.50, P=0.046). The contents of muscle n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including LA, 20:2n-6, 20:4n-6, 22:2n-6, were significantly positive correlated with dietary GO inclusion (R2>0.895, P=0.000). A positive relationship was significantly noted between the values of muscle n-3 PUFA (ALA, 20:3n-3, 20:5n-3 and 22:5n-3) and the dietary LO inclusion (R2>0.905, P=0.000). DHA was significantly increased and then decreased with dietary LO increase (R2=0.937, P=0.000). The expression levels of putative Δ5 Fads in 50%GO group were significantly higher than those of other GO groups (P<0.05). With the increase of dietary LO, expressions of putative Δ5 Fads first increased and thereafter reached a plateau (R2>0.929, P=0.000). These results indicated that biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid in muscle of abalone could be increased in response to increasing levels of dietary LA or ALA through increased expressions of putative Δ5 Fads. High intakes of dietary LA and/or ALA inhibited the biosynthesis of DHA and compromised the growth performance of abalone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis discus hannai 3aabalone 3abiosynthesis 3adietary fat 3aexperimental diets 3afatty acid composition 3agrapeseed oil 3agrowth performance 3alinoleic acid 3alinseed oil 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3amuscles 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aspecific growth rate 3asurvival rate 0aGrape seed oil 0aLinseed oil 0aΔ5 fatty acyl desaturase 0aAbalone 0aGene expression1 aMai, Kangsen1 aAi, Qinghui1 aHe, Gen1 aXu, Wei1 aZhang, Wenbing1 aZhang, Yanjiao1 aZhou, Huihui0 tAquaculture.g2013 Aug. 25, v. 406-407 p.105-114dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007800165300001600243520121600259592002801475650001101503650002901514650002101543650002101564650001401585650001001599650001601609650001401625700002101639700002101660700002001681773009301701856008101794852000901875655001201884IND50074576320221116150146.0150214e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007457632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-013-0942-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkashi, Osamu10aHalving global GHG emissions by 2050 without depending on nuclear and CCS  ap. 611-622.  aIn this paper, we assessed the technological feasibility and economic viability of the mid-term (until 2050) GHG emission reduction target required for stabilization of radiative forcing at 2.6 W/m2. Given the apparent uncertainty surrounding the future deployment of nuclear and CCS technologies, we intensively investigated emission reduction scenarios without nuclear and CCS. The analysis using AIM/Enduse[Global] shows the emission reduction target is technologically feasible, but the cost for achieving the target becomes very high if nuclear and CCS options are limited. The main reason for the cost rise is that additional investment for expensive technologies is required in order to compensate for emission increases in the steel, cement and power generation sectors in the absence of CCS. On the other hand, if material efficiency improvement measures, such as material substitution, efficient use of materials and recycling, are taken, the cost of achieving the emission reduction target is significantly reduced. The result indicates the potentially important role of material efficiency improvement in curbing the cost of significant GHG emission reductions without depending on nuclear and CCS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3apower generation 3arecycling 3asteel 3auncertainty 3aviability1 aHanaoka, Tatsuya1 aMasui, Toshihiko1 aKainuma, Mikiko0 tClimatic change.g2014 Apr., v. 123, no. 3-4 p.611-622dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-013-0942-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008200156300001800238520136900256592002801625650001801653650001301671650002901684650001801713650001801731650001101749650002501760650002301785650001301808700001701821700002201838773012101860856007501981852000902056655001202065IND60560060220221119130056.0161219e20150604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056006022DNAL7 a10.1021/jp509949b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xingyu10aGlycosylation Modulates Human CD2-CD58 Adhesion via Conformational Adjustment  ap. 6493-6501.  aHuman CD2 is a transmembrane cell surface glycoprotein found on T lymphocytes and natural killer cells and plays important roles in immune recognition. The interaction between human CD2 and its counter receptor CD58 facilitates surface adhesion between helper T lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells as well as between cytolytic effectors and target cells. In this study, the molecular effect of glycosylation of CD2 on the structure and dynamics of the CD2-CD58 adhesion complex were examined via MD simulation to help understand the fundamental mechanism of glycosylation that controls CD2-CD58 adhesion. The present result and detailed analysis revealed that the binding interaction of human CD2-CD58 is dominated by three hot spots that form a binding triangle whose topology is critical for stable binding of CD2-CD58. Our study found that the conformation of human CD2, represented by the topology of this binding triangle, is significantly adjusted and steered by glycosylation toward a particular conformation that energetically stabilizes the CD2-CD58 complex. Thus, the fundamental mechanism of glycosylation of human CD2 is to promote CD2-CD58 binding by conformational adjustment of CD2. The current result and explanation are in excellent agreement with previous experiments and help elucidate the dynamical mechanism of glycosylation of human CD2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadhesion 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3ahumans 3anatural killer cells 3aphysical chemistry 3atopology1 aJi, Chang G.1 aZhang, John Z.

The clinical manifestations caused by high-risk HPV types are cancers at anogenital sites, including cervical cancer, as well as head and neck cancers. Host cell defense mechanisms such as autophagy are initiated upon HPV entry. At the same time, the virus modulates cellular antiviral processes and structures such as promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) to enable infection. Here, we uncover the autophagy adaptor p62, also known as p62/sequestosome-1, as a novel proviral factor in infections by the high-risk HPV type 16 (HPV16). Proteomics, imaging and interaction studies of HPV16 pseudovirus-treated HeLa cells display that p62 is recruited to virus-filled endosomes, interacts with incoming capsids, and accompanies the virus to PML NBs, the sites of viral transcription and replication. Cellular depletion of p62 significantly decreased the delivery of HPV16 viral DNA to PML NBs and HPV16 infection rate. Moreover, the absence of p62 leads to an increase in the targeting of viral components to autophagic structures and enhanced degradation of the viral capsid protein L2. The proviral role of p62 and formation of virus-p62-PML hybrid bodies have also been observed in human primary keratinocytes, the HPV target cells. Together, these findings suggest the previously unrecognized virus-induced formation of p62-PML hybrid bodies as a viral mechanism to subvert the cellular antiviral defense, thus enabling viral gene expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPapillomaviridae 3aautophagy 3acapsid 3acoat proteins 3aendosomes 3agene expression 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3akeratinocytes 3aleukemia 3aproteomics 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3aviruses1 aLelieveld-Fast, Laura A.1 aMikuličić, Snježana 1 aStrunk, Johannes 1 aFreitag, Kirsten 1 aTenzer, Stefan 1 aClement, Albrecht M.1 aFlorin, Luise 0 tViruses.g2022 July 05, v. 14, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140714783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008500171506011700256506007600373520131000449592002801759506003701787650001901824650001601843650001701859650000701876650002001883650001501903650002001918650001801938650000901956653002301965653002001988653001302008653003502021700002902056700002302085700002102108700002102129773012502150856008202275852000902357655001202366IND60777811820221207084312.0220614e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077781182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1135772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoussi Hachfi, Rima10aRheological characterization of β-lactoglobulin/lactoferrin complex coacervates  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHeteroprotein complex coacervation between lactoferrin (LF) and β-lactoglobulin (β-LG), two oppositely charged proteins from whey, occurred under specific conditions of pH, ionic strength and protein molar ratio. The present work aims at characterizing the rheological properties of the concentrated phase called coacervate obtained after phase separation. Unlike some polysaccharide/protein coacervates, β-LG/LF heteroprotein coacervates exhibit a liquid-like behavior; the loss modulus G” being 100 times higher than the storage modulus G’ at low frequencies. This behavior was confirmed under creep-recovery tests. The heteroprotein coacervates exhibited a Newtonian viscous flow under low shear rate and a shear thinning behavior above 10 s⁻¹. The coacervates are exceptionally viscous, reaching a viscosity value of 55 ± 10 Pa.s which is ∼2500 times higher than that measured on individual protein solutions of equivalent total concentration. Also, a structural change occurred in the coacervates, probably due to the weaknesses of electrostatic interactions inside the protein network at high shear rates. The observed time-dependent structural rearrangement was proved to be reversible. These findings open new ways for the use of coacervates as texturizing agents in food matrices.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aionic strength 3alactoferrin 3aloss modulus 3apH 3apolysaccharides 3aseparation 3astorage modulus 3atexturization 3awhey 0aFood heteroprotein 0aViscoelasticity 0aRheology 0aLiquid-liquid phase separation1 aFamelart, Marie-Hélène1 aRousseau, Florence1 aHamon, Pascaline1 aBouhallab, Saïd0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 15, v. 163 p.113577-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1135773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017800168520159800346592002801944650001301972650002501985650002602010650001602036650001102052650001202063650002202075650003302097650001002130650001802140653003102158653003302189653002502222653002302247653002002270700001802290773010502308856008602413852000902499655001202508IND60754492220221123040840.0211227e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075449222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1270822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmiri, Vahab10aUsing a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based nomenclature system and self-organizing maps (SOM) for spatiotemporal assessment of groundwater quality in a coastal aquifer  aIn this study, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) - based nomenclature system have been used for the classification of groundwater samples in a coastal aquifer. The capability of three models (7 hlr, 7 M conc, and Greater molar conc) in determining the water types has been investigated. The results show that Ca-HCO₃, Na-Cl, and Na-HCO₃; and Ca-HCO₃, Na-HCO₃, and Na-Cl are the three dominant water types for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The results of 7 hlr (basic + hybrid) model as the best option show that 42 and 27 water types can be identified for wet and dry seasons, respectively. Twenty-four physicochemical components have been used for the hydrogeochemical study of selected water resources based on Kohonen’s self-organizing map (SOM) method. The k-means clustering tool detected 7 and 6 clusters using the Davies-Bouldin index (DBI) for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Hydrogeochemical assessment of duplicated samples showed that the seasonal changes can not cause significant changes in the chemical composition of groundwater resources of this aquifer. Radar diagrams of physicochemical variables showed some changes in the chemical composition of groundwater in some locations due to water–rock interaction as well as pollutants produced by human activities. Comparison of the results of classification of water samples by SOM and principal component analysis (PCA) shows that both methods can perform clustering of samples correctly. However, the SOM method provides more accurate clustering without any overlap between different clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3achemical composition 3adiscriminant analysis 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3ahydrogeochemistry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aradar 3awater quality 0aGroundwater classification 0aLinear discriminant analysis 0aSelf-organizing maps 0aK-means clustering 0aCoastal aquifer1 aNakagawa, Kei0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.127082-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1270823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245009600190300001400286520063600300592002800936650001400964650002000978650001700998650001301015650001701028650001401045650001701059650001101076650003001087650002701117650005701144650003801201650003601239650002701275700002001302700001901322773009501341856008401436990002301520852000901543655001201552IND60092091220221119234815.0141103e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009209122DNAL7 a220509072pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDunn, Jeffrey H.10aInflammasomes as molecular mediators of inflammation and cancer: Potential role in melanoma  ap. 24-33.  aThe inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that mediates immune responses to microbial, host, and environmental signals. When active, inflammasomes regulate caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. There is a strong link between inflammation and cancer, and IL-1β is one of the major molecules involved in both of these disease processes. Here we review the role of inflammasomes in regulating IL-1β secretion, and the impact of this pathway on cancer pathogenesis, with a focus on melanoma.

This study uses multiple sets of satellite altimetry, satellite gravity, and ocean temperature and salinity data to study the basin-scale sea level budget (SLB) from 2005 to 2019. The basin-scale sea level rises significantly at a rate of 2.48–4.31 mm/yr, for which the ocean mass component is a main and stable contributing factor, with a rate of 1.77–2.39 mm/yr, while the steric component explains a ~1 mm/yr sea level rise in most ocean basins, except for the Southern Ocean. Due to the drift in Argo salinity since 2016, the residuals of basin-scale SLB are significant from 2016 to 2019. The worst-affected ocean is the Atlantic Ocean, where the SLB is no longer closed from 2005 to 2019. If halosteric sea level change trends from 2005 to 2015 are used to revise salinity data after 2016, the SLB on the ocean basin scale can be kept closed. However, the SLB on the global scale is still not closed and requires further study. Therefore, we recommend that Argo salinity products after 2016 should be used with caution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate change 3agravimetry 3agravity 3ahumans 3asalinity 3asatellite altimetry 3asatellites 3asea level 3asustainable development 3awater temperature 3aAtlantic Ocean1 aFeng, Wei 1 aZhong, Min 1 aMu, Dapeng 1 aYao, Yanli 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141846373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007000173300001600243520176000259592002802019650001202047650002002059650001102079650002702090650002302117653000802140653000702148653000802155653000802163653000702171653000802178653000802186653000802194653000802202653000702210653000802217653000902225653000802234653002702242653001202269653001002281653002002291653002002311700001702331700001602348773011202364856008402476852000902560655001202569IND60601444020221123024832.0180706e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsraf-Snir, Meital10aGypsum scaling on anion exchange membranes during Donnan exchange  ap. 384-391.  aThe formation of gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) scale in ion-exchange membranes was investigated under a Donnan exchange regime. Two types of anion exchange membranes (AEM), homogeneous AMV and heterogeneous MA-40, were used for the study. Counter-ion flux, scaling-cation concentration in the fouled membrane and membrane potential served as indicators for membrane scaling. Locations of scaling domains were dependent on the membrane structure, and lead to different effects on the membrane performance. Scaling in the homogeneous membrane was mainly characterized by surface deposits, resulting in a moderate decrease of the counter-ion flux. On the other hand, the heterogeneous membrane showed a high degree of internal precipitation resulting in a complete clogging of the membrane, thus leading to earlier and more severe decline in counter-ion flux. Significant amounts of calcium were found within the fouled MA-40, supporting the other indications of internal scaling.The potential difference across the homogeneous AMV did not change significantly after operating under scaling conditions. However, for the MA-40, an increase of the membrane potential was observed, suggesting that CaSO4 scale blocks defects and imperfections in the heterogeneous matrix. Scaling experiments were conducted in a specially designed Donnan cell with optical apparatus for in-situ observation of scales. This allowed real-time observation of surface scaling on the ion exchange membranes. Gypsum growth centers were observed on the homogeneous AMV significantly earlier than flux decline appeared. This finding shows that it is feasible to detect onset of scaling on homogeneous anion-exchange membranes before the appearance of significant effects on membrane performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium sulfate 3agypsum 3aion-exchange membranes 3amembrane potential 0aAEM 0aBW 0aCEM 0aDSC 0aED 0aEDR 0aEDX 0aIEM 0aRED 0aRO 0aSEM 0aWWPT 0aZLD 0aIon exchange membranes 0aScaling 0aCaSO4 0aDonnan exchange 0aElectrodialysis1 aGilron, Jack1 aOren, Yoram0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 455 p.384-391dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015500171300001800326520161600344592002801960650002801988650001202016650001202028650001202040650001902052650003102071650001702102650000902119650001402128650001302142650002002155650001502175650001902190650001402209650001202223650001302235650001102248650002002259650001902279650001702298650000902315653001902324653001602343700002502359700002202384700001802406773014802424856008602572852000902658655001202667IND60779568520221122003248.0220610e20220806xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077956852DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2022.20633272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhzari, Davoud10aImpact of Drought, Salinity, and Heavy Metal Stress on Growth, Nutrient Uptake, and Physiological Traits of Vetiver Grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides L.)  ap. 1841-1847.  aDrought and salinity are the most common abiotic stresses in arid and semi-arid regions. Vetiver grass is one of the best plants for planting in heavy metal contaminated areas. Therefore, the impact of drought, salinity, and heavy metal stress on growth, nutrient uptake, and physiological traits of vetiver has been investigated in this research. The greenhouse experiment was conducted as a completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement with three replications. Drought stress was performed at two levels of control (field capacity) and water stress conditions (25% field capacity) (defined as FC and 25%FC, respectively). The salinity treatment was applied to the relevant pots in two levels (0 and 100 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) defined as S0 and S1, respectively). The cadmium stress was exerted with 0 and 12 mM cadmium nitrate concentrations (defined as Cd0 and Cd1, respectively). The results indicated the highest values of root length and root weight (as 52.14 and 31.22, respectively) were observed in the 25% FC S1 Cd0 treatment. The minimum amount of root length and root weight reported as 15.32 and 10.52 that seen in FC S0 Cd0 treatment. The highest values of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), and phosphorus (P) were seen in the FC S0 Cd0 treatment. Moreover, the lowest value of sodium (Na) concentrations was 4.92 (g kg⁻¹), observed in FC S0 Cd0. The maximum content of proline and the lowest total nitrogen content (TNC) values in Chrysopogon zizanioides tissue indicated as 0.41 μmol gFW⁻¹ and 0.97% which seen in 25% FC S1 Cd1 treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysopogon zizanioides 3acadmium 3acalcium 3adrought 3afield capacity 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3aplant analysis 3apotassium 3aproline 3asalinity 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3atotal nitrogen 3awater stress 3azinc 0aabiotic stress 0asaline soil1 aPessarakli, Mohammad1 aMahdavi, Shahriar1 aAriapour, Ali0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 Aug. 06, v. 53, no. 14 p.1841-1847dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20633273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245010300164300001400267520168900281592002801970650002501998650002802023650001702051650001102068650001902079650002202098650001502120650001102135650001402146650002902160650001902189650002002208650002302228650001302251650002002264650002002284651001502304653002002319653003302339653002602372653002502398653002302423700002102446773011002467856008402577852000902661655001202670IND60601444120221123024652.0180706e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lin10aNovel reverse osmosis membranes incorporated with a hydrophilic additive for seawater desalination  ap. 44-54.  aNovel thin-film-composite reverse osmosis membranes were synthesized successfully for seawater desalination by incorporating the hydrophilic additive, o-aminobenzoic acid–triethylamine (o-ABA–TEA) salt, into the aqueous m-phenylenediamine (MPD) solution to react with trimesoyl chloride (TMC) in the organic solution during the interfacial polymerization on a nanoporous polysulfone support. The membrane synthesis conditions, including o-ABA–TEA salt concentration, isopropanol (IPA) concentration, additional amine drying time, and hydrocarbon removal time, were optimized by characterizing membrane performances using synthetic 3.28wt% NaCl solution under seawater desalination conditions at 800psi (5.52MPa) and 25°C. The synthesized membranes showed a very high flux of 1.81m³/m²/day (44.4gallons/ft²/day (gfd)) and a salt rejection of 99.41%. The improvement of membrane hydrophilicity was confirmed by comparing the contact angles of the membranes synthesized with and without the hydrophilic additive. The high-flux membrane was further tested using seawater from Port Hueneme, CA and exhibited a very good and stable desalination performance for 30 days. The fouling-resistant properties of the membranes synthesized with and without the hydrophilic additive were evaluated by using sodium alginate, a common contaminant derived from seaweed, as the model foulant.

However, we still know relatively little about these patterns and processes for the dominant arthropod communities living in above-ground (AG) and below-ground (BG) ecosystems. To test whether the community patterns for AG communities are consistent with those of BG communities and to inform whether the underlying processes are congruous, samples of ground carabid and soil collembolan communities were collected from a primary mixed forest in Northeastern China. Within a 9-ha permanent forest plot, 225 carabid samples were captured using pitfall traps in August 2015, and 768 collembolan samples were collected using soil augers in September 2014. Vegetative, topographic, soil and spatial variables were also measured. Geostatistics, null models and variation partitioning were used to evaluate the spatial distributions, co-occurrence patterns and contributions of environmental and spatial factors, respectively. The carabid community did not show obvious spatial autocorrelation, while the collembolan community showed significant spatial autocorrelation and aggregation on multiple spatial scales. Both communities showed non-random co-occurrence patterns, but of different types. The carabid community was driven by weak and insignificant topographic filtering, while the collembolan community was driven by strong and significant topographic filtering. The two communities were each shaped by spatial factors, but the carabid community’s spatial distribution may be regulated by their high dispersal ability, which allowed the beetles to overcome topographic constraints. On the other hand, the collembolan community’s spatial distribution may be regulated by their dispersal limitations, which combine with topographic constraints to create an aggregation pattern. Finally, we conclude that the dominant AG and BG arthropod communities exhibit different community structure patterns controlled different spatial processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarabidae 3aCollembola 3aarthropod communities 3aarthropods 3aaugers 3aautocorrelation 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3ageostatistics 3amixed forests 3amodels 3apitfall traps 3asoil 3atopography 3aChina 0aSpatial distribution 0aCo-occurrence 0aCommunity assembly 0aGround carabid 0aSoil collembola 0aAbove-below ground1 aSun, Xin1 aQiao, Zhihong1 aHou, Hongyu1 aLü, Tingyu,1 aWu, Donghui1 aJin, Guangze0 tPedobiologia.g2018 July, v. 69 p.17-28dElsevier GmbHwJournal:1957x0031-40567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2018.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01496naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245008200164300001600246520055000262592002800812653002000840653001400860653004600874653001100920653002000931653002100951700003400972773010201006856007701108852000901185655001201194IND60125361920221120153607.0151103e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012536192DNAL7 a10.1646/02155-Q15612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamíírez, Alonso10aAquatic Insect Assemblages in Shrimp-dominated Tropical Streams, Puerto Rico1  ap. 259-266.  aWe examined the effects of shrimp on insects in Puerto Rico by assessing insect assemblages in streams relative to varying shrimp densities and also by manipulating shrimp presence. Insect assemblages were typical of tropical island streams and insects were found in all stream habitats. Shrimp impacted insects directly via predation and competition and indirectly through removing particles from the water column. Variation in shrimp distribution is likely to be an important factor determining insect-assemblage structure in tropical streams.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaquatic insects 0aexclusion 0aLuquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico 0ashrimp 0astream habitats 0atop-down control1 aHernáández-Cruz, Luz Raquel0 tBiotropica.g2004 June, v. 36, no. 2 p.259-266dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F02155-Q15613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012500170300001600295520101200311592002801323650002701351650002201378650002501400650001501425650001101440650001201451650002101463650002101484650001201505650000701517650001501524650001101539650002001550653002001570653002201590653002101612653001501633700002201648700002401670700001901694700001701713700005601730773011201786856008401898852000901982655001201991IND60601444320221123024811.0180706e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHau, Nguyen Thi10aExploration of EDTA sodium salt as novel draw solution in forward osmosis process for dewatering of high nutrient sludge  ap. 305-311.  aIn this study, a hybrid forward osmosis–nanofiltration (FO/NF) process was designed for dewatering high nutrient containing sludge and recovering draw solution with minimum energy as well as low fouling. A novel draw solution – EDTA sodium salt – was also systematically studied for dewatering process. Results show that using EDTA sodium salt produced higher water flux and lower reverse salt flux when compared to conventional inorganic salt (NaCl) at pH 8. The final sludge concentration reached 32,000mg/L after 16h of operation. Moreover, nutrient compounds in sludge were successfully removed by the FO membrane with a removal efficiency of approximately 97% of NH4+–N, 90% of NO3−–N, 97% of NO2−–N and 99% of PO43−–P, which was attributed to the multi-barrier layers of sludge forming on membrane surface and the steric effect of the FO membrane. The NF recovery of EDTA sodium salt indicated that all NF membranes performed well and TS-80 was the best among the tested membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aammonium nitrogen 3aartificial membranes 3adewatering 3aenergy 3afouling 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3aosmosis 3apH 3aphosphates 3asludge 3asodium chloride 0aForward osmosis 0aSludge dewatering 0aOsmotic pressure 0aComplexion1 aChen, Shiao-Shing1 aNguyen, Nguyen Cong1 aHuang, Kuo Zue1 aNgo, Huu Hao1 aGuo, Wenshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5542-28580 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 455 p.305-311dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03679naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016600167520189300333592002802226650001502254650001002269650001602279650001502295650001702310650001702327650003102344650002902375650001902404650001702423650002302440650001002463650002102473650001902494650001502513650002602528650001702554653002502571653002702596653002102623653002102644653002802665653001702693700001802710700001702728700001602745700002102761700002002782700002102802700001402823700002002837700001902857773011802876856008602994852000903080655001203089IND60724200820221122071841.0211114e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072420082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xi-Xi10aCharacterization of algal organic matter as precursors for carbonaceous and nitrogenous disinfection byproducts formation: Comparison with natural organic matter  aAlgal organic matter (AOM) and natural organic matter (NOM) from a typical eutrophic lake were comprehensively investigated in terms of their physico-chemical property, components and disinfection byproduct formation potentials (DBPFPs). The relationships between specific chemical properties of AOM and NOM with their corresponding DBPFPs were further evaluated during chlorination. Results indicated that AOM had lower specific UV absorbance (SUVA) but richer organic nitrogen contents than NOM. Fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy further demonstrated that AOM were chiefly composed of aromatic protein-like and soluble microbial byproduct-like matters, while NOM were mainly contributed from humic acid-like and soluble microbial byproduct-like substances. Although the molecular weight (MW) distribution of AOM and NOM showed no significant difference, size-exclusion chromatography with organic carbon as well as organic nitrogen detection (LC-OCD-OND) revealed that AOM were concentrated with the fraction of building blocks and NOM had higher concentrations of biopolymers and humics (HS). Moreover, AOM displayed higher DBPFPs than NOM, especially for nitrogenous DBPFP (N-DBPFP). MW < 1 kDa fractions both in AOM and NOM contributed the largest proportion to the formation of carbonaceous disinfection byproducts (C-DBPs). In addition, Pearson correlation analysis showed that bulk parameter SUVA was significantly relevant to the formation potentials of trihalomethane both in AOM and NOM, but was ineffective for carbonaceous DBPFP (C-DBPFP) prediction. Dissolved organic nitrogen contents in biopolymer and HS characterized by LC-OCD-OND had strong correlations with N-DBPFPs from AOM and NOM, indicating that LC-OCD-OND quantitative analysis could improve the prediction accuracy of the DBP formation than bulk parameters during NOM and AOM chlorination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aalgae 3abiopolymers 3abyproducts 3achlorination 3adisinfection 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3aenvironmental management 3aeutrophication 3afluorescence 3agel chromatography 3alakes 3amolecular weight 3aorganic carbon 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectroscopy 0aAlgal organic matter 0aNatural organic matter 0aCharacterization 0aMolecular weight 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aChlorination1 aLiu, Bao-Ming1 aLu, Min-Feng1 aLi, Yu-Ping1 aJiang, Ying-Ying1 aZhao, Ming-Xing1 aHuang, Zhen-Xing1 aPan, Yang1 aMiao, Heng-Feng1 aRuan, Wen-Quan0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 282 p.111951-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007800165300001600243520150000259592002801759650001401787650002301801650001201824650002501836650001701861650001601878650002201894650001101916650000901927650001601936650001101952650002401963650001901987650001202006653001702018653001702035653001602052653002102068653001602089653002502105700001402130700002102144700001602165773009002181856008402271852000902355655001202364IND60610972020221120225419.0180830e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061097202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.1632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, J.P.10aPalm biomass strategic resource managment – A competitive game analysis  ap. 456-463.  aThere are plentiful of palm biomass but these resources are not always being fully utilised. Palm biomass are plentiful; yet their utilization are far from reaching their potential. From the perspective of biomass industry players, especially of the bio-energy industry, there are primarily three factors affecting their business decision: (i) constant and good quality supplies, (ii) process efficiency, (iii) market demand and price. The strategy considerations that respond to these factors are based on other players' competition, plantation output, mill output, logistics matter, government policy and weather. In order to model a real situation in a particular palm plantation area, game theory approach is adopted in analysing and identifying the best strategy for the biomass industry owner. Given that every player tends to act according to their own self-interest for profit maximization, this is thus a non-cooperative game study. The case study in this paper is modelled on two industry players, two oil mills and two plantations. Nash equilibrium is achieved through analysing the best strategy. The strategy selected by the player will lead to the most favorable and positive outcome regardless of whatever decision made by the opponents. In other word, by analysing this scenario using game theory approach, an optimal non-cooperative strategy can be determined. For the future works, it can be applied into the decision support framework for the biomass industry management team.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy 3abioenergy industry 3abiomass 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3agame theory 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aoils 3aplantations 3aprices 3aprofit maximization 3asupply balance 3aweather 0aPalm biomass 0aSupply chain 0aGame theory 0aNash equilibrium 0aCompetition 0aProcurement strategy1 aLam, H.L.1 aAbdul Aziz, M.K.1 aMorad, N.A.0 tEnergy.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 118 p.456-463dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.1633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245007300174300001600247520100200263592002801265650002901293650001101322650001301333650002201346650001001368650001201378651001101390653001801401653003001419653001701449700002001466700001801486773013201504856008601636852000901722655001201731IND60779568920221122031314.0220610e20220504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077956892DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2021.19203162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMucunguzi, Patrick14aThe role of the faith-based organisations in tree planting in Uganda  ap. 436-449.  aThis study explored tree planting in Uganda by several faith-based organisations (FBOs).

Key resources for tree planting were good administrative structures from the grassroots level to funding provisions. Benefits of tree planting include: fuelwood, sawn timber, fruit production and provision of environmental services. Constraints faced by FBOs in tree planting include: lack of skills for resource mobilisation and tree planting, lack of specific environmental protection policy, restricted funds, lack of suitable indigenous tree seedlings, negative attitudes of local communities, inclement weather and inadequate tending of planted seedlings. The findings will guide decision-making by FBOs and funding agencies in enhancing tree planting for products provision, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation and adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental protection 3afruits 3afuelwood 3aissues and policy 3atrees 3aweather 3aUganda 0aTree planting 0afaith-based organisations 0aconservation1 aMusiime, Adrine1 aOgola, Laster0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2022 May 04, v. 79, no. 3 p.436-449dRoutledgewJournal:12219x1029-04007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2021.19203163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014700163300001600310520130400326592002801630650002301658650001801681650001501699650002001714650003001734650003101764650002001795650002201815650002701837650002001864650002401884650001301908650001301921650001501934650000901949650002401958700001501982700001701997700001502014700001202029700001702041700001602058700001702074700001702091700001802108700001302126773015102139856008102290852000902371655001202380IND60560060820221119130246.0170610e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056006082DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-08-16-0165-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Jidong10aRice Plasma Membrane Proteomics Reveals Magnaporthe oryzae Promotes Susceptibility by Sequential Activation of Host Hormone Signaling Pathways  ap. 902-913.  aPlant plasma membrane (PM) plays important roles in immune response.

Half of the identified proteins are predicted to have binding functions and over one third of the proteins have enzyme-related functions. In addition, Gene Ontology analyses revealed that abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin (CK) signaling were sequentially activated after M. oryzae infection in rice. We found that the activation of ABA signaling and the suppression of rice immune response occurred at the early infection stage, while the activation of CK signaling, the upregulation of sugar transporter genes expression, and the nutrient efflux of infected rice cells occurred at later infection stage. Thus, we further propose that M. oryzae activates ABA signaling to repress rice immune signaling for initial invasion and redirects nutrient efflux of infected cells for massive growth at the later infection stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3aabscisic acid 3acytokinins 3adata collection 3afungal diseases of plants 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3amass spectrometry 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein composition 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arice 3asignal transduction1 aYang, Chao1 aLi, Lingjuan1 aJiang, Lan1 aWu, Yao1 aWu, Chuanwan1 aBu, Qingyun1 aXia, Guixian1 aLiu, Xiaoyun1 aLuo, Yuanming1 aLiu, Jun0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2016 Nov., v. 29, no. 11 p.902-913dMolecular Plant-Microbe InteractionswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-08-16-0165-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011300166300001600279520137600295592002801671650001701699650002501716650002301741650002401764650002301788650001501811650002001826650001501846650002101861650002501882650002001907650001101927650002201938650001801960650001701978650001801995651001802013653002702031653003502058653002702093653002002120700003102140700001802171773013102189856008202320852000902402655001202411IND60516567920221118235819.0190730e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051656792DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929140003932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVILLAMAGNA, A.10aCollateral benefits from public and private conservation lands: a comparison of ecosystem service capacities  ap. 204-215.  aProtected areas remain the most commonly used tool for in situ conservation; however growth in the USA's system of public lands has stagnated while private land conservation continues to expand. Easements can provide a range of ecosystem services (ESs), but it is unknown whether conservation easements maintain ES capacities equivalent to public protected areas. Evaluation of the capacity of seven ESs on federal and state protected areas and conservation easements in the USA using spatially-explicit ES models and publicly available data indicated that ES capacities in easements were equal to or greater than capacities within state or federal protected areas for six of seven services and, when bundled together, conservation easements protected greater focal ES capacity than other conservation areas. Economic incentive programmes and regulatory mechanisms may be used to stimulate capacity improvements for surface water regulation, riparian filtration, erosion control, and carbon storage on conservation easements, and landscape-level conservation efforts should (1) continue to protect natural and uninhabited areas that provide ecosystem and biological diversity, (2) expand private conservation efforts close to human population centres, and (3) limit future development to areas with high regulating service capacity that can sustain new population growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acarbon sequestration 3aconservation areas 3aeconomic incentives 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aerosion control 3afiltration 3ahuman population 3ain situ conservation 3aland management 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3aprivate lands 3apublic lands 3asurface water 3aUnited States 0aconservation easements 0ageographic information systems 0apositive externalities 0aprotected areas1 aScott, L.q(Larry),d1935-1 aGILLESPIE, J.0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2015 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.204-215dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929140003933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245009700170300001600267520142200283592002801705650002001733650002901753650001401782650001801796650002301814650001901837650002201856650001001878650001501888650001601903650001801919650002801937650001201965650002301977650001102000650001302011650002202024650001402046650001402060650001102074700002002085700001702105700001702122700001802139700001702157700001702174773008602191856008602277852000902363655001202372IND4479331620221122084748.0141110e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447933162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shuangping10aEthanol production from Lycoris radiata Herbert (Amarylllidaceae) residues as a new resource  ap. 237-242.  aThe large quantities of Lycoris radiata Herbert (Amarylllidaceae) residues, left after the extraction of alkaloids from the bulbs, could threaten the environment if not properly disposed. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the feasibility of bioconversion of L. radiata Herbert residues to ethanol through batch fermentation. In L. radiata Herbert residues, the average contents (gÂ kgâ»Â¹) of non-structural carbohydrates, crude fiber, crude protein, ash, and lignin are 485.1, 177.3, 124.7, 108.9, and 91.0, respectively. Five commercial enzymes (Î²-glucanase, pectinase, xylanase, phytase and cellulase) were employed in pretreatment process and ethanol bioconversion was evaluated with three yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, osmotolerant S. cerevisiae and genetically engineered S. cerevisiae constructed to use cellobiose). The results showed that pretreament by Î²-glucanase successfully facilitated the penetration of Î±-amylase into ground material. After residues pretreatment by 10Â g kgâ»Â¹ of Î²-glucanase for 14Â h at 50Â Â°C, the viscosity decreased from 1135 to 59Â PaÂ·s which was equivalent to that obtained by the combined whole five enzymes. Further experiments proved that osmotolerant S. cerevisiae was desirable for ethanol production from Lycoris radiate Herbert residues. The results are helpful to develop non-grain bioethanol production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLycoris radiata 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalkaloids 3aalpha-amylase 3abatch fermentation 3abeta-glucanase 3abiotransformation 3abulbs 3acellobiose 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3alignin 3aphytases 3apolygalacturonase 3aviscosity 3axylanases 3ayeasts1 aDing, Zhongyang1 aZhang, Liang1 aGu, Zhenghua1 aWang, Xiaolan1 aSun, Xiaojun1 aShi, Guiyang0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2012 Feb., v. 37 p.237-242dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009000168300001800258500001500276520103400291592002801325650004401353650001401397650002801411650001501439650002001454650001601474650002801490650002001518650001501538650002601553653002201579653002401601653003201625653002401657653002301681653002301704700002101727700002201748700001401770773012801784856005101912852000901963655001201972IND50075494820221116182838.0140410e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007549482DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2010.5444672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakil, N.

By irradiation of 2-hydroxy chalcones with trifluoroacetic acid over silica gel, 11 known flavanones were prepared in high yields. The synthesised compounds were characterised using spectroscopic techniques, namely, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR and IR, and screened for their antifungal activity in vitro against Sclerotium rolfsii and Rhizoctonia solani by poisoned food technique. The compounds tested were found to be more active against R. solani, whereas against S. rolfsii, moderate activity was observed, as evident from LC₅₀ values.

Both the isoelectronic Ge₁₆Sc⁻ anion and neutral Ge₁₆Ti that have a perfect Frank–Kasper tetrahedral Td shape and an electron shell filled with 68 valence electrons, emerge as magic clusters with an enhanced thermodynamic stability. The latter can be rationalized by the simple Jellium model. Geometric distortions from the Frank–Kasper tetrahedron of Ge₁₆M having more or less than 68 valence electrons can be understood by a Jahn–Teller effect. Remarkably, DFT calculations reveal that both neutral Ge₁₆Sc and Ge₁₆Cu can be considered as superhalogens as their electron affinities (≥3.6 eV) exceed the value of the halogen atoms and even that of icosahedral Al₁₃. A detailed view of the magnetic behavior of Ge₁₆M⁰/⁻ clusters shows that the magnetic moments of the atomic metals remain large even when they are quenched upon doping. When M goes from Sc to Zn, the total spin magnetic moment of Ge₁₆M⁰/⁻ increases steadily and reaches the maximum value of 3 μB with M = Mn before decreasing towards the end of the first-row 3d block metals. Furthermore, the IR spectra of some tetrahedral Ge₁₆M are also predicted.  aPublisher supplied data 3agermanium 3ahalogens 3amagnetism 3amodels 3aquantum mechanics 3athermodynamics1 aCuong, Ngo Tuan1 aLan, Ngo Thi1 aTung, Nguyen Thanh1 aNguyen, Minh Tho1 aTam, Nguyen Minh0 tRSC advances.g2022 May 04, v. 12, no. 21 p.13487-13499dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra08527a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04818naa a2200949 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017300172520223300345592002802578650002302606650002102629650001902650650001402669650001302683650002702696650001902723650001202742650001702754650001002771650002702781650001702808650001002825650001902835650001702854650003502871650001602906650000902922650001102931650000902942650001202951650001502963650001702978650001402995650000903009650001303018650001903031650002103050650002803071650005203099650002403151650002803175650003203203653003303235653003403268653001903302653000803321653000903329653000903338653000703347653000903354653000903363653000803372653001003380653000803390653001103398653000903409653000903418653000803427653001103435653001103446653001003457653001303467700001903480700001903499700002003518700002003538700002003558700002003578700001903598700001503617700001603632700002003648773009403668856008503762852000903847655001203856IND60649558220221121232215.0190718e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064955822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1530052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Leong-Perng10aTris(8-Hydroxyquinoline)iron induces apoptotic cell death via oxidative stress and by activating death receptor signaling pathway in human head and neck carcinoma cells  a8-Hydroxyquinoline derivatives have highly sensitive fluorescent chemosensors for metal ions, which are associated with anti-oxidant, anti-tumor and anti-HIV-1 properties. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is associated with a high rate of mortality and novel anti-HNSCC drugs must be developed. Therefore, effective chemotherapy agents are required to address this public health issue.The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)iron (Feq3) on the HNSCC and the underlying mechanism.A novel 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative, Feq3, was synthesized. The cell viabilities were analyzed using MTT reagent. Apoptosis and the cell cycle distributions were determined by flow cytometer. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunofluorescence, western blot, MitoSOX and CellROX stain assay were used to study the mechanism of Feq3. Feq3 combined with antioxidants NAC (N-acetylcysteine) and BSO (buthionine sulfoximine) measured the cell viability and intracellular ROS.Feq3 induced the death of HNSCC cells and caused them to exhibit the morphological features of apoptosis. Feq3 also induced apoptosis of SCC9 cells by cell cycle arrest during the G2/M phase and the induced arrest of SCC25 cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases, which was associated with decreased cyclin B1/cdc2 and cyclin D/cdk4 expressions. Feq3 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduces glutathione (GSH) levels, and responds to increased p53 and p21 expressions. Feq3 induced apoptosis by mitochondria-mediated Bax and cytochrome c up-expression and down-expression Bcl-2. Feq3 also up-regulated tBid, which interacts with the mitochondrial pathway and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/TNF-Rs, FasL/Fas, and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptors (TRAIL-Rs)/TRAIL-dependent caspases apoptotic signaling pathway in HNSCC cells. However, Feq3 activates Fas but not FasL in SCC25 cells. Feq3 arrests the growth of HNSCC cells and is involved in the mitochondria- and death receptor (DR)-mediated caspases apoptotic pathway.This study is the first to suggest that apoptosis mediates the anti-HNSCC of Feq3. Feq3 has potential as a cancer therapeutic agent against HNSCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3a8-hydroxyquinoline 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylcysteine 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell viability 3acyclins 3acytochrome c 3adeath 3adeath domain receptors 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglutathione 3ahead 3ahumans 3airon 3aligands 3ametal ions 3amitochondria 3amortality 3aneck 3anecrosis 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aTris(8-Hydroxyquinoline)iron 0aHuman head and neck carcinoma 0aDeath receptor 0aBSO 0aDISC 0aDPPH 0aDR 0aFADD 0aFeq3 0aGSH 0aHNSCC 0aNAC 0aNF-κB 0aPARP 0arMSC 0aROS 0aRT-PCR 0aTNF-α 0aTRADD 0aTRAIL-Rs1 aTseng, Ya-Ping1 aDing, Hsiou-Yu1 aPan, Sheng-Ming1 aChiang, Feng-Yu1 aWang, Ling-Feng1 aChou, Tzung-Han1 aLien, Pei-Jung1 aLiu, Cheng1 aGuo, Bolin,1 aLiang, Chia-Hua0 tPhytomedicine.g2019 Oct., v. 63 p.153005-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1530053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02573naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245019600159300002000355520145500375592002801830650001501858650003001873650001501903650001601918700002301934700002301957700002001980700001702000700002202017773012402039856007502163852000902238655001202247IND60776418020221117184804.0220506e20220503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077641802DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra08561a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishat, Maliha10aRole of metal and anions in organo-metal halide perovskites CH₃NH₃MX₃ (M: Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Sn, Pb; X: Cl, Br, I) on structural and optoelectronic properties for photovoltaic applications  ap. 13281-13294.  aMethylammonium metal halide perovskites have recently been explored for new uses due to their unique and exciting optoelectronic properties. Their exceptional electronic properties have often been attributed to the overlap between the metal cation s and halogen p states. In this study, density functional theory calculations have been carried out based on the orthorhombic phase of the organometal trihalide perovskite CH₃NH₃MX₃ (M: Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Sn, Pb; X: Cl, Br, I) to systematically investigate the effects of the metal cation and halogen anion on the structural, electronic, and optical properties for solar cell applications. The calculated lattice parameters agree well with previously obtained experimental and theoretical results. All of these perovskites are direct band gap compounds at the G symmetry point, except CH₃NH₃GaX₃. The band gap increases from iodide to chloride and also with the metal cation size, from Ge to Pb or Cu to Zn. Furthermore, metal halide perovskites show blue shifts in their optical absorption spectra with an increase in metal cation size. Among the studied examples, CH₃NH₃GaBr₃ and CH₃NH₃CuCl₃ absorb a wide range of light, from UV to the visible region, and possess very unusual high dielectric constants and refractive indices. Our calculations reveal that CH₃NH₃SnI₃, CH₃NH₃GeI₃, and CH₃NH₃ZnI₃ are favorable candidates for lead-free photovoltaic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adensity functional theory 3ametal ions 3asolar cells1 aHossain, Md.

The number average molecular weight (Mₙ) of PDMI was as high as Mₙ = 15 000 g mol⁻¹, the monomer conversion rate reached up to 70%, and the dispersity remained low (Đ = 1.06–1.38). The first-order kinetics of PDMI are discussed in detail. The AIBME initiator had a higher initiation efficiency than the AIBN initiator. As the ratio of initiator (AIBME) to catalyst (CuBr₂) decreased, the Mₙ and Đ of PDMI decreased. At 60 °C and 80 °C, the Mₙ of PDMI was much higher than the theoretical number average (Mₙ,ₜₕ), and the Đ of PDMI broadened with the conversion rate. At 100 °C, the Đ of PDMI remained low, and the Mₙ of PDMI was closer to the Mₙ,ₜₕ. As the ratio of monomer (DMI) to initiator (AIBME) increased, the Mₙ of PDMI changed little over time. These phenomena could be explained by the influence of the initiator and catalyst on polymerization kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization1 aJi, HaiJun1 aYang, Hui1 aYu, Jie1 aWang, Jiaqi1 aZhang, Liqun1 aZhou, Xinxin1 aWang, Runguo0 tRSC advances.g2022 May 04, v. 12, no. 21 p.13347-13351dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra08878e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008200167300001600249520089000265592002801155650001701183650001901200650001401219650002301233650001901256650001401275650001601289700002201305700002501327773011901352856008201471852000901553655001201562IND60630627720221122113401.0220819e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063062772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-008-3153-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukahori, Shuji10aSelective oxidation of benzyl alcohol using RuHAp-containing sheet composites  ap. 374-378.  aRu-containing hydroxyapatite (RuHAp) powder was successfully impregnated into sheet composites using a papermaking technique, and its catalytic efficiency was investigated.

This study applies the contention from development studies that participatory approaches may be tyrannical to participatory monitoring of Nepal's community forests. There is a tyranny of the group because elites within the community stand to benefit at the cost of those already marginalized. In theory, tyranny is produced through the methods employed in the projects, as they promote scientific systems of monitoring at the expense of local understandings of environmental change; in practice, however, the latter aspects override official monitoring to enable effective learning from the projects. In some instances, tyranny is produced through decision-making and control, whilst, in other cases, the reverse is true and communities are empowered through their participatory monitoring efforts. Policy makers and those involved in participatory monitoring should endeavour to transform tyranny created at local and wider scales. Participatory monitoring holds huge potential in the assessment of biodiversity, natural resources and ecosystem services, but programmes and projects need to effectively deliver associated benefits of conservation and community empowerment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acommunity development 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3alearning 3amonitoring 3ascientists 3aNepal 0acitizen science 0acommunity-based conservation 0adevelopment studies 0aecological monitoring 0ainterdisciplinary 0aNepal 0aparticipation 0aparticipatory monitoring1 aNIGHTINGALE, ANDREA1 aShrestha, Shyam K.,0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2015 Sept., v. 42, no. 3 p.268-277dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S037689291500003X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011500161300001600276520103000292592002801322650001601350650002101366650001201387650001901399650001501418650003101433650001401464653001201478653000801490653002301498653001301521653003801534700001701572700001601589700001501605773011201620856008201732852000901814655001201823IND60630957120221120140524.0190326e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063095712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2019.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Wei10aLimonin attenuates the stemness of cervical carcinoma cells by promoting YAP nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation  ap. 621-628.  aThis work aimed to investigate the role and related mechanism of limonin in regulating the stemness of cervical carcinoma (CC) cells. In the present study, we constructed adriamycin-resistant CC cells and found that they exhibited greater stemness than parental cells. Additionally, limonin attenuated the stemness of CC cells that were resistant or sensitive to adriamycin, as evidenced by the decreases in spheroid formation capacity, stemness markers expression and ALDH1 activity, whereas limonin did not affect the viability of normal cervical epithelial cells. Furthermore, limonin enhanced adriamycin sensitivity and attenuated adriamycin resistance in CC cells. Mechanistically, the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of YAP, not TAZ, was promoted by limonin in CC cells. Additionally, YAP overexpression attenuated the inhibitory effects of limonin on CC cell stemness. Therefore, limonin can attenuate the stemness, and thus the chemoresistance, of CC cells by promoting the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of YAP.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3aepithelial cells 3alimonin 3aneoplasm cells 3atoxicology 3auterine cervical neoplasms 3aviability 0aLimonin 0aYAP 0aCervical carcinoma 0aStemness 0aNuclear-cytoplasmic translocation1 aWu, Mingyuan1 aCui, Lijuan1 aDu, Wenxia0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Mar., v. 125 p.621-628dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04103naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245019700171500001900368520220500387592002802592650002602620650001602646650001802662650001602680650001902696650001202715650001102727650002602738650002202764650001302786650002402799650001902823650001102842650000702853650001302860650001302873650001602886653002802902653002502930653001502955700002302970700002302993700002603016700003703042700002403079700002103103700002303124700001903147700002003166700002203186700002603208700001803234700002103252773011903273856008803392852000903480655001203489IND60704738020221118022311.0210114e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070473802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1409492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamajo, Laura10aUpwelling intensity modulates the fitness and physiological performance of coastal species: Implications for the aquaculture of the scallop Argopecten purpuratus in the Humboldt Current System  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding how marine species cope with the natural environmental variability of their native habitats will provide significant information about their sensitivity to the potential environmental changes driven by climate change. In particular, marine species inhabiting upwelling ecosystems are experiencing low seawater temperatures, as well as, acidic and low oxygen conditions as a consequence of the nature of the deep upwelled waters. Our study is focused on one of the most important socio-economical resources of the Humboldt Current System (HCS): the scallop Argopecten purpuratus which has been historically subjected to intensive aquaculture in areas influenced by upwelling processes. Here, a long-term field experiment was performed to understand how tolerant and well-locally-adapted is A. purpuratus to upwelling conditions by studying a set of fitness, physiological, and biomineralogical traits. Stronger upwelling generated a minor water column stratification, with lower temperatures, pH, and oxygen conditions. On the contrary, as upwelling weakened, temperature, pH, and oxygen availability increased. Finally, upwelling intensity also determined the number, duration, and intensity of the cooling and de-oxygenation events occurring in A. purpuratus habitat, as well as, the food availability (chlorophyll-a concentration, Chl-a). Physiologically, A. purpuratus was able to cope with stressful environmental conditions imposed by higher upwelling intensities by enhancing its metabolic and calcification rates, as well, producing higher concentrations of the shell organic matter. These physiological changes impacted the total energy budget, which was highly dependent on Chl-a concentration, and revealed important traits trade-offs with significant fitness costs (higher mortalities emerged when longer and more intense upwelling events succeed). Our study increases the knowledge about the physiological performance and tolerance of this important resource to the ocean acidification and ocean-deoxygenation imposed by variable upwelling intensities, as well as, its potential vulnerability under future changing conditions driven by a potential upwelling intensification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArgopecten purpuratus 3aaquaculture 3acalcification 3achlorophyll 3aclimate change 3acooling 3aenergy 3afield experimentation 3afood availability 3ahabitats 3aocean acidification 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apH 3ascallops 3aseawater 3atemperature 0aHumboldt Current System 0aOcean de-oxygenation 0aPhysiology1 aValladares, María1 aAstudillo, Orlando1 aFernández, Carolina,1 aRodríguez-Navarro, Alejandro B.1 aWatt-Arévalo, Paul1 aNúñez, Manuel,1 aGrenier, Christian1 aRomán, Rocío1 aAguayo, Paulina1 aLardies, Marco A.1 aBroitman, Bernardo R.1 aTapia, Pamela1 aTapia, Christian0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 745 p.140949-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1409493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245007600166300001600242520110000258592002801358650001101386650002101397650002201418650001201440650002201452650001501474650001101489650001501500651001201515651001101527651001401538651001301552651001401565653001501579653002101594653001601615653002201631653001801653653002401671653002801695700001901723700001801742700001901760773013401779856008001913852000901993655001202002IND60623075720221117015301.0181127e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062307572DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965073062202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarson, Anne M.14aThe Effects of Forestry Decentralization on Access to Livelihood Assets  ap. 251-268.  aDespite its argued theoretical benefits, forestry decentralization in practice can have detrimental effects on forest-dependent peoples, but little is understood about the specific paths by which decentralization affects livelihoods. This article, based on data from research in 2005 in Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, presents a working conceptual model for analyzing these interactions. The research found that vulnerability increased when decentralization was not combined with policies addressing structural inequities-that is, increased municipal government control over land and forests must be accompanied by policies increasing poor local people's access rights and security. At the same time, increased municipal government authority over forest management and monitoring can facilitate access to these and other assets needed for forest livelihoods, but this new responsibility must also be accompanied by improved controls over local authorities. The needed changes rarely come about without specific organized demands of local actors' associations and movements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3adecentralization 3aforest management 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aBolivia 3aBrazil 3aGuatemala 3aHonduras 3aNicaragua 0agovernance 0adecentralization 0alivelihoods 0aforest management 0aLatin America 0aaccess to resources 0aforest-dependent groups1 aPacheco, Pablo1 aToni, Fabiano1 aVallejo, Mario0 tJournal of environment & development.g2007 Sept., v. 16, no. 3 p.251-268dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965073062203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01318naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008500166300001200251520046600263592002800729650001500757650002800772650003700800650001900837773010600856856008100962852000901043655001201052IND60082446020221121014554.0151024e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008244602DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-014-0982-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPärtel, Kadri10aUltrastructure of the ascus apical apparatus of Encoelia furfuracea (Helotiales)  ap. 982.  aThe ultrastructural characteristics of the ascus apical apparatus of Encoelia furfuracea are described by means of transmission electron microscopy.

The results showed that the culture filtrate of E. nigrum induced the highest efficacy against powdery mildew relative to other treatments in both tested seasons. Moreover, culture filtrate of E.nigrum mixed with the tested fungicide gave higher efficiency against powdery mildew than use of the fungicide alone. The efficacy of the tested culture filtrates against powdery mildew due to the presence of different antifungal compounds identified by (GC–MS) analysis. This study suggests the ability of using the culture filtrates of the tested bio-agents as alternative of fungicides to control powdery mildew in okra. Furthermore, the results implied the possibility to minimise the use of fungicides by mixing with the microbial culture filtrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus pumilus 3aEpicoccum nigrum 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aTrichoderma viride 3aantifungal agents 3aculture filtrates 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aokra 3apenconazole 3apowdery mildew 0aEpicoccum nigrum 0aokra 0apathogen 0abio-agents 0aSphaerotheca fuliginea1 aEl Kot, G.

Phylogenetic analyses based on the LSU and ITS regions reveal that Elmerina was a polyphyletic genus. Moreover, E. hexagonoides collected from Malaysia and “E. hexagonoides” from Japan formed two distinct clades within a well-supported larger clade with Protomerulius caryae. These taxa comprise a different lineage from the type species of both Protomerulius and Protodaedalea, and we conclude that they are members of the genus Aporpium. The phylogenetic position of E. cladophora (type species of Elmerina) is still unclear, and we retain Aporpium and Protodaedalea as genera distinct from Elmerina. Aporpium strigosum sp. nov. is described to represent Japanese specimens misidentified as E. hexagonoides. Aporpium is characterized by resupinate to sessile basidiocarps, tough-fleshy to leathery context, poroid hymenophore, dimitic hyphal systems with unbranched skeletal hyphae, clavate to pyriform probasidia, and ellipsoid to cylindrical or allantoid basidiospores. Aporpium strigosum is similar to A. hexagonoides, but can be differentiated by the ochraceous to straw-colored basidiocarps, strigose pileus surface with long and stiff hairs, and the larger pores, basidia, and basidiospores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAuriculariales 3aCladophora 3aElmerina 3abasidia 3abasidiospores 3ahairs 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3apolyphyly 3aJapan 3aMalaysia1 aMaekawa, Nitato1 aNakagiri, Akira1 aLee, S.

Two-gram samples of mash broiler feed were added into a filtered sample bag and inoculated with nalidixic acid (NaL, 200 ppm) resistant S. Typhimurium or Enterococcus faecium, followed by vacuum-packaging and heating in a circulated thermal water bath at 75°, 85°, and 95°C for 0 to 180 s. Counts of bacterial survival were analyzed on tryptic soy agar and bile esculin agar plus 200 ppm of NaL. Microbial data and thermal kinetic parameters (n = 8, Global-Fit and United States Department of Agriculture [USDA]-Integrated-Predictive-Modeling-Program software) were analyzed by JMP software. Heating mash broiler feed at 75°, 85°, and 95°C decreased (P < 0.05) Salmonella cell counts by >6 log₁₀CFU/g after 180, 60, and 50 s, respectively. Heating E. faecium in feed at 75°, 85°, and 95°C for 180, 120, and 70 s achieved reductions of 3, 6, and >6.5 log₁₀CFU/g, respectively. D-values of linear, Weibull models, and z-value of Salmonella at 75°, 85°, and 95°C were 1.8 to 11.2, 4.2 to 21.8, and 28.6 s, respectively, which were lower (P < 0.05) than those of E. faecium (3.7–18.1, 8.5–34.4, and 34.1 s). Linear with Tail, Linear with Tail and Shoulder, and Weibull with tail equations revealed that E. faecium were more resistant (P < 0.05) to heat than Salmonella as shown by longer “Shoulder-time” (26.5 vs. 16.2 s) and greater “Tail” effect (4.4–4.5 vs. 2.5–2.6 log₁₀CFU/g). Results clearly suggested that E. faecium can be used as a surrogate for Salmonella to validate thermal inactivation during feed manufacture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aUSDA 3aWeibull statistics 3aagar 3abile 3acomputer software 3aesculin 3aheat inactivation 3amanufacturing 3amash 3analidixic acid 3avacuum packaging 0abroiler feed 0aSalmonella 0aEnterococcus faecium 0athermal inactivation 0asurrogate bacteria1 aBoltz, Timothy1 aStearns, Rebecca1 aFoster, Peighton1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6935-15761 aTaylor, Robert L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6215-71801 aMoritz, Joe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1397-74811 aJaczynski, Jacek1 aFreshour, Annette1 aShen, Cangliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7741-72640 tPoultry science.g2022 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.101976-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2022.1019763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245009900162300001600261520105600277592002801333650001101361650002101372650002501393650002501418650001301443650002801456651001301484653002001497653002001517653001301537653002701550653002501577653002301602700001801625773013401643856008001777852000901857655001201866IND60623075920221117015240.0181127e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062307592DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965073062232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonami, Aki10aSustainable Development in ThailandbLessons From Implementing Local Agenda 21 in Three Cities  ap. 269-289.  aThis article examines the effect of development assistance programs on Local Agenda 21 (LA21) programs in three municipalities of Thailand. First, the article examines institutional changes in Thailand geared toward decentralization. Second, the article analyzes the effect based on the frameworks of Noda and Ouchi for the level of participation. The results indicate that participation was a top—down participation of local residents who presumed some benefits from the municipality in exchange for their attendance in meetings. Third, the article evaluates the effect in terms of project efficiency. The results show that municipalities conducted most of the actions declared in their LA21 but the sustainability of these actions is questionable. It is contended that LA21 has its limitations as a planning guide for sustainable cities in developing countries. An assistance program should be designed that helps the government of a developing country to institutionalize meaningful involvement for a participatory environmental policy formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adecentralization 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental policy 3aplanning 3asustainable development 3aThailand 0adevelopment aid 0aLocal Agenda 21 0aThailand 0asubsidiarity principle 0apublic participation 0aproject efficiency1 aMori, Akihisa0 tJournal of environment & development.g2007 Sept., v. 16, no. 3 p.269-289dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965073062233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245006900174300001600243520100600259592002801265650002101293650000901314650002401323650002401347650002001371650000901391650001401400650001101414650001701425653001501442653001401457653002101471653002301492653002101515700002001536700002001556773010601576856008701682852000901769655001201778IND60536187620221118173954.0190410e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053618762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamazi, Azadeh B.10aMicrowave-assisted pyrolysis and activation of pulp mill sludge  ap. 217-224.  aThis work analyses the effects of microwaves on the production of char – the solid product of pyrolysis. Using pulp mill sludge and a 1200 W microwave oven, the pyrolysis of the sludge was analyzed and compared with that of conventional heating. Alkali metal hydroxide is an effective microwave absorber; adding a mass fraction of 5% of KOH to dried sludge enabled a complete pyrolysis in a few minutes, compared to hours in conventional pyrolysis. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis, however, retained 20% less carbon from the sludge, likely caused by the faster release of volatiles. The secondary sludge yielded more char than the primary sludge, which may be attributed to its greater protein content. Microwave-assisted combined pyrolysis and activation was feasible, due to the dual roles of alkali metal hydroxides as activating agent and microwave absorber. The combined one-step process generated an activated carbon with a specific surface area of 660 m2g−1 from the sludge in three minutes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aheat 3amicrowave treatment 3apotassium hydroxide 3aprotein content 3apulp 3apyrolysis 3asludge 3asurface area 0aMicrowaves 0aPyrolysis 0aPulp mill sludge 0aMicrowave absorber 0aActivated carbon1 aGrant Allen, D.1 aJia, Charles Q.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Feb., v. 73 p.217-224dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.12.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02644naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245011900199506011700318506007600435520104700511592002801558506003701586650002701623650001901650650001001669650001301679650002001692650001601712650001301728650001501741650001801756650002001774653001201794653001601806653001101822653002401833653001501857700001601872700005601888700001601944700001601960773010701976856008202083852000902165655001202174IND60778522920221207105011.0220726e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077852292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2022.1019772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Geng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3914-626110aResearch Note: IsomiRs of chicken miR-146b-5p are activated upon Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis infection  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn order to enrich the knowledge of chicken transcriptomic response to Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis infection, 2-day-old chicks were orally inoculated with this bacteria (1.0 × 10⁸ cfu/mL), and then the cecum tissues of 3 days post-inoculation were utilized for RNA sequencing (6 replicates each for treatment group and control group). After analysis, we found a variety of inflammatory genes were triggered at the mRNA level upon infection. Notably, the expression profiles at the miRNA level and the isomiR level were heterogeneous. Certain isomiRs of chicken miR-146b-5p were significantly increased by more than 2 times compared to control (Padj < 0.05). Combining the bioinformatics prediction, transcriptome data and RT-qPCR results, we deduced that the isomiRs of chicken miR-146b-5p might act to sustain the RIG-I-like receptor signaling and type I interferon induction by repressing USP3 transcript. Our findings provide a new perspective on the regulatory function of miR-146b-5p and facilitate the study of isomiRs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3abioinformatics 3acecum 3achickens 3agene expression 3ainterferons 3amicroRNA 3aprediction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 0achicken 0amiR-146b-5p 0aisomiR 0aRIG-I-like receptor 0ainterferon1 aLiu, Liying1 aMiao, Xiuxiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2538-88761 aZhao, Yanan1 aLi, Xianyao0 tPoultry science.g2022 Aug., v. 101, no. 8 p.101977-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2022.1019773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03719naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012200169300001800291500001500309520198900324592002802313650002802341650001402369650001102383650002102394650001402415650002002429650002202449650001602471650001602487650001402503650001202517653002402529700002802553700002402581700001802605700002502623700002102648700002002669700002102689700002502710700002402735700002502759700002002784700002302804700002102827700002202848700001902870700001802889700002102907700002202928700002302950773008702973856004803060852000903108655001203117IND50061255520221117002925.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006125552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-012-9584-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Benjamin I.10aSensitivity of Spring Phenology to Warming Across Temporal and Spatial Climate Gradients in Two Independent Databases  ap. 1283-1294.  a2019-12-06  aDisparate ecological datasets are often organized into databases post hoc and then analyzed and interpreted in ways that may diverge from the purposes of the original data collections. Few studies, however, have attempted to quantify how biases inherent in these data (for example, species richness, replication, climate) affect their suitability for addressing broad scientific questions, especially in under-represented systems (for example, deserts, tropical forests) and wild communities. Here, we quantitatively compare the sensitivity of species first flowering and leafing dates to spring warmth in two phenological databases from the Northern Hemisphere. One—PEP725—has high replication within and across sites, but has low species diversity and spans a limited climate gradient. The other—NECTAR—includes many more species and a wider range of climates, but has fewer sites and low replication of species across sites. PEP725, despite low species diversity and relatively low seasonality, accurately captures the magnitude and seasonality of warming responses at climatically similar NECTAR sites, with most species showing earlier phenological events in response to warming. In NECTAR, the prevalence of temperature responders significantly declines with increasing mean annual temperature, a pattern that cannot be detected across the limited climate gradient spanned by the PEP725 flowering and leafing data. Our results showcase broad areas of agreement between the two databases, despite significant differences in species richness and geographic coverage, while also noting areas where including data across broader climate gradients may provide added value. Such comparisons help to identify gaps in our observations and knowledge base that can be addressed by ongoing monitoring and research efforts. Resolving these issues will be critical for improving predictions in understudied and under-sampled systems outside of the temperature seasonal mid-latitudes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterspecific variation 3aflowering 3anectar 3atropical forests 3aphenology 3adata collection 3aspecies diversity 3avalue added 3atemperature 3adatabases 3aclimate 0aspecies differences1 aWolkovich, Elizabeth M.1 aDavies, T.

But substitution behavior and the associated health impact may vary between individuals. We therefore propose the use of probabilistic methods to model substitution and assess health impact distributions in risk-benefit assessment (RBA) of foods.We investigated the health impact of substituting red and processed meat with fish in the Danish adult population and the variability in health impact. We applied probabilistic approaches in modeling the substitution to reflect variability between individual substitution behaviors. Furthermore, when multiple intake scenarios are compared, we propose a method for adjusting intake differences for individual day-to-day variability.We estimated that 134 (95% UI: 102; 169) Disability-Adjusted Life Years/100,000 were averted per year by the substitution. The health impact varied considerably by age and sex, with the largest health benefit of the substitution observed for young women in the child-bearing age and for the older generation, mainly men.This study provides further insight in how the health impact of substituting meat by fish varies between individuals and suggests a framework to be applied in RBAs of other food substitutions. Our results are relevant for policy makers in defining targeted public health strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acase studies 3afish 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aprobability analysis 3aprocessed meat 3apublic health 3arisk-benefit analysis 3atoxicology 3awomen 0aRisk-benefit assessment (RBA) 0aDisability-Adjusted Life Year(DALY) 0aUsual intake difference model 0aFood-based dietary guidelines 0aSubstitution 0aHealth impact 0aAI 0aAR 0aBLUP 0aBw 0aCHD 0aCRC 0aDALY 0aDANSDA 0aDHA 0adl-PCB 0aDW 0aEPA 0aFBDG 0aGIES 0aIQ 0aLE 0aLNN 0aMeHg 0aNCSC 0aOIM 0aP2.5 0aP10 0aP50 0aP90 0aP97.5 0aRBA 0aSD 0aTEQ 0aTWI 0aUID 0aYLD 0aYLL1 ade Boer, Waldo1 aPires, Sara M.1 aDevleesschauwer, Brecht1 aFagt, Sisse1 aAndersen, Rikke1 aPoulsen, Morten1 avan der Voet, Hilko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0802-73820 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2019 Apr., v. 126 p.79-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.02.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011000157520180800267592002802075650002902103650001502132650002802147650002002175650002102195650001502216650002602231650001902257650001502276650002202291650001702313650001502330650001002345700002202355700001802377700002102395773012902416856007402545852000902619655001202628IND60660546920221119082135.0190823e20190813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066054692DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111618922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiala, Zolo 10aFeature Selection on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery for Mapping a Landscape Infested by Parthenium Weed  aIn the recent past, the volume of spatial datasets has significantly increased. This is attributed to, among other factors, higher sensor temporal resolutions of the recently launched satellites. The increased data, combined with the computation and possible derivation of a large number of indices, may lead to high multi-collinearity and redundant features that compromise the performance of classifiers. Using dimension reduction algorithms, a subset of these features can be selected, hence increasing their predictive potential. In this regard, an investigation into the application of feature selection techniques on multi-temporal multispectral datasets such as Sentinel-2 is valuable in vegetation mapping. In this study, ten feature selection methods belonging to five groups (Similarity-based, statistical-based, Sparse learning based, Information theoretical based, and wrappers methods) were compared based on f-score and data size for mapping a landscape infested by the Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus). Overall, results showed that ReliefF (a Similarity-based approach) was the best performing feature selection method as demonstrated by the high f-score values of Parthenium weed and a small size of optimal features selected. Although svm-b (a wrapper method) yielded the highest accuracies, the size of optimal subset of selected features was quite large. Results also showed that data size affects the performance of feature selection algorithms, except for statistically-based methods such as Gini-index and F-score and svm-b. Findings in this study provide a guidance on the application of feature selection methods for accurate mapping of invasive plant species in general and Parthenium weed, in particular, using new multispectral imagery with high temporal resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParthenium hysterophorus 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3adata collection 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3amultispectral imagery 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aselection methods 3aspatial data 3avegetation 3aweeds1 aMutanga, Onisimo 1 aOdindi, John 1 aPeerbhay, Kabir 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Aug. 13, v. 11, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111618923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245015500171500001900326520200000345592002802345650001302373650002402386650000802410650001802418650001802436650001602454650001102470650002202481650001602503650001502519650001202534650001602546651001002562651002402572653001002596653000802606653001902614653002502633653000902658700006102667700001802728700001702746700002202763700002902785700001502814773011902829856008802948852000903036655001203045IND60704738520221118022251.0201202e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070473852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1409632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Tanbir10aClimatological trends in satellite-derived aerosol optical depth over North India and its relationship with crop residue burning: Rural-urban contrast  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aColumnar Aerosol Optical Depths (AOD) over an urban area (Chandigarh) and a rural area (Khera, Fatehgarh Sahib district) situated in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India were analysed to study their temporal heterogeneity in terms of interannual, seasonal and monthly variations. Over the last few decades, IGP has become one of the global hotspots of air pollution due to the increased anthropogenic activities such as traffic, industries, agricultural waste burning etc. Level-2 AODs (550 nm) were retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, for a period of 14 years (2005–2018). The climatological mean Terra-MODIS (Aqua-MODIS) AOD over the urban location was ~0.497 ± 0.238 (0.474 ± 0.228), whereas over the rural location it was 0.542 ± 0.269 (0.534 ± 0.282). Linear trend analysis estimated an increase in annual mean Terra-MODIS (Aqua-MODIS) AOD at a rate of ~0.009 (0.013) per year over the urban site; whereas over the rural location the rate of increase was ~0.003 (0.004) per year. Results show that the observed increase is ~1.49% (2.41%) of climatological mean AOD over the urban location for Terra-MODIS (Aqua-MODIS), whereas, over the rural location, it was ~0.50% (0.67%). Using the HYSPLIT trajectory model, it was concluded that, during post-monsoon, the observed high AODs can be related to massive crop residue burning in the IGP region. These AOD trends can also be used to track the regional anthropogenic air-pollution changes. An empirical relation between AOD and PM₁₀ was established, which can be used to estimate PM₁₀ over the urban and rural areas of IGP (using MODIS AODs), complementing the sparse ground-based monitoring. Further, satellite-based air pollution data can be used for baseline assessment and understanding the impact of control policies such as National Clean Air Programme and to support formulate evidence-based pollution control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aagricultural wastes 3aair 3aair pollution 3acrop residues 3aenvironment 3amodels 3apollution control 3arural areas 3asatellites 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain 0aMODIS 0aIGP 0aRural location 0aCrop residue burning 0aNCAP1 aRavindra, Khaiwal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1000-48441 aSreekanth, V.1 aGupta, Pawan1 aSembhi, Harjinder1 aTripathi, Sachchida Nand1 aMor, Suman0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 748 p.140963-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1409633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245004700174300001200221520086100233592002801094650001501122650001701137650001301154650001701167650001301184650001301197650001001210650003301220650000901253650001401262650001801276650001301294700002601307700002101333773010601354856008101460852000901541655001201550IND60082446620221120234401.0151024e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008244662DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-014-0989-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcTaggart, Alistair R.14aThe rusts on Goodeniaceae and Stylidiaceae  ap. 989.  aSystematic relationships between the rusts on Goodeniaceae and Stylidiaceae were examined using phylogenetic analyses with two loci (internal transcribed spacer, large subunit region) from ribosomal DNA.

The purified gene products possessed the ATPase activity similar to other bacterial and eukaryal counterparts. Recombinant GroELGt and GroESGt were able to refold the denatured insoluble aggregates of α-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis into soluble and active form. Furthermore, GroELGt and GroESGt successfully enhanced the thermostability of porcine heart malate dehydrogenase. Expression of GroELGt gene in E. coli cells enhanced the thermotolerance of the host. Furthermore, soluble production of recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis strain R5 in E. coli, initially produced as insoluble aggregates, was achieved by co-expressing the gene with GroELGt. Our results implied that GroELGt could assist folding of nascent protein in E. coli with the help of host co-chaperonin without requiring additional ATP. This system can be used for soluble production of recombinant proteins which otherwise are produced in insoluble form in E. coli. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on functional characterization and applications of chaperonins from genus Geobacillus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aGeobacillus 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aalpha-amylase 3achaperonins 3agenes 3aheart 3aheat tolerance 3amalate dehydrogenase 3aprotein folding 3arecombinant proteins 3aswine 3athermal stability 0aChaperonin 0aCo-chaperonin 0aProtein folding 0aThermotolerance 0aGeobacillus thermopakistaniensis1 aMuhammad, Majida Atta1 aRashid, Naeem1 aAkhtar, Muhammad0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2017 July 20, v. 254 p.9-16dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245014100159300001600300520058800316592002800904650002200932650002100954650002200975650002000997650002201017650000901039653004101048653001401089653001501103653002201118700001801140700002101158700001901179773015001198856007701348852000901425655001201434IND60521760320221119151909.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052176032DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-03242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemant, Udo10aFormamidinhim-Hexachloroferrat(III) Synthese und Kristallstruktur / Formamidinium-Hexachloroferrate(III) Synthesis and Crystal Structure  ap. 443-446.  a[HC(NH₂)₂]₃FeCl₆ was obtained together with other products from the reaction of S₄N₄ with HCl in H₂CCl₂ in the presence of FeCl₃.

This discrepancy might be due to the assumptions on quantitative trait loci (QTL) properties applied in simulation studies, including number of QTL, spectrum of QTL allele frequencies across breeds, and distribution of allele substitution effects. We investigated the effects of QTL properties and of including a random across- and within-breed animal effect in a genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model on accuracy of multi-breed genomic prediction using genotypes of Holstein-Friesian and Jersey cows. METHODS: Genotypes of three classes of variants obtained from whole-genome sequence data, with moderately low, very low or extremely low average minor allele frequencies (MAF), were imputed in 3000 Holstein-Friesian and 3000 Jersey cows that had real high-density genotypes. Phenotypes of traits controlled by QTL with different properties were simulated by sampling 100 or 1000 QTL from one class of variants and their allele substitution effects either randomly from a gamma distribution, or computed such that each QTL explained the same variance, i.e. rare alleles had a large effect. Genomic breeding values for 1000 selection candidates per breed were estimated using GBLUP modelsincluding a random across- and a within-breed animal effect. RESULTS: For all three classes of QTL allele frequency spectra, accuracies of genomic prediction were not affected by the addition of 2000 individuals of the other breed to a reference population of the same breed as the selection candidates. Accuracies of both single- and multi-breed genomic prediction decreased as MAF of QTL decreased, especially when rare alleles had a large effect. Accuracies of genomic prediction were similar for the models with and without a random within-breed animal effect, probably because of insufficient power to separate across- and within-breed animal effects. CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy of both single- and multi-breed genomic prediction depends on the properties of the QTL that underlie the trait. As QTL MAF decreased, accuracy decreased, especially when rare alleles had a large effect. This demonstrates that QTL properties are key parameters that determine the accuracy of genomic prediction.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3aalleles 3abreeding value 3acows 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3amodels 3aphenotype 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3aquantitative trait loci 3avariance1 aCalus, Mario PL1 aGoddard, Michael E1 aHayes, Ben J0 tGenetics, selection, evolution.g2015 Dec., v. 47, no. 1 p.124-124dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350896x0999-193X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12711-015-0124-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04551naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003200135040001800167100002700185245010100212300001200313500001500325506007600340520234700416592002802763506003702791650001702828650000902845650001502854650001102869650002802880650001602908650002102924650002402945650001902969650001402988650001503002650002003017650001403037650002103051650002403072650001803096650001003114650001803124650002803142650001503170650002003185650002303205650002903228650001103257650003303268650003203301650004203333650001103375650002003386650000903406650001603415650003203431651001103463651001003474651001103484651001003495653001503505700002203520700001803542700001803560773016103578856004503739852000903784655001203793IND50058751220221207055152.0201006e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005875122DNAL7 a215923782pmid7 aPMC31181292pmcid7 a10.1186/1479-5868-8-422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenmöller, Doenja L10aDeterminants of changes in dietary patterns among Chinese immigrants: a cross-sectional analysis  ap. 439.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Chinese individuals who have immigrated to a Western country initially tend to have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to people who are already living there. Some studies have found, however, that CVD risk increases over time in immigrants and that immigration to a western country is associated with changes in dietary patterns. This could have unfavourable effects on the risk of CVD. There is limited knowledge on the food patterns, awareness and knowledge about healthy nutrition among Chinese immigrants. The objective for this study is to explore changes in food patterns, and levels of awareness and knowledge of healthy nutrition by length of residence among Chinese immigrants to Canada. METHODS: 120 Chinese individuals born in China but currently living in Canada completed an assessment on socio-demographic characteristics, changes in dietary patterns and variables of awareness and knowledge about healthy foods. With ordinal logistic regression the associations between the quartiles of length of residence and dietary patterns, variables of awareness and knowledge about healthy foods were explored, adjusting for age, sex, education and body mass index. RESULTS: More than 50% of the participants reported increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, decreasing the use of deep-frying after immigration. Increased awareness and knowledge about healthy foods was reported by more than 50% of the participants. Ordinal regression indicated that Chinese immigrants who lived in Canada the longest, compared to Chinese immigrants who lived in Canada the shortest, consumed significant greater portion sizes (OR: 9.9; 95% CI: 3.11 - 31.15), dined out more frequently (OR: 15.8; 95% CI: 5.0 - 49.85), and consumed convenience foods more often (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.23 - 10.01). CONCLUSIONS: Chinese immigrants reported some favourable changes in their dietary intake and greater awareness and more knowledge about healthy foods after immigration. However, an increase in portion size, an increased frequency of dining out and an increased consumption of convenience foods could indicate some unfavourable changes. These results suggest that health promotion strategies should build on the observed benefits of improved nutritional knowledge and target areas of portion size and convenience eating.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aportion size 3arisk 3avegetables 3afruits 3acardiovascular diseases 3aimmigration 3ahealth promotion 3aregression analysis 3aprepared foods 3aeducation 3aeating out 3abody mass index 3aingestion 3afood consumption 3anutrition knowledge 2aAcculturation 2aAdult 2aAsian People. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDemography 2aDietxethnology 2aEducational Status 2aEmigrants and Immigrants 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behaviorxethnology. 2aFood Preferencesxethnology 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 3aCanada 3aChina 0aCanada 0aChina 0aimmigrants1 aGasevic, Danijela1 aSeidell, Jaap1 aLear, Scott A0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2011 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.439-439dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-8-42  aDNAL 7aarticle02616naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245008500173300001200258520125200270592002801522650001901550650001301569650001201582650001201594650001101606650001801617650001501635650001701650650001201667650001001679650001301689650001701702650002601719650001901745650001101764650001701775650001201792650003101804651001001835700001701845700001801862700002001880700002601900773010601926856008102032852000902113655001202122IND60082446920221120234504.0151024e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008244692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-014-0992-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajulu, M.

One approach to circumvent this roadblock is through microbial degradation of furaldehydes in biomass hydrolysates. Since these furaldehydes are the most common and abundant volatile organic compounds in plant litter and are released during biomass burning, we investigated endophytic and litter fungi of fire-prone forests for their ability to utilize furaldehydes. Of the 23 (11 endophytic and 12 litter) fungi we tested, 10 grew on furfural, 21 on HMF, and nine on both substrates as the sole carbon source. These fungi initially grew slower on furaldehydes than on sucrose, but their growth increased on subsequent sub-culturing on the same furaldehyde medium, suggesting an innate-adaptation competence. The ability of endophytic and litter fungi of fire-prone forests to metabolize furaldehydes is more common than previously anticipated and helps rationalize their unusual ecological fitness in specific niches. Our findings should also motivate a closer examination of all locales of biomass (including crop residue) burning for identifying furaldehyde-utilizing fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon 3acrop residues 3aendophytes 3afermentation 3aforests 3afungi 3afurfural 3ahydrolysates 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3alignocellulose 3aniches 3aplant litter 3asucrose 3avolatile organic compounds 3aIndia1 aLai, Lien B.1 aMurali, T.

It enables cells under certain stress conditions to survive by removing toxic cellular components, and may protect cells from apoptosis. In the present study, the signaling pathways involved in ARV S1133 regulated switch from autophagy to apoptosis were investigated. RESULTS: ARV S1133 infection caused autophagy in the early to middle infectious stages in Vero and DF1 cells, and apoptosis in the middle to late stages. Conversion of the autophagy marker LC3-I to LC3-II occurred earlier than cleavage of the apoptotic marker caspase-3. ARV S1133 also activated the Beclin-1 promoter in the early to middle stages of infection. Levels of RhoA-GTP and ROCK1 activity were elevated upon ARV S1133 infection, while inhibition of RhoA and ROCK1 reduced autophagy and subsequent apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of caspase-3 did not affect the level of autophagy. Beclin-1 knockdown and treatment with autophagy inhibitors, 3-MA and Bafilomycin A1, suppressed ARV S1133-induced autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously, suggesting the shift from autophagy to apoptosis. A co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the formation of a RhoA, ROCK1 and Beclin-1 complex coincided with the induction of autophagy. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that RhoA/ROCK1 signaling play critical roles in the transition of cell activity from autophagy to apoptosis in ARV S1133-infected cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aReoviridae 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abirds 3acaspase-3 3ahomeostasis 3aprocess control 3asignal transduction 3atoxicity1 aChang, Ching-Dong1 aChen, Yo-Chia1 aShih, Wen-Ling0 tBMC veterinary research.g2015 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.103-103dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0417-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011600168500001900284520123200303592002801535650002101563650001101584650001601595650001701611650001701628650001901645650001601664650001801680650001901698653004301717653004301760653003501803653002201838700001801860700001501878700001501893700005501908700002801963773011901991856008802110852000902198655001202207IND60704738920221118022308.0201025e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070473892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1409672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Lijun10aBacterial-induced mineralization (BIM) for soil solidification and heavy metal stabilization: A critical review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolidification and stabilization (S/S) treatment via cement is common and effective for improving soil strength and stabilizing heavy metals in contaminated soils, but has certain drawbacks, such as high fossil energy consumption, big carbon footprint, poor chemical compatibility, and ambiguous long-term stability. This paper innovatively proposes bacterial-induced mineralization (BIM) as an eco-friendly and efficient S/S method. In the BIM-S/S treatment, life activities of bacteria produce minerals to cement the soil particles and fix the heavy metals. This review firstly summarizes the basic theories of BIM technology followed by the evaluation on remediation effects and long-term stability in terms of soil solidification and heavy metal stabilization. Then the factors in BIM-S/S application are reviewed. Emphasis is put on the comparison of the BIM-S/S effect with that of cement-based-S/S technology. It is concluded that BIM-S/S technology is promising with outstanding performance in sustainability. On the other hand, current limitations and deficiencies with this technology are identified finally, hereby the directions for future research are pointed to make a major advancement in the BIM-S/S technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon footprint 3acement 3aenvironment 3afossil fuels 3aheavy metals 3amineralization 3aremediation 3asoil strength 3asolidification 0aBacterial induced mineralization (BIM) 0aSolidification and stabilization (S/S) 0aHeavy metals contaminated soil 0aGreen remediation1 aLi, Jiangshan1 aXue, Qiang1 aChen, Zhen1 aZhou, Yaoyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8995-68041 aPoon, C.

The influence of metal contaminations on the mechanical and thermal properties and how the blends could be stabilized in order to be recycled and give reliable properties over time were studied. The results show that blends of 25–50% XLPE in PP give good mechanical properties with retained or improved impact strength independent of the source of XLPE. Ageing at 105 °C for 6 months showed a more severe material degradation and loss of mechanical properties for blends that contained XLPE with end-of-life cable. Addition of metal deactivator proved to retain the mechanical properties for more than 8 months of ageing at 105 °C. Simulated recycling of 50% XLPE in PP stabilized with a metal deactivator, showed that mechanical properties were preserved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimpact strength 3amanufacturing 3amixing 3apolypropylenes 3arecycling 3athermal properties 3awastes1 aAndersson, Mattias1 aBoss, Annika1 aOxfall, Henrik0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2019 Feb., v. 27, no. 2 p.386-394dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870065x1566-25437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-018-1357-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03115naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014800166520144900314592002801763650002201791650001701813650001701830650001901847650001001866650002001876650002401896650002101920650001801941650001301959650001801972650001201990650001702002650001302019650001802032650001402050653001302064653001802077653001702095653002302112653000902135700005802144700001502202700001802217700001802235700001402253700001502267700001102282700001202293700001502305700001302320773010902333856008602442852000902528655001202537IND60778523620221119183900.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077852362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.1087322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Zhirui10aAggravation of nitrous oxide emissions driven by burrowing crab activities in intertidal marsh soils: Mechanisms and environmental implications  aCoastal wetlands are hotspots for nitrogen (N) cycling and a significant natural source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N₂O). Burrowing benthos are known to transform N in intertidal marsh soils, but their contribution to N₂O emissions and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, the effects of crab bioturbation on N₂O emissions in coastal marshes, where Chiromantes dehaani and Helice tridens tientsinensis were the dominant crab species, were investigated in field and indoor experiments. The N₂O emissions increased significantly in the presence of crabs, being positively correlated with the intensity of crab bioturbation but differing among crab species. Natural-abundance isotope analyses indicated that crab bioturbation greatly promoted the contribution of hydroxylamine oxidation to N₂O production; nevertheless, bacterial denitrification (including heterotrophic denitrification and nitrifier denitrification) remained the dominant pathway. Molecular analyses suggested that the increased N₂O emissions in crab-disturbed habitats might be driven by underlying changes to microbial communities, especially by the disproportionate stimulation of nitric oxide reductase-carrying microbes over nitrous oxide reductase-carrying microbes. This study highlights the importance of considering the burrowing activity, density, and species of benthos when evaluating the N cycle in coastal wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic organisms 3abiochemistry 3abioturbation 3aclimate change 3acrabs 3adenitrification 3aecological function 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydroxylamine 3aisotopes 3alittoral zone 3amarshes 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidation 0aNitrogen 0aNitrous oxide 0aBioturbation 0aIntertidal marshes 0aSoil1 aZheng, Yanling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8041-28431 aHou, Lijun1 aGao, Dengzhou1 aChen, Feiyang1 aZhou, Jie1 aLiu, Bolin1 aWu, Li1 aQi, Lin1 aYin, Guoyu1 aLiu, Min0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 171 p.108732-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.1087323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014700173500002200320520127900342592002801621650001201649650001801661650002201679650001501701650002501716653002701741653002901768653002201797653002301819653001301842653001101855700002001866700001801886700001901904700002201923700001901945700001801964700002301982700001902005700001902024700002302043773007002066856008502136852000902221655001202230IND60570620620221121020910.0170709s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057062062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurewicz, Michael10aBioInfra.Prot: A Comprehensive Proteomics Workflow Including Data Standardization, Protein Inference, Expression Analysis and Data Publication  aPre-press version  aThe analysis of high-throughput mass spectrometry-based proteomics data must address the specific challenges of this technology.

Mechanical tension, in addition, is closely associated with the germination and development of keloids. In this study, we investigated the influence of human keloid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (KD-MSCs) on cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, and expressions of integrin αvβ3 under tension.KD-MSCs and human normal skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells (NS-MSCs) were isolated and cultured in stem cell medium with a gradual increase in the serum concentration. Cell proliferation and collagen synthesis were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and hydroxyproline content analysis under tension respectively. We investigated the messenger RNA expressions of nine integrin subunits, including integrin units α2, α3, α5, αv, α8, α10, α11, β1, and β3, in KD-MSCs stimulated with tension. Identification of differentially expressed genes was performed by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry staining.We obtained high-purity KD-MSCs and NS-MSCs using the culture method of decreasing serum concentration gradient gradually. Furthermore, we found that tension enhances cell proliferation and collagen synthesis and promotes expressions of integrin αvβ3 in KD-MSCs. In addition, blocking experiments showed that increased integrin αvβ3 expression affects cell proliferation and collagen synthesis of KD-MSCs under tension.Our results suggest that integrin αvβ3 receptor may be sensitive molecules of mechanical tension and could contribute to the occurrence and development of keloids.

Eighty-three calves were cleanly collected at birth and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups as follows: (1) control group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer for first feeding, (2) group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer mixed with antirotavirus antibodies for first feeding, or (3) group that was fed colostrum replacer mixed with antirotavirus antibodies and a product approved by the US Department of Agriculture containing antibodies against Escherichia coli K99 and bovine coronavirus for first feeding. One of the 3 treatments was administered within 6 h of birth to each calf, followed by oral challenge with bovine rotavirus 3 h later. Calves were observed through 7 d of age and scored according to a standardized scale for clinical signs of diarrhea, change in appetite, depression, and dehydration. Twice daily, measurements of rectal temperature and collection of feces were performed. Fecal samples were assessed for infectious agents commonly associated with diarrhea, and bovine rotavirus shedding was quantified. There were 24 of 28 (86%) calves in the control group that received no antibodies that had signs of severe diarrhea, whereas 57% of the calves that received antirotavirus in milk replacer experienced severe diarrhea, and 7% of calves that received colostrum replacer mixed with antigen-specific bovine rotavirus antibodies showed signs of severe diarrhea. Calves that received colostrum replacer mixed with antigen-specific bovine rotavirus antibodies had a mean duration of 0.9 d of diarrhea compared with 2.7 d in the control group. Calves in the group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer with antirotavirus antibodies had a mean duration of diarrhea of 1.7 d. Rotavirus peak fecal shedding was 3.5 d in the group with milk replacer only, 5.5 d in the milk replacer with antibody group, and 6.5 d in calves in the colostrum replacer group. When bovine rotavirus antigen-specific antibody was fed in milk replacer to colostrum-deprived calves or in conjunction with colostrum replacer that also contained supplemental antibodies against Escherichia coli K99 and bovine coronavirus, those calves were observed to have reduced the onset, duration, and severity of diarrhea when compared with milk replacer placebo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBovine coronavirus 3aEscherichia coli 3aRotavirus 3aUSDA 3aantibodies 3aappetite 3abody temperature 3acalves 3acolostrum 3adairy science 3adiarrhea 3afeces 3amilk replacer 3aplacebos 3avaccines 0apassive immunity1 aDuhamel, G.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1246-25741 aZinckgraf, J.W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4490-504X1 aCrabb, J.H.1 aNydam, D.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7717-48590 tJournal of dairy science.g2021 Nov., v. 104, no. 11 p.11922-11930dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-198343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011700161300002000278520085700298592002801155650001501183650001401198650002201212650001001234650001901244650001501263650001601278700001901294700001701313700001901330700001501349773012401364856007401488852000901562655001201571IND60664619220221119145849.0190912e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066461922DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43396j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yongliang10aPreparation of porous BiVO₄ fibers by electrospinning and their photocatalytic performance under visible light  ap. 20606-20612.  aIn this study, porous BiVO₄ fibers were fabricated by a simple electrospinning technique followed by a controllable annealing of electrospun precursor fibers at different temperatures.

The results show that the final products have fibrous morphology and the phase structure of porous fibers belongs to monoclinic scheelite structure. The crystallinity and crystalline size increases, but the specific surface area decrease with increasing calcination temperature. These porous fibers all exhibit good optical absorption in visible light. As the sample calcined at 500 °C has larger specific surface area and better crystallinity, it exhibits the best photodegrading properties for rhodamine B solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aannealing 3acrystal structure 3alight 3aphotocatalysis 3arhodamines 3atemperature1 aChen, Jiangtao1 aYan, Xingbin1 aZheng, Zongmin1 aXue, Qunji0 tRSC advances.g2013 Oct. 16, v. 3, no. 43 p.20606-20612dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra43396j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245012700170300001600297520144800313592002801761650001301789650001401802650001701816650002101833650001201854700002001866700002201886773009101908856008401999852000902083655001202092IND4480374420221122060952.0141112e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448037442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2012.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell Sakai, R.10aEffect of single oroesophageal feeding of 3L versus 4L of colostrum on absorption of colostral IgG in Holstein bull calves  ap. 296-299.  aIngestion and absorption of colostral immunoglobulins is essential for survival of dairy calves. The hypothesis put forward in this study was that large colostral volumes (4L) reduce absorption of colostral immunoglobulin by reducing apparent efficiency of absorption of immunoglobulins compared to smaller colostral volumes (3L), when colostrum is fed once by oroesophageal tubing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of colostral volume on apparent efficiency of absorption (AEA) of colostral immunoglobulin G (IgG) when calves are fed 3L compared to 4L of colostrum. Twenty-eight, age-matched Holstein bull calves aged between 2 and 8h were randomly assigned to receive 3L or 4L of colostrum with similar colostral IgG concentration, once, by oroesophageal tubing. Serum IgG concentration at 48h of age and AEA of IgG were compared between the two groups. The results of the study showed that there was no difference in the serum IgG concentrations at 48h of age or AEA of IgG between the groups (P>0.05). The results of this study suggest that dairy producers can save colostrum by feeding 3L of colostrum when calves are fed once by oroesophageal tubing. There seems to be no added practical benefit in feeding 4L of colostrum compared to 3L when colostrum is fed once. Studies with larger sample sizes are required to compare mortalities up to weaning between groups of dairy calves fed 3L compared to 4L of colostrum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3acolostrum 3adairy calves 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aweaning1 aCoons, David M.1 aChigerwe, Munashe0 tLivestock science.g2012 Oct., v. 148, no. 3 p.296-299dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2012.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245012600180300001400306520113200320592002801452650001501480650002501495650001901520650002301539650001501562650001201577650001801589650001101607650001301618653002701631653001301658653003601671653002401707653002001731700002001751700002501771700001701796700001901813700001801832773011001850856008401960852000902044655001202053IND60601441520221123010807.0180706e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbarracin Zaidiza, David10aModeling of CO2 post-combustion capture using membrane contactors, comparison between one- and two-dimensional approaches  ap. 64-74.  aThis work presents a numerical comparison between a one-dimensional and a two-dimensional model for CO2 capture through solvent absorption with chemical reaction in a hollow fiber membrane contactor. The relevance of the two approaches is discussed. Industrially relevant operational conditions of post-combustion capture using MEA as reactive solvent were applied for both models. Variable gas and liquid mass transfer resistances, depending on the concentrations and the fluids velocity, were employed for the one-dimensional approach, while differential mass-balances considering convection, diffusion and reaction contributions were employed for the two-dimensional approach. The space-averaged specific molar CO2 absorbed flux estimated by both models was almost identical, with a maximum relative difference of 5.73% for membrane permeabilities (ε/τ) comprised between 0.001 and 0.2 and external fiber radiuses comprised between 0.2 and 0.9mm. Thus it turns out that the one-dimensional approach provides results similar to a two-dimensional approach in the investigated domain with significant lower calculation times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aartificial membranes 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical reactions 3aconvection 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amodels 3asolvents 0aCarbon dioxide capture 0aModeling 0aHollow fiber membrane contactor 0aReactive absorption 0aIntensification1 aBillaud, Joseph1 aBelaissaoui, Bouchra1 aRode, Sabine1 aRoizard, Denis1 aFavre, Éric,0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 455 p.64-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009300158300001800251520082000269592002801089650001901117650002501136650001101161650001201172650001701184650001801201650001701219650001501236700001901251773012101270856007401391852000901465655001201474IND60664619320221119145849.0190912e20131202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066461932DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43399d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Supriya10aControlling the electronic energy levels of ZnO quantum dots using mixed capping ligands  ap. 1640-1645.  aThe surface passivation of nanocrystals with mixed ligands is an important way to enhance the performance of quantum dot based optoelectronic devices through tuning the electronic energy levels. By attaching two or three different ligands on the surface of a single nanoparticle, one can induce electric fields large enough to significantly alter the electronic and optoelectronic properties of the nanocrystals. By using the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method we demonstrate the tuning of the electronic energy levels of ZnO quantum dots (QDs) through exchanging the surface capping ligands. The tuning of the energy levels is largely dependent on the surface linking groups as well as on the ratio of the different passivated molecules attached on to the surface of the QDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectronic equipment 3aenergy 3aligands 3ananocrystals 3ananoparticles 3aquantum dots 3azinc oxide1 aSarkar, Pranab0 tRSC advances.g2013 Dec. 02, v. 4, no. 4 p.1640-1645dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra43399d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012500157520193100282592002802213650001302241650001202254650001502266650001902281650001002300650001102310650002602321650001602347650002402363650001802387651001002405700002002415700002102435700001902456700001202475700001702487700001402504700001902518700001702537700001302554700001702567773013002584856007502714852000902789655001202798IND60794336820221122065953.0220922e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079433682DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141846122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xusheng 10aComparison of Lake Area Extraction Algorithms in Qinghai Tibet Plateau Leveraging Google Earth Engine and Landsat-9 Data  aMonitoring the lake waterbody area in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) is significant in dealing with global climate change. The latest released Landsat-9 data, which has higher radiation resolution and can be complemented with other Landsat data to improve imaging temporal resolution, have great potential for applications in lake area extraction. However, no study is published on identifying waterbodies and lakes in large-scale plateau scenes based on Landsat-9 data. Therefore, we relied on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and selected ten waterbody extraction algorithms to evaluate the quantitative evaluation of waterbody and lake area extraction results on the QTP and explore the usability of Landsat-9 images in the relationship between the extraction accuracy and the algorithm. The results show that the random forest (RF) algorithm performs best in all models. The overall accuracy of waterbody extraction is 95.84%, and the average lake waterbody area extraction error is 1.505%. Among the traditional threshold segmentation waterbody extraction algorithms, the overall accuracy of the NDWI waterbody extraction method is 89.89%, and the average error of lake waterbody area extraction is 3.501%, which is the highest performance model in this kind of algorithm. The linear regression coefficients of NDVI and reflectance of Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 data are close to 1, and R² is more significant than 0.91. At the same time, the overall accuracy difference of water extraction between the two data is not better than 1.1%. This study proves that Landsat-9 and Landsat-8 data have great consistency, which can be used for collaborative analysis to identify plateau waterbodies more efficiently. With the development of cloud computing technologies, such as Gee, more complex models, such as RF, can be selected to improve the extraction accuracy of the waterbody and lake area in large-scale research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3alakes 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3asurface water 3aChina1 aZhang, Donghui 1 aJiang, Chenchen 1 aZhao, Yingjun 1 aLi, Hu 1 aLu, Donghua 1 aQin, Kai 1 aChen, Donghua 1 aLiu, Yufeng 1 aSun, Yu 1 aLiu, Saisai 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141846123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02132naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015100157300002000308520095400328592002801282650002301310650001401333650001501347650001901362650001301381650001501394650001901409650001601428700002001444700001501464700001401479700001901493700001201512700001501524773012401539856007401663852000901737655001201746IND60664619420221119145938.0190912e20131028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066461942DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43400a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yazhou10aFast and green synthesis of flexible free-standing silver nanoparticles–graphene substrates and their surface-enhanced Raman scattering activity  ap. 23236-23241.  aA fast and green way to synthesize a free-standing and flexible silver nanoparticles–graphene (Ag NPs–GE) film with high surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensitivity has been developed. The silver nitrate–graphene oxide (Ag⁺–GO) films can be fabricated through vacuum filtration of the Ag⁺–GO suspension. And then, through the thermal annealing under H₂/Ar atmosphere at 400 °C, as-synthesized Ag⁺–GO films were thermal reduced to Ag NPs–GE films. The SERS activity of these substrates was greatly influenced by different laser wavelengths. And the maximum enhancement factor value for the Raman signals of R6G adsorbed on Ag NPs–GE substrate obtained at 780 nm (1.25 × 10⁷) was much larger than that acquired at 532 nm (3.7 × 10⁵). Furthermore, the high mechanical and flexibility of the GE sheets can provide protection of Ag NPs from the surrounding environment to yield a high degree of temporal stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aannealing 3afiltration 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen 3ananosilver 3asilver nitrate 3awavelengths1 aCheng, Xiaonong1 aYang, Juan1 aZhao, Nan1 aMa, Shuangbiao1 aLi, Dan1 aZhong, Tao0 tRSC advances.g2013 Oct. 28, v. 3, no. 45 p.23236-23241dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra43400a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245007700203300001600280520204100296592002802337650002202365650002502387650001302412650002002425650001202445650001302457650003302470650002602503650000902529650001702538653002302555653002102578653002202599653002002621700001902641700005502660700001302715700001902728700001702747773008702764856008502851852000902936655001202945IND60610969620221117171248.0190725e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061096962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Pujia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7138-961010aSoil quality assessment under different land uses in an alpine grassland  ap. 280-287.  aSoil quality index (SQI) is widely practiced form plot to national scales to assess the status and use potential of soils. However, how to objectively choose relevant indicators and score these indicators to generate comprehensive SQI is still a major challenge because of the complexity and site-specificity of soils. The objective of this study is to develop SQI using different indicators selecting methods (total data set, minimum data set and revised minimum data set) and scoring methods (linear and non-linear) to evaluate the influences of three land uses (CL, cropland; GR, grazing grassland; FE, grassland enclosure) on soil quality in an alpine grassland. Fourteen soil indicators representing soil physical, chemical and biological properties were measured at 0–20 cm depth. One-way analysis of variance and principal component analysis were used with the fourteen indicators to select the total data set, minimum data set and revised minimum data set. Eleven soil indicators exhibited treatment differences were identified as the total data set. However, only two (AN and MBC) and four (MWD, SOC, AN and MBC) soil indicators were retained in the minimum data set and revised minimum data set, respectively. The six SQIs developed in this study quantified the effects of different land uses on soil quality equally well regarding both sensitivity and accuracy. However, the differentiating ability of SQI calculated using the non-linear scoring-revised minimum data set method (SQI-NLRM) was better than other SQIs based on minimum data set and revised minimum data set because of the highest F value and greatest correlation coefficient with SQI based on total data set. Under GR and CL treatment, SQI-NLRM values were 15.15% and 69.70% lower than that under FE treatment. These results indicated that land use conversions can significantly change the soil quality in the alpine grassland, and the SQI-NLRM developed in this study provides a sensitive and effective approach for quantitative evaluation of soil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine grasslands 3aanalysis of variance 3acropland 3adata collection 3agrazing 3aland use 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asoil 3asoil quality 0aSoil quality index 0aMinimum data set 0aMethod comparison 0aNorthwest China1 aHan, Dongliang1 aLiu, Shiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2509-03191 aWen, Xin1 aHuang, Yingxin1 aJia, Hongtao0 tCatena.g2018 Dec., v. 171 p.280-287dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002600135245009500161300001600256520165100272592002801923653002701951653000901978653001701987653002902004653001702033653003302050653004302083653002202126773010302148856007102251852000902322655001202331IND60125358520221121104504.0151103e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012535852DNAL7 a10.1646/021132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltshuler, Douglas L.10aFlower Color, Hummingbird Pollination, and Habitat Irradiance in Four Neotropical Forests1  ap. 344-355.  aPollinator visual systems differ considerably among broad groupings such as bees, bats, and birds, and it has been proposed that factors shaping the diversity of flower color in tropical plants include differences in pollinator perceptual abilities. Within the pollinators of the Neotropics, one major difference between taxa is that hummingbirds perceive color well across a broad range of wavelengths from 300––660 nm whereas most bees perceive color well over a narrower range spanning 300––550 nm. Thus, hummingbirds can see red and other long-wavelength reflection much better than bees. Another factor that could potentially influence flower color in tropical forests is the difference in light availability among habitats such as gaps, canopy, and forest understory. I conducted a survey of floral color in four Neotropical forests using a portable spectroradiometer to provide an unbiased measure of color reflectance. The primary pollinator agents and light habitats of each plant species were classified using primary literature or accounts of direct observations by experts. Flower color was not influenced by differences in light availability between open and closed habitats but was influenced by pollinator visual systems. Specifically, insect flowers reflected across a broad range of the spectrum but hummingbird flowers reflected mostly long-wavelength light (typically median wavelength >585 nm). Thus, hummingbird-pollinated flowers are not tuned specifically to hummingbird color sensitivity but instead may decrease conspicuousness to bees and other insects that have poor visual sensitivity to long-wavelength color.  aPublisher supplied data 0aambient light habitats 0abees 0afloral color 0afour Neotropical forests 0ahummingbirds 0apollinator color sensitivity 0atropical plant––pollinator systems 0aultraviolet color0 tBiotropica.g2003 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.344-355dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F021133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008900165300001400254520106900268592002801337650001601365650001001381650000901391650001301400650001001413650002301423650001001446650001701456650002701473650001801500650000901518650001901527650001201546650001601558650001701574651001101591700002601602700002901628773009401657856008201751852000901833655001201842IND60691340620200616000000.0200429e20010601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069134062DNAL7 a10.2752/0892793017869995352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjerke, Tore10aAnimal-Related Activities and Appreciation of Animals Among Children and Adolescents  ap. 86-94.  aFive hundred and sixty-two children and adolescents, aged between nine and 15 years, from one urban and three rural areas in Southern Norway, completed a questionnaire in which they expressed their degree of preference for various animal species, participation in animal-related activities, and the presence of pets at home. The results showed that a majority of the respondents had an animal at home (71%), and participated in animal-related activities such as fishing (72%), feeding birds (74%), and reading about animals (66%). Participation in most animal-related activities decreased with increasing age. Pet owners liked farm and wild animals more than did respondents without pets. Positive associations were found between the liking of animal species and participation in animal-related activities. Gender differences were largest for horseback riding (girls most) and for fishing and hunting (boys most). Those who reported allergic reactions to animals, or had been injured by an animal, liked animals as much as, or more than, did the other respondents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abirds 3aboys 3achildren 3afarms 3agender differences 3agirls 3ahorse riding 3ahuman-animal relations 3apet ownership 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3areading 3arural areas 3awild animals 3aNorway1 aKaltenborn, Bjørn P.1 aØdegårdstuen, Toril S.0 tAnthrozoös.g2001 June 1, v. 14, no. 2 p.86-94dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/0892793017869995353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168506010400260506007600364520105000440592002801490506003701518650002001555650001801575650002701593650001001620650002301630653002901653653002101682653001101703653001101714653001901725653001701744700003101761700001901792700003201811700002101843700006801864773012501932856008202057852000902139655001202148IND60777810020221207055210.0220614e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077781002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1135562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez, Ramiro,10aEvaluation of the olfactory pattern of black olives stuffed with flavored hydrocolloids  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA sensory panel and an electronic nose (E-nose) were used to discriminate olives stuffed with flavored hydrocolloids submitted to different thermal treatments. The aroma perceived by the tasting panel before the sterilization was considered to be highly intense. However, the application of a single sterilization caused a 35–42% decrease in aroma intensity perceived by tasters. The aroma intensity also decreased when the number of sterilizations increased, but the tasting panel did not detect differences between them. The sterilization led to an increase in the ‘cooking effect’ that was less detected by panelists when the olives were flavored. The E-nose showed that the olives subjected to sterilization presented a different aromatic profile. Thus, the E-nose was able to discriminate the three treatments applied with greater precision than the tasting panel. E-nose technology offers a fast, inexpensive and non-destructive method for discriminating between olives stuffed with flavored hydrocolloids submitted to sterilization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectronic nose 3ahydrocolloids 3anondestructive methods 3aodors 3asensory evaluation 0aSterilization treatments 0aSensory analysis 0aE-nose 0aFlavor 0aCooking defect 0aTable olives1 aMartín-Tornero, Elísabet1 aLozano, Jesus,1 aArroyo Calderón, Patricia,1 aMelendez, Felix,1 aMartín-Vertedor, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8134-06180 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 June 15, v. 163 p.113556-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1135563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100006500191245009000256300001800346506007600364520106200440592002801502506003701530650001601567650001501583650002601598650001101624650001101635650001601646650001501662650001701677650001501694650001601709700005901725700002301784700001701807700001901824700002301843700005901866773012801925856008402053852000902137655001202146IND60598593120221207092256.0180702e20180209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059859312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b040732doi7 aPMC58630972pmcid7 a294250242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiedzwiecki, Megan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6647-141X10aHuman Suction Blister Fluid Composition Determined Using High-Resolution Metabolomics  ap. 3786-3792.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInterstitial fluid (ISF) surrounds the cells and tissues of the body. Since ISF has molecular components similar to plasma, as well as compounds produced locally in tissues, it may be a valuable source of biomarkers for diagnostics and monitoring. However, there has not been a comprehensive study to determine the metabolite composition of ISF and to compare it to plasma. In this study, the metabolome of suction blister fluid (SBF), which largely consists of ISF, collected from 10 human volunteers was analyzed using untargeted high-resolution metabolomics (HRM). A wide range of metabolites were detected in SBF, including amino acids, lipids, nucleotides, and compounds of exogenous origin. Various systemic and skin-derived metabolite biomarkers were elevated or found uniquely in SBF, and many other metabolites of clinical and physiological significance were well correlated between SBF and plasma. In sum, using untargeted HRM profiling, this study shows that SBF can be a valuable source of information about metabolites relevant to human health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3abiomarkers 3adiagnostic techniques 3ahumans 3alipids 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amonitoring 3anucleotides1 aSamant, Pradnya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8319-50711 aWalker, Douglas I.1 aTran, ViLinh1 aJones, Dean P.1 aPrausnitz, Mark R.1 aMiller, Gary W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8984-12840 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 09, v. 90, no. 6 p.3786-3792dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b040733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001700135245013000152300001600282520189600298592002802194653003302222653002102255653003502276653002402311653002302335653002502358653001902383773010302402856007102505852000902576655001202585IND60125358620221121104436.0151103e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012535862DNAL7 a10.1646/021202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaz, Horacio10aRoot/Shoot Allocation and Root Architecture in Seedlings: Variation among Forest Sites, Microhabitats, and Ecological Groups1  ap. 318-332.  aI analyzed patterns of variation in root mass allocation and root morphology among seedlings of woody species in relation to environmental factors in four Neotropical forests. Among forests, I explored the response of root traits to sites varying in water or nutrient availability. Within each forest, I explored the plastic response of species to different microhabitats: gaps and understory. Additionally, I explored evidence for life history correlation of root and shoot traits by comparing species differing in their successional group (light-demanding [[22 spp.]] or shade tolerant [[27 spp.]]) and germination type (species with photosynthetic cotyledons or species with reserve cotyledons). At each forest site, young seedlings from 10 to 20 species were excavated. A total of 55 species was collected in understory conditions and 31 of them were also collected in gaps. From each seedling, six morphological ratios were determined. Allocation to roots was higher in forest sites with the lowest soil resources. Roots were finer and longer in the most infertile site, while roots were deeper in the site with the longest dry season. Seedling traits did not differ between germination types. Shade tolerant species allocated more to roots and developed thicker roots than light-demanding species. Light-demanding species showed stronger plastic responses to habitat than shade tolerant species, and species with photosynthetic cotyledons showed lower plasticity than species with reserve cotyledons. Overall, these results suggest that among Neotropical species, root allocation and root morphology of seedlings reflect plant adjustments to water or nutrient availability at geographic and microhabitat scales. In addition, life history specialization to light environments is suggested by differences among groups of species in their allocation to roots and in their root morphology.  aPublisher supplied data 0abelow-aboveground morphology 0aroot:shoot ratio 0aseedling functional morphology 0aseedling morphology 0aspecific leaf area 0aspecific root length 0atropical trees0 tBiotropica.g2003 Sept., v. 35, no. 3 p.318-332dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F021203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02344naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245011500164300001600279520105400295592002801349650002201377650001101399650001401410650002001424650002401444650002201468650001901490650002601509650001301535650003401548650001301582650002101595650001401616700001601630700005401646700005501700773008601755856008401841852000901925655001201934IND60598984720221119092409.0180702e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059898472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.12.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Lili10aEffect of graphene oxide on the solution rheology and the film structure and properties of cellulose carbamate  ap. 552-562.  aHighly ordered, homogeneous and reinforced cellulose carbamate (CC)/graphene oxide (GO) composite films were prepared using an easy, aqueous and solution-mixing method. The dynamic rheology measurement showed that the addition of 2wt.% GO decreased the complex viscosity of CC solution and significantly prolonged the valid spinning time of CC solution. X-ray diffraction characterization revealed that GO promoted the transition of crystalline structure of CC from cellulose I to II, and the addition of 2wt.% GO improved the orientation and crystallinity of the CC molecules. Scanning electron microscope images indicated that the GO layers were aligned parallel to the surface of the composite films. The incorporation of GO also showed profound effects on the macroscopic properties of the CC film. Compared to the pure CC, the composite showed a 280% increase in Young’s modulus and 180% increase in tensile strength by the addition of 2wt.% of GO. Moreover, the carbon yields of all the composite films were higher than that of pure CC film.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3acellulose 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3acrystal structure 3agraphene oxide 3amodulus of elasticity 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aspinning 3atensile strength 3aviscosity1 aLu, Yonggen1 aWang, Yibo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4439-48951 aHu, Leiyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6993-00520 tCarbon.g2014 Apr., v. 69 p.552-562dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.12.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01332naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012400165500002200289520026400311592002800575650001100603650001100614650002800625650002800653650001800681650002600699650001300725650002500738650001100763700001700774700001800791773008200809856008200891852000900973655001200982IND60628117020221120061012.0190815e20181227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062811702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.12.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yupeng10aWITHDRAWN: A meta-analysis on associations of CDKN2B-AS variants with atherosclerotic cardio-cerebral vascular diseases  aPre-press version  aThis article has been withdrawn at the request of the editor.

Different risk factors, e.g., transplantation and chemotherapy, increase the risk of developing a HAdV hepatitis. We retrospectively analyzed three patients who showed the characteristics of a HAdV hepatitis observed in disseminated disease. In addition to PCR, diagnosis could be proven by pathology, CT scan, and markedly elevated transaminases. All patients had a hemato-oncologic underlying disease. Two had received a stem-cell transplant, and one was under chemotherapy including rituximab. Despite therapy with cidofovir, all patients died. As the incidence of HAdV hepatitis is low, diagnosis may be easily overlooked. No treatment approaches have yet been established. HAdV hepatitis should be considered as a differential diagnosis, especially when risk factors are present. To avoid dissemination, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMastadenovirus 3acomputed tomography 3adrug therapy 3ahepatitis 3atransaminases1 aSchneider, Jochen 1 aRasch, Sebastian 1 aHerhaus, Peter 1 aVerbeek, Mareike 1 aMogler, Carolin 1 aHeim, Albert 1 aFrösner, Gert 1 aHoffmann, Dieter 1 aSchmid, Roland M.1 aLahmer, Tobias 0 tViruses.g2022 July 01, v. 14, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140714593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009500169300001600264520151600280592002801796650001701824650001401841650002401855650001201879650002801891650001801919650001601937650001701953650002401970650001801994650001602012650000902028650002302037650001402060650002202074650001402096650002102110650002202131650000902153650002002162650001302182653001602195653002202211653002102233653002102254653001802275653001902293653000802312653000902320700002302329700002102352700003202373700006302405700006102468773009802529856008202627852000902709655001202718IND60601797120221117221025.0181002e20180815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060179712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2018.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalilzadeh, Mina10aProtective effects of magnesium sulfate against doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity in rats  ap. 436-441.  aClinical use of doxorubicin, an effective chemotherapeutic agent, has limited uses due to dose-dependent cardiac toxicity. It has been supposed that the production of free radicals and calcium ions overload can lead to cardiac toxicity. Magnesium is a cardioprotective drug which inhibits lipid peroxidation and reducing myocardial apoptosis. This study was aimed to explore the hypothesis that the cardiac toxicity induced by administration of doxorubicin is prevented or reduced by magnesium sulfate treatment and if so, whether this is associated with altered oxidative stress response in heart.Male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with doxorubicin and magnesium sulfate and normal saline four times per week for 2 consecutive weeks. Then electrocardiographic, inotropic and biochemical tests were performed.Co-administration of magnesium sulfate with doxorubicin significantly reversed alterations in the stimulation threshold and contractile force induced by doxorubicin. In addition, magnesium sulfate improved body weight loss and alleviated the mortality rate of animals induced by doxorubicin. Moreover, it was observed that lesions induced by doxorubicin decreased in animals treated with magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate significantly increased Glutathione (GSH) in doxorubicin treated animals.In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that magnesium sulfate attenuate the cardio toxic effects of doxorubicin by increasing the activities of the antioxidants enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abody weight changes 3acalcium 3acardioprotective agents 3adose response 3adoxorubicin 3adrug therapy 3aelectrocardiography 3afree radicals 3aglutathione 3aions 3alipid peroxidation 3amagnesium 3amagnesium sulfate 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3arats 3astress response 3atoxicity 0aDoxorubicin 0aMagnesium sulfate 0aPapillary muscle 0aOxidative stress 0aFree radicals 0aCardiotoxicity 0aECG 0aRats1 aAbdollahi, Alireza1 aAbdolahi, Farhad1 aAbdolghaffari, Amir Hossein1 aDehpour, Ahmad Reza1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8001-55651 aJazaeri, Farahnaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8392-97950 tLife sciences.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 207 p.436-441dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2018.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010200209300001800311520079900329592002801128650001501156650002001171650002101191650001201212650001101224650001301235700001701248700001901265773012801284856008401412852000901496655001201505IND60598593320221120194516.0180702e20180206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059859332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b040752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOja, Stephen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1504-126210aMethod for Low Nanomolar Concentration Analyte Sensing Using Electrochemical Enzymatic Biosensors  ap. 1536-1541.  aWe introduce a new electrochemical measurement method compatible with an enzymatic biosensor that is capable of analyte sensing down to the low nanomolar concentration regime. This method is termed accumulation mode sensing and utilizes an immobilized redox polymer mediator wired to an oxidoreductase enzyme to store charge during a premeasurement charge concentration step, followed by a measurement step in which this accumulated charge is quantified. We demonstrate this new method using a model glucose sensor and show how the sensitivity of a sensor can be modified simply by adjusting the time duration of the charge concentration step. We achieve a limit of detection of 4.7 ± 1.4 nM using accumulation mode sensing, which represents a 25-fold improvement over traditional amperometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aglucose 3amodels 3apolymers1 aFeldman, Ben1 aEshoo, Mark W.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 06, v. 90, no. 3 p.1536-1541dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b040753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245009200162520136200254592002801616650001801644650001101662650001901673650002301692650001101715650002201726650002901748650001301777650001301790650002501803650001201828773012101840856007401961852000902035655001202044IND60784220920221122080904.0220726e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078422092DNAL7 a10.3390/v140714602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmekita, Kunihiko 10aEffect of HTLV-1 Infection on the Clinical Course of Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis  aHuman T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The effects of HTLV-1 on health are not fully elucidated. Epidemiological studies have shown that the prevalence of HTLV-1 infection is high in patients with rheumatic diseases. The prevalence of comorbidities, such as Sjögren’s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is higher in patients with HAM/TSP than the in general population. Studies have shown the effects of HTLV-1-infection on the clinical course of RA. Major questions on the association between HTLV-1 infection and RA: (1) Is it possible that HTLV-1 infection causes RA? (2) Do patients with RA who are infected with HTLV-1 have different clinical features? (3) Are immunosuppressants associated with an increased prevalence of HAM/TSP or ATL in RA patients with HTLV-1 infection? Is ATL an immunosuppressive therapy-associated lymphoproliferative disorder? No large-scale studies have investigated the incidence of ATL in patients with RA. However, several studies have reported the development of ATL in patients with RA who have HTLV-1 infection. This review aimed to shed light on the association between HTLV-1 infection and RA and summarize the unmet medical needs of RA patients with HTLV-1 infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadults 3adisease course 3aetiological agents 3ahumans 3aimmunosuppression 3aimmunosuppressive agents 3aleukemia 3alymphoma 3arheumatoid arthritis 3aviruses0 tViruses.g2022 July 01, v. 14, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140714603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016200154300001800316520144500334592002801779650001101807650001401818650002301832650002001855650001501875650002801890650002101918650002001939650001501959650001601974650001301990650001802003650001402021650001402035650001402049650001302063650001702076700001502093700001202108700001702120700001402137700001502151700001802166700001802184773014002202856007402342852000902416655001202425IND60670724720221120160613.0191002e20140506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067072472DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00277f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Zhen10aBiotemplated synthesis of bark-structured TiC nanowires as Pt catalyst supports with enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability for methanol oxidation  ap. 8003-8008.  aDeveloping Pt eletrocatalysts with high activity and long-term durability remains a great challenge in commercializing fuel cells. Herein, we report a new kind of bark-structured TiC nanowire (NW) as an efficient support for Pt electrocatalysts, which exhibits a higher electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), much improved electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability toward a methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) when compared with commercial Pt/C (Vulcan XC-72) catalysts. The TiC NWs were synthesized via a simple biotemplating method using natural nanoporous cotton fibers as both the carbon source and the template. Their typical size is in the range of 50–150 nm in width and up to several micrometers in length. The Pt nanoparticles deposited onto the TiC NWs by a urea-assisted ethylene glycol reduction method are small (ca. 3 nm), narrowly distributed and well crystallized. The unique one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure of the TiC NWs provides fast transport and a short diffusion path for electroactive species, and a high utilization of catalysts. Moreover, the merits of TiC NWs, such as high electrical conductivity and excellent chemical/electrochemical stability also contribute to enhancing their electrocatalytic properties. The carbide support reported here will promote broader interest in the further development of Pt electrocatalysts in the fields of fuel cells and related electrocatalytic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystallization 3adurability 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aethylene glycol 3afuel cells 3alint cotton 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3ananopores 3ananowires 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3asurface area1 aHuang, Hui1 aDu, Jun1 aTao, Xinyong1 aXia, Yang1 aFeng, Tong1 aGan, Yongping1 aZhang, Wenkui0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 May 6, v. 2, no. 21 p.8003-8008dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00277f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245009000187300001600277520106400293592002801357650003001385650001501415650001801430650001601448650001101464650001301475650004101488650001201529650003001541650003001571650003201601650003201633650003201665650003301697650005901730650001101789650002701800650004301827650000901870650002301879650005001902650002701952650002301979650003402002650003202036650002402068650003702092700001802129700001702147700001702164700002002181700002102201700001902222700001802241700001802259700001802277773009802295856008402393990002302477852000902500655001202509IND60092089420221123020541.0141103e20111227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009208942DNAL7 a219748042pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jee Youn10aAdjuvant effect of a natural TLR4 ligand on dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy  ap. 226-234.  aThe clinical efficacy of dendritic cell (DC) vaccine in cancer patients has been unsatisfactory due, at least in part, to the deficiency of maturation and impaired migration of ex vivo generated DCs to the draining lymph nodes. To solve this problem, we used angelan, a natural TLR4 ligand, to enhance the maturation and migration of DCs. Angelan increased the expression of MHC-I/II, CD80, and CD86, DC maturation markers, through the NF-κB pathway. This compound also increased CCR7 expression in DCs through NF-κB and p38 pathway and enhanced their migration against CCL19, which is a key chemokine that guides DCs into lymph nodes. We also showed that angelan enhanced in vivo DC homing from tissues to draining lymph nodes. When treated to DCs in vitro and vivo, angelan increased antitumor activity of DCs in B16F10 syngeneic tumor model. Taken together, the present data suggest that a natural TLR4 ligand might be helpful for overcoming the disadvantages of DC-based cancer therapy, such as impaired maturation and poor migration in cancer patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3achemokines 3aimmunotherapy 3alymph nodes 3amodels 3apatients 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aB7-1 Antigenxmetabolism. 2aB7-2 Antigenxmetabolism. 2aCancer Vaccinesximmunology 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aChemokine CCL19xmetabolism 2aChemokine CXCL12xmetabolism 2aDendritic Cellsxdrug effectsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aImmunotherapyxmethods 2aLymph Nodesxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aNeoplasmsxtherapy 2aPolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aReceptors, CCR7xmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aToll-Like Receptor 4xmetabolism1 aKim, Yeon Jin1 aKim, Ji Sung1 aRyu, Hwa Sun1 aLee, Hong Kyung1 aKang, Jong-Soon,1 aKim, Hwan Mook1 aHong, Jin Tae1 aKim, Youngsoo1 aHan, Sang-Bae0 tCancer letters.g2011 Dec. 27, v. 313, no. 2 p.226-234dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.09.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01429naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002000135245012200155300001600277520054300293592002800836653001300864653001200877653001400889653001100903653002400914653001800938773010300956856007101059852000901130655001201139IND60125359020221121065513.0151103e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012535902DNAL7 a10.1646/021542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKitajima, Kaoru10aImpact of Cotyledon and Leaf Removal on Seedling Survival in Three Tree Species with Contrasting Cotyledon Functions1  ap. 429-434.  aThe relative importance of cotyledons and leaves for seedling survival was evaluated using a factorial field experiment on three neotropical tree species with contrasting cotyledon functional morphologies (photosynthetic, epigeal reserve vs. hypogeal reserve).

A fractional factorial design consisted of four internal temperatures (55.0, 57.5, 60.0 and 62.5°C), five concentrations of NaCl (0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5 and 6.0wt/wt.%) and SPP (0.0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3wt/wt.%), and five levels of pH (4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0). The 38 variable combinations were replicated twice to provide a total of 76 survivor curves, which were modelled by a modified three-parameter Weibull function as primary model. The polynomial secondary models, developed to estimate the time to achieve a 3-log and a 5-log reduction, enabled the estimation of critical pH, NaCl and SPP concentrations, which are values at which the thermo-tolerance of E. coli O157:H7 reaches it maximum. The addition up to a certain critical concentration of NaCl (~2.7–4.7%) or SPP (~0.16%) acts independently to increase the heat resistance of E. coli O157:H7. Beyond such critical concentrations, the thermo-resistance of E. coli O157:H7 will progressively diminish. A similar pattern was found for pH with a critical value between 6.0 and 6.7, depending upon temperature and NaCl concentration. A mixed-effects omnibus regression model further revealed that the acidity of the matrix and NaCl concentration had a greater impact on the inactivation kinetics of E. coli O157:H7 in minced beef than SPP, and both are responsible for the concavity/convexity of the curves. When pH, SPP or NaCl concentration is far above or below from its critical value, the temperatures needed to reduce E. coli O157:H7 up to a certain log level are much lower than those required when any other environmental condition is at its critical value. Meat processors can use the model to design lethality treatments in order to achieve specific log reductions of E. coli O157:H7 in ready-to-eat beef products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aWeibull statistics 3aacidity 3aground beef 3aheat tolerance 3aminced beef 3amodels 3apH 3aready-to-eat foods 3asodium chloride 3asodium pyrophosphate 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 0aE. coli 0aMinced beef 0aWeibull 0aPolynomial 0aPredictive model 0aThermal lethality1 aCadavez, Vasco1 aGonzales-Barron, Ursula1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8462-97751 aMukhopadhyay, Sudarsan0 tFood research international.g2015 Mar., v. 69 p.289-304dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2014.11.0503Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/610963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/306299Juneja.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008000202300001600282506007600298520175900374592002802133506003702161650002102198650001302219650001402232650001502246650001202261650002002273650002002293650004202313650001702355650002002372650001302392700001402405700002302419700002402442773017102466856008302637852000902720655001202729IND4481209920221207133607.0120502e20120110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448120992DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11149631092doi7 aPMC32586372pmcid7 a222039982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Soon Ju10aRate of meristem maturation determines inflorescence architecture in tomato  ap. 639-644.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFlower production and crop yields are highly influenced by the architectures of inflorescences. In the compound inflorescences of tomato and related nightshades (Solanaceae), new lateral inflorescence branches develop on the flanks of older branches that have terminated in flowers through a program of plant growth known as "sympodial." Variability in the number and organization of sympodial branches produces a remarkable array of inflorescence architectures, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying sympodial growth and branching diversity. One hypothesis is that the rate of termination modulates branching. By performing deep sequencing of transcriptomes, we have captured gene expression dynamics from individual shoot meristems in tomato as they gradually transition from a vegetative state to a terminal flower. Surprisingly, we find thousands of age-dependent expression changes, even when there is little change in meristem morphology. From these data, we reveal that meristem maturation is an extremely gradual process defined molecularly by a "meristem maturation clock." Using hundreds of stage-enriched marker genes that compose this clock, we show that extreme branching, conditioned by loss of expression of the COMPOUND INFLORESCENCE gene, is driven by delaying the maturation of both apical and lateral meristems. In contrast, we find that wild tomato species display a delayed maturation only in apical meristems, which leads to modest branching. Our systems genetics approach reveals that the program for inflorescence branching is initiated surprisingly early during meristem maturation and that evolutionary diversity in inflorescence architecture is modulated by heterochronic shifts in the acquisition of floral fate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapical meristems 3abranches 3abranching 3acrop yield 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agenetic markers 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aplant growth 3ashoot meristems 3atomatoes1 aJiang, Ke1 aSchatz, Michael C.1 aLippman, Zachary B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Jan. 10, v. 109, no. 2 p.639-644dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11149631093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002600135245008000161300001500241520099000256592002801246650001501274650001001289650001101299650002001310700001701330700002001347773015201367856007001519856009601589852000901685655001201694IND60779566920221122003300.0220610e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077956692DNAL7 a10.3791/626332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPadmashri, Ragunathan10aImplantation of a cranial window for repeated In Vivo imaging in awake mice  ap. e62633.  aTo fully understand the cellular physiology of neurons and glia in behaving animals, it is necessary to visualize their morphology and record their activity in vivo in behaving mice. This paper describes a method for the implantation of a chronic cranial window to allow for the longitudinal imaging of brain cells in awake, head-restrained mice. In combination with genetic strategies and viral injections, it is possible to label specific cells and regions of interest with structural or physiological markers. This protocol demonstrates how to combine viral injections to label neurons in the vicinity of GCaMP6-expressing astrocytes in the cortex for simultaneous imaging of both cells through a cranial window. Multiphoton imaging of the same cells can be performed for days, weeks, or months in awake, behaving animals. This approach provides researchers with a method for viewing cellular dynamics in real time and can be applied to answer a number of questions in neuroscience.  aPublisher supplied data 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3acortex 3aneurophysiology1 aTyner, Kevin1 aDunaevsky, Anna0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 June 22, , no. 172 p.e62633-e62633dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/626333Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/62633/implantation-cranial-window-for-repeated-vivo-imaging-awake  aDNAL 7aarticle04661naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005300144245009600197300002000293520264200313592002802955650001302983650002502996650001003021650001003031650001803041650002103059650001303080650001203093650001803105650001003123650002003133650001203153650002703165650001603192650001603208650001503224650000903239650001303248650001903261650002303280650001803303650002003321650002203341650002103363650002103384650001103405650001403416650002403430650001003454653002403464653001703488653002103505653001503526700005303541700005803594700005003652700005203702773015703754856007903911852000903990655001203999IND60754490620221120050145.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075449062DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2021-204512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, S.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9282-248X10aCooling ameliorates decreased milk protein metrics in heat-stressed lactating Holstein cows  ap. 12139-12152.  aCooling can alleviate the negative consequences of heat stress on multiple milk production metrics in dairy cows. However, it is still controversial whether cooling can increase milk protein content compared with heat-stressed cows. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the relief effect of cooling on the decrease in milk protein concentration during heat stress and elucidate the potential metabolic mechanisms. Thirty lactating multiparous Holstein cows (days in milk = 175 ± 25 d, milk yield = 27.5 ± 2.5 kg/d; mean ± SD) were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: heat stress (HS; n = 10), cooling (CL; n = 10), and cooling with pair-feeding (PFCL; n = 10). The barns for PFCL and CL cows were equipped with sprinklers and fans, whereas the barn for HS cows were not. The average temperature-humidity index during the experiment ranged from 74 to 83. The spraying was activated automatically 2 times per day (1130–1330 h and 1500–1600 h) with 3 min on and 6 min off during the first 2 wk, and 1.5 min on and 3 min off during the last 2 wk, whereas the fans operated 24 h/d. The experiment lasted for 4 wk in total. Milk, urine, feces, total mixed ration, blood, and rumen fluid samples were collected weekly. Compared with HS, feed efficiency (1.24 and 1.49), milk protein yield (0.82 and 0.94 kg/d), and milk fat yield (0.98 and 1.26 kg/d) were increased in PFCL, whereas the differences between CL and HS were not significant. Compared with HS cows, PFCL and CL cows had a lower respiratory rate (70.6, 59.1, and 60.3 breaths per minute, respectively), rectal temperature (38.95, 38.61, and 38.51°C), and shoulder skin temperature (33.95, 33.25, 33.40°C), and had greater milk protein content (3.41, 3.72, and 3.69%) and milk fat percent (4.08, 4.97, 4.65%). Both the blood activity of catalase (increased by 12.8 and 41.0%) and glutathione peroxidase (12.6 and 40.4%) of PFCL and CL cows were greater than the HS cows. Compared with HS, cooling increased the blood content of glucose, methionine, threonine, and cystathionine by 10.7% and 10.3%, 19.0% and 9.5%, 15.8% and 12.0%, and 9.5% and 23.8% in PFCL and CL, respectively. In conclusion, the results indicated that cooling partially rescued milk protein synthesis induced by heat stress, and the potential mechanism may have been due to increased antioxidant ability, blood glucose, and key AA. Consequently, in addition to modifying the environment, nutritional and physiological strategies designed to influence carbohydrate, AA, and oxidative homeostasis may be an opportunity to maintain or correct low milk protein content during the warm summer months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aantioxidant activity 3abarns 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3abody temperature 3acatalase 3acooling 3acystathionine 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3aglucose 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aheat stress 3ahomeostasis 3amethionine 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amilk fat yield 3amilk protein yield 3amilk proteins 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3arespiratory rate 3askin temperature 3asummer 3athreonine 3atotal mixed rations 3aurine 0asprinklers and fans 0amilk protein 0aoxidative stress 0aamino acid1 aGuo, Z.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0105-99661 aBaumgard, L.H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3077-59961 aMa, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9752-02181 aBu, D.P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1548-55090 tJournal of dairy science.g2021 Nov., v. 104, no. 11 p.12139-12152dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2021-204513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014700169300001800316520128300334592002801617650002201645650001501667650001901682650001301701650002001714650001201734650002201746650001601768650001701784650001501801650001201816650002201828650001301850700002301863700006001886700002101946700002201967700006301989773012802052856008402180852000902264655001202273IND60598593620221120162747.0180702e20180131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059859362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b040842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGill, Emily L.10aMass Spectrometric Methodologies for Investigating the Metabolic Signatures of Parkinson’s Disease: Current Progress and Future Perspectives  ap. 2979-2986.  aParkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra as well as degeneration of motor and nonmotor basal ganglia circuitries. Typically known for classical motor deficits (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia), early stages of the disease are associated with a large nonmotor component (depression, anxiety, apathy, etc.). Currently, there are no definitive biomarkers of PD, and the measurement of dopamine metabolites does not allow for detection of prodromal PD nor does it aid in long-term monitoring of disease progression. Given that PD is increasingly recognized as complex and heterogeneous, involving several neurotransmitters and proteins, it is of importance that we advance interdisciplinary studies to further our knowledge of the molecular and cellular pathways that are affected in PD. This approach will possibly yield useful biomarkers for early diagnosis and may assist in the development of disease-modifying therapies. Here, we discuss preanalytical factors associated with metabolomics studies, summarize current mass spectrometric methodologies used to evaluate the metabolic signature of PD, and provide future perspectives of the rapidly developing field of MS in the context of PD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3abiomarkers 3adisease course 3adopamine 3aearly diagnosis 3aganglia 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amonitoring 3aneurons 3aneurotransmitters 3aproteins1 aKoelmel, Jeremy P.1 aYost, Richard A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1293-56691 aOkun, Michael S.1 aVedam-Mai, Vinata1 aGarrett, Timothy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1623-009X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 31, v. 90, no. 5 p.2979-2986dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b040843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245008200189300001600271520075200287592002801039650002301067650001101090650002001101650002501121650001601146650001501162650001401177650001201191650002901203650007601232650006501308650002101373650003701394650008101431650001901512650003001531650001101561650000901572650000901581650001501590650004001605650005101645650002501696650005101721650003701772700001401809700001901823700001901842700001301861700002001874700001801894700001701912773009801929856008402027990002302111852000902134655001202143IND60092089720221123020615.0141103e20111227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009208972DNAL7 a220302542pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.05.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guan-Nan10aCombination of salinomycin and gemcitabine eliminates pancreatic cancer cells  ap. 137-144.  aPrevious research has documented that a subpopulation of pancreatic cancer cells, named cancer stem cells (CSCs), harbor stem cell-like properties. Here, we examined the efficacy of combined treatments of salinomycin and gemcitabine in human pancreatic cancer cells. Salinomycin inhibited the growth of CSCs, while gemcitabine suppressed the viability of non-CSCs. Consistently, in vivo studies showed that salinomycin combined with gemcitabine could eliminate the engraftment of human pancreatic cancer more effectively than the individual agents. These data indicated that administration of salinomycin, which targets CSCs, may constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for improving the efficacy of gemcitabine to eradicate pancreatic cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrowth retardation 3ahumans 3ain vivo studies 3apancreatic neoplasms 3asalinomycin 3astem cells 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, CDxmetabolism 2aAntimetabolites, Antineoplasticxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAntineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocolsxpharmacology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDeoxycytidinexadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGlycoproteinsxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Nude 2aNeoplastic Stem Cellsxdrug effects 2aPancreatic Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aPeptidesxmetabolism 2aPyransxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aXenograft Model Antitumor Assays1 aLiang, Yi1 aZhou, Ling-Jun1 aChen, Shu-Peng1 aChen, Ge1 aZhang, Tai-Ping1 aKang, Tiebang1 aZhao, Yu-Pei0 tCancer letters.g2011 Dec. 27, v. 313, no. 2 p.137-144dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.05.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008500171300001300256520112800269592002801397650001401425650001101439650001101450650001301461650001801474650001101492650001601503650001101519700002101530700002601551773008301577856008401660852000901744655001201753IND60598985320221119090810.0180702e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059898532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.12.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeah, Choon-Ming10aMechanisms of graphene growth by chemical vapour deposition on transition metals  ap. 1-21.  aGraphene has become the focus of research recently due to its properties. Various methods have been proposed for the synthesis of graphene, and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) appears to be the most promising route for synthesising large-area graphene. Use of Ru, Ir, Ni, or Co lead to a segregation growth procedure, in which carbon dissolves into the bulk metals at a high temperature and segregates to form graphene after reaching the carbon saturation, and the graphene expand with carpet growth mode. For Cu catalyst, the formation of graphene can be explained by the surface growth model, in which carbon aggregates at the surface of Cu to form graphene. Graphene are formed at different mechanism on different crystalline facets for Pt, Ni and Cu. Meanwhile Ru(0001) and Ir(111) only suitable for graphene formation for respective metals. This review discusses the fundamental mechanisms of the synthesis of graphene from various transition metals under various circumstances through a CVD process and concludes by addressing the challenges involved in large-scale graphene synthesis and the reuse of the catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3acopper 3agraphene 3agrowth models 3anickel 3atemperature 3avapors1 aChai, Siang-Piao1 aR̲ahmān, Eṃ.

Among the policies incentivising solar energy utilisation, Feed-in Tariff has been widely applied to stimulate the adoption of solar photovoltaic systems in the residential sector. This paper presents a payback-year-based Feed-in Tariff determination mechanism from the investment perspective, as suggested by recent research survey data. As an important indicator, the time required to recover the investment (i.e., payback year) in a residential PV project is then formulated using the proposed algorithm to determine Feed-in Tariff rates. The proposed mechanism is demonstrated in a case study in Victoria, Australia. Sensitivity analysis is used to identify the optimum Feed-in Tariff ranges for two popular types of rooftop PV systems, i.e., 3 kW and 5 kW, as examples. The results identify the desirable Feed-in Tariff range for individual energy investors as 20.29 A¢/kWh to 28.25 A¢/kWh, and this should be considered as a point of reference in determining the Feed-in Tariff rate in a manner that takes into account end-users’ expectations. The proposed mechanisms and methodology would be useful for policymakers in adjusting Feed-in Tariff incentive policies at a national or regional level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3asolar energy 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3atariffs 0aSolar energy policy 0aFeed-in tariff 0aSolar photovoltaic (PV) 0aPayback period 0aSensitivity analysis1 aZhang, Yitao1 aLi, Yan1 aHuang, Jiaxin1 aCostin, Glenn1 aZhang, Peng0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Mar., v. 150 p.112133-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1121333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02222naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012600157300001800283520109300301592002801394650001301422650002101435650001101456650000901467650001301476650001601489650001601505650001501521700002001536700001501556700002001571700001501591700001901606773014001625856007401765852000901839655001201848IND60670725120221120231716.0191002e20140506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067072512DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ta00289j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhenhua12aA work-function tunable polyelectrolyte complex (PEI:PSS) as a cathode interfacial layer for inverted organic solar cells  ap. 7788-7794.  aHigh-efficiency inverted polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a polyelectrolyte complex, polyethylenimine:poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEI:PSS), as the cathode interfacial layer for efficient electron extraction are demonstrated. By introducing the negatively charged PSS⁻ as the counter ions into PEI, the imine protonation could be tuned, leading to tunable work-function of the PEI:PSS coated ITO. The incorporation of PSS in PEI enhances the photocurrent and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices, due to an improved electron extraction at the PEI:PSS–active-layer interfaces. Furthermore, a TiOₓ–PEI:PSS combined interfacial layer further enhances the cell performance and eliminates the need for light-soaking treatment for TiOₓ, owing to the improved hole-blocking and surface-state passivation in the interfacial layer. The achieved high cell performance, better stability, low-cost materials, and low-temperature solution processes of the TiOₓ–PEI:PSS interfacial layers demonstrate a promising cathode configuration for realizing efficient and long lifetime PSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acathodes 3aelectric current 3aimines 3aions 3apolymers 3aprotonation 3asolar cells 3asulfonates1 aChang, Jingjing1 aZhang, Jie1 aJiang, Changyun1 aWu, Jishan1 aZhu, Chunxiang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2014 May 6, v. 2, no. 21 p.7788-7794dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ta00289j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245015400171520140600325592002801731650001601759650002701775650001801802650001701820650001201837650001101849650001401860650001601874650001501890651001101905653001901916653002701935653001701962653003201979653001502011653002702026700006002053700002202113700002402135700002402159700003002183700002302213700002202236700005402258700001902312773010802331856008402439852000902523655001202532IND60724199020221123034856.0211106e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072419902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1121382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbuckle, Evan J.10aInsights for Canadian electricity generation planning from an integrated assessment model: Should we be more cautious about hydropower cost overruns?  aHydropower accounts for approximately 60% of electricity generation in Canada, with growth expected in the coming decades as part of renewable energy transitions; however, frequent cost overruns threaten the viability of this growth. Using the integrated assessment model GCAM, we develop an endogenous representation of hydropower for Canada that accounts for market dynamics, thus permitting analysis of hydropower competition with other electricity generation technologies, both with and without cost overruns. Results show that modelling hydropower resources endogenously increases Canadian hydropower deployment relative to an assumption of fixed hydropower production, from 417 to 495 TWh annually by 2050. In scenarios that apply cost overruns at historical levels, hydropower loses market share to more easily scalable technologies like wind power. When including high cost overrun assumptions, the model determines that hydropower falls from about 73% to 65% of Canadian electricity generation by 2050, while wind power increases from about 8% to 11%. Countries may be better able to achieve electrification and renewable energy targets at lower cost by avoiding large-scale, overrun-prone hydropower and nuclear generation projects. Model results support that cost overruns are important considerations for policy decisions related to electricity sector development in Canada and elsewhere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy policy 3amarket share 3amarkets 3amodels 3aviability 3awater power 3awind power 3aCanada 0aEnergy systems 0aElectricity generation 0aCost overrun 0aIntegrated assessment model 0aHydropower 0aEnergy policy planning1 aBinsted, Matthew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5177-72531 aDavies, Evan G.R.1 aChiappori, Diego V.1 aBergero, Candelaria1 aSiddiqui, Muhammad-Shahid1 aRoney, Christopher1 aMcJeon, Haewon C.1 aZhou, Yuyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1765-67891 aMacaluso, Nick0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Mar., v. 150 p.112138-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1121383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005200144245008400196300002000280520188000300592002802180650001102208650001402219650001902233650001702252650001302269650001302282650001502295650001402310650001702324650001102341650001402352653002902366653001602395700006102411700005702472700001902529700001802548700005502566773015702621856007902778852000902857655001202866IND60754490820221120050229.0211029e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075449082DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2021-206022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6534-609414aThe effect of high-pressure jet processing on cocoa stability in chocolate milk  ap. 11432-11441.  aFat-free chocolate milk formulations containing skim milk, cocoa powder, and sugar were thermally treated and then processed using high-pressure jet (HPJ) technology from 125 to 500 MPa. The rheological properties and stability of HPJ-treated chocolate milks were compared with controls (no HPJ processing) prepared both with and without added κ-carrageenan. As expected, carrageenan-free chocolate milk exhibited immediate phase separation of the cocoa powder, whereas formulations containing κ-carrageenan were stable for 14 d. An increased stability was observed with increasing HPJ processing pressure, with a maximum observed when chocolate milk was processed at 500 MPa. The apparent viscosity at 50 s⁻¹ of HPJ-processed samples increased from ~3 mPa·s to ~9 mPa·s with increasing pressure, and shear-thinning behavior (n < 0.9) was observed for samples processed at HPJ pressures ≥250 MPa. We suggest that HPJ-induced structural changes in casein micelles and new casein-cocoa interactions increased cocoa stability in the chocolate milk. Because casein seemed to be the major component enhancing cocoa stability in HPJ-treated samples, a second study was conducted to determine the effect of additional micellar casein (1, 2, or 4%) and HPJ processing (0–500 MPa) on the stability of fat-free chocolate milk. Formulations with 4% micellar casein processed at 375 and 500 MPa showed no phase separation over a 14-d storage period at 4°C. The addition of micellar casein together with HPJ processing at 500 MPa resulted in a higher apparent viscosity (~17 mPa·s at 50s⁻¹) and more pronounced shear-thinning behavior (n ≤ 0.81) compared with that without added micellar casein.

The production of landslide maps is mainly based on manual visual interpretation methods of aerial and satellite images combined with field surveys. In recent times, advances in machine learning methods have made it possible to explore new semi-automated landslide detection methodologies using remotely detected images. In this sense, developing new artificial intelligence models based on Deep Learning (DL) opens up an excellent opportunity to automate this arduous process. Although the Andes mountain range is one of the most geomorphologically active areas on the planet, the few investigations that use DL mainly focus on mountain ranges in Europe and Asia. One of the main reasons is the low density of landslide data available in the Andean areas, making it difficult to experiment with DL models requiring large data volumes. In this work, we seek to narrow the existing gap in the availability of landslide inventories in the area of the Patagonian Andes. In addition, the feasibility and efficiency of DL techniques are studied to develop landslide detection models in the Andes from the generated datasets. To achieve this goal, we generated in a manual process a datasets of 10,000 landslides for northern Chilean Patagonia (42–45°S), being the largest freely accessible landslide datasets in this region. We implement a machine learning model, through DL, to detect landslides in optical images of the Sentinel-2 constellation using a model based on the DeepLabv3+ architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning network for semantic segmentation. Our results indicate that the algorithm detects landslides with an accuracy of 0.75 at the object level. For its part, the segmentation reaches a precision of 0.86, a recall of 0.74, and an F1-score of 0.79. The correlation of the segmentation measured through the Matthews correlation coefficient shows a value of 0.59, and the geometric similarity of the correctly detected landslides measured through the Jaccard score reaches 0.70. Although the model shows a good response in the testing area, errors are generated that can be explained by geometric and spectral relationships, which should be solved through new training approaches and data sets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3aautomatic detection 3adata collection 3ageometry 3ainventories 3alandslides 3amodels 3amountains 3asatellites 3aAndes region 3aAsia 3aChile 3aEurope1 aGarcia-Pedrero, Angel 1 aLizama, Elizabet 1 aLillo Saavedra, Mario,1 aGonzalo-Martín, Consuelo 1 aChen, Ningsheng 1 aSomos-Valenzuela, Marcelo 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141846223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245008200180300001600262520133400278592002801612650002501640650001501665650001201680650002501692650001101717653002001728653001101748653001301759653001001772653001801782700002201800700003501822773011201857856008401969852000902053655001202062IND60601442720221123024734.0180706e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJørgensen, Mads Koustrup10aOn the reversibility of cake buildup and compression in a membrane bioreactor  ap. 152-161.  aFouling in a membrane bioreactor was studied by describing the reversibility of fouling developing during short-term experiments. Data were fitted to a recently proposed model of the buildup and compression of fouling layers. Shear stepping experiments performed to characterize the efficiency of increased shear rates at removing cake layers indicated that cake layer removal follows the same kinetics as does cake layer development, so the fouling layers can be characterized as removable fouling. Furthermore, transmembrane pressure stepping indicates compression reversibility, so when the pressure on compressed cake layers is released, the cake swells back to a looser structure. Based on these observations, we discuss the validity of using the critical flux concept to study fouling irreversibility. Modeling data of short-term filtration tests shows that the presence of a critical flux for irreversible fouling depends on the relaxation time relative to the filtration time and pressure. Therefore, to observe a critical flux for irreversible fouling, the relaxation times applied in the stepping approach should be customized to be sufficient to remove all removable fouling. The model suggests that the critical flux occurs when the critical amount of deposit forming a stagnant cake on the membrane has been reached.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3afiltration 3afouling 3amembrane bioreactors 3amodels 0aCompressibility 0aSludge 0aModeling 0aShear 0aCritical flux1 aKeiding, Kristian1 aChristensen, Morten Lykkegaard0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 455 p.152-161dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002300135245008000158300001500238520179000253592002802043650002502071650001902096650002502115650002502140650001402165650002602179650001802205650001602223650002102239650000902260650001302269650002902282700002502311773015202336856007002488856009702558852000902655655001202664IND60779567220221122003256.0220610e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077956722DNAL7 a10.3791/634462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarsell, Alexander10aInoculation strategies to infect plant roots with soil-borne microorganisms  ap. e63446.  aThe rhizosphere harbors a highly complex microbial community in which plant roots are constantly challenged. Roots are in close contact with a wide variety of microorganisms, but studies on soil-borne interactions are still behind those performed on aboveground organs. Although some inoculation strategies for infecting model plants with model root pathogens are described in the literature, it remains difficult to get a comprehensive methodological overview. To address this problem, three different root inoculation systems are precisely described that can be applied to gain insights into the biology of root-microbe interactions. For illustration, Verticillium species (namely, V. longisporum and V. dahliae) were employed as root invading model pathogens. However, the methods can be easily adapted to other root colonizing microbes - both pathogenic and beneficial. By colonizing the plant xylem, vascular soil-borne fungi such as Verticillium spp. exhibit a unique lifestyle. After root invasion, they spread via the xylem vessels acropetally, reach the shoot, and elicit disease symptoms. Three representative plant species were chosen as model hosts: Arabidopsis thaliana, economically important oilseed rape (Brassica napus), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Step-by-step protocols are given. Representative results of pathogenicity assays, transcriptional analyses of marker genes, and independent confirmations by reporter constructs are shown. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of each inoculation system are thoroughly discussed. These proven protocols can assist in providing approaches for research questions on root-microbe interactions. Knowing how plants cope with microbes in the soil is crucial for developing new strategies to improve agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica napus 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aVerticillium dahliae 3alifestyle 3amicrobial communities 3apathogenicity 3arhizosphere 3aroot inoculation 3asoil 3atomatoes 3atranscription (genetics)1 aFröschel, Christian0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 Mar. 01, , no. 181 p.e63446-e63446dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/634463Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63446/inoculation-strategies-to-infect-plant-roots-with-soil-borne  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010400171300001400275520128900289592002801578650000801606650002501614650002501639650001201664650002401676650002601700650001501726650001701741650001601758650001401774653002401788653001801812653001201830653001601842653002601858700002301884700002301907700002501930773011001955856008402065852000902149655001202158IND60601442820221123024703.0180706e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhondi, Ebrahim10aInfluence of dissolved air on the effectiveness of cyclic backwashing in submerged membrane systems  ap. 77-84.  aBackwashing of submerged hollow fiber membranes has been observed to have an unstable impact on the recovery of the membrane permeability. Modeling and experimental results in this study show that the effectiveness of fixed backwash cycles can decrease over time and reach a point at which the backwash effectiveness suddenly decreases. Evidence from transmembrane pressure (TMP) monitoring suggests that the sudden decrease in backwash efficiency occurs when the pressure on the permeate side of the membrane at the end of a backwash cycle does not reach the atmospheric pressure maintained on the feed side. The release of dissolved air on the permeate side of the membrane due to the pressure drop across the membrane was recognized as a major reason for reducing backwash effectiveness. The mathematical model predicts that the minimum backwash duration required to reverse the flow through the membrane by increasing the permeate-side pressure up to atmospheric pressure depends on the pressure at the beginning of the backwash, backwash flow rate, amount of air on the permeate side, membrane surface area, water viscosity, temperature, and the membrane and fouling resistances. These findings have implications for the design and operation of submerged membranes with backwash.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aartificial membranes 3aatmospheric pressure 3afouling 3amathematical models 3amembrane permeability 3amonitoring 3asurface area 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aSubmerged membranes 0aHollow fibers 0aFouling 0aBackwashing 0aMathematical modeling1 aWicaksana, Filicia1 aKrantz, William B.1 aFane, Anthony Gordon0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 456 p.77-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013100175520144600306592002801752650001301780650001901793650003301812650002901845650001301874650001301887650001901900650001801919650001101937651002501948653003101973653001902004653001902023653003302042653002202075700002802097700002302125700003202148773011802180856008602298852000902384655001202393IND60724199320221123015144.0211114e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072419932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTemino-Boes, Regina10aFuture trends of dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in Northwestern Mediterranean coastal waters under climate change  aCoastal ecosystems are amongst the most vulnerable to climate change, due to their location at the land-sea interface. In coastal waters, the nitrogen cycle can be significantly altered by rising temperatures and other factors derived from climate change, affecting phytoplankton and higher trophic levels. This research analyzes the effect of meteorological variables on dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species in coastal inshore waters of a Northwestern Mediterranean region under climate change. We built simple mathematical schemes based on artificial neural networks (ANN), trained with field data. Then, we used regional climatic projections for the Spanish Mediterranean coast to provide inputs to the trained ANNs, and thus, allowing the estimation of future DIN trends throughout the 21st century. The results obtained indicate that nitrite and nitrate concentrations are expected to decrease mainly due to rising temperatures and decreasing continental inputs. Major changes are projected for the winter season, driven by a rise in minimum temperatures which decrease the nitrite and nitrate peaks observed at low temperatures. Ammonium concentrations are not expected to undergo a significant annual trend but may either increase or decrease during some months. These results entail a preliminary simplified approach to estimate the impact of meteorological changes on DIN concentrations in coastal waters under climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aclimate change 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3aenvironmental management 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen cycle 3aphytoplankton 3awinter 3aMediterranean region 0aArtificial neural networks 0aClimate change 0aCoastal waters 0aDissolved inorganic nitrogen 0aMediterranean sea1 aGarcía-Bartual, Rafael1 aRomero, Inmaculada1 aRomero-Lopez, Rabindranarth0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 282 p.111739-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1117393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01585naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100003000135245010800165300001600273520063800289592002800927653001100955653001700966653001400983653001300997653001501010653001701025700002401042700002301066773010201089856007101191852000901262655001201271IND60125359920221121065537.0151103e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012535992DNAL7 a10.1646/030282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Freitas, Cecíília A.10aMorphological Variation in Two Facultative Epiphytic Bromeliads Growing on the Floor of a Swamp Forest1  ap. 546-550.  aThe epiphytic tank bromeliads Nidularium procerum (a CAM plant) and N. innocentii (a C₃ plant) can be found as terrestrial plants in the understory of a Brazilian swamp forest.

SWCNT transparent conducting films (TCFs) were fabricated by rod coating using the SWCNT ink. A combination of two surfactants provided optimal rheological behaviour, which produced uniform films by preventing dewetting and rupture of SWCNTs during drying. The combination led to a dramatic increase of shear viscosities but no change of their wettability. The viscosity of SWCNT ink was controlled by the ratio of two surfactants. The thickness of SWCNT films could be easily varied by controlling both the concentration of SWCNT ink and the size of the wire-wound rod. The produced uniform SWCNT-TCFs treated by nitric acid have a relatively low sheet resistance of ∼80Ωsq⁻¹ at 80% transmittance. The performance has a wide range of applied interest for touch screen and flexible electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3adrying 3aelectronics 3anitric acid 3asurfactants 3atransmittance 3aviscosity 3awettability1 aXu, Xiao-Bing1 aLi, Hu1 aWang, Yan1 aDing, Er-Xiong1 aZhang, Ze-Chen1 aGeng, Hong-Zhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7897-85840 tCarbon.g2014 Apr., v. 70 p.103-110dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.12.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245015600209300001800365520164900383592002802032650002002060650004302080650001502123650001202138650001602150650002202166650001302188650001802201650002102219650001802240650003702258700002102295700002102316700002402337700002002361700002302381773012802404856008402532852000902616655001202625IND60598594020221121151745.0180702e20180206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059859402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b041042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlack, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2757-447X10aLiquid Chromatography Separation and Mass Spectrometry Detection of Silver-Lipoate Ag29(LA)12 Nanoclusters: Evidence of Isomerism in the Solution Phase  ap. 2010-2017.  aEvidence for the existence of condensed-phase isomers of silver-lipoate clusters, Ag₂₉(LA)₁₂, where LA = (R)-α lipoic acid, was obtained by reversed-phase ion-pair liquid chromatography with in-line UV–vis and electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS detection. All components of a raw mixture were separated according to surface chemistry and increasing size via reversed-phase gradient HPLC methods and identified by their corresponding m/z ratio by ESI in the negative ionization mode. Aqueous and methanol mobile-phase mixtures, each containing 400 mM hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)–15 mM triethylamine (TEA), were employed to facilitate the interaction between the clusters and stationary phase via formation of ion-pairs. TEA-HFIP (triethylammonium-hexafluoroisopropoxide) had been shown to provide superior chromatographic peak shape and mass spectral signal compared with alternative modifiers such as TEAA (triethylammonium-acetate) for analysis of oligonucleotide samples. Liquid chromatographic separation prior to mass spectrometry detection facilitated sample analysis by production of simplified mass spectra for each eluting cluster species and provided insight into the existence of at least two major solution-phase isomers of Ag₂₉(LA)₁₂. UV–vis detection in-line with ESI analysis provided independent confirmation of the existence of the isomers and their similar electronic structure as judged from their identical optical spectra in the 300–500 nm range. [Diastereomerism provides a possible interpretation for the near-equal abundance of the two forms, based on a structurally defined nonaqueous homologue.]  aPublisher supplied data 3adiastereomerism 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionization 3aisomers 3alipoic acid 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3atriethylamine 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aRobles, Geronimo1 aLopez, Priscilla1 aBach, Stephan B.

Owner attitudes towards neutering are associated with different sterilization rates of dogs. While owners' gender is associated with differences in attitudes, these differences are not necessarily associated with owner behavior with respect to neutering their animals. Men, more than women, want to have animals for long-term breeding. No evidence is found to support the belief that men are less likely to neuter their dogs than women, but younger owners are less likely than older owners to neuter their dogs. A comparison with a study from Australia suggests that Bahamians are more likely to project human traits on to their animals and so appear more reluctant to have their dogs neutered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3abreeding 3acastration 3adogs 3agender 3ahumans 3amen 3apet ownership 3awomen 3aAustralia 3aBahamas 0aage 0aattitudes 0apets 0aneutering 0asterilization 0aThe Bahamas1 aSamuels, Denise1 aMather, Jane0 tAnthrozoös.g2002 Sept. 1, v. 15, no. 3 p.206-226dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/0892793027869924873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245015000211300001200361506007600373520174400449592002802193506003702221650003102258650001102289650001302300650002502313650001302338650002602351650001402377650002002391650001002411650001102421650001702432650001702449650004302466650000802509650001802517650004302535650001302578650001302591650003002604650002602634650002702660700002802687700002302715700002402738700002102762700002202783773009202805856007902897852000902976655001202985IND50068167020221207055424.0140728e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006816702DNAL7 a10.1186/1475-2891-12-982doi7 aPMC37186292pmcid7 a238559732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabonté, Marie-Ève10aEicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid supplementation and inflammatory gene expression in the duodenum of obese patients with type 2 diabetes  ap. 678.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe extent to which long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA) from fish oil such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) exert their anti-inflammatory effects by down-regulating intestinal inflammation in humans is unknown. We investigated the impact of LCn-3PUFA supplementation on inflammatory gene expression in the duodenum of obese patients with type 2 diabetes. This placebo-controlled randomized crossover study included 12 men with type 2 diabetes. After a 4-week run-in period, patients received in a random sequence 5 g/d of fish oil (providing 3 g of EPA + DHA) and a placebo (corn and soybean oil) for 8 weeks each. The two treatment phases were separated by a 12-week washout period. Gene expression was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in duodenal biopsy samples obtained in the fasted state at the end of each treatment phase. Intestinal mRNA expression levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α were hardly detectable after either treatment (<100 copies/105 copies of the reference gene ATP5o). Intestinal mRNA expression of IL-18 and of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was higher (>5000 copies/105 copies ATP5o) but still relatively low. EPA + DHA supplementation had no impact on any of these levels (all P ≥ 0.73). These data suggest that duodenal cells gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is low in patients with type 2 diabetes and not affected by EPA + DHA supplementation. Further studies are warranted to determine if inflammatory gene expression in other tissues surrounding the intestine is modulated by EPA + DHA supplementation.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of environmental enrichment (EE) consisting of natural hemp ropes, sawdust, rubber balls, and a herbal compound (HC) of Valeriana officinalis and Passiflora incarnata on the behaviour and performance of growing pigs. Fifty-six pigs were used to assess four different treatments divided in two pens of seven animals per treatment (14 pigs/treatment). The treatments tested were: (a) pigs reared with EE, (b) pigs supplemented with HC, (c) pigs provided with both EE and HC, and (d) control group (CG, neither EE nor HC). Body weight and lesions were measured before starting the experiments (week 15) and at 18, 20, 22 and 24 weeks of age. Weekly instantaneous scan and continuous focal sampling were used to record behavioural patterns of activity, social interactions and abnormal behaviours. Three novel tests were carried out at 16, 19 and 23 weeks of age. Body weight at the end of the experiment was found to be significantly lower for the pigs reared in the control group compared to the other treatments (p=0.0009). Furthermore, pigs reared with EE presented less stereotypies (p=0.016) and redirected behaviour (0.0188), but more exploratory behaviour (p=0.008). However, pigs supplemented with HC presented less social interactions (p=0.048), a trend to present less negative social behaviour (p=0.09) and less skin lesions (P=0.0433) than pigs not supplemented. Finally, no remarkable differences were reported in any of the three novel tests. Thus, both EE and HC positively influenced some animal welfare indicators and performance of growing pigs in the present experiment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPassiflora incarnata 3aValeriana officinalis 3aabnormal behavior 3aanimal welfare 3abehavior change 3abody weight 3aenvironmental enrichment 3ahemp 3arearing 3aropes 3arubber 3asawdust 3askin lesions 3asocial behavior 3aswine 0aEnvironmental enrichment 0aHerbal compounds 0aStress 0aBehaviour 0aPigs1 aManteca, Xavier1 aDalmau, Antoni1 aFàbrega, Emma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1877-82540 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2017 Oct., v. 195 p.38-43dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2017.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009200165300001400257520111600271592002801387650001601415650001201431650001301443650002001456650001201476650000901488650000901497650002101506650002101527650001201548650001301560650001301573650002201586650001101608653001301619653002201632653002701654653002901681653002901710653002701739700001801766700002501784700002201809700002301831700002101854700001901875700001801894700002301912700002201935773011801957856008702075852000902162655001202171IND60536185020221118174113.0190410e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053618502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Hui10aTransgenic ferritin overproduction enhances thermochemical pretreatments in Arabidopsis  ap. 55-64.  aReducing the severity of thermochemical pretreatment by incorporating iron ions as co-catalysts has been shown to enhance the sugar yield from dilute acid pretreatments and enzymatic saccharification. However, current approach of soaking iron containing acid solutions onto milled biomass prior to pretreatment is time-consuming and subject to diffusion limitations. Here, we overexpressed soybean ferritin protein intracellularly in Arabidopsis plants (referred to as FerIN) under the control of the 35S promoter for the purpose of accumulating iron ions in Arabidopsis plants. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants accumulated iron during growth under both normal and iron-augmented watering conditions. Prussian blue staining showed punctuate staining of iron predominantly on the interior surfaces of cell lumen in FerIN plants. The harvested transgenic biomass showed enhanced pretreatability, in that it released 13–19% more glucose and xylose than empty vector control plants. The data indicated a positive correlation between iron concentration and sugar release during pretreatment of transgenic biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3abiomass 3aferritin 3agenetic vectors 3aglucose 3aions 3airon 3apromoter regions 3asaccharification 3asoaking 3asoybeans 3astaining 3atransgenic plants 3axylose 0aFerritin 0aIron accumulation 0aTransgenic Arabidopsis 0aBiomass saccharification 0aDilute acid pretreatment 0aPrussian blue staining1 aYang, Haibing1 aCiesielski, Peter N.1 aDonohoe, Bryon S.1 aMcCann, Maureen C.1 aMurphy, Angus S.1 aPeer, Wendy A.1 aDing, Shi-You1 aHimmel, Michael E.1 aTucker, Melvin P.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Jan., v. 72 p.55-64dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04582naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024002800134024002200162024001900184024001200203040001800215100001900233245013400252300001800386506007600404506017300480520235200653506003703005650001503042650001503057650001803072650001303090650003103103650001103134650002203145650001303167650001003180650001803190650004203208650001503250650001703265650001403282650003003296650001803326650001303344650002703357650001203384700001703396700001603413773010603429856011403535856007503649956012003724956011803844961000903962852000903971655001203980IND60647229120221214231451.0180626e20180412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064722912DNAL7 a10113/64722912hdl7 a3449162aris7 a10.1093/jas/sky0322doi7 aPMC61409632pmcid7 a296598722pmid8 ans14672  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDaneld, Tara10aEvaluating the microbiome of two sampling locations in the nasal cavity of cattle with bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC)1  ap. 1281-1287.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a multifactor disease, and disease incidence may be associated with an animal’s commensal bacterial populations (microbiome) in the upper nasal cavity. Identifying these commensal bacterial populations in the upper nasal cavity may help us to understand the impact of the microbiome on incidence of BRDC in cattle. Various sampling techniques have previously been utilized to evaluate the microbiome of different locations of the upper nasal cavity in cattle. Therefore, our objective was to determine whether bacterial populations of the nasal cavity vary based on these sampling locations. Two common sampling techniques were evaluated, including 6-inch nasal swabs and deep nasopharyngeal swabs. Nasal swabs from calves were collected when the animal was diagnosed with BRDC after weaning in the feedlot in addition to collection of samples from asymptomatic cohorts. Samples were pooled in groups based on year the animal was in the feedlot (2015 or 2016), when the animal was diagnosed with BRDC (1 to 5 weeks after weaning), type of sample (6-inch nasal swab or deep nasopharyngeal swab), and health status (diagnosis with BRDC or control). Variable regions 1 through 3 along the 16S rRNA gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced using next-generation sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) for identification of the bacterial taxa present. Overall, sampling site did not consistently influence diversity of the bacterial populations of the upper nasal cavity. However, the effect of disease incidence on the microbiome was depended on sampling time after weaning (P = 0.0462) for 2015, while the main effects of sampling time after weaning (P = 0.00992) and disease phenotype (P = 0.012) were significant for 2016. These data for 2016 demonstrate that in addition to bacterial profiles changing throughout weaning, calves diagnosed with BRDC have different bacterial profiles compared to their control cohorts. In addition, evaluation of the microbiome identified predominant bacteria genera in the upper nasal cavity included those previously reported to be associated with cattle diagnosed with BRDC including Mycoplasma sp., Psychrobacter sp., and Mannheimia sp. In summary, these results demonstrate that shorter, less invasive 6-inch nasal swabs produce similar results to deep nasopharyngeal swabs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMannheimia 3aMycoplasma 3aPsychrobacter 3abacteria 3abovine respiratory disease 3acalves 3adisease incidence 3afeedlots 3agenes 3ahealth status 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amicrobiome 3anasal cavity 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asampling 3aspecies identification 3aweaning1 aKuehn, Larry1 aKeele, John0 tJournal of animal science.g2018 Apr. 12, v. 96, no. 4 p.1281-1287wJournal:jnl45556x1525-31637nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64722913Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jas/sky0323Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/J.%20Anim.%20Sci.%202018.96%201281-1287_0.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/J.%20Anim.%20Sci.%202018.96%201281-1287.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245007000130300001400200506002800214520109700242592002801339506003701367650002001404650002101424650002101445650002701466650002101493650002701514650002701541650002601568650001301594650002901607650001401636650001901650650002801669650001101697650002201708650001101730651001101741653002801752653001801780653002401798700001801822700002501840700002201865700001901887700001501906773010801921852000902029655001202038IND60774457320221207100800.0170727e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077445732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatejić,  J.10aAntimicrobial potential of essential oil from Pastinaca sativa L.  ap. 31-35.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of the current investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of Pastinaca sativa L. (Apiaceae) essential oil. The aerial parts of plants were collected at Kopaonik Mountain (Serbia) and the essential oil has been isolated by hydrodistillation from this plant material. Essential oil was dominated by (Z)-β-ocimene (10.8%), hexyl butanoate (10.4%), (E)-β-farnesene (6.1%) and lavandulyl acetate (5.2%). The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was investigated using a micro-well dilution assay against the most common human gastrointestinal pathogenic microbial strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and yeast Candida albicans. The results showed that minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentrations of essential oil ranged from 0.72 μg/ml (for the most sensitive B. cereus) to above 92.5 mg/ml for S. enteritidis and L. monocytogenes. This finding suggests that P. sativa may be considered as a natural source of antimicrobial agents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus cereus 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPastinaca sativa 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aacetates 3aantimicrobial properties 3abutyrates 3aessential oils 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3ahydrodistillation 3ayeasts 3aSerbia 0aantimicrobial potential 0aessential oil 0aPastinaca sativa L.1 aDžamić,  A.1 aMihajlov-Krstev,  T.1 aRanđelović,  V.1 aKrivošej,  Z.1 aMarin, P.,0 tBiologica Nyssana.g2014 Sept., v. 5, no. 1 p.31-35dUniversity of NišwJournal:27819x2217-46057nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245008600163300001400249520175800263592002802021650000902049650001102058650001602069651001002085653002502095653002502120653002302145700001402168773011102182856008402293852000902377655001202386IND60605459520221121030817.0180721e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060545952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2014.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhen10aRecent trends in daily temperature extremes over northeastern China (1960–2011)  ap. 35-48.  aBased on long-term, high-quality, and homogenous daily maximum and minimum temperature of 70 meteorological stations spanning the period from 1960 to 2011, the spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme temperature events in northeastern China have been investigated. A total of 14 indices are used to assess changes in extreme temperature distributions. All the temperature-based indices show patterns consistent with a general warming trend. The regional occurrence of the increase in warm nights (TN90p: 2.17 days/decade) and warm days (TX90p: 0.97 days/decade), and decrease in cool nights (TN10p: −1.80 days/decade) and cool days (TXx: −0.86 days/decade) was detected in the past 52 years. Moreover, the trend magnitudes in cold/warm nights are larger than those in cold/warm days, which indicate that trends in minimum temperature extremes are more rapid than trends in maximum temperature extremes, consistent with a long-term decrease in DTR. The other indices, including TNn, TNx, SU25, TR20, FD0, ID0, GSL, and DTR, show statistically significant changes except for Maximum and minimum values of maximum daily temperatures (TXx and TXn) which have statistically insignificant slopes at individual stations and in regional mean trend. For the majority of stations, significant increases are detected for heat related extremes such as summer days and tropical nights (SU25 and TR20) as well as for maximum and minimum values of minimum daily temperatures (TNn and TNx); With the exception of diurnal temperature range (DTR) and maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx), the other indices strongly correlate with annual mean temperature. In addition, there are high correlations among warm indices and among cold ones, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat 3asummer 3atemperature 3aChina 0aTemperature extremes 0aSpatial distribution 0aNortheastern China1 aLi, Xilin0 tQuaternary international.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 380-381 p.35-48dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245007300165300001600238520054900254592002800803650001100831650001400842650001600856650001300872650001400885650001100899650001600910650001400926650001800940653001500958653001200973653001800985653001801003653002601021653000901047653000801056653000801064700002401072700001601096773012101112856008401233852000901317655001201326IND60541406320221119140541.0190318e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054140632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2013.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWigoda, Noa10aIs the leaf bundle sheath a “smart flux valve” for K+ nutrition?  ap. 715-722.  aEvidence has started to accumulate that the bundle sheath regulates the passage of water, minerals and metabolites between the mesophyll and the conducting vessels of xylem and phloem within the leaf veins which it envelops.

The first step in the study was to assemble from both published and unpublished sources an exhaustive database of ¹⁴C dates (n = 85), recording data regarding the environmental setting and spatial coordinates of each site, stratigraphic provenance of the dated samples, material used for dating, and ¹⁴C dating method. After the application of different filtering procedures based on outlier detection techniques, the database was subsequently reduced (n = 77). Using uncalibrated and calibrated dates, some spatial and temporal trends in data distribution were investigated in order to illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of the available database. It is concluded that three main features that characterize the ¹⁴C dataset from Northwest South America, namely the very high percentage of ¹⁴C measurements made on charcoal, the almost total disregard of bone as a target sample for dating, and the extremely low percentage of AMS dates, partially affect both its reliability and comparability. It is suggested that, in order to use ¹⁴C dates as data to make reliable inferences about the timing, pattern, process and tempo of early exploration and colonization of the study area, work at two different levels would be profitably carried out. In the short term, it would be advisable to develop an extensive and exhaustive program aimed at redating, with AMS and new sample selection criteria, the more significant archaeological assemblages attributable to the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. In the medium to long term, it would be necessary to implement new research projects specifically aimed at obtaining original information about early human settlement in different geographical areas of the Colombian territory.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acharcoal 3adata collection 3adatabases 3ahuman settlements 3aprovenance 3aradiocarbon dating 3aradionuclides 3aresearch projects 3aselection criteria 3aColombia 0aRadiocarbon data 0aPaleoenvironmental diversity 0aNorthwest South America 0aEarly human peopling1 aAceituno, Francisco Javier1 aBarrientos, Gustavo0 tQuaternary international.g2015 Mar. 30, v. 363 p.55-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012600168300001600294520170300310592002802013650001302041650002802054650002702082650001602109650002602125650001902151650002202170650002402192650001202216650002002228650001702248650000902265650002502274650001502299650002102314650001002335650002302345650002302368650002102391650002102412650001102433650002302444650001802467650001202485650003502497650001002532653003002542653003502572653001402607653001602621653001602637653001802653700001902671773010602690856008502796852000902881655001202890IND60563651220221122010438.0190214e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056365122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2017.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuber, Verena10aGlochidial development of the freshwater swan mussel (Anodonta cygnea, Linnaeus 1758) on native and invasive fish species  ap. 230-238.  aThe declining mussel Anodonta cygnea is an important keystone species in European freshwater systems. Information on the complex life cycle of A. cygnea regarding the attachment and metamorphosis of their larvae on suitable host fish species is lacking, yet important as a basis for conservation and fisheries management. Ten different fish species, including eight native and two non-native species from four different families, were simultaneously infested with the glochidia of A. cygnea in a standardized laboratory experiment. The results of this study confirmed the hypothesis that Anodonta cygnea can be considered a host generalist, as nine out of the ten tested fish species were suitable hosts, and different body parts were infested. Due to the observed differences in initial infestation rates and metamorphosis success, hosts were classed into “good hosts” (Perca fluviatilis, Leuciscus idus, Salmo trutta, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Ctenopharyngodon idella), “poor hosts” (Leucaspius delineatus, Gobio gobio, Rutilus rutilus, Pseudorasbora parva) and “not hosts” (Rhodeus amarus). The larval development differed strongly between the single host fish species with regard to success and duration of metamorphosis, as well as timing and synchronization in larval drop-off, suggesting evolutionary consequences of the use of different host fish species. The finding that two non-native fish species were identified as suitable hosts for the glochidia of A. cygnea illustrates that the generalizations that non-native species are a threat to native mussel communities and that co-evolutionary patterns between hosts and mussels determine host suitability do not always hold true.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnodonta 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aGobio gobio 3aLeucaspius delineatus 3aLeuciscus idus 3aPerca fluviatilis 3aPseudorasbora parva 3aRhodeus 3aRutilus rutilus 3aSalmo trutta 3afish 3afisheries management 3afreshwater 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3akeystone species 3alarvae 3alarval development 3ametamorphosis 3amussels 3anatural resources conservation 3aswans 0aHost-parasite interaction 0aFreshwater mussel conservation 0aUnionidae 0aAnodontinae 0aDegree-days 0aAlien species1 aGeist, Juergen0 tBiological conservation.g2017 May, v. 209 p.230-238dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245013300174300001600307520140800323592002801731650003801759650001801797650001701815650001101832650001601843650001501859650001601874650001701890650001401907650001101921653000801932653001201940653000901952653000801961653000901969653000701978653000901985653000701994653000702001653001902008653001602027653001102043653002502054653003502079700002302114700002702137700001902164700001902183700001902202700002302221700002002244773012302264856008402387852000902471655001202480IND60541406420221119140427.0190318e20140615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054140642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2014.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondo, S.q(Satoru),10aAbscisic acid metabolism and anthocyanin synthesis in grape skin are affected by light emitting diode (LED) irradiation at night  ap. 823-829.  aThe effects of blue and red light irradiation at night on abscisic acid (ABA) metabolism and anthocyanin synthesis were examined in grape berries. The expressions of VlMYBA1-2, VlMYBA2, UDP-glucose-flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (VvUFGT), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (VvNCED1), and ABA 8′-hydroxylase (VvCYP707A1) were also investigated. Endogenous ABA, its metabolite phaseic acid (PA), and the expressions of VvNCED1 and VvCYP707A1 were highest in red light-emitting diode (LED)-treated skin. In contrast, anthocyanin concentrations were highest in blue LED-treated skin, followed by red LED treatment. However, the expressions of VlMYBA1-2, VlMYBA2, and VvUFGT did not necessarily coincide with anthocyanin concentrations. The quality of coloring may depend on the amount of malvidin-based anthocyanin, which increased toward harvest in blue and red LED-treated skin, unlike in untreated controls. An increase in sugars was also observed in blue and red LED-treated skin.These results suggest that blue LED irradiation at night may be effective in increasing anthocyanin and sugar concentrations in grape berries. However, there is evidence that another factor may influence anthocyanin concentrations in grape berry skin significantly more than endogenous ABA: ABA concentrations were highest in red LED-treated skin, which had lower anthocyanin concentrations than blue LED-treated skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3a9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 3aabscisic acid 3aanthocyanins 3agrapes 3airradiation 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aphaseic acid 3ared light 3asugars 0aABA 0aCYP707A 0aDAFB 0aLED 0aNCED 0aPA 0aUFGT 0aVl 0aVv 0aABA metabolism 0aAnthocyanin 0aGrapes 0aLight-emitting diode 0aVitis vinifera×Vitis labrusca1 aTomiyama, Hiroyuki1 aRodyoung, Abhichartbut1 aOkawa, Katsuya1 aOhara, Hitoshi1 aSugaya, Sumiko1 aTerahara, Norihiko1 aHirai, Nobuhiro0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2014 June 15, v. 171, no. 10 p.823-829dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2014.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010800167500001900275520165500294592002801949650001001977650002301987650001602010650001302026650001402039650001502053650000902068650001602077650002002093650001402113650001402127650001302141650002102154650001202175650001402187650001202201650001902213653002902232653001602261653001102277653000802288700001502296700001702311700001602328700001602344700001202360700001802372700001502390700001602405700001902421700001202440700001202452700001902464700001302483773010202496856008502598852000902683655001202692IND60697145720221122225227.0200913e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069714572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xudong10aEffects of diet chitosan oligosaccharide on performance and immune response of sows and their offspring  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEffects of chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) supplementation to the diets of sow and/or their offspring on performance and immune response were investigated. Multiparous sows (3 to 5 parity; Landrace × Yorkshire) were fed either a control diet (sCON, n = 20) or a diet containing 30 mg kg⁻¹ COS (sCOS, n = 20) from day 86 of gestation until weaning at day 20 of lactation. Piglets from Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire sires were assigned at 7 days of age within sow treatments and fed either a control diet (pCON) or a diet containing 30 mg kg⁻¹ COS (pCOS) for 28 days. The four piglet treatments (n = 10 per treatment) were: sCON-pCON, sCON-pCOS, sCOS-pCON, and sCOS-pCOS. Sow dietary COS did not significantly change (P > 0.05) number of piglets born, piglet birth and weaning weight, piglet average daily gain (ADG) before and after weaning, piglet average daily feed intake or feed-to-gain ratio after weaning. However, piglet diet COS increased weight at weaning (P = 0.03) and on day 35 of age (P = 0.01), and ADG during lactation (P = 0.03). Sow diet COS increased immunoglobulin (Ig) M content in the colostrum (P = 0.03) and in umbilical cord blood (P = 0.02). Sow diet COS also increased the contents of IgG and interleukin (IL) 10 (P < 0.01), complement 3 (P = 0.03), and tended to increase IgA, IgM and lysozyme (LYZ) concentrations (P = 0.08) in serum of piglets at weaning. Piglet dietary COS did not significantly affect immune-related indexes. In conclusion, sow diets supplying COS improved piglet immune response, and piglet diets supplying COS improved piglet growth rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood serum 3achitosan 3acolostrum 3acomplement 3adiet 3afeed intake 3aimmune response 3alactation 3alandraces 3alysozyme 3aoligosaccharides 3apiglets 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aumbilical cord 0aChitosan oligosaccharide 0aPerformance 0aPiglet 0aSow1 aTian, Gang1 aChen, Daiwen1 aYang, Jiwen1 aZhang, Ling1 aLi, Bin1 aHuang, Linhui1 aZhang, Dan1 aZheng, Ping1 aMao, Xiangbing1 aYu, Jie1 aHe, Jun1 aHuang, Zhiqing1 aYu, Bing0 tLivestock science.g2020 Sept., v. 239 p.104114-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013600163300001800299520109400317592002801411650004401439650001501483650002201498650002101520650003601541650001401577650001601591650001901607650001101626650000701637650001301644650002201657650003701679700002501716773010601741856007501847852000901922655001201931IND60532722820221118000758.0160728e20120514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053272282DNAL7 a10.1021/bm300137d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeshpande, Megha
S.10aSequence Specific Association of Tryptic Peptides with Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes: Effect of Localization of Hydrophobic Residues  ap. 1410-1419.  aA model-free approach has been used to study the association of peptides onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in aqueous solution at ambient pH to understand the molecular basis of interaction of the peptides with MWCNT. The peptides obtained by tryptic digestion of cytochrome P450cam from P. putida were allowed to interact with MWCNT, and several peptides were found to bind to the nanotube leading to formation of stable homogeneous dispersion of the bionano conjugates of MWCNT. The peptides bound to the MWCNT were separated from the unbound peptides and sequence analyses by tandem MS/MS technique identified the strongly bound peptides as well as the unbound and the weakly bound peptides. The peptide–MWCNT conjugate was further characterized by TEM as well as Raman, FTIR, vis-NIR absorption, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. A model based on the hydrophobicity of residues in the peptides suggested that the amphiphilic peptides with localized hydrophobic residues at the center or at one end of the sequence form stable dispersions of the peptide–MWCNT conjugates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adigestion 3adispersions 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3apH 3apeptides 3asequence analysis 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMazumdar, Shyamalava0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 May 14, v. 13, no. 5 p.1410-1419dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm300137d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014100157300001800298520139200316592002801708650001301736650002101749650001801770650002101788650001201809650001601821650002501837650001401862650001401876650001301890650002401903650001501927650001801942650001401960650002301974650002101997700002402018700002102042700002302063773010602086856007502192852000902267655001202276IND60532722920221118000854.0160728e20120514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053272292DNAL7 a10.1021/bm300144y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Dhaval10aSynergistic Activity of αvβ3 Integrins and the Elastin Binding Protein Enhance Cell-Matrix Interactions on Bioactive Hydrogel Surfaces  ap. 1420-1428.  aEngineering materials suitable for vascular prostheses has been a significant challenge, especially in promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) development within synthetic materials. Herein we have utilized two different elastin mimetic peptide sequences, EM-19 and EM-23, to provide a template for ECM deposition when covalently incorporated into scaffold materials. Both peptides contain the hexapeptide sequence VGVAPG, which interacts with the cell surface receptor known as the elastin binding protein (EBP). Additionally, EM-23 contains an RGDS sequence intended for the peptide’s interaction with the αᵥβ₃ integrin. We first confirm that the presence of both peptides approximates the synergistic mechanism for elastic fiber assembly in vivo, a process that utilizes both the EBP and αᵥβ₃. Peptides were then grafted onto the surface of a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) hydrogel and their efficacy as templates for promoting cell adhesion, spreading, and elastin deposition was evaluated. Although both peptides were able to encourage smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion and elastin deposition over PEG-DA and PEG-RGDS controls, PEG-grafted EM-23 was proven to be the more promising motif for inclusion in synthetic substrates to be used in the engineering of vascular tissues, enhancing cell adhesion 60-fold and elastin content 2-fold compared with PEG-RGDS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abinding proteins 3acell adhesion 3achemical bonding 3aelastin 3aengineering 3aextracellular matrix 3ahydrogels 3aintegrins 3apeptides 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprostheses 3asmooth muscle 3asynergism 3asynthetic products 3avascular tissues1 aVandromme, Susan E.1 aReid, Michael E.1 aTaite, Lakeshia J.0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 May 14, v. 13, no. 5 p.1420-1428dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm300144y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245010500175300001800280520146000298592002801758650003001786650001101816650000901827650001501836650001201851650002201863700003401885700002901919700001701948700006401965773013602029856008002165852000902245655001202254IND60605568120180917000000.0180721e20180424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060556812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b123932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbelo-López, Hector D.10aCharge Transfer and π to π* Transitions in the Visible Spectra of Sulfheme Met Isomeric Structures  ap. 4947-4955.  aSince the 1863 discovery of a new green hemoglobin derivative called “sulfhemoglobin”, the nature of the characteristic 618 nm absorption band has been the subject of several hypotheses. The experimental spectra are a function of the observation time and interplay between two major sulfheme isomer concentrations (a three- and five-membered ring adduct), with the latter being the dominant isomer at longer times. Thus, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) was used to calculate the sulfheme excited states and visualize the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied MOs (LUMOs) of both isomers in order to interpret the transitions between them. These two isomers have distinguishable a₁ᵤ and a₂ᵤ HOMO energies. Formation of the three-membered ring SA isomeric structure decreases the energy of the HOMO a₁ᵤ and a₂ᵤ orbitals compared to the unmodified heme due to the electron-withdrawing, sulfur-containing, three-membered ring. Conversely, formation of the SC isomeric structure decreases the energy of the HOMO a₁ᵤ and a₂ᵤ orbitals due to the electron-withdrawing, sulfur-containing, five-membered ring. The calculations reveal that the absorption spectrum within the 700 nm region arises from a mixture of MOs but can be characterized as π to π* transitions, while the 600 nm region is characterized by π to dπ (dyz, dₓz) transitions having components of a deoxy-like derivative.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aheme 3ahemoglobin 3aisomers 3aspectral analysis1 aRodriguez-Mackenzie, Angel D.1 aRoman-Morales, Elddie M.1 aWymore, Troy1 aLópez-Garriga, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5506-34340 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 24, v. 122, no. 19 p.4947-4955dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b123933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245009500183300001600278520115500294592002801449650002701477650001301504650002401517650001301541650001701554650002201571650000901593650001301602650001101615650002101626650001201647650001201659650001801671651001101689653001501700653003101715653001801746653001601764653001701780700007101797700002901868700002901897700002301926700002001949700003701969773009102006856008902097852000902186655001202195IND60606388420221119024355.0180725e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060638842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorais, Cássio Resende10aAssessment of water quality and genotoxic impact by toxic metals in Geophagus brasiliensis  ap. 328-334.  aThis study used the pearl cichlid Geophagus brasiliensis as a bioindicator to survey the health of the aquatic environment on four sites (P1, P2, P3 and P4) of the Mumbuca stream located at Monte Carmelo/MG, Brazil. The selection of different sites was made with reference to the gradient of urban activity and via physicochemical and biological evaluation of water quality and genotoxicity. The water quality index was classified as ‘good’ for P1 and P4, regular in P2 and ‘poor’ for P3. The micronuclei (MN) frequency obtained from blood analysis was in agreement with the water quality, such that the higher values of MN were detected in sites evaluated as poor. Water degradation conditions worsen according to the flow of the stream over the sites P1, P2 and P3, but for site P4, located after the Monte Carmelo Sewage Treatment Plant, improvements in the micronuclei frequency are detected. Our results showed high levels of potentially toxic metals (chromium, lead, aluminum and nickel) in specific stream sites (P2 and P3). We suggest that the micronuclei induction in G. brasiliensis could be due to the presence of these compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeophagus brasiliensis 3aaluminum 3aaquatic environment 3achromium 3agenotoxicity 3ahematologic tests 3alead 3amutagens 3anickel 3asewage treatment 3astreams 3asurveys 3awater quality 3aBrazil 0aBody water 0aEnvironmental contaminants 0aWater quality 0aMicronuclei 0aToxic metals1 aCarvalho, Stephan Malfitano1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3199-38371 aAraujo, Galber Rodrigues1 aSouto, Henrique Nazareth1 aBonetti, Ana Maria1 aMorelli, Sandra1 aCampos Júnior, Edimar Olegário0 tChemosphere.g2016 June, v. 152 p.328-334dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245013800163500001400301520145200315592002801767650001301795650001801808650001901826650001501845650001901860650001501879650001001894650001101904650002601915650002101941650001901962650001501981650001101996651001502007700001902022700001902041700002102060700002002081700002002101700002002121773012902141856007402270852000902344655001202353IND60717492820221118155140.0201112e20201103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071749282DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122136082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarkentin, Kelsey 10aShrub Fractional Cover Estimation and Mapping of San Clemente Island Shrubland Based on Airborne Multispectral Imagery and Lidar Data  aNAL-light  aThe purpose of this study is to map shrub distributions and estimate shrub cover fractions based on the classification of high-spatial-resolution aerial orthoimagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data for portions of the highly disturbed coastal sage scrub landscapes of San Clemente Island, California. We utilized nine multi-temporal aerial orthoimage sets for the 2010 to 2018 period to map shrub cover. Pixel-based and object-based image analysis (OBIA) approaches to image classification of growth forms were tested. Shrub fractional cover was estimated for 10, 20 and 40 m grid sizes and assessed for accuracy. The most accurate estimates of shrub cover were generated with the OBIA method with both multispectral brightness values and canopy height estimates from a normalized digital surface model (nDSM). Fractional cover products derived from 2015 and 2017 orthoimagery with nDSM data incorporated yielded the highest accuracies. Major factors that influenced the accuracy of shrub maps and fractional cover estimates include the time of year and spatial resolution of the imagery, the type of classifier, feature inputs to the classifier, and the grid size used for fractional cover estimation. While tracking actual changes in shrub cover over time was not the purpose, this study illustrates the importance of consistent mapping approaches and high-quality inputs, including very-high-spatial-resolution imagery and an nDSM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3acanopy height 3aclassification 3aestimation 3aimage analysis 3alandscapes 3alidar 3amodels 3amultispectral imagery 3aorthophotography 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3aCalifornia1 aStow, Douglas 1 aUyeda, Kellie 1 aO’Leary, John 1 aLambert, Julie 1 aLoerch, Andrew 1 aCoulter, Lloyd 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Nov. 03, v. 12, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122136083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02928naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012100170300001600291520153500307592002801842650001501870650002101885650001501906650001701921650001701938650001401955650001801969650001301987650002402000650001802024650002402042650001302066650001502079653002402094653002302118653001902141653001802160653002502178653003002203700001502233700001802248700001602266773007102282856008402353852000902437655001202446IND60562714120221122042759.0170719e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056271412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Askary, W.A.10aHydrodynamics characteristics of hydrogen evolution process through electrolysis: Numerical and experimental studies  ap. 722-737.  aA reliable numerical procedure using the control volume formulation has been built up for predicting the hydrogen-generation process. The hydrogen production is due to the flow of an electrolyte between cathode and anode at different current densities. A bubbly two-phase flow process has been considered and a mathematical model based on Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluids has been adopted. The transport equations have been solved for both phases with allowance of interfacial transfer of mass and momentum. The conservation equations have been discretized using a finite volume method and solved by the SIMPLE algorithm. Measurements have been carried out along a tested cell gap at different current densities to visualize the hydrogen generation process. New insights into the model of hydrogen bubble-size variation in the computations are considered. Comparisons of numerical results based on the model with both experimental measurements and results available in the literature have been performed. The results indicate that the developed numerical model accurately predicts the hydrogen production process. The study shows also that the best production process is reached by decreasing the main flow velocity. Increasing the current density and reducing the gap distance between the cathode and the anode of the electrochemical cell helps improving the hydrogen production process. The bubble-diameter formulation of the dispersed hydrogen gas considerably influences the local and global characteristics of two-phase stream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolysis 3aelectrolytes 3aequations 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3amomentum 3aprediction 0aHydrogen production 0aWater electrolysis 0aTwo-phase flow 0aVoid fraction 0aNumerical simulation 0aExperimental measurements1 aSakr, I.M.1 aIbrahim, K.A.1 aBalabel, A.0 tEnergy.g2015 Oct., v. 90 p.722-737dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245020600167500001900373520163800392592002802030650002102058650001902079650002902098650001602127650001702143650001602160650001502176650001902191650002202210650001602232653001202248653001202260653001602272653001602288700001802304700002202322773010202344856008502446852000902531655001202540IND60697146020221122215437.0200913e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069714602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaq, Ijaz ul10aProtective effect of Nigella sativa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae on zootechnical characteristics, fecal Escherichia coli and hematopoietic potential in broiler infected with experimental Colibacillosis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNo study has compared the effect of Nigella sativa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae on performance, fecal E. coli and heamatopoitic potential of broiler under experimental condition of Colibacillosis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effect of N. sativa and S. cerevisiae on zootechnical characteristics, fecal microbial load and hematopoietic potential in broiler infected with Escherichia coli. A total of 400 birds (Ross 500) were randomly divided into five groups and five replicates as follow: T1, negative control; T2, positive control (infected with E. coli); T3, infected + 2% N. sativa seed powder; T4, infected + S. cerevisiae; T5, infected + antibiotic (Enrofloxacin 10 mg/kg). At the end of the experimental period, feed intake was lower (P<0.05) in T3 (2644.01±39.8g), T4 (2585.01±51.2g) and T5 (2663.85±32.0g) compared to all other treatments. Weight gain was higher (P>0.05) in T3 (1856.60±59.1g) and T1 (1857.08±48.4g) compared to other treatments. On the basis of overall period, T5 (1.49±0.04) showed higher (P<0.05) FCR as compared to group T1 (1.41±0.01) followed by T3 (1.38±0.02) and T4 (1.37±0.03) but no significant difference (P>0.05) with T2 (1.44±0.02). On day 35 of the trial, T2 (2.69 × 10⁸± 0.54 CFU) showed higher (P<0.05) fecal E. coli population as compared to other treatments. At the end of the trial, there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in red and white blood cells count and hemoglobin concentration among the groups.

(Hymenoptera: Vespidae), is a eusocial insect native to Eurasia that was accidentally introduced in the island of Sardinia (Italy) in 2010. This alien generalist predator could impact on native insect species through predation or competition by modifying interspecific relations in sensitive island ecosystems. As part of the Interreg project ALIEM, the present work regarded the first monitoring activity of the European hornet conducted in Sardinia by means of verified citizen science. The main goals of this study were to define the distribution area of the wasp in 2018 and evaluate the profile and the performance of citizen scientists. Our results showed that V.crabro is mainly located in north-eastern Sardinia and that the hotspot was probably the commercial port of Olbia. Furthermore, data provided by contributors were very accurate and none of the parameters considered to define the participants (age, gender, education level, job category) was a true predictor of a volunteer’s ability to recognise the wasp. In conclusion, this small-scale study suggests that citizen scientists could be a valuable aid to monitor already-established alien species and could be part of a surveillance network for early detection of other potentially invasive alien species not yet introduced in Sardinia, such as the yellow-legged hornet, Vespavelutina, which is already present in northern Italy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVespa crabro 3aVespa velutina 3acitizen science 3acitizen scientists 3aecosystems 3aeducational status 3agender 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amonitoring 3apredation 3asocial insects 3awasps 3aEurasia 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0aAlien species 0abiological invasion 0adata quality 0aEuropean hornet 0apublic information.1 aFloris, Ignazio1 aMannu, Roberto1 aCocco, Arturo1 aSatta, Alberto0 tNeoBiota.g2019 Oct. 02, v. 50 p.97-108dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.50.375873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013600170300001600306520127500322592002801597650001701625650001101642650002401653650001701677650001401694650001601708650001001724653002001734653001501754653002501769653002101794653002701815653002001842700001301862700001701875700001301892700001401905773007101919856008401990852000902074655001202083IND60562714320221122042811.0170719e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056271432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Jing-Chun10aThree dimensional experimental and numerical investigations into hydrate dissociation in sandy reservoir with dual horizontal wells  ap. 836-845.  aIn this study, both three dimensional experimental and numerical investigations of hydrate dissociation have been carried out by depressurization in conjunction with warm water stimulation using dual horizontal wells. Hydrate has been synthesized in the porous sediment in a CHS (Cubic Hydrate Simulator). The results of gas and water production, hydrate dissociation, and temperature distribution by numerical simulation are in good agreement with the experimental results. The results show that hydrate dissociation evolves by means of ablation with double-moving boundary. One dissociation interface moves from the injection well to the neighboring regions, and the other dissociation interface spreads from the boundary to the central reservoir. The assessment of the energy ratio shows that the depressurization in conjunction with warm water stimulation using dual horizontal wells is a promising method for hydrate dissociation. Sensitivity analyses show that raising the injection temperature causes a sharply decline of energy ratio, although it increases the gas production rate at a certain time. Additionally, reducing the intrinsic permeability of the reservoir can decrease the energy ratio and increase the time for the completion of hydrate dissociation.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3apermeability 3asediments 3atemperature 3awells 0aMethane hydrate 0aExperiment 0aNumerical simulation 0aDepressurization 0aWarm water stimulation 0aHorizontal well1 aWang, Yi1 aLi, Xiao-Sen1 aLi, Gang1 aZhang, Yu0 tEnergy.g2015 Oct., v. 90 p.836-845dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010700166500001900273520183900292592002802131650002102159650001002180650001502190650001402205650001702219650002002236653001202256653002602268653002302294653002102317653002602338700001602364700001702380700001602397773010102413856008502514852000902599655001202608IND60697146220221122215433.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069714622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaleh, M.S.10aCrossbreeding analyses and polymorphic associations of gallinacin genes with growth traits in chickens  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA simple crossbreeding experiment between Fayoumi (F) and Rhode Island Red (R) and their F₁ of ½R½F and ½F½R crosses was conducted. A total number of 480 chicks produced from four genetic groups was used to estimate direct additive genetic effects (Gᴵ), maternal effects (Gᴹ) and direct heterosis (Hᴵ) for growth traits by using generalized least squares procedure. The studied traits were body weights at hatch, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of age and daily gains during the intervals of 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8 and 8-10 weeks of age. Candidate gallinacin genes of GAL 2, GAL 3, GAL 4 and GAL 5 were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, associating the SNP with body weights and gains.Direct additive effects were mostly significantly (P≤0.01) in favour of R breed by 7.4 to 57.9 g for body weights and by 0.8 to 1.8 g for daily gains. The estimates of maternal effect were mostly significantly (P˂0.01) in favour of R breed and ranging from 0.8 to 25.1 g for body weights and 0.5 to 2.3 g for daily gains. All the estimates for direct heterosis were positive and significant (P˂0.01) and ranged from 0.15 to 35.2 g for body weights and 0.3 to 1.5 g for daily gains.The GAL 2 gene was one homozygous genotype in the four genetic groups, while in GAL 3, GAL 4 and GAL 5 genes only one homozygous genotype in Fayoumi breed was observed. The genotypes of Gal 3 gene had significant associations with most body weights and gains (p<0.05) in R, ½R½F and ½F½R genetic groups. The genotypes of GAL 4 and GAL 5 genes were associated significantly with most body weights and daily gains during the intervals of 0-2 and 2-4 weeks of age in½R½F and ½F½R genetic groups. In practice, the molecular associations obtained for GAL 3, GAL 4 and GAL 5 genes could be used in marker assisted selection programs to improve growth traits in chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhode Island Red 3agenes 3agenotyping 3aheterosis 3ahomozygosity 3amaternal effect 0aPoultry 0aCrossbreeding effects 0aGrowth performance 0aGallinacin genes 0aPCR-RFLP associations1 aIraqi, M.M.1 aKhalil, M.H.1 aCamarda, A.0 tLivestock science.g2020 Oct., v. 240 p.104118-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1041183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245009100200300001800291506007600309520144600385592002801831506003701859650003501896650001501931650002501946650001801971650001401989650002002003650002102023650003202044650002102076650001902097650001302116650001602129650002302145650001702168650001202185700002102197700002102218773010602239856007502345852000902420655001202429IND60532723120221207115211.0160728e20120514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053272312DNAL7 a10.1021/bm300150q2doi7 aPMC34689412pmcid7 a224554412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanial, Maarten10aPolyvalent Side Chain Peptide–Synthetic Polymer Conjugates as HIV-1 Entry Inhibitors  ap. 1438-1447.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis report describes the synthesis and properties of a series of polyvalent side chain peptide–synthetic polymer conjugates designed to block the CD4 binding site on gp120 and inhibit HIV-1 entry into a host cell. The peptide sequences in the conjugates are based on the CDR H3 region of the neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibody IgG1 b12. Using a consecutive ester-amide/thiol-ene postpolymerization modification strategy, a library of polymer conjugates was prepared. Evaluation of the HIV-1 inhibitory properties revealed that midsized polymer conjugates displayed the highest antiviral activity, while shorter and longer conjugates proved to be less efficacious inhibitors. The lower molecular weight conjugates may not have sufficient length to span the distance between two neighboring gp120 containing spikes, while the higher molecular weight conjugates may be compromised due to a higher entropic penalty that would accompany their binding to the viral envelope. Although the IC₅₀ values for these polymer conjugates are higher than that of the parent IgG1 b12 antibody, the strategy presented here may represent an interesting antiviral approach due to the attractive properties of such polymer therapeutics (relatively inexpensive production and purification costs, high thermal and chemical stability in storage conditions, long half-life in biological tissues, low immunogenicity, and protection from proteolytic degradation).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aantibodies 3aantiviral properties 3abinding sites 3ahalf life 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amolecular weight 3aneutralization 3apolymers 3aproteolysis 3astorage conditions 3atherapeutics 3atissues1 aRoot, Michael

While simple regressions for estimating the BCF of chemical compounds from water solubility or the n-octanol/water partition coefficient have been proposed in the literature, these models do not always yield good correlations and more descriptive variables are required for better modeling of BCF data for a given series of organic pollutants, such as some herbicides. Thus, the logBCF values for a set of carbonyl herbicides comprising amide, urea, carbamate and thiocarbamate groups were quantitatively modeled using multivariate image analysis (MIA) descriptors, derived from colored image representations for chemical structures. The logBCF model was calibrated and vigorously validated (r² = 0.79, q² = 0.70 and rtest² = 0.81), providing a comprehensive three-parameter linear equation after variable selection (logBCF = 5.682 − 0.00233 × X9774 − 0.00070 × X813 − 0.00273 × X5144); the variables represent pixel coordinates in the multivariate image. Finally, chemical interpretation of the obtained models in terms of the structural characteristics responsible for the enhanced or reduced logBCF values was performed, providing key leads in the prospective development of more eco-friendly synthetic herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3abioaccumulation factor 3achemical structure 3acolor 3aequations 3aherbicides 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3apollutants 3aurea 3awater solubility 0aBioconcentration 0aCarbonyl herbicides 0aQSPR 0aImage analysis 0aBCF 0aMLR 0aLOOCV 0aMIA 0aRGB 0aRMSE 0aQSPR1 aBarigye, Stephen J.1 aDaré, Joyce K.1 aFreitas, Matheus P.0 tChemosphere.g2016 June, v. 152 p.190-195dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009500168500001900263520236600282592002802648650001902676650001002695650002902705650002702734650001902761650001402780650001702794650000702811650001602818650001202834650002002846650001602866653001502882653001302897653002302910700001902933700001702952700001702969700002102986773010203007856008503109852000903194655001203203IND60697146320221122215336.0200913e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069714632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1040942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSecci, Giulia10aUse of mirrors into free-range areas: effects on rabbit meat quality and storage stability  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNowadays, animal welfare is driving consumers’ purchase choice, hence the challenge to recover rabbit sector from many years of downturn is to find a valuable compromise between animal welfare, farmers’ needs, and meat quality. Among the efforts to improve rabbit welfare, mirrors have been proposed as cages or pens enrichment; however, it is unclear if they affect rabbit meat quality. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the use of mirrors into free-range areas on color, weight loss, pH, water holding capacity (WHC), fatty acid profile (FA), conjugated dienes (CD) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) of both fresh and stored rabbit meatballs. Specifically, rabbits were divided in three farming groups: in the open group (OG) the rabbits of three replicates could see and smell each other; in the closed group (CG), plastic sheets isolated each replicate; the replicates of the mirror group (MG) were confined as the CG but animals could mirror themselves thanks to two mirrors (120 × 40 cm each) placed inside the area. After 49 days, nine rabbits from each group were slaughtered, their carcass meat was minced to form 40 meatballs for each group destined to be analyzed (n=10) immediately (T0), and after 20 (T20), 40 (T40), and 80 (T80) days of frozen storage (-10°C). The meatballs physical traits were similar among the farming groups, while the pH value was lower in MG (6.02) than OG (6.07), and CG (6.07) meat (P < 0.05). The farming slightly affected the FA content, being the PUFAn-3 amount between 60 and 121 mg/100 g (P > 0.05). Concerning the oxidative status, both CG and MG groups had higher (P < 0.01) TBARS than the OG, while the CDs were unaffected. The duration of storage modified all the physical traits, for instance the weight loss increased (P < 0.001) and the WHC diminished (-5.86%) during the early 20 days. Only the OG group showed a specific ability to maintain its redness value till the T40. Even though the overall PUFAn-3 fraction did not vary, both C20:5n-3 and C22:5n-3 were halved (P < 0.01) and CD (P < 0.001) doubled during the early 20 days. In conclusion, the OG farming was the best method for improving meat quality; however, mirrors can minimize the negative effects of a confined housing on the quality items, hence representing a valuable environmental enrichment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3acolor 3aenvironmental enrichment 3afatty acid composition 3afrozen storage 3alivestock 3ameat quality 3apH 3arabbit meat 3arabbits 3astorage quality 3aweight loss 0aFree-range 0aMeatball 0aFatty acid profile1 aBovera, Fulvia1 aMusco, Nadia1 aHusein, Yara1 aParisi, Giuliana0 tLivestock science.g2020 Sept., v. 239 p.104094-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1040943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245014700169300001400316520174300330592002802073650002802101650002302129650001402152650002502166650001702191650001802208650001302226650002102239650001802260650001402278650002802292650001702320650004102337650001402378650001302392650003702405650001702442650003702459650001902496653000902515653000802524653000802532653000702540653000802547653001102555653000802566653000702574653002302581653002702604653004502631653002002676700002702696700002502723700002502748773010502773856008202878852000902960655001202969IND60697146420221122215426.0200705e20200925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069714642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nbt.2020.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTugarova, Anna V.10aSelenite reduction by the rhizobacterium Azospirillum brasilense, synthesis of extracellular selenium nanoparticles and their characterisation  ap. 17-24.  aMicrobial reduction of selenium oxyanions has attracted attention in recent years. In this study, an original and simple method for the synthesis of extracellular selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) of relatively uniform size has been developed using strains Sp7 and Sp245 of the ubiquitous plant-growth promoting rhizobacterium Azospirillum brasilense, both capable of selenite (SeO₃²⁻) reduction. In addition, a reliable purification protocol for the recovery of the Se NPs has been perfected, which could be applied with minor modifications to cultures of other microbial species. Importantly, it was found that, by changing the conditions of bacterial reduction of selenite, extracellularly localised Se NPs can be obtained using bacteria which would otherwise produce intracellular Se NPs. In particular, bacterial cultures grown up to the end of the logarithmic growth phase, washed free of culture medium and then incubated with selenite, were used to obtain extracellular Se NPs. Their sizes depended on the initial selenite concentration (∼25–80 nm in diameter at 50–10 mM selenite, respectively). The Se NPs obtained were characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering, as well as Raman and UV–vis spectroscopies. Their zeta potential was found to be negative (ca. minus 21–24 mV). Bacterial selenite reduction was also studied in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). In this case, TEM indicated the formation only of intracellular selenium crystallites. The data show that the formation of extracellular Se NPs requires normal bacterial metabolic activity, while CCCP evidently blocks the membrane export of Se⁰ nuclei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aRhizobium 3abiochemical pathways 3acrystallites 3aculture media 3acyanides 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles 3aoxyanions 3aphysiological transport 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aselenites 3aselenium 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atransporters 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azeta potential 0aCCCP 0aDLS 0aMSM 0aNP 0aPMF 0aSe NPs 0aTEM 0aUV 0aSelenite reduction 0aSelenium nanoparticles 0aCarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone 0aGreen chemistry1 aMamchenkova, Polina V.1 aKhanadeev, Vitaly A.1 aKamnev, Alexander A.0 tNew biotechnology.g2020 Sept. 25, v. 58 p.17-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4392691x1871-67847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nbt.2020.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245014400209300001300353520180200366592002802168650001902196650000902215650001502224650001302239650001502252650001102267651001102278653002402289653002602313653001202339653001502351653002002366700002002386700002402406700006202430700002902492700002202521773010602543856008502649852000902734655001202743IND60752567320221120133847.0220830e20220920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075256732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2021.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGórecki, Artur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0632-607410aNew climatic oscillations during MIS 11c in the record of the Skrzynka II site (Eastern Poland) based on palynological and isotope analysis  ap. 4-20.  aDeposits of MIS 11c (Masovian Interglacial) are common in eastern Poland and therefore the area is considered as a Masovian palaeolakeland. In the Skrzynka II succession, MIS 11c lacustrine and MIS 10 lacustrine deposits of the early Liviecian Glaciation were found below beds representing the Weichselian Glaciation and the Holocene (1.35 m). The Mazovian Interglacial succession of the core as well as the base of the Liviecian Glaciation in depth interval 2.10–6.10 m were sampled for the purpose of palynological and isotope analyses. The main goal of the study was to determine a detailed record of climatic oscillations during MIS 11c. The palynological record of the Skrzynka II core contains nearly the entire MIS 11c succession, with an exception of the earliest protocratic stage. Both the previously described oscillation known from other European localities are present in the Skrzynka II record. Moreover, another major regressive oscillation, which was previously misinterpreted in two other Polish localities, was described in the late mesocratic phase. Yet another oscillation can be distinguished within the telocratic phase; it can be correlated with the ‘birch oscillation’ known so far only from Nowiny Żukowskie in Poland. Enhanced sampling resolution enabled also the description of several minor, local-scale climatic events or disturbances. Results of the isotope analysis correspond well with pollen data in the lower part of the succession, confirming a warming trend in the early interglacial and the cold character of the first regressive oscillation event. Since the second stage of the mesocratic phase, an unknown environmental disturbance occurred and δ¹³C₍ₒᵣg₎ data are inconsistent with the pollen record until the end of the climatic optimum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3acold 3aglaciation 3aisotopes 3apalynology 3apollen 3aPoland 0aClimate oscillation 0aPalaeoclimatic record 0aMIS 11c 0aPalynology 0aCarbon isotopes1 aŻarski, Marcin1 aDrzewicki, Wojciech1 aPleśniak, Łukasz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0478-05961 aZalewska-Gałosz, Joanna1 aHrynowiecka, Anna0 tQuaternary international.g2022 Sept. 20, v. 632 p.4-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245020800154300001800362500001400380520157500394592002801969650002501997650002402022650001702046650001302063650002402076650001502100650001902115650001602134650001402150650002002164650002702184650002402211650002002235650001602255650002502271653001002296653002302306653000902329700001202338700001602350700001202366700001402378773011102392856007302503852000902576655001202585IND60726850320221118043953.0210209e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072685032DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez1782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Y.Q.12aA mixture of daidzein and Chinese herbs increases egg production and eggshell strength as well as blood plasma Ca, P, antioxidative enzymes, and luteinizing hormone levels in post-peak, brown laying hens  ap. 3298-3303.  aNAL-light  aDietary supplementation with the isoflavone, daidzein, has been shown to improve egg production in poultry. Additionally, providing Chinese herbs (CH) in the broiler diet has led to increased antioxidative enzyme activity. However, the combined effect of these dietary supplements on hen performance has not been examined. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if dietary supplementation with a mixture of daidzein and CH would alter laying performance, egg quality, and blood plasma constituents of post-peak laying hens. At 59 wk of age, Hyline brown hens (240) were randomly allocated to 2 dietary groups and fed for 16 wk. The control group received the basal diet, and a treatment group was fed the basal diet that contained 0.02% of a mixture of daidzein and CH. Egg production and weight were recorded daily and egg quality data were collected at 75 wk of age. Blood plasma antioxidant activity, hormone levels, mineral (Ca and P) content, and osteocalcin content were determined at the end of the study. The results showed that laying rate, egg mass, and shell strength were greater in the daidzein-CH mixture group than the controls (P < 0.05). The plasma glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and luteinizing hormone levels were also greater in the daidzein-CH mixture group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The results of this study reveal that supplementing diets with a daidzein-CH mixture can improve laying performance perhaps by increasing plasma antioxidant activity, luteinizing hormone levels, and mineral content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3ablood plasma 3adaidzein 3adietary supplements 3aegg masses 3aegg production 3aegg quality 3aegg shell 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aluteinizing hormone 3amineral content 3aosteocalcin 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aherbs 0alaying performance 0ahens1 aShao, D1 aSheng, Z.W.1 aWang, Q1 aShi, S.R.0 tPoultry science.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 98, no. 8 p.3298-3303dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez1783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158300001800268520105000286592002801336650001101364650002701375650003001402650001201432650002201444650001301466700001301479700001501492700001401507700001801521700001601539700002001555700001501575700001401590700001901604700001701623773014101640856007401781852000901855655001201864IND60628783420221119193519.0190131e20190129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062878342DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta11230d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMan, Zengming10aHigh-performance lithium–organic batteries by achieving 16 lithium storage in poly(imine-anthraquinone)  ap. 2368-2375.  aOrganic materials have attracted intensive research interest in lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to their advantages of structural diversity, low cost and sustainability in nature. Here we report a highly conjugated organic framework, poly(imine-anthraquinone) (PIAQ), as the anode material of LIBs. It was synthesized by a green and environmentally friendly in situ solvothermal condensation reaction. When applied in LIBs, the PIAQ exhibits an outstanding reversible specific capacity (1231 mA h g⁻¹ at 200 mA g⁻¹), excellent long-term cycle stability (486 mA h g⁻¹, 1000 cycles at 1 A g⁻¹), and good rate performance. As further revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the Li storage mechanism of PIAQ is a reversible process associated with a six-step insertion/deintercalation of 16 Li⁺ per molecule, which is well consistent with the experimental results. Both the structural stability and excellent performance of PIAQ make it one of the most promising organic electrode materials for next-generation LIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acondensation reactions 3adensity functional theory 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aquinones1 aLi, Peng1 aZhou, Dong1 aZang, Rui1 aWang, Shijian1 aLi, Pengxin1 aLiu, Shuaishuai1 aLi, Xuemei1 aWu, Yuhan1 aLiang, Xiaohui1 aWang, Guoxiu0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Jan. 29, v. 7, no. 5 p.2368-2375dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta11230d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03516naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245014000179300001400319520176500333536009602098592002802194650002602222650002702248650001402275650001602289650001202305650001902317650002002336650002402356650001502380650001002395650001002405650001202415650001102427650002302438650002202461650002102483650001502504650000902519650002002528651002102548651001502569653001402584653001302598653001602611653002502627700003302652700003202685700001802717700001902735773009402754856008102848852000902929655001202938IND60698725020221120085910.0200615e20191024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069872502DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.51.372502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolina-Montenegro, Marco A.10aIncreasing impacts by Antarctica’s most widespread invasive plant species as result of direct competition with native vascular plants  ap. 19-40.  aBiological invasions represent significant economic and conservation challenges, though it is widely acknowledged that their impacts are often poorly documented and difficult to predict. In the Antarctic, one non-native vascular plant species is widespread and studies have shown negative impacts on native flora. Using field “common garden” experiments, we evaluate the competitive impact of the increasingly widespread invasive grass Poaannua on the only two native vascular species of Antarctica, the forb Colobanthusquitensis and the grass Deschampsiaantarctica. We focus on interactions between these three plant species under current and a future, wetter, climate scenario, in terms of density of individuals. Our analysis demonstrates Poaannua has the potential to have negative impacts on the survival and growth of the native Antarctic vascular species. Under predicted future wetter conditions, C.quitensis communities will become more resistant to invasion, while those dominated by D.antarctica will become less resistant. Under a recently developed unified scheme for non-native species impacts, P.annua can be considered a species that can cause potentially moderate to major impacts in Antarctica. If current patterns of increased human pressure and regional climate change persist and mitigation action is not taken (i.e. reduction of propagule pressure and eradication or control measures), P.annua is likely to spread in Antarctica, especially in the Antarctic Peninsula region, with significant negative consequences for some of the most remote and pristine ecosystems worldwide. Tighter biosecurity across all operators in the region, improved surveillance for the species, and prompt, effective control actions will reduce these risks.  aFONDECYT 11140607 and PII 20150126 Project 4307 from the Australian Antarctic Division NERC  aPublisher supplied data 3aColobanthus quitensis 3aDeschampsia antarctica 3aPoa annua 3abiosecurity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acontrol methods 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aflora 3aforbs 3agrasses 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3amonitoring 3arisk 3avascular plants 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aInvasions 0aPoaannua 0aCompetition 0aAntarctic ecosystems1 aBergstrom, D.

The line-of-sight signal and its coherent surface reflection signal are not separate observables in geodetic GNSS-R. The temporally constructive and destructive oscillations in the recorded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations can be used to retrieve water-surface levels at intermediate spatial scales that are proportional to the height of the GNSS antenna above the water surface. In this contribution, SNR observations are used to retrieve water levels at the Vianden Pumped Storage Plant (VPSP) in Luxembourg, where the water-surface level abruptly changes up to 17 m every 4-8 h to generate a peak current when the energy demand increases. The GNSS-R water level retrievals are corrected for the vertical velocity and acceleration of the water surface. The vertical velocity and acceleration corrections are important corrections that mitigate systematic errors in the estimated water level, especially for VPSP with such large water-surface changes. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the 10-min multi-GNSS water level time series and water level gauge records is 7.0 cm for a one-year period, with a 0.999 correlation coefficient. Our results demonstrate that GNSS-R can be used as a new complementary approach to study hurricanes or storm surges that cause abnormal rises of water levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacceleration 3acorrelation 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3ageodesy 3aglobal positioning systems 3aheight 3ahurricanes 3aradar 3areflectometry 3aremote sensing 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3astorage 3atime series analysis 3avelocity 3awater 3aLuxembourg1 aFrancis, O.q(Olivier),0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Nov. 03, v. 12, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122136143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245016500172300001800337520144600355592002801801650001801829650002201847650002001869650001101889650001701900650001701917650001201934650001901946650003401965650002501999650002002024650000902044650001402053650001702067650001102084650001602095650002502111650001202136653001702148653002602165653002002191653003802211653001102249700002302260700002802283773011202311856008602423852000902509655001202518IND60543166220221118065516.0190410e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054316622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudryn, Grażyna10aChanges of free and nanoencapsulated hydroxycinnamic acids from green coffee added to different food products during processing and in vitro enzymatic digestion  ap. 1004-1014.  aAn aqueous extract was derived from green coffee beans. To increase the concentration of hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) the extract was purified by centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC). The purified extract was used to form inclusion complexes of HCAs with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). HCAs were used to enrich six food products: cookies, bread, caramel cottage, mushroom and meat stuffing and nutty filling. Each product was prepared in five options: control, supplemented with 1% of HCAs from GCE, supplemented with 5% of protein hydrolysate, supplemented with both 1% of HCAs from GCE and 5% of protein hydrolysate, and supplemented with 1% of HCAs in the form of an inclusion complex. The concentration of HCAs and total polyphenols in the obtained products was analyzed by the LC/MSn method and the products were then hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes: α-amylase, pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin and amyloglucosidase and again analyzed for HCAs and total polyphenol content. Bioaccessibility of HCAs and total polyphenols found as an unbound form in the supplemented foods was reduced by processing and further by enzymatic hydrolysis. Furthermore the addition of protein hydrolysate led to a significant decrease of HCAs and total polyphenol bioaccessibility. Inclusion of HCAs into β-cyclodextrin before supplementation into food led to the increase of their bioaccessibility both after food processing and further enzymatic hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3abioavailability 3abreads 3achymotrypsin 3acoffee beans 3acookies 3acoumaric acids 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afood processing 3ameat 3amushrooms 3ananocapsules 3apepsin 3apolyphenols 3aprotein hydrolysates 3atrypsin 0aGreen coffee 0aHydroxycinnamic acids 0aβ-Cyclodextrin 0aProtein–polyphenol interactions 0aLC-MSn1 aZaczyńska, Donata1 aRachwał-Rosiak, Danuta0 tFood research international.g2016 Nov., v. 89 p.1004-1014dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010300169300001400272520181600286592002802102650002002130650002302150650002102173650002202194650002802216650001602244653002702260653002002287653001802307653002202325653001802347653001102365700001802376700001702394700002002411700001902431773009402450856008102544852000902625655001202634IND60698725120221120075747.0200615e20191029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069872512DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.51.359402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrubbe, Diederik10aAdvancing impact assessments of non-native species: strategies for strengthening the evidence-base  ap. 41-64.  aThe numbers and impacts of non-native species (NNS) continue to grow. Multiple ranking protocols have been developed to identify and manage the most damaging species. However, existing protocols differ considerably in the type of impact they consider, the way evidence of impacts is included and scored, and in the way the precautionary principle is applied. These differences may lead to inconsistent impact assessments. Since these protocols are considered a main policy tool to promote mitigation efforts, such inconsistencies are undesirable, as they can affect our ability to reliably identify the most damaging NNS, and can erode public support for NNS management. Here we propose a broadly applicable framework for building a transparent NNS impact evidence base. First, we advise to separate the collection of evidence of impacts from the act of scoring the severity of these impacts. Second, we propose to map the collected evidence along a set of distinguishing criteria: where it is published, which methodological approach was used to obtain it, the relevance of the geographical area from which it originates, and the direction of the impact. This procedure produces a transparent and reproducible evidence base which can subsequently be used for different scoring protocols, and which should be made public. Finally, we argue that the precautionary principle should only be used at the risk management stage. Conditional upon the evidence presented in an impact assessment, decision-makers may use the precautionary principle for NNS management under scientific uncertainty regarding the likelihood and magnitude of NNS impacts. Our framework paves the way for an improved application of impact assessments protocols, reducing inconsistencies and ultimately enabling more effective NNS management.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aissues and policy 3aprecautionary principle 3auncertainty 0ainvasive alien species 0arisk assessment 0arisk analysis 0aimpact assessment 0aevidence base 0apolicy1 aWhite, Rachel1 aEdelaar, Pim1 aRahbek, Carsten1 aShwartz, Assaf0 tNeoBiota.g2019 Oct. 29, v. 51 p.41-64dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.51.359403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009900165300001400264520090700278592002801185653003501213653001801248653001601266653004001282653001501322653002001337700001301357773011601370856008601486852000901572655001201581IND60602576720221120222440.0180711e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060257672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, M.10aEffect of different working gases on the performance of a small thermoacoustic Stirling engine  ap. 41-51.  aThe performance of a small thermoacoustic Stirling heat engine (TASHE) was investigated with three kinds of working gases experimentally and numerically. The examined performances focused on the operating frequency, onset temperature, pressure amplitude and some temperature characteristics after onset. The working frequency with nitrogen, argon and helium as the working gas was 45 Hz, 42 Hz and 130 Hz, respectively. The engine worked with helium in a much wider range of mean pressure than with nitrogen and argon. There was an optimal mean pressure for the minimum onset temperature for each working media. Using nitrogen and argon as working gas rather than helium, another optimal mean pressure for the highest pressure ratio was obtained in the experiment. The loop dimension was indispensable in determining the frequency and the highest pressure ratio was observed in the resonator cavity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aThermoacoustic Stirling engine 0aWorking gases 0aSmall-scale 0aMoteur thermoacoustique de Stirling 0aGaz actifs 0aPetite échelle1 aJu, Y.L.0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2015 Mar., v. 51 p.41-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245010000150300001600250520199300266592002802259650001002287650001102297650002102308650002302329650001402352650001102366650001302377650001102390650002202401650001502423650001102438650002202449650001002471650001202481650001202493650001102505650002202516650001102538651001002549651001002559700002002569700001902589700001702608773008802625856007102713852000902784655001202793IND4475859320221122173643.0180525s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447585932DNAL7 a10.1071/WR120602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Min10aEffect of traffic noise on black-faced spoonbills in the Taipa–Coloane Wetland Reserve, Macao  ap. 603-610.  aContext Nearly 20% of black-faced spoonbills (Platalea minor), a globally endangered species, winter along the coasts of the Pearl River Estuary, China.

Then we investigated the relationship between traffic noise and diurnal of spoonbill behaviours by collecting traffic-noise data on surrounding roads and observing the activity of black-faced spoonbills in the area over two winters, from 2007 to 2009. Key results The maximum number of individuals present in a single month was 50 in the winter of 2007–08 (in February) and 52 in the winter of 2008–09 (in January). Continuous traffic noise was 46.5 and 45.4dB(A), respectively, at roosting sites in two ecological zones. On the basis of the prediction model, only 10.8 of 30.3ha were suitable for spoonbills, with noise levels lower than 47dB(A). Most of the time, the spoonbills were acclimated to the traffic and were not alarmed. However, heavy trucks with a high noise level of 81.8±2.3dB(A) sometimes disrupted spoonbill behaviour. Conclusions The traffic noise around the Taipa–Coloane Wetland Reserve did exist but did not substantially affect black-faced spoonbills. For the birds mainly roosting in a quieter area, the small area of suitable habitat may indirectly limit population growth. Implications The fences around Ecological Zone I were successful in minimising visual stimuli from human activities and passing cars. To maintain the suitability of the winter habitat in Macao, restrictions on traffic flow, especially on heavy truck volume, are necessary for spoonbill conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3acoasts 3aecological zones 3aendangered species 3aestuaries 3afences 3ahabitats 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3arivers 3aroad construction 3aroads 3atourism 3atraffic 3atrucks 3aurban development 3awinter 3aChina 3aMacau1 aCheong, Kuaitat1 aLeong, Kunfong1 aZou, Fasheng0 tWildlife research.g2012, v. 39, no. 7 p.603-610dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR120603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02012naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014500168300001400313520084700327592002801174653001201202653001401214653002401228653002401252653001201276653002101288653002801309653003101337700001701368700002001385700001601405700001801421773011601439856008601555852000901641655001201650IND60602576920221120233719.0180711e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060257692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTammaro, M.12aA propane water-to-water heat pump booster for sanitary hot water production: Seasonal performance analysis of a new solution optimizing COP  ap. 59-69.  aElectrical heat pumps for sanitary hot water production achieve a high performance with a good matching of water and refrigerant temperature profiles during the heat rejection stage, as it happens in CO2 systems. This work considers the thermodynamic possibility to adapt the condenser pressure of a propane heat pump to maximize the COP, while producing sanitary hot water up to 60 °C from a heat sink equal to 15 or 25 °C. The performance of the heat pump is calculated through specific models which, in combination with a TRNSYS model of the whole system, allowed to assess its seasonal performance for a hotel in Strasbourg, also varying the control logic and the size of the storage tank. Results obtained led to the conclusion that, for achieving a high seasonal performance, the control logic of the tank has the largest influence.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPropane 0aHeat pump 0aWaste heat recovery 0aEnergy optimization 0aPropane 0aPompe à chaleur 0aRecuperation de chaleur 0aOptimization énergétique1 aMontagud, C.1 aCorberán, J.M.1 aMauro, A.W.1 aMastrullo, R.0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2015 Mar., v. 51 p.59-69dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245019800163300001800361520100800379592002801387650002201415650002301437650001201460650002401472650001701496650002101513650001201534650001501546650001701561650002101578650001301599650001001612650001501622653001301637653001901650653001401669653001501683653001301698653001201711700001701723700001601740700001501756700001901771700001501790700001701805700005701822700001901879773014801898856008002046852000902126655001202135IND60604296020221118095124.0180716e20180606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060429602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b025022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Xiaori10aComparative Metabolomic and Proteomic Analyses Reveal the Regulation Mechanism Underlying MeJA-Induced Bioactive Compound Accumulation in Cutleaf Groundcherry (Physalis angulata L.) Hairy Roots  ap. 6336-6347.  aCutleaf groundcherry (Physalis angulata L.) is an annual plant with a number of medicinal ingredients. However, studies about the secondary metabolism of P. angulata are very limited. An integrated metabolome and proteome approach was used to reveal the variations in the metabolism associated with bioactive compounds under methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Application of MeJA to the hairy roots could significantly increase the accumulation of most active ingredients. A targeted approach confirmed the variations in physalins D and H between MeJA treatment and the controls. Increases in the levels of a number of terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and steroid biosynthesis related enzymes, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and 3β-hydroxysterioid dehydrogenase might provide a potential explanation for the MeJA-induced active ingredient synthesis. Our results may contribute to a deeper understanding of the regulation mechanism underlying the MeJA-induced active compound accumulation in P. angulata.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysalis angulata 3aactive ingredients 3aannuals 3abioactive compounds 3abiosynthesis 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amethyl jasmonate 3aproteome 3aroots 3aterpenoids 0aPhysalis 0aMeJA treatment 0aphysalins 0ametabolome 0aproteome 0asteroid1 aLiao, Xinyue1 aLuo, Xiujun1 aZhu, Yujia1 aFeng, Shangguo1 aYu, Chunna1 aLu, Jiangjie1 aShen, Chenjia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8575-05931 aWang, Huizhong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 June 06, v. 66, no. 25 p.6336-6347dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b025023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015700157300001800314520131700332592002801649650000801677650002201685650001601707650001401723650001401737650001301751650002601764650001501790650001601805650001701821650002001838650001501858650003701873700001601910700002001926700001801946700001701964700001501981773014101996856007402137852000902211655001202220IND60628783720221119193337.0190131e20190129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062878372DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta11322j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Seon-Mi14aThe 3D morphological stability of P3HT nanowire-based bulk heterojunction thin films against light irradiation quantitatively resolved by TEM tomography  ap. 2027-2033.  aAlthough polymer solar cells (PSCs) continue to improve, with advances in power conversion efficiencies of 15% and beyond, intrinsic device stability in air under sunlight remains a challenge for commercialization. As the key parameter determining PSC performance relies on a bicomponent nanostructured active layer morphology, we investigate the stability of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films composed of preassembled poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) nanowires (NWs) and [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC₇₁BM) under light irradiation. The three-dimensional (3D) morphological changes caused by light-derived chemical oxidation and degradation are visualized and interpreted using 3D transmission electron microscopy combined with photo-physical characterization. Quantitative analysis of the phase separation and percolation pathways for efficient charge transport is performed. Two solution-processed NW-based thin films prepared via crystallization-driven assembly of P3HT in the presence or absence of PC₇₁BM were compared with conventional P3HT/PC₇₁BM blend films in terms of morphological instability against light irradiation. The introduction of pre-assembled NWs with tight packing of P3HT in thin films with PC₇₁BM reduces the morphological degradation of BHJ thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acommercialization 3airradiation 3ananowires 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3aquantitative analysis 3aseparation 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3atomography 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aNam, Jinwoo1 aSong, Chang Eun1 aChung, Heesun1 aKim, BongSoo1 aLee, Eunji0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Jan. 29, v. 7, no. 5 p.2027-2033dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta11322j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245006300159300001800222520123700240592002801477650001401505650001401519650001301533650001901546650001101565650001601576650001801592650001301610650002101623650001701644650001801661650001201679650001101691650001701702650001801719700001901737700001901756773010601775856007501881852000901956655001201965IND60532723620221118000804.0160728e20120514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053272362DNAL7 a10.1021/bm300191k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeck, Stephanie10aDispersibility in Water of Dried Nanocrystalline Cellulose  ap. 1486-1494.  aDispersibility is important for nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) because recovering the unique suspension and particle properties is essential after the product has been dried for storage or transport. It is our goal to produce dried NCC that redisperses in water to yield colloidal suspensions without the use of additives or a large energy input. In contrast with the as-prepared acidic form of NCC (H-NCC), suspensions of neutral sodium-form NCC (Na-NCC) dried by evaporation, lyophilization, or spray-drying are readily dispersible in water. Suspension properties and NCC particle size determined by light scattering were used as indicators of dispersion quality. The neutral counterion content, drying technique, freezing action, drying and redispersion concentrations, and moisture content in the dried NCC were all found to influence dispersibility. When a minimum of 94% of the H⁺ counterion is exchanged for Na⁺, the neutral salt form is fully dispersible in water even when fully dried. Mild sonication is generally sufficient to recover measured particle sizes identical to those in the never-dried Na-NCC sample. A threshold moisture content of 4 wt % was found, above which dried H-NCC is fully dispersible in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3acellulose 3acolloids 3adispersibility 3aenergy 3aevaporation 3afreeze drying 3afreezing 3alight scattering 3ananocrystals 3aparticle size 3aprotons 3asodium 3aspray drying 3awater content1 aBouchard, Jean1 aBerry, Richard0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 May 14, v. 13, no. 5 p.1486-1494dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm300191k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245011600163500001400279520156500293592002801858650001701886650002201903650001401925650001901939650001601958650001601974650002001990650001402010650001502024650001902039650001302058650001302071650002502084650001602109650002902125700002102154700002102175700001802196700002102214773012902235856007402364852000902438655001202447IND60717493720221118162019.0201112e20201104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071749372DNAL7 a10.3390/rs122136172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrevisan, Rodrigo 10aHigh-Throughput Phenotyping of Soybean Maturity Using Time Series UAV Imagery and Convolutional Neural Networks  aNAL-light  aSoybean maturity is a trait of critical importance for the development of new soybean cultivars, nevertheless, its characterization based on visual ratings has many challenges. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) imagery-based high-throughput phenotyping methodologies have been proposed as an alternative to the traditional visual ratings of pod senescence. However, the lack of scalable and accurate methods to extract the desired information from the images remains a significant bottleneck in breeding programs. The objective of this study was to develop an image-based high-throughput phenotyping system for evaluating soybean maturity in breeding programs. Images were acquired twice a week, starting when the earlier lines began maturation until the latest ones were mature. Two complementary convolutional neural networks (CNN) were developed to predict the maturity date. The first using a single date and the second using the five best image dates identified by the first model. The proposed CNN architecture was validated using more than 15,000 ground truth observations from five trials, including data from three growing seasons and two countries. The trained model showed good generalization capability with a root mean squared error lower than two days in four out of five trials. Four methods of estimating prediction uncertainty showed potential at identifying different sources of errors in the maturity date predictions. The architecture developed solves limitations of previous research and can be used at scale in commercial breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarchitecture 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3agrowing season 3ainformation 3amethodology 3aneural networks 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3aresearch 3asoybeans 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aPérez, Osvaldo 1 aSchmitz, Nathan 1 aDiers, Brian 1 aMartin, Nicolas 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Nov. 04, v. 12, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs122136173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245012700201500002000328520202000348592002802368596005402396596004102450650002502491650001402516650002102530650002402551650001302575650001002588650001702598650001402615650001502629650001302644650001702657650001102674650002202685650001302707650001102720650001302731650001102744650001402755650001102769651001402780651001502794700006202809700002902871700002102900700002002921700002302941700001902964700002302983700002403006773010703030856007303137852000903210655001203219IND60681346720221118191824.0200115e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068134672DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.29832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColborne, Scott F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0143-845610aSequence analysis and acoustic tracking of individual lake sturgeon identify multiple patterns of river–lake habitat use  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding the spatial ecology of sturgeon (Acipenseridae) has proven to be a challenge due to the life history characteristics of these fish, especially their long life span, intermittent spawning, and long‐distance migrations. Within the Huron‐Erie Corridor (HEC) of the Laurentian Great Lakes, habitat use of 247 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) was monitored over a three‐year period (2015–2017) with acoustic transmitters. Extensive spatial coverage of receivers throughout the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River between Lake Huron and Lake Erie (~150 km) allowed for continuous monitoring of the movements of acoustic‐tagged individuals. Sequence analysis of individual detection histories was used to describe lake sturgeon habitat use and to determine (1) whether distinct habitat‐use patterns occurred within the HEC; (2) whether the range of habitats occupied varied across seasons among sturgeon grouped by common patterns; and (3) whether variation identified was related to tagging sites in the two rivers or sex. Lake sturgeon were active throughout the HEC, but five distinct habitat‐use patterns were identified. River residents were not broadly distributed across entire rivers, but rather associated with particular segments (middle Detroit River, St. Clair River delta). Variations in habitat‐use sequences were in part related to three river tagging sites, but not sex, and did not produce groups with sequences that reflected all five habitat‐use patterns derived from cluster analysis. Lake sturgeon distribution was reduced to fewer habitat segments during winter and expanded to the maximum extent during the spring and summer. Conservation planning that incorporates behavioral diversity of habitat use is relatively rare due to a lack of observations on movements of individuals at biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales, but using telemetry and sequence analysis methods may promote the success of conservation and restoration efforts.  aPublisher supplied data  aGL‐00E23010cGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative  a2011.1200cGreat Lakes Fishery Trust 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aacoustics 3acluster analysis 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alakes 3alife history 3alongevity 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3asequence analysis 3aspawning 3aspring 3asturgeon 3asummer 3atelemetry 3awinter 3aLake Erie 3aLake Huron1 aHondorp, Darryl W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5182-19631 aHolbrook, Christopher M.1 aLowe, Michael R.1 aBoase, James C.1 aChiotti, Justin A.1 aWills, Todd C.1 aRoseman, Edward F.1 aKrueger, Charles C.0 tEcosphere.g2019 Dec., v. 10, no. 12 p.e02983-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.29833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01989naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245025600170300001400426520064300440592002801083650002501111650001901136650002101155650001501176650001901191650001601210650002201226650002201248650001901270650001501289650001701304651001201321700006701333773012301400856008301523852000901606655001201615IND60542773720221119074406.0190405e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054277372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2015.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, Linda D.14aThe impact of climate change on existing and emerging microbial threats across the food chain: An island of Ireland perspective††This paper is one of a series of reviews on “Climate Change and Food Safety – an Island of Ireland perspective”.  ap. 11-20.  aThe Agri-Food and aquaculture industries are vital to the economy of the island of Ireland with a gross annual output that is expected to double in the future.

When we compared plasma and serum prepared immediately after blood sampling, 95.5% of 176 quantified proteins differed by less than 1.5-fold. When we compared plasma samples prepared by centrifugation after storage of blood at room temperature for 0, 15 or 30 min, or under refrigeration at 0–5 °C for 1, 4 or 8 h, no protein showed a significant change (q < 0.05) that amounted to 1.5-fold or more, except hemoglobins. Those proteins were greatly increased in a single sample at 8 h, probably due to hemolysis. Comparison of data from the same samples indicates that the blood proteome is more stable than the blood metabolome. The present results suggest that most components of the proteome are essentially the same in plasma and serum, and are stable under the storage conditions examined in the present study. However, it may be important to pay attention to the extent of coagulation, and levels of platelet and hemolysis-related proteins.Pre-analytical processing and storage conditions after blood collection are expected to influence the blood proteome. Therefore, we investigated differences in the proteome between human serum and plasma, as well as the stability of human plasma proteins under different storage conditions: at room temperature for 0–30 min, or at 0–5 °C for 1–8 h, which may reflect the clinical situation of blood collection. Proteomics analysis with SWATH-MS identified 342 proteins, and 176 proteins quantified with two or more unique peptides were compared. The levels of most components of the proteome were similar in plasma and serum, and were stable under the storage conditions examined. However, it is necessary to consider the possibility of coagulation, as this affects the levels of platelet and hemolysis-related proteins. Interestingly, the blood proteome appears to be more stable than the blood metabolome, based on previously reported metabolomics data with same samples. These data will be helpful in designing protocols for blood sampling and for blood biomarker discovery and validation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abiomarkers 3ablood proteins 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acentrifugation 3acoagulation 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3apeptides 3aprotein composition 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arefrigeration 3astorage conditions 0aPlasma 0aSerum 0aPre-analytical condition 0aRoom temperature 0aCold temperature 0aCoagulation 0aHemolysis 0aSWATH-MS1 aNishiumi, Shin1 aKobayashi, Takashi1 aAska, Warabé,1 aIto, Shingo1 aYoshida, Masaru1 aOhtsuki, Sumio0 tJournal of proteomics.g2020 July 15, v. 223 p.103824-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2020.1038243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005400139245008900193300001800282500001400300520164600314592002801960650002501988650001402013650001602027650001602043650001202059650000902071650001002080650000902090650001902099650001302118650001502131650001002146653001402156653001402170700001402184700001302198700001402211700001402225700001202239700001202251700001602263700001502279773011202294856007302406852000902479655001202488IND60726850920221118043839.0210209e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072685092DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pez1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, H.Y1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1957-159710aStudy on the morphology and mineralization of the tibia in meat ducks from 1 to 56 d  ap. 3355-3364.  aNAL-light  aThe objective of this current study was to characterize the basic physiological data on morphological and mineralized properties of the tibia from 1 to 56 days, as well as the interrelationships of body weight (BW) and bone traits for meat ducks. A total of 176 1-d-old ducks was allocated into eight pens and fed with the same diet until the age of 56 d. Eight birds (1 ducks/pen) were randomly selected weekly for measuring BW and tibia characteristics. The BW of duck was increased with age throughout the whole study. Tibial length and width rapidly grew from 1 to 35 d, when it leveled off. The fat-free weight, ash, calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) content of tibia increased rapidly from 1 to 42 d and reached its plateau from 42 d onward. Tibial density and tibia-breaking strength increased in a regular manner with age until 42 d. Serum alkaline phosphatase activity was higher between 1 to 7 d in the duck. Regression and ontogenetic scaling analysis showed the age of maximal growth rate in tibia dimension and mineralization was earlier than that in BW; when compared with BW, tibial fat-free weight and tibia-breaking strength increased isometrically, tibia length displayed a negative allometry, and tibial width showed a positive allometric growth. Results indicate that the tibia displayed rapid bone growth (1 to 35 d) and mineralization (1 to 42 d), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) plays a critical role in the early stage of tibia mineralization of meat duck. Intensive selection for growth rate in ducks has resulted in tibial morphology changes, which represents an interesting compromise of adaptation for increasing BW.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aallometry 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acalcium 3adiet 3aducks 3ameat 3amineralization 3aontogeny 3aphosphorus 3atibia 0adimension 0ameat duck1 aZeng, Q F1 aBai, S P1 aWang, J P1 aDing, X M1 aXuan, Y1 aSu, Z W1 aFraley, G S1 aZhang, K Y0 tPoultry science.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 98, no. 9 p.3355-3364dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011200174300001600286520067100302592002800973650001601001650001601017650003001033650001501063650001701078650001001095650001301105650001301118650001901131650001401150650004401164650002001208700002301228700002001251700002001271700001801291700001801309700001601327700005801343700006301401773017101464856008401635852000901719655001201728IND60604296320221118095204.0180716e20180223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060429632DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b008732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Varun Pratap10aLipovelutibols A–D: Cytotoxic Lipopeptaibols from the Himalayan Cold Habitat Fungus Trichoderma velutinum  ap. 219-226.  aFour novel lipovelutibols A (1), B (2), C (3), and D (4) containing six amino acid residues with leucinol at the C-terminus and a fatty acyl moiety (n-octanoyl) at its N-terminus were isolated from the psychrotrophic fungus Trichoderma velutinum collected from the Himalayan cold habitat.

In Drosophila melanogaster, three members of the Nimrod gene family (draper, nimC1 and eater) bind bacteria, and this binding leads to phagocytosis by hemocytes. The Nimrod gene family has since been identified in other insects, but their function in non-drosophilids remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify the members of the Nimrod gene family in the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and to assess their role in immunity. We identified and sequenced three members of this gene family, herein named draper, nimrod and eater, which are the orthologs of D. melanogaster draper, nimB2 and eater, respectively. The three genes are preferentially expressed in hemocytes and their peak developmental expression is in pupae and young adults. Infection induces the transcriptional upregulation of all three genes, but the magnitude of this upregulation becomes more attenuated as mosquitoes become older. RNAi-based knockdown of eater, but not draper or nimrod, decreased a mosquito's ability to kill Escherichia coli in the hemocoel. Knockdown of draper, eater, or any combination of Nimrod family genes rendered mosquitoes more likely to die from Staphylococcus epidermidis. Finally, knockdown of Nimrod family genes did not impact mRNA levels of the antimicrobial peptides defensin (def1), cecropin (cecA) or gambicin (gam1), but eater knockdown led to a decrease in mRNA levels of nitric oxide synthase. Together, these data show that members of the A. gambiae Nimrod gene family are positive regulators of the mosquito antibacterial response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3abacteria 3acecropins 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahemocoel 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3ainsects 3amalaria 3amessenger RNA 3anitric oxide synthase 3aphagocytosis 3aproteins 3apupae 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayoung adults 0aAnopheles gambiae 0aMosquito 0aImmunity 0aHemocyte 0aBacteria 0aDraper 0aNimrod 0aEater1 aHillyer, Julián F.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2014 Jan., v. 44 p.12-22dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2013.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245014600213500001900359520165400378592002802032650001602060650001602076650001502092650001202107650001802119650001402137650001102151650001102162650001602173651001302189653002802202653001402230653001502244653001302259700002602272700002302298700005802321700002102379773013402400856008802534852000902622655001202631IND60705510120221117031715.0201202e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070551012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1413742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReis, Paula C.J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6940-054510aRapid shifts in methanotrophic bacterial communities mitigate methane emissions from a tropical hydropower reservoir and its downstream river  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMethane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) present in the water column mitigate methane (CH₄) emissions from hydropower complexes to the atmosphere. By creating a discontinuity in rivers, dams cause large environmental variations, including in CH₄ and oxygen concentrations, between upstream, reservoir, and downstream segments. Although highest freshwater methanotrophic activity is often detected at low oxygen concentrations, CH₄ oxidation in well-oxygenated downstream rivers below dams has also been reported. Here we combined DNA and RNA high-throughput sequencing with microscopic enumeration (by CARD-FISH) and biogeochemical data to investigate the abundance, composition, and potential activity of MOB taxa from upstream to downstream waters in the tropical hydropower complex Batang Ai (Malaysia). High relative abundance of MOB (up to 61% in 16S rRNA sequences and 19% in cell counts) and enrichment of stable isotopic signatures of CH₄ (up to 0‰) were detected in the hypoxic hypolimnion of the reservoir and in the outflowing downstream river. MOB community shifts along the river-reservoir system reflected environmental sorting of taxa and an interrupted hydrologic connectivity in which downstream MOB communities resembled reservoir's hypolimnetic communities but differed from upstream and surface reservoir communities. In downstream waters, CH₄ oxidation was accompanied by fast cell growth of particular MOB taxa. Our results suggest that rapid shifts in active MOB communities allow the mitigation of CH₄ emissions from different zones of hydropower complexes, including in quickly re-oxygenated rivers downstream of dams.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell growth 3aenvironment 3afreshwater 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3arivers 3awater power 3aMalaysia 0aMethanotrophic bacteria 0aReservoir 0aHydropower 0aTropical1 aRuiz-González, Clara1 aCrevecoeur, Sophie1 aSoued, Cynthia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1985-76721 aPrairie, Yves T.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 748 p.141374-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1413743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02265naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012200158300001800280520101700298592002801315650001401343650003401357650002001391650001301411650001601424650001701440700002901457700001801486700001601504700001401520700001601534700001401550700001301564700001201577700002401589700001801613773014101631856007401772852000901846655001201855IND60628784220221119193032.0190131e20190129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062878422DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ta11637g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Shuixing10aHigh-performance organic solar cells based on polymer donor/small molecule donor/nonfullerene acceptor ternary blends  ap. 2268-2274.  aWe used mid-bandgap small molecule donor TR as a third component to fabricate ternary nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) based on narrow-bandgap polymer donor PTB7-Th and narrow-bandgap nonfullerene acceptor FOIC. TR exhibits full miscibility with PTB7-Th and efficient energy transfer to PTB7-Th, enhances stacking of PTB7-Th, hole mobility and charge generation of the blends, and ultimately improves device performance. Compared with the binary PTB7-Th/FOIC blend, the ternary device with 25% TR (w/w) yields simultaneously improved open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density and fill factor. Finally, single-junction OSCs based on the ternary PTB7-Th/TR/FOIC blend yield power conversion efficiency as high as 13.1%, higher than the binary OSCs (12.1%). The ternary device efficiency exhibits high tolerance to thickness variation (>12% in the range of 80–200 nm). Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms the importance of long-range resonant energy transfer from donor to acceptor phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aelectric potential difference 3aenergy transfer 3apolymers 3asolar cells 3aspectroscopy1 aChandrabose, Sreelakshmi1 aXin, Jingming1 aLi, Tengfei1 aChen, Kai1 aXue, Peiyao1 aLiu, Kuan1 aZhou, Ke1 aMa, Wei1 aHodgkiss, Justin M.1 aZhan, Xiaowei0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Jan. 29, v. 7, no. 5 p.2268-2274dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ta11637g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011600170300001400286520149400300592002801794653001601822653002201838653001201860653001201872653001101884653001901895653002301914653002001937653001401957653001201971773011601983856008602099852000902185655001202194IND60602577420221120222326.0180711e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060257742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdul Khaliq,12aA theoretical study on a novel solar based integrated system for simultaneous production of cooling and heating  ap. 66-82.  aAn integrated system for simultaneous production of triple-effect cooling and single stage heating is proposed in this paper to harness low grade solar energy. The proposed system combines the heliostat field with a central receiver and the ejector-absorption cycle with the shaft power driven transcritical CO2 cycle. A parametric study based on first and second laws of thermodynamics is carried out to ascertain the effect of varying the exit temperature of duratherm oil, turbine inlet pressure, and evaporators temperature on the energy and exergy output as well as on the energy and exergy efficiencies of the system. The results obtained indicate that major source of exergy destruction is the central receiver where 52.5% of the inlet solar heat exergy is lost followed by the heliostat where 25% of the inlet exergy is destroyed. The energy and exergy efficiencies of the integrated system vary from 32% to 39% and 2.5%–4.0%, respectively, with a rise in the hot oil outlet temperature from 160 °C–180 °C. It is further shown that increase in evaporator temperature of transcritical CO2 cycle from −20 °C to 0 °C increases the energy efficiency from 27.45% to 43.27% and exergy efficiency from 2.51% to 2.97%, respectively. The results clearly show how the variation in the values of hot oil outlet temperature, turbine inlet pressure, and the evaporator temperature of transcritical CO2 cycle strongly influences the attainable performance of the integrated system.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSolar based 0aIntegrated system 0aCooling 0aHeating 0aExergy 0aA base solaire 0aSystème intégré 0aRefroidissement 0aChauffage 0aExergie0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2015 Apr., v. 52 p.66-82dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2014.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009500166300001600261520132300277592002801600650001301628650002201641650001801663650001101681653002601692653000901718653001301727653001801740653001801758700001701776700001601793700001901809700001301828773007101841856008401912852000901996655001202005IND60562715320221122042713.0170719e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056271532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xufei10aOperation of an organic Rankine cycle dependent on pumping flow rates and expander torques  ap. 864-878.  aAn ORC (organic Rankine cycle) was developed with R123 as the working fluid. The heat capacity is in ∼100 kW. The match between pump and expander is investigated. Lower pump frequencies (f < 10 Hz) adapt the whole range of expander torques, yielding stable flow. Higher pump frequencies (f > 10 Hz) adapt low expander torques only, and cause unstable flow and pump cavitation for larger expander torques. Ultra-low expander torques generate sufficiently high vapor superheatings to decrease expander efficiencies. Ultra-high expander torques achieve saturation vapor at the expander inlet, causing liquid droplets induced shock wave to worsen expander performance. An optimal range of expander torques exists to have better expander performance. A liquid subcooling of 20 °C is necessary to avoid pump cavitation. Expander powers and efficiencies show parabola shapes versus expander torques, or vapor superheatings at the expander inlet. The optimal vapor superheating is 13 °C. The cavitation mechanisms and measures to avoid cavitation are analyzed. This paper notes the overestimation of ORC performance by equilibrium thermodynamic analysis. Assumptions should be dependent on experiments. Future studies are suggested on organic fluid flow, heat transfer and energy conversion in various components.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplets 3aenergy conversion 3aheat transfer 3avapors 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aPump 0aExpander 0aThermodynamic 0aHeat transfer1 aXu, Jinliang1 aMiao, Zheng1 aZou, Jinghuang1 aYu, Chao0 tEnergy.g2015 Oct., v. 90 p.864-878dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245007600212300001600288520133900304592002801643650001401671650002001685650002601705650002901731650002501760650002301785650001701808650001701825650001601842650001701858650003501875650001701910650001801927650002601945650001201971650002701983650001702010650001702027650001602044650001502060650001602075700003202091773017102123856008402294852000902378655001202387IND60604296520221118095141.0180716e20171011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060429652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b010462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsakawa, Yoshinori1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1847-412X10aChemical Constituents of Bryophytes: Structures and Biological Activity  ap. 641-660.  aComparatively little attention has been paid to the bryophytes for use in the human diet or medicine in spite of the presence of 23 000 species globally. Several hundred new compounds have been isolated from the liverworts (Marchantiophyta), and more than 40 new carbon skeletons of terpenoids and aromatic compounds were found. Most of the liverworts studied elaborate characteristic odiferous, pungent, and bitter-tasting compounds, of which many show antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, allergic contact dermatitis, cytotoxic, insecticidal, anti-HIV, plant growth regulatory, neurotrophic, NO production and superoxide anion radical release inhibitory, muscle relaxing, antiobesity, piscicidal, and nematocidal activities. The biological effects ascribed to the liverworts are mainly due to lipophilic sesqui- and diterpenoids, phenolic compounds, and polyketides, which are the principal constituents of their oil bodies. Some mosses and liverworts produce significant levels of vitamin B₂ and tocopherols, as well as prostaglandin-like highly unsaturated fatty acids. The most characteristic chemical phenomenon of the liverworts is that most of the sesqui- and diterpenoids are enantiomers of those found in higher plants. In this review, the chemical constituents and potential medicinal uses of bryophytes are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3aMarchantiophyta 3aantiretroviral agents 3abitter-tasting compounds 3achemical composition 3acontact dermatitis 3acytotoxicity 3aditerpenoids 3aenantiomers 3afish poisons 3ahighly unsaturated fatty acids 3alipid bodies 3alipophilicity 3amosses and liverworts 3amuscles 3anematicidal properties 3anitric oxide 3aplant growth 3apolyketides 3ariboflavin 3atocopherols1 aLudwiczuk, A.q(Agnieszka),0 tJournal of natural products.g2017 Oct. 11, v. 81, no. 3 p.641-660dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b010463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011800167300001300285520158000298536004201878592002801920650001501948650001601963650001601979650001801995650003002013650002302043650002302066650002102089650001102110650000902121650001502130650001502145650000902160650001002169650001002179650001502189650000902204651000902213651001402222651002602236653002602262653002502288653002502313653002002338653002502358653002202383653002402405653002402429653001902453653002702472700002202499700002202521700002002543700002302563700002002586700002002606773009302626856008102719852000902800655001202809IND60698725820221120075750.0200615e20191122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069872582DNAL7 a10.3897/neobiota.53.394632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuhr, Elissa L.10aAnt interceptions reveal roles of transport and commodity in identifying biosecurity risk pathways into Australia  ap. 1-24.  aWe obtained 14,140 interception records of ants arriving in Australia between 1986 and 2010 to examine taxonomic and biogeographic patterns of invasion. We also evaluated how trade and transport data influenced interception rates, the identity of species being transported, the commerce most associated with the transport of ants, and which countries are the primary sources for ants arriving in Australia. The majority of ant interceptions, accounting for 48% of interceptions, were from Asia and Oceania. The top commodities associated with ant interceptions were: (1) Live trees, plants, cut flowers; (2) Wood and wood products; (3) Edible vegetables; and (4) Edible fruit and nuts. The best fitting model for predicting ant interceptions included volumes for these four commodities, as well as total trade value, transport volume, and geographic distance (with increased distance decreasing predicted ant interceptions). Intercepted ants identified to species consisted of a combination of species native to Australia, introduced species already established in Australia, and species not yet known to be established. 82% of interceptions identified to species level were of species already known to be established in Australia with Paratrechinalongicornis having the most records. These data provide key biogeographic insight into the overlooked transport stage of the invasion process. Given the difficult nature of eradication, once an ant species is firmly established, focusing on early detection and quarantine is key for reducing the establishment of new invasions.  aAustralian Research Council Discovery  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3abiosecurity 3acut flowers 3aedible fruits 3ageographical distribution 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3amodels 3anuts 3aprediction 3aquarantine 3arisk 3atrade 3atrees 3avegetables 3awood 3aAsia 3aAustralia 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aAnoplolepisgracilipes 0abiological invasions 0ainterception records 0aintroduced ants 0aIridomyrmexpurpureus 0aLinepithemahumile 0aMonomoriumpharaonis 0aPheidolemegacephala 0aports of entry 0aTapinomamelanocephalum1 aO'Dowd, Dennis J.1 aSuarez, Andrew V.1 aCassey, Phillip1 aWittmann, Talia A.1 aRoss, Joshua V.1 aCope, Robert C.0 tNeoBiota.g2019 Nov. 22, v. 53 p.1-24dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2193x1314-24887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.53.394633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245008100217300001600298520130100314592002801615650001401643650001901657650001301676650001701689650001001706650001001716650001701726650001301743650001901756650001401775650001901789650002601808650002101834650002101855650001101876650001701887650000701904650001301911650001601924650001501940653003301955653001801988653001902006653001302025653001702038700003002055700002202085700003302107700002202140700003902162700003302201773010602234856008702340852000902427655001202436IND60615717920221120125909.0190321e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061571792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenna, Juliana Perdiz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0017-488X10aDual alginate-lipid nanocarriers as oral delivery systems for amphotericin B  ap. 187-194.  aAmphotericin B (AmB) is the first-choice drug to treat several fungal infections. However, due to its low solubility it can only be administrated intravenously. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) have the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs in an aqueous matrix, making them interesting for use in alternative drug delivery systems for AmB. Their combination with stimuli-sensitive polymers such as alginate can be used as a strategy to protect acid sensitive molecules from gastric acid. The proposal of this work was to develop a dual-strategy hydrogel/NLC delivery system for amphotericin B. NLCs were produced by high-pressure homogenization and their size and stability were assessed by dynamic light scattering and electron transmission microscopy. The NLCs presented low cytotoxicity and high selectivity at neutral pH. Alginate hydrogels were successfully produced by the ionic gelation method and characterized using optical microscopy. The hydrogels were tested for their pH-selectivity, cytotoxicity and drug delivery profile. Swelling degree and drug delivery profiles suggested that drug delivery is stimulated as the alginate particles swell and that NLC particles maintain their structure even after rehydration, indicating these systems can be used for oral delivery of AmB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3aamphotericin B 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3afungi 3agastric acid 3agelation 3ahomogenization 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3aintravenous injection 3alight microscopy 3alight scattering 3alipids 3ananocarriers 3apH 3apolymers 3arehydration 3asolubility 0aNanostructured lipid carrier 0aDrug delivery 0aAmphotericin B 0aAlginate 0apH-sensitive1 aBarradas, Thaís Nogueira1 aCardoso, Stephani1 aCastiglione, Talita Carvalho1 aSerpe, Michael J.1 aSilva, Kattya Gyselle de Holanda e1 aMansur, Claudia Regina Elias0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 June 01, v. 166 p.187-194dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245009500172300001200267520137500279592002801654650001201682650002201694650001301716650001401729650001901743650001601762650001501778650002301793650001201816650001701828650001301845650001701858650002201875650001601897650004901913650001201962650003001974650004002004650001102044650005002055650001102105650003902116650006302155650006302218700001502281700001502296773010102311856004002412852000902452655001202461IND4471354020221118041652.0120503e20120421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447135402DNAL7 a223833282pmid7 a10.1136/vr.1003812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrosche, A.10aPeritoneal fluid analysis in dairy cows with left displaced abomasum and abomasal volvulus  ap. 413.  aPeritoneal fluid (PF) was evaluated in 40 cows with left displaced abomasum (LDA) and 15 cows with abomasal volvulus (AV). PF was obtained by abdominocentesis at the right ventral abdomen at admission. Simultaneously, a blood sample was taken from the jugular vein. Biochemical and cytological variables in blood and PF specific for ischaemia, inflammation and cell damage were compared. Total protein, albumin, glucose and cholesterol were normal in PF of cows with LDA and AV. Although L-lactate increased in both groups, cows with AV had significantly higher values (LDA: 1.47/0.69/2.68 mmol/l; AV: 6.45/4.55/12.89 mmol/l (median/1. quartile/3. quartile)). D-dimer (LDA: 0.50/0.22/0.88 mg/l; AV: 1.11/0.40/1.85 mg/l) and LDH (LDA: 663/437/943 U/l; AV: 1099/750/1439 U/l) were only increased in PF of cows with AV. The number of leucocytes was normal; however, significantly more peritoneal neutrophils appeared necrotic or apoptotic after AV. PF of cows with abomasal displacement showed distinctive features of ischaemia and inflammation. Characteristics of haemostatic dysfunction and cell damage were mainly evident in PF of cows with AV. The results suggest that anti-inflammatory therapy is indicated in each cow with abomasal displacement. Additionally, medical treatment should be directed to prevent complications of ischaemia and reperfusion in cows with AV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3aabomasal volvulus 3aalbumins 3aapoptosis 3ablood sampling 3acholesterol 3adairy cows 3adisplaced abomasum 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3aischemia 3ajugular vein 3amedical treatment 3aneutrophils 2aAbomasumxblood supplyxcytologyxpathology. 2aAnimals 2aAscitic Fluidxmetabolism 2aBlood Chemical Analysisxveterinary 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aLactic Acidxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aStomach Diseasesxmetabolismxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aStomach Volvulusxmetabolismxphysiopathologyxveterinary.1 aFürll, M.1 aWittek, T.0 tVeterinary record.g2012 Apr. 21, v. 170, no. 16 p.413-413dBMJ Group Group Ltdx2042-76707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.100381  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009800165300001200263520156100275592002801836650002301864650002301887650002501910650001101935650001101946650002301957650001601980650001301996650002602009650000702035650001202042650002502054650001402079650001702093700001802110700001902128700002302147700001702170773013202187856008102319852000902400655001202409IND60129889720221123044238.0151024e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012988972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4532-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRana, Shivnam10aThiamethoxam degradation by Pseudomonas and Bacillus strains isolated from agricultural soils  ap. 300.  aTwelve bacterial species were evaluated to know the degradation pattern of thiamethoxam in liquid medium. All the bacterial species could actively degrade phorate in a mineral salt medium containing phorate (50 μg ml–¹) as sole carbon source. As these species have ability to degrade, we used these for the degradation of thiamethoxam—a neonicoitinoids. Screening of 12 active phorate-metabolizing bacterial species resulted in selection of Bacillus aeromonas strain IMBL 4.1 and Pseudomonas putida strain IMBL 5.2 causing 45.28 and 38.23 % thiamethoxam (50 μg ml⁻¹) reduction, respectively, in 15 days as potential thiamethoxam degrading species. These two bacterial species grew optimally at 37 °C under shake culture conditions in MSMT medium raised with initial pH of 6.0–6.5 and use of these optimum cultural conditions resulted in improved thiamethoxam degradation by these bacterial species. These species caused maximum thiamethoxam degradation only in the presence of thiamethoxam as sole source of carbon and energy and the same was reduced in the presence of easily metabolize able carbon (C₀ and C₁) and nitrogen ((N₀, N₁ and N₂) sources. This could be attributed to involvement of repressible metabolic pathways, reactions of which are inhibited by the presence of easily available nutrients for growth. Besides above, qualitative analysis of thiamethoxam residues by gas liquid chromatography revealed complete metabolization of thiamethoxam without detectable accumulation of any known thiamethoxam metabolites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3aagricultural soils 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3aenergy 3agas chromatography 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3apH 3aphorate 3aqualitative analysis 3ascreening 3athiamethoxam1 aJindal, Vikas1 aMandal, Kousik1 aKaura, Guraprīta,1 aGupta, V.

To overcome this problem, we have generated large datasets of organic dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblages from Southern Ocean shelf sediments over the past decade, and we here calibrate these to the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) using magnetostratigraphy and stable isotope stratigraphy. This now for the first time allows a high-resolution Southern Pacific Ocean dinocyst zonation for the late Palaeocene to late Eocene (58–36million years ago; Ma). We compile published dinocyst chronologies from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 1171D on the South Tasman Rise, Hole 1172A/D on the East Tasman Plateau and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Hole U1356A on the Wilkes Land margin. Correlation to dinocyst zonations from New Zealand lead to revisions of the magnetostratigraphic age model at Holes 1171D and 1172A/D. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope records reveal the stratigraphic location of the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (~56Ma) and the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (~40Ma), respectively. The resulting zonation consists of thirteen dinocyst zones, calibrated to the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) of Vandenberghe et al. (2012), which can likely be applied to the entire Southern Ocean. Finally, we apply the revised stratigraphy to all published TEX₈₆ data, a biomarker-based proxy for sea surface temperature (SST), from ODP Site 1172 to assess long-term climate evolution. This shows that Southwest Pacific SST trends mimic the global compilation of benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotopes even better than previously appreciated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophyceae 3acalcite 3acarbon 3aclimate 3adata collection 3adrilling 3amicrofossils 3amodels 3aoxygen 3apaleoclimatology 3apaleoecology 3aplateaus 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3astratigraphy 3asurface water temperature 3aNew Zealand 3aPacific Ocean 3aPolar Regions1 aSluijs, Appy1 aBrinkhuis, Henk0 tEarth-science reviews.g2013 Sept., v. 124 p.1-31dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.04.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009300155300002000248520115600268592002801424650001501452650001101467650001301478650002201491650001401513650001201527700001401539700001301553700001801566700001301584700001501597700001701612700001501629773014401644856007401788852000901862655001201871IND60648096720221119162446.0190626e20190625xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064809672DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta00519f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chao10aAnisotropic expansion and size-dependent fracture of silicon nanotubes during lithiation  ap. 15113-15122.  aSilicon nanotube anodes are notably promising for high-performance lithium-ion batteries due to their outstanding structural stability, but fundamental understanding about their structural evolution during lithiation still remains unclear. Here, the expansion and fracture behavior of lithiated silicon nanotubes is investigated, and the influences of the crystal phase, crystal orientation, inner radius, wall thickness, and thickness–radius ratio are demonstrated. Experiments and simulations demonstrate anisotropic expansion and outer-surface fractures of crystalline silicon nanotubes and isotropic expansion of amorphous ones. The inner holes of nanotubes undergo much less expansion than the outside. The fracture ratio and the maximum hoop stress are positively correlated with both wall thickness and inner radius for crystalline silicon nanotubes. Their competition gives rise to an optimal thickness–outer radius ratio of about 2/3, and the critical diameter reaches 700 nm correspondingly. This research provides significant insight into the lithiation behavior of silicon nanotubes, which could help to design improved silicon anodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3aanodes 3aisotropy 3alithium batteries 3ananotubes 3asilicon1 aWen, Jici1 aLuo, Fei1 aQuan, Baogang1 aLi, Hong1 aWei, Yujie1 aGu, Changzhi1 aLi, Junjie0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 June 25, v. 7, no. 25 p.15113-15122dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta00519f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009200171300001600263500002000279500001900299500000900318520210200327592002802429650002502457650002402482650001302506650001302519650001402532650001102546650001502557650002202572651001302594651002402607700002302631700001702654773013302671856008302804852000902887655001202896IND60663694720221117222623.0220803e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066369472DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2016.07.04092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiorellino, Nicole10aLong‐Term Agronomic Drawdown of Soil Phosphorus in Mid‐Atlantic Coastal Plain Soils  ap. 455-461.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aepub  aCORE IDEAS: Rate of soil P drawdown is a slow process having economic impacts to producers. Cropping system affected drawdown of soil P concentrations at all locations. Forage cropping systems exhibited faster soil P drawdown. Lower initial soil P status resulted in faster soil P drawdown at one location. Soils could take 18 to 44 yr to return to agronomic optimum P concentrations. Phytoremediation remains the only management option to lower soil P concentrations. Elevated soil P concentrations exist where manure has been repeatedly applied over a long period of time leading to regulatory restrictions on P applications targeted to decrease P loss from fields. Phytoextraction uses growing crops to remove contaminants, including P, from the soil through removal of crop biomass. A long‐term study initiated in 1994 compared effectiveness of forage and grain rotations common in the mid‐Atlantic region at reducing soil P concentrations in the absence of additional P application. Five soil P concentrations were established in replicated plots at three Maryland locations through application of manure. Grain and forage plots were established as main plots and soil P concentrations were split plots. Mehlich‐3 extractable phosphorus (M3P) concentrations were measured biennially or annually and rate of soil P drawdown was calculated as a first‐order decay equation. Phosphorus concentration was measured in grain and aboveground biomass from grain and forage plots, respectively, to measure crop P removal. Forage plots had greater P removal than grain plots at all locations studied. Forage plots tended to have greater rate of soil P drawdown at all three locations. An average of 20 yr was estimated for forage plots to return to optimum soil P concentrations, about 100 mg kg⁻¹ Mehlich‐3 P, while an average of 25 yr was estimated for grain plots to return to optimum. Future research should investigate the relative proportions of soil P fractions, as Mehlich‐3 P concentrations may not be completely describing soil P drawdown behavior in the absence of P additions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMehlich-3 phosphorus 3aaboveground biomass 3aagronomy 3adrawdown 3aequations 3aforage 3aphosphorus 3aphytoaccumulation 3aMaryland 3aMid-Atlantic region1 aKratochvil, Robert1 aCoale, Frank0 tAgronomy journal.g2017 Mar., v. 109, no. 2 p.455-461dThe American Society of Agronomy, Inc.wJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2016.07.04093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245013600179300001800315520128900333592002801622650001201650650001101662650001301673650001001686650002201696650001301718650001901731650001101750650002701761650001201788650001701800650002401817650000901841650003501850700001901885700002001904700002001924700002101944700001701965700002001982700002102002773010102023856008102124852000902205655001202214IND60129890120221121230824.0150503e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012989012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-011-1403-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasaje, Charisse Flerida A.10aGenetic variations in KIFC1 and the risk of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease in a Korean population: an association analysis  ap. 5913-5919.  aModest effects of genes in various pathways are significant in the etiology of complex human diseases, including aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). By functioning as a relevant component of respiratory processes, the human kinesin family member C1 (KIFC1) is hypothesized to play a role in AERD pathogenesis. A case–control analysis was carried out by comparing the genotype distribution of six KIFC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms between 93 AERD cases and 96 aspirin-tolerant asthma controls in a Korean population. After controlling for confounds, logistic and regression models via various modes of genetic inheritance facilitated the association analysis. Initial results revealed significant association at 0.05 level of significance between several KIFC1 variations and AERD (P = 0.01–0.05, OR = 1.81–1.90) as well as fall rate of forced expiratory volume in the 1st second, an important diagnostic marker of airways constriction (P = 0.04–0.05). However, the signals were not deemed significant after multiple testing corrections (Pᶜᵒʳʳ > 0.05). Although the results do not support a major role of KIFC1 in AERD pathogenesis in a Korean asthma cohort, further replication and validation studies are required to clarify the current findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspirin 3aasthma 3aetiology 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3ainheritance (genetics) 3akinesin 3apathogenesis 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aBae, Joon Seol1 aPark, Byung-Lae1 aKim, Jeong-Hyun1 aCheong, Hyun Sub1 aUh, Soo-Taek1 aPark, Choon-Sik1 aShin, Hyoung Doo0 tMolecular biology reports.g2012 May, v. 39, no. 5 p.5913-5919dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-011-1403-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007800158300001600236520098000252592002801232650002501260650002201285650002301307650002001330650001201350650002701362650001301389650001201402650001301414650001201427650001001439651001601449700001701465773008901482856007401571852000901645655001201654IND60340803420221120182733.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034080342DNAL7 a10.1111/soru.120992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoeksen, Anne10aBusiness Strategies for Resilience: The Case of Zeeland's Oyster Industry  ap. 325-342.  aThe article examines approaches to resilience building adopted by 18 out of the 29 active oyster firms in Zeeland, the southwestern delta province of the Netherlands, where a highly dynamic natural environment exposes oyster growing to known but unpredictable environmental disturbances. Survey results reveal a range of actions across three interrelated areas of decision‐making: maricultural practice, the business and the household. Closer analysis indicates two contrasting strategies for resilience building: a more cautious, cost saving approach adopted by the smaller ‘oyster farmer’ and a more adventurous approach based on vertical and horizontal integration favoured by ‘farmer traders’, often involving expansion into other forms of seafood production and trade. The actions of individual firms in seeking to build resilience within their own enterprises is not matched by collaborative initiatives nor, in the view of the industry, by government action.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3abusiness planning 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3afarmers 3ahorizontal integration 3aindustry 3aoysters 3aseafoods 3asurveys 3atrade 3aNetherlands1 aSymes, David0 tSociologia ruralis.g2015 July, v. 55, no. 3 p.325-342dVan Gorcum.x0038-01997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/soru.120993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01948naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011200163300001400275520076400289592002801053650001901081650001101100650002101111650003101132650001701163653002701180653001601207653002201223653001401245653001801259700001101277700002101288700002101309700002401330773011901354856008001473852000901553655001201562IND60560868120221119172339.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056086812DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b141062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaek, David

Recently, we have fabricated freestanding 2D oxide membranes using the water-soluble perovskite Sr₃Al₂O₆ as a sacrificial buffer layer. Here, with atomic-resolution spectroscopic imaging, we observe that direct growth of oxide thin films on Sr₃Al₂O₆ can cause complete phase transformation of the buffer layer, rendering it water-insoluble. More importantly, we demonstrate that an ultrathin SrTiO₃ layer can be employed as an effective barrier to preserve Sr₃Al₂O₆ during subsequent growth, thus allowing its integration in a wider range of oxide heterostructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3aoxides 3aphase transition 3aphysicochemical properties 3aspectroscopy 0aoxide heterostructures 0asoft oxides 0athermal stability 0aSTEM-EELS 0abuffer layers1 aLu, Di1 aHikita, Yasuyuki1 aHwang, Harold Y.1 aKourkoutis, Lena F.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.54-59dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b141063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245017500205300001200380520247900392592002802871596010602899650001103005650001203016650002203028650001203050700001903062773016103081856008303242852000903325655001203334IND60788443120221120080736.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078844312DNAL7 a10.1186/s12966-022-01343-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilb, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9751-249910aEffects of behavioral performance, intrinsic reward value, and context stability on the formation of a higher-order nutrition habit: an intensive longitudinal diary study  ap. 105.  aBACKGROUND: Habits drive many of our health behaviors in our daily lives. However, little is known about the relative contribution of different key factors for habit formation in real-world contexts. We examined the effects of behavioral performance, intrinsic reward value (operationalized as tastiness), and context stability on the formation of a higher-order nutrition habit. METHODS: Participants were recruited via mailing lists and posts on social media platforms. N = 199 participants (Mₐgₑ = 37.10 years, SD = 13.00, 86.93% female) received an online intervention for building the higher-order habit of filling half of their plates with vegetables at dinner and completed one daily online survey for up to 56 days, including the assessment of habit strength, behavioral performance, intrinsic reward value, and context stability, providing a total of N = 6352 daily measurements. N = 189 participants (N = 4175 measurements) could be included in the primary analysis. Utilizing multilevel modeling, we analyzed the impact of behavioral performance, intrinsic reward value, and context stability, as well as their interaction effects, on habit strength on the next day. RESULTS: Habit strength significantly increased over time. This effect was strengthened in persons with high mean levels of behavioral performance. Furthermore, mean levels of behavioral performance, intrinsic reward value, and context stability were all positively related to mean levels of habit strength. There were no positive effects of daily intraindividual variations in the three examined factors on habit strength at the next day. There was an unexpected negative effect of daily behavioral performance on habit strength at the next day. We found little to no evidence for our expected and pre-registered interaction effects. In an additional exploratory analysis, there were positive effects of daily intraindividual variations in the three factors on habit strength at the same day. CONCLUSIONS: We found that behavioral performance, intrinsic reward value, and context stability were all independent predictors of habit strength of a higher-order habit at the between-person level. However, we did not find the expected associations at the within-person level. Habit interventions should promote the consistent performance of the target behaviors in stable contexts.

An important step to understand the molecular foundation of stress response in plants is the analysis of stress-responsive proteins. In this work we attempted to investigate and compare changes in the abundance of proteins in the roots of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) germinating under long continuous chilling conditions (10°C, 16 days), exposed to short rapid chilling during germination (10°C, 24h), as well as subjected to recovery from stress (25°C, 24h). The results we obtained indicate that germination under continuous chilling causes alterations in the accumulation of the proteins involved in stress response, energy production, translation, vesicle transport, secondary metabolism and protein degradation. The subsequent recovery influences the accumulation of the proteins implicated in calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways, secondary metabolism and those promoting cell division and expansion. Subjecting the germinating bean seeds to short rapid chilling stress resulted in a transient changes in the relative content of the proteins taking part in energy production, DNA repair, RNA processing and translation. Short stress triggers also the mechanisms of protection against oxidative stress and promotes expression of anti-stress proteins. Subjecting bean seeds to the subsequent recovery influences the abundance of the proteins involved in energy metabolism, protection against stress and production of phytohormones. The exposure to long and short chilling did not result in the alterations of any proteins common to both treatments. The same situation was observed with respect to the recovery after stresses. Bean response to chilling is therefore strongly correlated with the manner and length of exposure to low temperature, which causes divergent proteomic alterations in the roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aRNA 3abeans 3acell division 3acold stress 3acold treatment 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3agermination 3aoxidative stress 3aphysiological transport 3aplant hormones 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein metabolism 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aroots 3aseeds 3asignal transduction 3astress response 3atemperature 3atranslation (genetics) 0a2D-PAGE 0aC1 0aC2 0aCDPK 0aDW 0aFC 0aFW 0aLEA 0aLS 0aLSR 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0aPAL 0aC/P 0aSS 0aSR 0aBean 0aChilling 0aProteomics 0aRecovery 0aRoots1 aWeidner, Stanisław0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 171, no. 6 p.389-398dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2013.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008300169300001800252500000900270520123400279592002801513650001901541650002401560650000901584650002001593650001201613650002601625650001301651650002501664650001501689650002301704650001401727650002401741650002001765651001301785700002201798773013901820856007901959852000902038655001202047IND60668508520221117180314.0191228e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066850852DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2004.02232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuwanwaree, Pongthep10aMethane Oxidation in Forest, Successional, and No-till Agricultural Ecosystems  ap. 1722-1729.  aepub  aMethane oxidation in well-aerated soils is a significant global sink for atmospheric methane. We examined the effects of soil disturbance (simulated tillage) and N-fertilizer additions on methane oxidation in old-growth forest, mid-successional, and no-till maize ecosystems in southwest Michigan, USA. We found highest oxidation rates in forest sites (about 30 μg CH₄–C m⁻² h⁻¹ on average), with average rates in successional and agricultural sites about 75 and 12% of this, respectively. In the forest and successional sites a one-time N-fertilizer addition (100 kg NH₄NO₃–N ha⁻¹) significantly suppressed oxidation for the several weeks that inorganic N pools were elevated. There was no effect of fertilizer addition in the agricultural site, where available N was already high and oxidation rates low. Soil disturbance by itself had no detectable effect on fluxes in any of the sites. Results confirm the overriding importance of elevated N for suppressing CH₄ oxidation in managed and unmanaged ecosystems, and suggest further that recovery of CH₄ suppression following agriculture is related to slow-changing soil properties such as soil organic matter composition or microbial community structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acommunity structure 3acorn 3adisturbed soils 3amethane 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ano-tillage 3aold-growth forests 3aoxidation 3asoil organic matter 3asoil properties 3aMichigan1 aRobertson, G.

Research was conducted over 3 site-years in Montana to (1) examine the spatial distribution of wild oat seed banks on a small scale (1 m² plots), (2) compare wild oat seed bank density sample means and precision between two soil samplers, and (3) predict the sample area needed to quantify a range of wild oat seed bank densities at several levels of precision. Seed bank sample means obtained with a large sampler (10- by 10-cm box) were greater than means obtained with a small sampler (4.4- or 3.8-cm-diam cylinder) for 15 of 18 seed banks. There was no clear advantage in precision (SE/mean) when sampling seed banks using a large number of small soil samples rather than using a small number of large soil samples. Furthermore, at very low seed bank densities, using a small number of large samples gave better precision. Precision improved as sample number increased for each seed bank at each site-year. High-density seed banks tended to have better precision than low-density seed banks at any given sample number. Seed banks had an aggregated spatial distribution when sampled with either soil sampler. As the desired precision level decreases (becomes more precise), the predicted sample area required increases greatly. A seed bank containing 6,000 seeds m⁻⁻² has a predicted sample area of 0.5, 0.7, 1.3, and 2.9%% of the total area to obtain precision levels of 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively.Nomenclature: Wild oat; Avena fatua L.

The studied sequence is composed of results from Jelinek's excavations and Ronen's excavations which sampled different parts of the stratigraphic section of Tabun Cave, together covering 16 m depth of superimposed archaeological layers. The recycling of flint is examined using three aspects: (1) the presence of patinated items, (2) the phenomenon of ‘handaxes with a preferential flake scar’ along with other aspects indicating the recycling of handaxes as cores, and (3) the presence of items which are both cores-on-flakes and tools, indicating a complex life-history. The changes in their frequencies and characteristics along the sequence are presented through a study of 20 assemblages spanning from the Acheulean, Lower Paleolithic to the early Middle Paleolithic.  aPublisher supplied data 3alife history 3arecycling 3aIsrael 0aLithic technology 0aRecycling 0aLower Paleolithic 0aTabun Cave0 tQuaternary international.g2015 Mar. 10, v. 361 p.34-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010900164300001800273520091700291592002801208650002401236650001301260650001101273650002201284650001401306650001301320650001001333650001901343653001301362653003601375653001701411653002401428653001901452700001801471700001701489700001901506700002101525700001701546700002001563773012301583856008001706852000901786655001201795IND60560868220221119172504.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056086822DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b143752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChueh, Chu-Chen10aDoping Versatile n-Type Organic Semiconductors via Room Temperature Solution-Processable Anionic Dopants  ap. 1136-1144.  aIn this study, we describe a facile solution-processing method to effectively dope versatile n-type organic semiconductors, including fullerene, n-type small molecules, and graphene by commercially available ammonium and phosphonium salts via in situ anion-induced electron transfer. In addition to the Lewis basicity of anions, we unveiled that the ionic binding strength between the cation and anion of the salts is also crucial in modulating the electron transfer strength of the dopants to affect the resulting doping efficiency. Furthermore, combined with the rational design of n-type molecules, an n-doped organic semiconductor is demonstrated to be thermally and environmentally stable. This finding provides a simple and generally applicable method to make highly efficient n-doped conductors which complements the well-established p-doped organics such as PEDOT:PSS for organic electronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aammonium 3aanions 3aelectron transfer 3afullerene 3agraphene 3asalts 3asemiconductors 0an-doping 0aanion-induced electron transfer 0aconductivity 0aorganic electronics 0aanionic dopant1 aLi, Chang-Zhi1 aDing, Feizhi1 aLi, Zhong’an1 aCernetic, Nathan1 aLi, Xiaosong1 aJen, Alex K.-Y.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.1136-1144dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b143753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03710naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013500167300001600302500001500318520208100333592002802414650002402442650003102466650002402497650001802521650002002539650002502559650001902584650001702603650002602620650002102646650002102667650001702688650001802705651001002723653002502733653002002758653001102778653002202789653003102811653003902842700001502881700001902896700001402915700005702929700001302986773008702999856008503086852000903171655001203180IND60557079520221116141852.0190403e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055707952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2016.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Maibo10aVariation of soil aggregation and intra-aggregate carbon by long-term fertilization with aggregate formation in a grey desert soil  ap. 437-445.  a2019-12-06  aA long-term field experiment was established in 1990 to evaluate the impact of mineral fertilizer (N and NPK) and organic material (manure and crop residues) application on soil aggregation and organic carbon (C) accumulation in an intensively cultivated grey desert soil in northwestern China. The long-term addition of organic materials with balanced inorganic NPK inputs significantly increased the mass proportion of macroaggregates from 10% in the CK treatment to 34% and 24% in the 1.5MNPK and SNPK treatments (the application of inorganic NPK combined with organic sheep manure and the return of crop residues to the field, respectively). In contrast, the addition of inorganic fertilizer (the N and NPK treatments) had no obvious effect in promoting the percentage of macroaggregates. The application of inorganic fertilizer and abandonment (the CK0 treatment) only sustained the soil organic carbon (SOC) content. However, the SOC contents were significantly increased by 197% and 19% in the 1.5MNPK and SNPK treatments, respectively, relative to the CK treatment over a 24-year period. Amending the soils with N and NPK mainly increased the organic C concentrations in the silt+clay fraction. In contrast, the application of manure accelerated the accumulation of organic C in all of the aggregate fractions, particularly by increasing the amount of C in the fine intra-aggregate particulate organic matter (iPOM) fraction rather than the coarse iPOM or the silt+clay subfraction. The organic C concentration in the silt+clay fraction was significantly correlated with the mass proportion of macroaggregates (R2=0.9488, P<0.01), and with the ratio of macroaggregates to microaggregates (R2=0.9477, P<0.01). These results indicated that macroaggregates and the silt+clay fraction were more sensitive to fertilization in the grey desert soils. We consider that increases in the organic C concentrations in the silt+clay fraction and shifts in the stored C towards microaggregates may play important roles in soil aggregation and SOC sequestration in grey desert soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3amineral fertilizers 3aparticulate organic matter 3asoil organic carbon 3acrop residues 3amicroaggregates 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil treatment 3adesert soils 3afield experimentation 3amanure spreading 3asoil aggregation 3asheep manure 3aorganic foods 3aChina 0aCarbon sequestration 0aSoil aggregates 0acarbon 0aGrey desert soils 0aParticulate organic matter 0aLong-term fertilization experiment1 aWang, Xihe1 aLiusui, Yunhao1 aHan, Chao1 aZhao, Chengyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1557-19791 aLiu, Hua0 tCatena.g2017 Feb., v. 149 p.437-445dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2016.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015600163500002200319520141700341592002801758650002301786650001401809650002101823650001301844650001701857650001601874650000901890650001401899650001601913650001501929650001301944650002401957650002001981653002202001653004002023653001502063653001002078653001002088700001302098700001402111700001702125700001202142700001902154773009702173856008202270852000902352655001202361IND60563649220221123002939.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056364922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.1232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Wenhan10aTargeting androgen receptor with ACS-J9 attenuates cardiac injury and dysfunction in experimental autoimmune myocarditis by reducing M1-like macrophage  aPre-press version  aMacrophages are important mediators in inflammatory cardiovascular diseases. Experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) is characterized by pronounced macrophage infiltration, cardiac necrosis and cardiac fibrosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a regulator of immune system which can control macrophages' infiltration and function in various inflammatory-related diseases. However, the effect of AR on the inflammatory response in EAM is unknown. Our study aims to investigate the potential role of AR on the development of autoimmune myocarditis.In our study, we found that AR was increased in the myocardium and was associated with the time-course of EAM progression, which motivated us to use ASC-J9 (an enhancer of AR degradation). The results revealed that ASC-J9 administration in EAM mice resulted in an attenuation in the severity of disease and cardiac injury, a reduced CD4+T cell response, reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and decreases in the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, ASC-J9 was also found to prevent Raw264.7 cells polarization to M1 macrophages in response to LPS by upregulating suppressor of cytokine signaling 1(SOCS1) and downregulating signal transducer and activator of the transcription 5(STAT5) activity.AR facilitated EAM development, and targeting AR with ASC-J9 attenuated cardiac injury and dysfunction by inhibiting macrophages polarization towards M1 macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrogen receptors 3acytokines 3adisease severity 3afibrosis 3ainflammation 3amacrophages 3amice 3amonocytes 3amyocarditis 3amyocardium 3anecrosis 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators 0aAndrogen receptor 0aExperimental autoimmune myocarditis 0aMacrophage 0aSOCS1 0aSTAT51 aWang, Ya1 aLu, Shuai1 aYan, LianHua1 aHu, Fen1 aWang, Zhaohui,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.1233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02799naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012900169300001600298520181000314592002802124650001902152650001902171650001702190650001702207650001402224650000902238650001902247650001102266700002502277773007802302856008402380852000902464655001202473IND60087200320221120035002.0141102e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008720032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2010.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlorea, Adrian10aAbnormal mitochondrial cristae were experimentally generated by high doses of Apis mellifera venom in the rat adrenal cortex  ap. 434-442.  aIn the present study, Apis mellifera venom (AmV) was tested for its ability to cause ultrastructural changes in mitochondria of rat adrenal cortex in vivo. In order to achieve this goal, different AmV treatments were performed and the effects were quantified on transmission electron micrographs. In a first experimental group, AmV injected for 30 days in low daily doses (700μg/kg) generated important ultrastructural changes in zona fasciculata. The mitochondrial ultrastructure was not affected, but the diameters of mitochondrial cristae (MC) were reduced (57.066±7.795nm) as compared to the MC diameters in the corresponding control groups (58.596±6.603nm, and 58.503±5.708nm). In adrenal glands collected from rats injected with a single, high dose of AmV (62mg/kg), many ultrastructural changes were described. Mitochondria with normal, tubular MC (with diameter of 58.711±5.907nm) were observed in many cells, very close to the values calculated for the corresponding control group (58.639±6.117nm). However, the striking data reported herein concerned the ability of AmV high doses to promote dramatic alterations in the ultrastructure of these particular mitochondria, similar to those described in certain severe diseases. Thus, several types of abnormal mitochondria were observed, including mitochondria displaying lamellar and/or circular, concentric cristae and mitochondria devoid of cristae. The abnormal circular, concentric MC, with large inner (281.904±158.588nm) and outer (432.076±230.372nm) diameters, appeared to be the most stable form of MC in the adrenal cortex after the acute treatment with AmV. Among other ultrastructural aspects, these important changes indicated a high level of cytotoxicity of AmV in adrenocortical cells following in vivo experimental poisoning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aadrenal cortex 3acytotoxicity 3amitochondria 3apoisoning 3arats 3aultrastructure 3avenoms1 aCrăciun, Constantin0 tMicron.g2011 July, v. 42, no. 5 p.434-442dElsevier Ltdx0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2010.12.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03318naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015000169300001800319520193600337592002802273650000802301650001302309650002502322650001502347650002402362650001002386650001302396650001802409650001202427650001302439650001102452650001002463650001502473650001302488650003002501650000902531650003502540700001902575700001702594700002102611700002502632773010102657856008102758852000902839655001202848IND60129890420221120043506.0150503e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012989042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-011-1406-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayram, Süleyman14aThe significance of Exonuclease 1 K589E polymorphism on hepatocellular carcinoma susceptibility in the Turkish population: a case–control study  ap. 5943-5951.  aExonuclease 1 (Exo 1) is an important nuclease involved in mismatch repair system that contributes to maintain genomic stability, to modulate DNA recombination, and to mediate cell cycle arrest. A guanine (G)/adenine (A) common single nucleotide polymorphism at first position of codon 589 in Exo 1 gene determines a glutamic acid (Glu, E) to lysine (Lys, K) (K589E) aminoacidic substitution which may alter cancer risk by influencing the activity of Exo 1 protein. Exo 1 K589E polymorphism has been studied in various cancers, but its association with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has yet to be investigated. To determine the association of the Exo 1 K589E polymorphism with the risk of HCC development in a Turkish population, a hospital-based case–control study was designed consisting of 224 subjects with HCC and 224 cancer-free control subjects matched for age, gender, smoking and alcohol status. The genotype frequency of the Exo 1 K589E polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Our data shows that the Lys/Lys genotype of the Exo 1 K589E polymorphism is associated with increased risk of HCC development in this Turkish population [odds ratio (OR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13–4.09, P = 0.02]. Furthermore, according to stratified analysis, a significant association was observed between the homozygote Lys/Lys genotype and HCC risk in the subgroups of male gender (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.27–5.61, P = 0.009) and patients with non-viral-related HCC (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.09–8.99, P = 0.03). Because our results suggest for the first time that the Lys/Lys homozygote genotype of Exo 1 K589E polymorphism may be a genetic susceptibility factor for HCC in the Turkish population, further independent studies are required to validate our findings in a larger series, as well as in patients of different ethnic origins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalcohols 3acase-control studies 3acell cycle 3aconfidence interval 3agenes 3agenotype 3aglutamic acid 3aguanine 3ahepatoma 3alysine 3amales 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aAkkız, Hikmet1 aBekar, Aynur1 aAkgöllü, Ersin1 aYıldırım, Selçuk0 tMolecular biology reports.g2012 May, v. 39, no. 5 p.5943-5951dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-011-1406-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011700171520162200288592002801910650002101938650001401959650002001973650001501993650002202008650002102030650001802051650000902069650002202078650001402100650002302114650001402137650003102151650002602182650001302208650001502221653001202236653001302248653001102261653001402272653001902286653000802305653000802313700002202321700002002343700002102363700001702384700002702401773012102428856008302549852000902632655001202641IND60761831020221119114314.0220228e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076183102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1092532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpilsbury, Francis10aMultivariate analysis of otolith microchemistry can discriminate the source of oil contamination in exposed fish  aThe uptake of metals into the aragonite lattice of the fish otolith (ear-bone) has been used for decades as a historical record of exposure to metals in polluted environments. The relative abundance of two metals in particular, Ni and V, are used in forensic chemical analysis of crude oils to assist in confirming its origin. In this study we investigate the potential for metal accumulation in otoliths to act as a biomarker of exposure to crude oil. Using a 33-day static-renewal laboratory trial design, 56 juvenile Lates calcarifer (commonly known as Asian seabass or barramundi) were fed diets enriched with V (20 mg/kg), Ni (500 mg/kg), Fe (500 mg/kg), and two crude oils with distinctly different metals profiles: a heavy fuel oil (1% w/w) and a typical Australian medium crude (1% w/w). Fish exposed to crude oils showed Ba and Al retained in otoliths in a dose-dependent manner, but fish fed V-, Ni- and Fe-enriched diets showed no metal increase in otoliths, indicating that V, Ni and Fe are not incorporated into the otolith of L. calcarifer via dietary exposure. For crude oils, incorporation into otolith for many metals is likely limited due to porphyrin casing reducing their bioavailability. Principal components analysis (PCA) and subsequent linear discriminatory analysis (LDA) of selected otolith metals demonstrated that, even despite large variability in the metal abundances detected in otolith between individuals within the test groups (cv = 1.00), it is possible to discriminate between fish exposed to different crude oils using multivariate analysis of their otolith microchemistry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLates calcarifer 3aaragonite 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3achemical analysis 3adietary exposure 3adose response 3afish 3aforensic sciences 3afuel oils 3ahistorical records 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory experimentation 3amultivariate analysis 3aotoliths 3aporphyrins 0aOtolith 0aVanadium 0aNickel 0aCrude oil 0aHeavy fuel oil 0aPCA 0aLDA1 aMcDonald, Bradley1 aRankenburg, Kai1 aEvans, Noreen J.1 aGrice, Kliti1 aGagnon, Marthe Monique0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Apr., v. 254 p.109253-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1092533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009700164300001600261520065900277592002800936650002100964650001600985650001401001650001901015650002601034650002301060650001901083650001701102650000901119650002501128650001401153650003001167650006501197650002101262653001101283653002101294653001401315653005301329700002001382700002101402700001601423700001701439700001301456700001501469700001701484700002001501700001601521773010901537856008301646852000901729655001201738IND60535164120221120044906.0190411e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053516412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hua-tao10aDetection of Anaplasma platys in dogs using real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification  ap. 468-470.  aAnaplasma platys is a parasite of canine platelets that causes infectious cyclic thrombocytopenia. In this study, a novel real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method was developed to detect A. platys. RT-LAMP primer sets were designed using a citrate synthase gene sequence and the assay was performed at 63°C for 30min. No cross-reactivity was observed with other Anaplasma or Ehrlichia spp. and the method exhibited a similar level of sensitivity in detecting the organism in 58 canine blood samples to that of a nested PCR. This RT-LAMP is a rapid and potentially cost-effective method of diagnosing A. platys infection in dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma platys 3aDNA primers 3aEhrlichia 3ablood sampling 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3acost effectiveness 3across reaction 3adog diseases 3adogs 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification 3athrombocytopenia 0aCanine 0aAnaplasma platys 0agltA gene 0aReal-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification1 aSun, Ling-suang1 aChen, Zhong-ming1 aHu, Jing-si1 aYe, Cun-dong1 aJia, Kun1 aWang, Heng1 aYuan, Li-guo1 aZhang, Gui-hong1 aLi, Shoujun0 tveterinary journal.g2014 Mar., v. 199, no. 3 p.468-470dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245012100162520106700283592002801350650001601378650001901394650002401413650001401437650002701451650002001478650002001498650002601518650001401544650002801558650002501586650001501611653003401626653001401660653002901674653002801703653002401731700001901755700001901774700001601793773012101809856008301930852000902013655001202022IND60761831120221119113952.0220228e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076183112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1092542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Yu10a5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde induces developmental toxicology and decreases bone mineralization in zebrafish larvae  aIn this study, we aimed to assess the developmental toxicity and effects of 5-HMF in zebrafish as a model organism for toxicology studies. To this end, we treated zebrafish embryos with 1–100 μg/ml 5-HMF and observed bone staining, gene expression, and reactive oxygen species levels in order to investigate the toxicological effects of 5-HMF. The results showed that high concentrations of 5-HMF caused increased mortality and deformity rates in zebrafish larvae, inhibited cartilage development, reduced bone mineralization, increased reactive oxygen species levels, and disrupted the expression of genes related to bone development and reactive oxygen species enzyme activity. The antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine partially rescued the toxicological effects caused by the high concentrations of 5-HMF. Overall, these findings showed that high concentrations of 5-HMF induce reactive oxygen species production, leading to developmental toxicity and decreased bone mineralization. Our results provide a reference for understanding the toxic effects of 5-HMF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aacetylcysteine 3abone mineralization 3acartilage 3adevelopmental toxicity 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amortality 3areactive oxygen species 3askeletal development 3atoxicology 0a5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde 0aZebrafish 0aDevelopmental toxicology 0aReactive oxygen species 0aBone mineralization1 aZhong, Zhaomin1 aWang, Mingyong1 aZhang, Xian0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2022 Apr., v. 254 p.109254-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12414x1532-04567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2021.1092543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012400172520139400296592002801690650002001718650001601738650001001754650001201764650001201776650002001788650001101808650001701819650002001836650001101856650001301867650001001880650001301890650002301903650001201926651001001938653003001948653002401978653002502002700001402027700002002041700001902061700001502080700001802095700002002113773009902133856009002232852000902322655001202331IND60677515720221117033005.0200210e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067751572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7347962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Karsoon10aSeasonal variation of total carotenoids content in the tissues of male and female golden noble scallops Chlamys nobilis  aThe noble scallop Chlamys nobilis is an economically important edible marine bivalve that has been cultivated in the Southern Sea of China since the 1980s. Noble scallops, particularly the golden scallops, are rich in carotenoids, are of interest for their potential beneficial uses in human healthcare, food processing and pharmaceuticals. However, very little is known about the seasonal variation of total carotenoids content (TCC) in the golden scallops. Therefore, present study was conducted to determine the seasonal variation of TCC in the tissues of male and female of golden scallops. The results of present study revealed that the TCC in adductor, mantle and gonads of golden scallops were ranged from 16.79 to 138.86 μg/ g, 92.86 to 312.98 μg/ g, and 71.5 to 750.0 μg/ g, respectively. Generally, the gonads of golden scallops contain the highest TCC, followed by the mantle and adductor. In comparison of male and female scallops, TCC in the same tissue (except for gonad) was not statistically significant. However, female gonads contain much higher TCC than male gonads. The temporal variation of the TCC in golden scallops showed the highest in March to April and the lowest in October. The findings of current study can be very useful for scallop farmers and industry to determine the best harvest time to obtain the highest quality of golden scallops with high TCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamys nobilis 3acarotenoids 3adrugs 3afarmers 3afemales 3afood processing 3agonads 3aharvest date 3ahealth services 3ahumans 3aindustry 3amales 3ascallops 3aseasonal variation 3atissues 3aChina 0aTotal carotenoids content 0aSeasonal variations 0aGolden noble scallop1 aLiu, Helu1 aZhang, Hongkuan1 aLim, Leongseng1 aMa, Hongyu1 aLi, Shengkang1 aZheng, Huaiping0 tAquaculture.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 518 p.734796-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7347963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012000172300001800292520173000310592002802040650000802068650001002076650002102086650002302107650001302130650001302143650003002156650001202186650001502198700002102213700001602234700002202250773010102272856008102373852000902454655001202463IND60129890620221120043609.0150503e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012989062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-011-1408-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChacon-Cortes, Diego10aComparison of genomic DNA extraction techniques from whole blood samples: a time, cost and quality evaluation study  ap. 5961-5966.  aGenomic DNA obtained from patient whole blood samples is a key element for genomic research. Advantages and disadvantages, in terms of time-efficiency, cost-effectiveness and laboratory requirements, of procedures available to isolate nucleic acids need to be considered before choosing any particular method. These characteristics have not been fully evaluated for some laboratory techniques, such as the salting out method for DNA extraction, which has been excluded from comparison in different studies published to date. We compared three different protocols (a traditional salting out method, a modified salting out method and a commercially available kit method) to determine the most cost-effective and time-efficient method to extract DNA. We extracted genomic DNA from whole blood samples obtained from breast cancer patient volunteers and compared the results of the product obtained in terms of quantity (concentration of DNA extracted and DNA obtained per ml of blood used) and quality (260/280 ratio and polymerase chain reaction product amplification) of the obtained yield. On average, all three methods showed no statistically significant differences between the final result, but when we accounted for time and cost derived for each method, they showed very significant differences. The modified salting out method resulted in a seven- and twofold reduction in cost compared to the commercial kit and traditional salting out method, respectively and reduced time from 3 days to 1 hour compared to the traditional salting out method. This highlights a modified salting out method as a suitable choice to be used in laboratories and research centres, particularly when dealing with a large number of samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablood 3abreast neoplasms 3acost effectiveness 3agenomics 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asalting 3avolunteers1 aHaupt, Larisa M.1 aLea, Rod A.1 aGriffiths, Lyn R.0 tMolecular biology reports.g2012 May, v. 39, no. 5 p.5961-5966dSpringer-Verlagx0301-48517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-011-1408-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245006300156300001800219500002000237500001500257520161300272592002801885650001001913650003301923650002501956650001301981650002401994650001202018650001302030650002202043650001502065650001902080650000902099650001602108650001002124651001802134651001502152653001802167700002402185773009902209856007102308852000902379655001202388IND60569964720221118134754.0170626e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056996472DNAL7 a10.1890/02-07892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoe, Sharon J.10aWater availability affects clutch size in a desert sparrow  ap. 3240-3249.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aBirds that breed in hot, arid environments experience unique physiological demands resulting from efforts to maintain positive water balance when ambient temperatures are high, but humidity and water availability are low. We provided water to Black‐throated Sparrows (Amphispiza bilineata) on breeding territories in the Mojave Desert of southern California to examine the effects of water availability on reproduction in desert birds, independent of the increase in food availability commonly associated with increased precipitation in arid ecosystems. In both years of the study (2000 and 2001), water‐supplemented (treatment) pairs laid significantly larger clutches than did control pairs. In 2000, the drier of the two years, the mean clutch size of treatment pairs was almost 0.5 egg larger, or about 16% larger, than control pairs. Overall, the mean egg volume per nest in treatment and control pairs was not significantly different, and the mean proportion of eggs hatched was not significantly different at α = 0.05, but was nearly so. Daily nest survival probabilities were not greater in treatment nests than in control nests in 2000 or in 2001. Treatment nests did not produce a greater mean number of young surviving to day 8 than did control nests, although the trend is of greater means in treatment nests. The results of our study indicate that for species like the Black‐throated Sparrow that are abundant in deserts, are successful in breeding there, and can survive without drinking water, water availability in arid environments can nevertheless impose limitations on reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3anests 3adry environmental conditions 3aAmphispiza bilineata 3abreeding 3aambient temperature 3adeserts 3ahumidity 3afood availability 3aecosystems 3adrinking water 3aeggs 3aclutch size 3abirds 3aMojave Desert 3aCalifornia 0awater balance1 aRotenberry, John T.0 tEcology.g2003 Dec., v. 84, no. 12 p.3240-3249dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-07893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03785naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245012700181300001600308500001500324520169400339592002802033650003702061650002202098650002302120650001002143650001602153650002102169650001302190650002802203650002202231650001902253650001102272650002702283650002502310650001802335650001602353650002002369650001202389650002502401650001302426650001102439653000802450653000802458653003202466653000802498653001802506653002602524653000802550653000802558653005002566653000802616653000902624653000802633653001002641653000802651653000702659653002102666653001702687653000902704653001002713700002402723700002502747700003102772700002102803773012202824856008402946852000903030655001203039IND60541404020221119140625.0190318e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054140402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2013.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía Sánchez, Mercedes,10aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi alleviate oxidative stress induced by ADOR and enhance antioxidant responses of tomato plants  ap. 421-428.  a2019-12-06  aThe behaviour of tomato plants inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi grown in the presence of aqueous extracts from dry olive residue (ADOR) was studied in order to understand how this symbiotic relationship helps plants to cope with oxidative stress caused by ADOR. The influence of AM symbiosis on plant growth and other physiological parameters was also studied. Tomato plants were inoculated with the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae and were grown in the presence of ADOR bioremediated and non-bioremediated by Coriolopsis floccosa and Penicillium chrysogenum-10. The antioxidant response as well as parameters of oxidative damage were examined in roots and leaves. The data showed a significant increase in the biomass of AM plant growth in the presence of ADOR, regardless of whether it was bioremediated. The establishment and development of the symbiosis were negatively affected after plants were exposed to ADOR. No differences were observed in the relative water content (RWC) or PS II efficiency between non-AM and AM plants. The increase in the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) were simultaneous to the reduction of MDA levels and H2O2 content in AM root growth in the presence of ADOR. Similar H2O2 levels were observed among non-AM and AM plants, although only AM plants showed reduced lipid peroxidation content, probably due to the involvement of antioxidant enzymes. The results highlight how the application of both bioremediated ADOR and AM fungi can alleviate the oxidative stress conditions, improving the growth and development of tomato plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3alipid peroxidation 3aroots 3aPenicillium 3aoxidative stress 3atomatoes 3aglutathione transferase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aGlomus mosseae 3aleaves 3agrowth and development 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater content 3aroot growth 3aenzyme activity 3abiomass 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3aolives 0aTBA 0aDOR 0aAntioxidant defense enzymes 0aCAT 0aSaprobe fungi 0aFunneliformis mosseae 0aMDA 0aROS 0aAqueous extract from dry olive residue (ADOR) 0aGST 0aADOR 0aRWC 0aO2− 0aGSH 0aAM 0aOxidative stress 0aantioxidants 0aH2O2 0aPS II1 aPalma, José Manuel1 aOcampo, Juan Antonio1 aGarcía-Romera, Inmaculada1 aAranda, Elisabet0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 171, no. 6 p.421-428dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2013.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02488naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245016400173520148700337592002801824653002701852653001801879653003001897653002801927700001401955700001701969700001401986773009902000856009002099852000902189655001202198IND60677515820221117033117.0200330e20200330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067751582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7347972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jinbin10aIdentification of two novel C-type lectins involved in immune defense against white spot syndrome virus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus from Marsupenaeus japonicus  aC-type lectins (CTLs) are vital molecules in crustacean innate immunity with the capacity to recognize and eliminate invaders, such as viruses and bacteria. Here, two novel CTLs were identified from the kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus, and their molecular characteristics and immune function were investigated. Sequence analysis revealed that the two CTLs possessed the typical CTL structure and function features. Tissue distribution analysis showed that the two CTLs were most abundantly expressed in the hepatopancreas and weakly expressed in other examined tissues. The transcription of the two CTLs significantly increased in the hepatopancreas of shrimp challenged with both white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and MjCTL4 was found to be more sensitive to the two pathogens than MjCTL3, being induced at relatively faster and higher increments. GST pull-down assays showed that the two CTLs could directly interact with several WSSV envelope proteins (VP19, VP24, VP26 and VP28). Moreover, the two CTLs displayed obvious binding and antibacterial ability to V. parahaemolyticus, and MjCTL3 exhibited stronger anti-V. parahaemolyticus activity than MjCTL4. These results suggest that the two novel CTLs might function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and antibacterial molecules in M. japonicus innate immunity, and the two CTLs may be alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by WSSV and V. parahaemolyticus.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMarsupenaeus japonicus 0aC-type lectin 0aWhite spot syndrome virus 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus1 aMao, Yong1 aSu, Yongquan1 aWang, Jun0 tAquaculture.g2020 Mar. 30, v. 519 p.734797-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7347973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011000164300001600274520153500290592002801825650003601853650001601889650001301905650001601918650002601934650001601960650002101976650001501997650001902012650002002031650001802051650000902069650001702078650001302095650001602108650001602124650004802140650002202188650002902210650001502239650002402254650002002278653001902298653001302317653001102330653001602341653002902357773010902386856008302495852000902578655001202587IND60535164320221120044822.0190411e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053516432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloom, Paul10aCanine superficial bacterial folliculitis: Current understanding of its etiology, diagnosis and treatment  ap. 217-222.  aSuperficial bacterial folliculitis (SBF) is more common in the dog than other mammalian species. Until recently, a successful outcome in cases of canine SBF was possible by administering a potentiated amoxicillin, a first generation cephalosporin or a potentiated sulfonamide. Unfortunately, this predictable susceptibility has changed, because methicillin resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are becoming more prevalent in canine SBF cases. The increasing frequency of multidrug resistance complicates the selection of antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobial agents that were once rarely used in cases of canine SBF, such as amikacin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol, are becoming the drugs of choice, based on bacterial culture and susceptibility testing. Furthermore, changes in antimicrobial susceptibility have helped to re-emphasize the importance of a multimodal approach to treatment of the disease, including topical therapy. Due to the increasing frequency of identification of highly resistant Staphylococcus spp., topical antimicrobial therapy, including the use of diluted sodium hypochlorite (bleach), is becoming necessary to successfully treat some cases of canine SBF. Other important antiseptics that can be used include chlorhexidine, benzoyl peroxide, ethyl lactate, triclosan and boric acid/acetic acid. This review discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic management of canine SBF, with a special emphasis on treating methicillin resistant staphylococcal infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus pseudintermedius 3aacetic acid 3aamikacin 3aamoxicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantiseptics 3ableaching agents 3aboric acid 3acephalosporins 3achloramphenicol 3achlorhexidine 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3aetiology 3alactic acid 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amicrobial culture 3amultiple drug resistance 3arifampicin 3asodium hypochlorite 3atopical therapy 0aStaphylococcus 0aPyoderma 0aCanine 0aMethicillin 0aAntimicrobial resistance0 tveterinary journal.g2014 Feb., v. 199, no. 2 p.217-222dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl55231x1090-02337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009100168500002200259520169200281592002801973650001502001650001702016650002502033650002202058650001602080650001002096650001202106650001602118650001402134650000902148650001302157650001202170650001102182650002002193653001702213653001002230653001902240653002802259700001302287700001902300700001402319700001402333700001402347700001502361700001402376700001902390700001702409700001902426700005702445773009702502856008202599852000902681655001202690IND60563649520221123002732.0170713s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056364952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lingling10aLoss of FKBP5 impedes adipocyte differentiation under both normoxia and hypoxic stress  aPre-press version  aFK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is one of the most important regulators in the GR-mediated stress response, and we previously demonstrated that loss of FKBP5 arrests adipogenesis and renders mice resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO). However, the exact role of FKBP5 in the process of adipocyte differentiation under hypoxic conditions (the common microenvironment where adipocytes reside in obese individuals) is still unclear. Here, by isolating and culturing WT- and Fkbp5-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and treat them at normal oxygen environment (21% O2, nomorxia) or low oxygen environment (5% O2, hypoxia). Enhanced adipogenesis were observed at hypoxia when compared to normal oxygen environment. The loss of FKBP5 significantly prevents the adipogenesis from KO MEFs under nomorxia condition, with subtle enhancement of adipogenesis at hypoxia condition, which is similar as observed in WT-MEFs at hypoxia condition but with obvious enhancement of adipogenesis. Importantly, the protein level of FKBP5 reduced in undifferentiated MEFs under acute hypoxic stress (24 h), but drastically increased during the mid-late stage of adipocyte (Day 6) differentiation from WT-MEFs under chronic hypoxia. Furthermore, we find under normal and hypoxic conditions that FKBP5 deletion alters the expression profile of adipogenesis-related genes, including those involved in lipogenesis, lipolysis, and energy metabolism, which partially explains the compromised adipocyte differentiation in FKBP51-KO MEFs. Taken together, our findings identify a novel role of FKBP5 in hypoxia-regulated adipogenesis, and provide a candidate for anti-obesity strategies targeting FKBP51.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aanaerobic conditions 3aenergy metabolism 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3alipogenesis 3alipolysis 3amice 3anormoxia 3aobesity 3aoxygen 3astress response 0aAdipogenesis 0aFKBP5 0aHypoxic stress 0aGlucocorticoid receptor1 aQiu, Bin1 aWang, Tingting1 aWang, Jun1 aLiu, Ming1 aXu, Yuxue1 aWang, Chao1 aDeng, Ran1 aWilliams, Kent1 aYang, Zhiwei1 aLiang, Tiebing1 aYong, Weidong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9347-38210 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245010300192300001600295500002000311520172200331592002802053650001602081650002602097650001202123650002602135650002602161700002202187773009602209856010702305852000902412655001202421IND60569964820221118134757.0170626e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056996482DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0511:CAOPCA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Marti J.10aCanonical analysis of principal coordinates: a useful method of constrained ordination for ecology  ap. 511-525.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA flexible method is needed for constrained ordination on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure, which will display a cloud of multivariate points by reference to a specific a priori hypothesis. We suggest the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCO, metric MDS), followed by either a canonical discriminant analysis (CDA, when the hypothesis concerns groups) or a canonical correlation analysis (CCorA, when the hypothesis concerns relationships with environmental or other variables), to provide a flexible and meaningful constrained ordination of ecological species abundance data. Called “CAP” for “Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates,” this method will allow a constrained ordination to be done on the basis of any distance or dissimilarity measure. We describe CAP in detail, including how it can uncover patterns that are masked in an unconstrained MDS ordination. Canonical tests using permutations are also given, and we show how the method can be used (1) to place a new observation into the canonical space using only interpoint dissimilarities, (2) to classify observations and obtain misclassification or residual errors, and (3) to correlate the original variables with patterns on canonical plots. Misclassification error or residual error is used to obtain a non‐arbitrary decision concerning the appropriate dimensionality of the response data cloud (number of PCO axes) for the ensuing canonical analysis. We suggest that a CAP ordination and an unconstrained ordination, such as MDS, together will provide important information for meaningful multivariate analyses of ecological data by reference to explicit a priori hypotheses.

It is suggested that this study be conducted with greater number of livestock, different sexes, different ages and different physiological stages in different breeds of goats in order to reach a comprehensive conclusion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aactin 3aadipocytes 3abackfat 3abrain 3acell growth 3agene expression 3agoats 3akidneys 3aliver 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3apoultry 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3askeletal muscle 3aspleen 0adlk1 0agene expression 0araini cashmere goat 0atissue0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2019 Nov., v. 11, no. 3 p.191-205dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2019.24813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012300164300001600287520178100303592002802084650001502112650001702127650001302144650001702157650001602174650002202190650001302212650003902225650001602264650001802280650001402298700002502312700001702337700001502354700001602369700001502385773007802400856008402478852000902562655001202571IND60087200720221120030300.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008720072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2011.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, A.10aDistribution of 5S and 45S rDNA sites in plants with holokinetic chromosomes and the “chromosome field” hypothesis  ap. 625-631.  aSecondary constrictions or 45S rDNA sites are commonly reported to be located mainly in the terminal regions of the chromosomes. This distribution has been assumed to be related to the existence of a “chromosome field” lying between the centromere and the telomere, an area in which certain cytogenetic events may predominantly occur. If this hypothesis is true this distribution should not be observed in holokinetic chromosomes, as they do not have a localized centromere. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, a comparative study was made of the distributions of 5S and 45S rDNA sites using fluorescence in situ hybridization in representatives of the genera Eleocharis, Diplacrum, Fimbristylis, Kyllinga and Rhynchospora, all of which belong to the family Cyperaceae. The numbers of sites per diploid chromosome complement varied from 2 to ∼10 for 5S rDNA, and from 2 to ∼45 for 45S rDNA. All of the 11 species analyzed had terminally located 45S rDNA sites on the chromosomes whereas the 5S rDNA sites also generally had terminal distributions, except for the Rhynchospora species, where their position was almost always interstitial. These results, together with other previously published data, suggest that the variation in the number and position of the rDNA sites in species with holokinetic chromosomes is non-random and similar to that reported for species with monocentric chromosomes. Therefore, the predominant terminal position of the 45S rDNA sites does not appear to be influenced by the centromere–telomere polarization as suggested by the “chromosome field” hypothesis. Additionally, the hybridization of 5S and 45S rDNA sites provides interesting markers to distinguish several chromosomes on the rather symmetrical karyotypes of Cyperaceae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleocharis 3aFimbristylis 3aKyllinga 3aRhynchospora 3acentromeres 3achromosome number 3adiploidy 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3akaryotyping 3aribosomal DNA 3atelomeres1 aBarros e Silva, A.E.1 aCuadrado, A.1 aLoarce, Y.1 aAlves, M.V.1 aGuerra, M.0 tMicron.g2011 Aug., v. 42, no. 6 p.625-631dElsevier Ltdx0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2011.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002300173245006600196300001600262520124000278592002801518650001201546650001401558650001301572650002501585650002001610650004401630650001101674650002401685650003601709650003801745651001801783700001901801700001901820700002301839773010701862856005501969852000902024655001202033IND50064711720221119044317.0130408e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006471172DNAL7 a235516462pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.2012.00420.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasey, Michelle M.10aRural Relevant Quality Measures for Critical Access Hospitals  ap. 159-171.  aPurpose: To identify current and future relevant quality measures for Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs). Methods: Three criteria (patient volume, internal usefulness for quality improvement, and external usefulness for public reporting and payment reform) were used to analyze quality measures for their relevance for CAHs. A 6‐member panel with expertise in rural hospital quality measurement and improvement provided input regarding the final measure selection. Findings: The relevant quality measures for CAHs include measures that are ready for reporting now and measures that need specifications to be finalized and/or a data reporting mechanism to be established. They include inpatient measures for specific medical conditions, global measures that address appropriate care across multiple medical conditions, and Emergency Department measures. Conclusions: All CAHs should publicly report on relevant quality measures. Acceptance of a single consolidated set of quality measures with common specifications for CAHs by all entities involved in regulation, accreditation, and payment; a phased process to implement the relevant measures; and the provision of technical assistance would help CAHs meet the challenge of reporting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperts 3ahospitals 3apatients 3aqualitative analysis 3arural hospitals 2aHospitals, Ruralxeconomicsxstandards. 2aHumans 2aMedicarexstandards 2aQuality Indicators, Health Care 2aQuality of Health Carexstandards 0aUnited States1 aMoscovice, Ira1 aKlingner, Jill1 aPrasad, Shailendra0 tJournal of rural health.g2013 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.159-171dBlackwell Publishing Incx0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.2012.00420.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245013100163300001600294520137200310592002801682650001601710650002601726650001901752650002201771650001501793650001101808650001701819653001001836653001501846653001901861653003001880653002401910700001401934700001401948700002701962773012101989856008002110852000902190655001202199IND60560868720221119172309.0170111e20170111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056086872DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b147462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jun Song10aRational Design of Self-Supported Ni3S2 Nanosheets Array for Advanced Asymmetric Supercapacitor with a Superior Energy Density  ap. 496-504.  aWe report a rationally designed two-step method to fabricate self-supported Ni₃S₂ nanosheet arrays. We first used 2-methylimidazole (2-MI), an organic molecule commonly served as organic linkers in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), to synthesize an α-Ni(OH)₂ nanosheet array as a precursor, followed by its hydrothermal sulfidization into Ni₃S₂. The resulting Ni₃S₂ nanosheet array demonstrated superior supercapacitance properties, with a very high capacitance of about 1,000 F g–¹ being delivered at a high current density of 50 A g–¹ for 20,000 charge–discharge cycles. This performance is unparalleled by other reported nickel sulfide-based supercapacitors and is also advantageous compared to other nickel-based materials such as NiO and Ni(OH)₂. An asymmetric supercapacitor was then established, exhibiting a very stable capacitance of about 200 F g–¹ at a high current density of 10 A g–¹ for 10,000 cycles and a surprisingly high energy density of 202 W h kg–¹. This value is comparable to that of the lithium-ion batteries, i.e., 180 W h kg–¹. The potential of the material for practical applications was evaluated by building a quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor which showed good flexibility and power output, and two of these devices connected in series were able to power up 18 green light-emitting diodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy density 3alithium batteries 3ananosheets 3anickel 3anickel oxide 0aNi3S2 0ananosheets 0aself-supported 0aasymmetric supercapacitor 0ahigh energy density1 aGuan, Cao1 aGui, Yang1 aBlackwood, Daniel John0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Jan. 11, v. 9, no. 1 p.496-504dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b147463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245017500176520133900351592002801690650001701718650002801735650002501763650001401788653003601802653003301838653003301871653001401904653002001918700003001938700002101968700001801989700002502007700002402032700002502056700006602081773011102147856008602258852000902344655001202353IND60761831520221119114241.0220207e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076183152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1230912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasih Ramandi, Negin10aStudy of Glutathione S-transferase-P1 in cancer blood plasma after extraction by affinity magnetic nanoparticles and monitoring by MALDI-TOF, IM-Q-TOF and LC-ESI-Q-TOF MS  aGlutathione S-transferase P1 (GST-P1) is considered as a detoxification enzyme and can be upregulated in several cancers. Therefore, qualification and/or quantification of GST-P1 in biological fluids can be noteworthy in cancer diagnostic and/or prognostic methods. Whereas costly immunoassays methods are routinely used for clinical analysis, long analysis time per sample is still considered as their disadvantages. To create a fast, efficient, and economical GST-P1 qualification and/or quantification technique, we developed an affinity magnetic nanoparticle-MS method. In proposed method there is no need for any pretreatment for reducing the complexity of sample and depletion of high abundant proteins that are used in routinely immunoassays methods. After enrichment of GST-P1 from blood plasma samples by affinity magnetic nanoparticle (without any pretreatment), the final eluent was analyzed using MALDI-TOF, IM-Q-TOF and LC-ESI-Q-TOF MS. For the first time this study demonstrates the suitability of affinity magnetic nanoparticle-MS method for qualification/quantification of GST-P1 from acute lymphoblastic leukemia blood plasma samples with the limit-of-detection 0.0094 ppm in less than 5 h. Our finding showed that in these blood plasma samples the level of GST-P1 can be up to six times more than healthy children.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood plasma 3aglutathione transferase 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amagnetism 0aAffinity magnetic nanoparticles 0aGlutathione S-transferase P1 0aAcute lymphoblastic leukemia 0aBiomarker 0aTOF MS analysis1 aSoleimani Mashhadi, Ilnaz1 aSharif, Amirreza1 aSaeedi, Negar1 aAshabi, Mohammad Ali1 aFaranoush, Mohammad1 aGhassempour, Alireza1 aAboul-Enein, Hassan Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0249-70090 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 1190 p.123091-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2021.1230913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245005100182300001600233500000900249520049000258592002800748650001300776650001200789650001300801650001100814700001900825700001900844773014900863856009601012852000901108655001201117IND60668509220221120121008.0191125e196809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066850922DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1968.03615995003200050042x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorchardt, G.

A decrease in the osmotic pressure of the medium resulted in considerable water loss, stomatal closure and a decreased CO2 assimilation rate for the wheat genotypes, while the changes in these parameters were moderate for the amphiploids. Maximal assimilation rate was maintained at high level even under severe osmotic stress in the amphiploids, while it decreased substantially in the wheat genotypes. Nevertheless, the effective quantum yield of PS II was higher and the quantum yield of non-photochemical quenching of PS II and PS I was lower for the amphiploids than for the wheat cultivars. Parallel with this, higher cyclic electron flow was detected in wheat than in the amphiploids. The elevated photosynthetic activity of amphiploids under osmotic stress conditions was manifested in higher biomass production by roots and shoots as compared to wheat genotypes. These results indicate that the drought-tolerant traits of Ae. biuncialis can be manifested in the wheat genetic background and these amphiploids are suitable genetic materials for improving drought tolerance of wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass production 3acarbon dioxide 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3agenetic background 3aosmotic pressure 3aosmotic stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aroots 3ashoots 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3awater content 3awheat 0aA 0aAL 0aAmphi 0aCi 0aFISH 0aFm 0aFm′ 0aF0 0aF 0aFv 0aFv/Fm 0aΔF/Fm′ 0aGISH 0ags 0aLm 0aLs 0aNPQ 0aΨ 0aPEG 0aP0 0aPm 0aPm′ 0aPS I 0aPS II 0aRubisco 0aRWC 0aY 0aY(I) 0aY(NA) 0aY(NO) 0aY(NPQ) 0aAegilops biuncialis 0aCereals 0aOsmotic stress 0aPhotosynthesis 0aWheat1 aMolnár, István,1 aSzopkó, Dóra1 aDarkó, Éva1 aVojtkó, András1 aSass-Gyarmati, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2036-02761 aMolnár-Láng, Márta0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 171, no. 7 p.509-517dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2013.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03876naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003300153245014200186300001600328500001100344520235200355592002802707650001902735650001302754650001102767650002202778650001402800650001402814650002602828650001502854650001202869650002202881650001602903650001402919650001502933650001302948650001402961651001002975700001702985700001503002700002203017700001303039700001303052700001903065700002003084700001303104700001703117700001603134773008803150856008703238852000903325655001203334IND60112036220221119204013.0141110e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011203622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenton, M. J.q(Michael J.),10aExceptional vertebrate biotas from the Triassic of China, and the expansion of marine ecosystems after the Permo-Triassic mass extinction  ap. 199-243.  aREVIEW  aThe Triassic was a time of turmoil, as life recovered from the most devastating of all mass extinctions, the Permo-Triassic event 252million years ago. The Triassic marine rock succession of southwest China provides unique documentation of the recovery of marine life through a series of well dated, exceptionally preserved fossil assemblages in the Daye, Guanling, Zhuganpo, and Xiaowa formations. New work shows the richness of the faunas of fishes and reptiles, and that recovery of vertebrate faunas was delayed by harsh environmental conditions and then occurred rapidly in the Anisian. The key faunas of fishes and reptiles come from a limited area in eastern Yunnan and western Guizhou provinces, and these may be dated relative to shared stratigraphic units, and their palaeoenvironments reconstructed. The Luoping and Panxian biotas, both from the Guanling Formation, are dated as Anisian (Pelsonian) on the basis of conodonts and radiometric dates, the former being slightly older than the latter. The Xingyi biota is from the Zhuganpo Formation, and is Ladinian or early Carnian, while the Guanling biota is from the overlying Xiaowa Formation, dated as Carnian. The first three biotas include extensive benthos and burrowing in the sediments, and they were located in restricted basins close to shore. Further, even though the Luoping and Panxian biotas are of similar age, their faunas differ significantly, reflecting perhaps palaeogeographically isolated basins. Between the time of the Xingyi and Guanling biotas, there was a major transgression, and the Guanling biota is entirely different in character from the other three, being dominated by pelagic forms such as large floating crinoids attached to logs, very large ichthyosaurs and thalattosaurs, and pseudoplanktonic bivalves, with no benthos and no burrowing. Phylogenetic study of the fishes and marine reptiles shows apparently explosive diversification among 20 actinopterygian lineages very early in the Early Triassic, but a later expansion of marine reptile groups, in the late Olenekian and early Anisian. This offset in diversification patterns is matched by comparisons of feeding guild categories and body size data. New research tools will shed considerable light on the phylogenetic and ecological implications of recovery of mairne vertebrates in the Triassic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinopterygii 3aBivalvia 3abasins 3abenthic organisms 3abody size 3aburrowing 3aenvironmental factors 3aextinction 3afossils 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine fish 3aphylogeny 3aradiometry 3areptiles 3asediments 3aChina1 aZhang, Qiyue1 aHu, Shixue1 aChen, Zhong-Qiang1 aWen, Wen1 aLiu, Jun1 aHuang, Jinyuan1 aZhou, Changyong1 aXie, Tao1 aTong, Jinnan1 aChoo, Brian0 tEarth-science reviews.g2013 Oct., v. 125 p.199-243dElsevier B.V.x0012-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04372naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245015900176520256200335592002802897650002802925650002402953650001202977650001302989650001803002650000903020650001503029650002703044650000903071650001703080650001503097650002303112650001403135650001103149650004303160650001403203650002603217650002003243650001203263650001903275650001503294650001803309650001703327651001903344653001603363653001403379653001603393653001803409653002703427700002003454700002403474700002003498700002303518700001903541773009903560856009003659852000903749655001203758IND60677516220221117032623.0200210e20200225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067751622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7347912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarron, James M.10aEvaluation of effluent waste water from salmonid culture as a potential food and water supply for culturing larval Pacific lamprey Entosphenus tridentatus  aThe Pacific lamprey is an iconic native fish of great importance to the ecosystem and indigenous cultures in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Pacific lamprey populations have declined in abundance from historic levels, and conservation aquaculture has been proposed as a technique to restore these populations. The present research focused on expanding the culture methods for larval lamprey. The larvae filter feed and cohabitate with juvenile salmonids in the wild, therefore the effluent water from rearing salmonids may be a viable source of water and food for culturing lamprey. This approach could be a sustainable method for raising lamprey at existing salmonid hatcheries. A nine week trial investigated the effects of rearing in effluent water from salmonid culture on the growth, survival, proximate composition, and fatty acid profile of larval lamprey. This trial also explored the potential of this rearing strategy to improve the water quality by removing nutrients from the effluent. The trial included three treatments testing the use of the effluent from steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a conventional lamprey diet (control diet), or both combined as a means for rearing lamprey. A fourth treatment where lamprey were excluded served as a water quality control to test the effect of lamprey presence on effluent quality. Lamprey survival was not affected by treatment. Lamprey reared solely on the effluent waste matched the survival and growth of fish fed the conventional diet. Lamprey fed the combination treatment grew faster than the conventional diet fed fish. Whole body lipid levels were elevated in lamprey from the combination treatment relative to the conventional diet fed lamprey. Crude protein in the whole bodies of effluent fed lamprey was low compared to fish from either of the treatments where the conventional diet was fed. Lamprey offered the effluent nutrients were high in saturated fats relative to the control fed fish, which reflected the lipid profile of this diet. However, lamprey from the combination treatment were lower in long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids relative to the control or the effluent treatment lamprey. There was no measureable improvement in water quality due to the presence of lamprey, though lamprey were able to sequester approximately 1.3% of the effluent dry matter as lamprey biomass. Overall, it appears the larval stage of lamprey can be effectively reared on salmonid effluent, and this method provides superior growth when used in combination with a conventional lamprey diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntosphenus tridentatus 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abiomass 3abody fat 3acrude protein 3adiet 3aecosystems 3afatty acid composition 3afish 3afish culture 3ahatcheries 3aindigenous species 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3anutrients 3aproximate composition 3aquality control 3arearing 3asaturated fats 3awastewater 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aPacific States 0aLarval fish 0aAquafeeds 0aPolyculture 0aSerial re-use 0aEffluent water quality1 aHanson, Kyle C.1 aHeadley, Racheal R.1 aHawke, Kelli A.1 aTwibell, Ronald G.1 aGannam, Ann L.0 tAquaculture.g2020 Feb. 25, v. 517 p.734791-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.7347913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245009200176300001200268500001500280520145900295592002801754650002501782650002101807650001201828650001501840650000801855650002101863650001901884650002501903650001501928650001101943650002001954650002201974650001201996650002202008650001902030650001502049650001102064650002702075650001202102650001402114650002502128650002002153650002502173650001002198650001902208650001302227650001302240650001702253653002302270653001702293653001402310653002902324653001002353653002002363653001702383653002602400700002202426700001602448700001802464700001802482700002202500700001902522773008602541856008402627852000902711655001202720IND60557080120221116141854.0190403e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055708012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2016.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdnan, Muhammad Yousuf10aDesmostachya bipinnata manages photosynthesis and oxidative stress at moderate salinity  ap. 1-9.  a2019-12-06  aDesmostachya bipinnata is a C4 grass distributed in arid-saline lands of the subtropical region. There are many economic usages of this perennial grass ranging from folk-medicine to cattle-fodder. However, information regarding the mechanism of salinity tolerance of this species is rare. This study examines the effects of salinity (0, 200 and 400mM NaCl) on growth, osmotic relations, photosynthesis and antioxidant defense. Salinity caused progressive decrease in fresh weight; however, dry weight decreased only at 400mM NaCl. Leaf sap osmotic potential and xylem pressure potential decreased while quantities of ash, proline and sugars increased in response to salinity increments. Stomatal conductance, photosynthetic CO2 gain and transpiration decreased with increasing salinity, while intercellular CO2 levels remained unaffected. Maximum and actual quantum yield of PS II and electron transport rate were inhibited with enhanced non-photochemical quenching under high salinity. Levels of superoxide dismutase and total phenols increased, those of guaiacol peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase remained unaltered and catalase increased transiently at 200mM NaCl. Leaf hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde content increased with salinity. Our data suggest that D. bipinnata could maintain photosynthesis and manage oxidative stress at moderate salinity but a further increase in salinity compromised both photosynthesis and the antioxidant system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aosmotic pressure 3aphenols 3asubtropics 3asap 3aoxidative stress 3acarbon dioxide 3astomatal conductance 3aperennials 3asugars 3amalondialdehyde 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aproline 3aelectron transfer 3aphotosynthesis 3aperoxidase 3aleaves 3aDesmostachya bipinnata 3agrasses 3aC4 plants 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asodium chloride 3aantioxidant activity 3axylem 3asalt tolerance 3acatalase 3asalinity 3arare species 0aOsmotic adjustment 0aGas exchange 0aHalophyte 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aGrass 0aWater relations 0aantioxidants 0aAntioxidative defense1 aHussain, Tabassum1 aAsrar, Hina1 aHameed, Abdul1 aGul, Bilquees1 aNielsen, Brent L.1 aKhan, M.

Here, we introduce a deep neural network (DNN)-based computational framework, RegVar, that can accurately predict the tissue-specific impact of noncoding regulatory variants on target genes. We show that by robustly learning the genomic characteristics of massive variant-gene expression associations in a variety of human tissues, RegVar vastly surpasses all current noncoding variant prioritization methods in predicting regulatory variants under different circumstances. The unique features of RegVar make it an excellent framework for assessing the regulatory impact of any variant on its putative target genes in a variety of tissues.

On average, K accumulation in grain or residue at harvest was 68 and 34 kg K ha⁻¹ in soybean and 29 and 52 kg K ha⁻¹ in corn. The K accumulation increase from fertilization was more frequent and greater in residue than in grain (60 and 9% for soybean and 57 and 7% for corn). Potassium accumulated in vegetative tissue at PM that remained in residue 2 mo after harvest was 50% in corn and 19% in soybean and decreased to 31 and 12% by April. The K loss decreased as precipitation increased (R² 0.64 for soybean and 0.38 for corn) and affected more the K loss in soybean than corn. Soil test K increased from fall to spring, and the increase was related to the K lost from residue (r² 0.56 in soybean and 0.16 in corn). Crop type and precipitation strongly influenced K recycling and affected STK temporal variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aautumn 3acorn 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3apotassium 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3asoybeans 3aspring 3atemporal variation 3atissues 3aIowa1 aMallarino, Antonio P.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2015 Jan., v. 79, no. 1 p.314-327dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2014.07.02723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245011000183300001600293520153800309592002801847650002601875650002801901650001601929650002001945650001001965700003001975700002802005700002502033773007802058856008402136852000902220655001202229IND60087201220221120234134.0141102e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008720122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micron.2011.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavalcanti, Danielle Pereira14aThe structure of the kinetoplast DNA network of Crithidia fasciculata revealed by atomic force microscopy  ap. 553-559.  aDNA is the biopolymer most studied by scanning probe methods, and it is now possible to obtain reliable and reproducible images of DNA using atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM has been extensively used to elucidate morphological changes to DNA structure, such as the formation of knots, nicks, supercoiling and bends. The mitochondrial or kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of trypanosomatids is the most unusual DNA found in nature, being unique in organization and replication. The kDNA is composed of thousands of topologically interlocked DNA circles that form a giant network. To understand the biological significance of the kinetoplast DNA, it is necessary to learn more about its structure. In the present work, we used two procedures to prepare kDNA networks of Crithidia fasciculata for observation by AFM. Because AFM allows for the examination of kDNA at high resolution, we were able to identify regions of overlapping kDNA molecules and sites where several molecules cross. This found support the earlier described kDNA structural organization as composed by interlocked circles. We also observed an intricate high-density height pattern around the periphery of the network of C. fasciculata, which appears to be a bundle of DNA fibers that organizes the border of the network. Our present data confirm that AFM is a powerful tool to study the structural organization of biological samples, including complex arrays of DNA such as kDNA, and can be useful in revealing new details of structures previously visualized by other means.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrithidia fasciculata 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiopolymers 3akinetoplast DNA 3aknots1 aGonçalves, Daniela Leão1 aCosta, Lilian Terezinha1 aSouza, Wanderley de,0 tMicron.g2011 Aug., v. 42, no. 6 p.553-559dElsevier Ltdx0968-43287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micron.2011.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245010100208300001600309506010400325506007600429520092300505592002801428506003701456650001301493650000801506650001901514650002201533650001501555650001301570650001501583653003101598653001301629653001301642653001201655653001101667700005201678700006301730700005801793700005701851700005101908700006201959700006002021700005802081700006602139700006202205700006002267773012502327856008202452852000902534655001202543IND60761831920221207100343.0220502e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076183192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2021.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarmire, David G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6913-655010aGranatumX: A Community-engaging, Modularized, and Flexible Webtool for Single-cell Data Analysis  ap. 452-460.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe present GranatumX, a next-generation software environment for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis.

The time to hatching was inversely related to the incubation temperature (87, 100 and 111 h). Larval survival at the time of hatching was significantly lower at 30 °C (50.3 %), coinciding with the highest larval mortality (30.2 %). Growth rates were 1.75 mm d-1 - 10.4 % d-1 at 26 °C, 1.30 mm d-1 - 10.2 % d-1-1 at 28 °C and 1.40 mm d-1 -10 % d-1 at 30 °C. Three similar critical periods were identified: 0-6, 7-11 and 12-18 DAH. During the first period, a similar increase in weight and a significant increase in total length occurred, mainly at 30 °C, indicating a more efficient reconversion of the yolk reserves. Later, growth was equally slow, corresponding with the transitional period from endogenous to exogenous feeding, indicating a similar physiologic pattern regardless of incubation temperature. Weight and length increased during the last period, with the greatest increase at 26 °C in contrast with the lowest gain at 30 °C. The inflexion points of many morphometric characters and the developmental stages accelerated with the increasing temperature. Although it was impossible to determine the optimal temperature, it was evident that 26 °C favored hatching success and larval growth  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAtractosteus 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amorphometry 3amortality 3atemperature 0aFish larvae 0aincubation temperature 0agar 0ahatching 0aallometry 0adevelopment1 aHurtado García, Andrés,1 aCanabal, Javier1 aGarcía-Galano, Tsai0 tEcosistemas  recur. agropecuarios.(impresa).g2014 Jan., v. 1, no. 1 p.19-32dUniversidad Juárez Autónoma de TabascowJournal:27794x2007-901X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245008200163300001600245520115700261592002801418650002301446650001301469650000801482650001901490650003301509650002001542650001101562650001601573650001201589650001201601650002101613650001901634700001401653700001801667773008401685856007801769852000901847655001201856IND60340804620150901000000.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034080462DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2015000482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Guanqing10aEffect of NaCl addition on the freeze–thaw stability of tapioca starch gels  ap. 604-611.  aThe influence of NaCl (0–1.0 mol/L) on the freeze–thaw stability of tapioca starch (TS) gels was investigated by syneresis measurements, texture analysis, and thermal analysis. Furthermore, SEM images, the spin–spin relaxation time (T₂) and freezable water on TS during freeze–thaw cycles (FTCs) and zeta potential of TS gels was compared to research the possible reasons of the effect. NaCl reduced the syneresis percentage and hardness of TS gels. DSC experiments demonstrated that starch retrogradation was retarded by NaCl addition. Micrograph images revealed that increased NaCl concentrations decreased the size of ice crystal in the gels and led to fewer links within the starch matrix. The T₂ of the system with NaCl decreased more quickly than that without NaCl during FTCs. Moreover, the amount of freezable water in the starch and the zeta potential of the starch gels decreased with increasing NaCl concentrations; both retarded the association of starch molecules during FTCs. Thus, NaCl effectively preserved the quality of freeze‐thawed TS gels, and it might be used to preserve the quality of frozen TS‐based products.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ahardness 3aice 3aretrogradation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium chloride 3astarch 3astarch gels 3atapioca 3atexture 3athermal analysis 3azeta potential1 aHong, Yan1 aGu, Zhengbiao0 tStärke =.g2015 July, v. 67, no. 7-8 p.604-611dVerlag Chemiex0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2015000483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002400169245009300193300001600286500002000302520149300322592002801815650002301843650002501866650002401891650002001915650001801935650001301953650001001966650002201976650002301998650001102021650001002032650001002042650001402052650002502066650001202091650001802103650001402121650001202135650001102147650001402158651001302172700002402185773009602209856010702305852000902412655001202421IND60569965320221118134804.0170626e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056996532DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[0406:SPIFEP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Kenneth A.10aSongbird populations in fluctuating environments: predator responses to pulsed resources  ap. 406-415.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn response to mast production of acorns, populations of small mammals, such as the white‐footed mouse and eastern chipmunk, greatly increase and, in turn, initiate cascades of direct and indirect effects that permeate throughout forest communities. To examine the strength of the effects stemming from acorn crops, we conducted studies in oak‐dominated deciduous forest of the Hudson Valley, New York, documenting the connections between predator abundance (small mammals and raptors) and the abundance and reproductive success of five woodland songbirds. Nest predation rates increased at high rodent densities for Veeries, Red‐eyed Vireos, and Wood Thrushes. Analysis of Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data from surrounding counties demonstrated a unimodal relationship between rodent density (year t) and songbird abundance (year t + 1), rather than a monotonic decline. Regional Christmas Bird Count data for Sharp‐shinned and Cooper's Hawks showed a positive correlation between rodent density and accipiter abundance the following winter, suggesting that hawks exhibit a numerical response to rodents. Taken together, we suggest that predation by accipiters when rodents are scarce, in combination with high nest predation when rodents are abundant, may explain the unimodal relationship between rodents and songbirds. Nonlinear relationships between predator and prey abundance and indirect interactions appear to characterize this system. Corresponding Editor: J. R.

Winter wheat injury from MON 37500 applied preemergence (PRE) was slight and was influenced by cumulative precipitation for 10 d after application. Winter wheat injury was more frequent with early vs. late postemergence (POST) applications and was influenced by wheat growth stage and mean, high, and low air temperatures before and after application. Cheat control averaged 75%% (n == 16 treatments with four to six replicates) when applied PRE and 88%% (n == 126 treatments with four to six replicates) when applied POST. Cheat control from MON 37500 applied POST declined with increasing cheat growth stage at application and with decreasing mean diurnal low temperatures 0 to 14 d and 0 to 21 d before application. MON 37500 applied PRE increased yields 52 and 66%% compared with the untreated control in Year 1 and Year 2, averaged over eight experiments each year.

T. Ali et Thines has a wide distribution, ranging from the Alps to the Tien Shan  ap. 76-81.  aMicrothlaspi is a predominantly Eurasian genus which also occurs in the northernmost parts of Africa (Maghreb). The most widespread species of the genus is M. perfoliatum, which can be found from Sweden to Algeria and from Portugal to China. The other species are thought to have much more confined distribution ranges, often covering only a few hundred kilometres. This is also believed for the diploid M. erraticum, which was recently re-appraised as a taxon independent from the tetra- to hexaploid M. perfoliatum. Previously, M. erraticum was believed to be present only in Central Europe, from the East of France to Slovenia. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the ecology, evolution and migration history of Microthlaspi it was the focus of the current study to investigate, if M. erraticum is present in habitats outside Central Europe, but with microclimates similar to Central Europe. It is demonstrated that M. erraticum is much more widespread than previously thought, while other lineages apart from M. perfoliatum s.str. and M. erraticum seem to have restricted distribution ranges. The latter species was observed from the Alps and their foreland, the Balkans, the mountainous areas around the Black Sea, Southern Siberia, as well as the Altai and Tien Shan mountains. This demonstrates a widespread occurrence of this easily-overlooked species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicrothlaspi 3adiploidy 3ahabitats 3ahexaploidy 3amicroclimate 3amountains 3aAlgeria 3aAlps region 3aBalkans 3aBlack Sea 3aCentral European region 3aChina 3aFrance 3aMaghreb 3aPortugal 3aSiberia 3aSlovenia 3aSweden 0aBiogeography 0aColuteocarpeae 0aNoccaea 0aPhylogeny 0aSpecies complex 0aThlaspi perfoliatum1 aRunge, Fabian1 aDutbayev, Ayan1 aSchmuker, Angelika1 aSolovyeva, Irina1 aNigrelli, Lisa1 aBuch, Ann-Katrin1 aHsia, Hsiao-Chuan,1 aPloch, Sebastian1 aOrren, Ouria1 aKummer, Volker1 aPaule, Juraj1 aҪelik, Ali1 aVakhrusheva, Ljudmila1 aGabrielyan, Ivan1 aThines, Marco0 tFlora.g2016 Nov., v. 225 p.76-81dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl51878x0367-25307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.flora.2016.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245011200202300001400314506007600328520107400404506003701478650001801515650002101533650001501554650002201569650001201591650001201603650001301615650002701628650000901655650001101664700001601675700001501691700001701706700002301723700001501746700001501761700001301776700002301789700001701812700001901829700002201848700002201870700002501892700001701917700002301934700002301957700002301980700002502003700002002028700001902048700002402067700002402091773016802115852000902283856008302292930003302375946001302408655001202421IND4400006320221207071643.0080113e20080108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440000632DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07104241052doi7 aPMC22242122pmcid7 a181625402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Benfang10aBinding of rapamycin analogs to calcium channels and FKBP52 contributes to their neuroprotective activities  ap. 33-38.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRapamycin is an immunosuppressive immunophilin ligand reported as having neurotrophic activity. We show that modification of rapamycin at the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) binding region yields immunophilin ligands, WYE-592 and ILS-920, with potent neurotrophic activities in cortical neuronal cultures, efficacy in a rodent model for ischemic stroke, and significantly reduced immunosuppressive activity. Surprisingly, both compounds showed higher binding selectivity for FKBP52 versus FKBP12, in contrast to previously reported immunophilin ligands. Affinity purification revealed two key binding proteins, the immunophilin FKBP52 and the β1-subunit of L-type voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels (CACNB1). Electrophysiological analysis indicated that both compounds can inhibit L-type Ca²⁺ channels in rat hippocampal neurons and F-11 dorsal root ganglia (DRG)/neuroblastoma cells. We propose that these immunophilin ligands can protect neurons from Ca²⁺-induced cell death by modulating Ca²⁺ channels and promote neurite outgrowth via FKBP52 binding.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3acalcium channels 3acell death 3aelectrophysiology 3aganglia 3aligands 3aneurites 3aneuroprotective effect 3arats 3astroke1 aPong, Kevin1 aJow, Flora1 aBowlby, Mark1 aCrozier, Robert A.1 aLiu, Danni1 aLiang, Shi1 aChen, Yi1 aMercado, Mary Lynn1 aFeng, Xidong1 aBennett, Frann1 avon Schack, David1 aMcDonald, Leonard1 aZaleska, Margaret M.1 aWood, Andrew1 aReinhart, Peter H.1 aMagolda, Ronald L.1 aSkotnicki, Jerauld1 aPangalos, Menelas N.1 aKoehn, Frank E.1 aCarter, Guy T.1 aAbou-Gharbia, Magid1 aGraziani, Edmund I.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 8, v. 105, no. 1 p.33-38dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07104241053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03157naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011000166300001600276520161600292650002501908650002101933650001101954650001301965650002001978650001001998650002002008650001902028650002302047650002602070650001602096650001202112650002102124650002202145650001902167650001202186650003502198650001302233653001302246653001502259700001602274700001602290700001602306700001602322700002202338700001402360773007102374852000902445856009202454930003302546945001302579946001102592655001202603IND2202094320221121150331.0991228e199906  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220209432DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00480.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLejay, L.10aMolecular and functional regulation of two NO3- uptake systems by N- and C-status of Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 509-519.  aRoot NO(3)- uptake and expression of two root NO(3)- transporter genes (Nrt2;1 and Nrt1) were investigated in response to changes in the N- or C-status of hydroponically grown Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Expression of Nrt2;1 is up-regulated by NO(3)- starvation in wild-type plants and by N-limitation in a nitrate reductase (NR) deficient mutant transferred to NO(3)- as sole N source. These observations show that expression of Nrt2;1 is under feedback repression by N-metabolites resulting from NO(3)- reduction. Expression of Nrt1 is not subject to such a repression. However, Nrt1 is overexpressed in the NR mutant even under N-sufficient conditions (growth on NH(4)NO(3) medium), suggesting that expression of this gene is affected by the presence of active NR, but not by N-status of the plant. Root (15)NO(3)- influx is markedly increased in the NR mutant as compared to the wild-type. Nevertheless, both genotypes have similar net (15)NO(3)- uptake rates due to a much larger (14)NO(3)- efflux in the mutant than in the wild-type. Expressions of Nrt2;1 and Nrt1 are diurnally regulated in photosynthetically active A. thaliana plants. Both increase during the light period and decrease in the first hours of the dark period. Sucrose supply prevents the inhibition of Nrt2;1 and Nrt1 expressions in the dark. In all conditions investigated, Nrt2;1 expression is strongly correlated with root (15)NO(3)- influx at 0.2mM external concentration. In contrast, changes in the Nrt1 mRNA level are not always associated with similar changes in the activities of high- or low-affinity NO(3)- transport systems. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3anitrogen content 3acarbon 3anitrates 3anutrient uptake 3aroots 3agene expression 3aplant proteins 3anutrient solutions 3anutrient availability 3ametabolites 3amutants 3aisotope labeling 3adiurnal variation 3aphotosynthesis 3asucrose 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3agenotype 0afeedback 0aregulation1 aTillard, P.1 aLepetit, M.1 aOlive, F.D.1 aFilleur, S.1 aDaniel-Vedele, F.1 aGojon, A.0 tplant journal.g1999 June, v. 18, no. 5 p.509-519x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00480.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02657naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245012000201300001600321506007600337520112900413506003701542650002101579650002601600650001901626650001101645650001901656650001101675650001901686650001301705700001501718700001501733700002001748700001801768700002601786700003301812700002001845700001401865773017001879852000902049856008302058930003302141946001302174655001202187IND4400003020221207062958.0080113e20080108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440000302DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07109051052doi7 aPMC22241792pmcid7 a181625322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zenggang10aDown-regulation of 14-3-3ζ suppresses anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells through anoikis activation  ap. 162-167.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe family of 14-3-3 proteins has emerged as critical regulators of diverse cellular responses under both physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report an important role of 14-3-3ζ in tumorigenesis through a mechanism that involves anoikis resistance. 14-3-3ζ is up-regulated in a number of cancer types, including lung cancer. Through an RNAi approach using human lung adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells as a model system, we have found that knockdown of a single ζ isoform of 14-3-3 is sufficient to restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to anoikis and impair their anchorage-independent growth. Enhanced anoikis appears to be mediated in part by up-regulated BH3-only proteins, Bad and Bim, coupled with decreased Mcl-1, resulting in the subsequent activation of Bax. This study suggests a model in which anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells requires the presence of 14-3-3ζ. This work not only reveals a critical role of 14-3-3ζ in anoikis suppression in lung cancer cells, but also identifies and validates 14-3-3ζ as a potential molecular target for anticancer therapeutic development.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3aantineoplastic agents 3acarcinogenesis 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aproteins1 aZhao, Jing1 aDu, Yuhong1 aPark, Hae Ryoun1 aSun, Shi-Yong1 aBernal-Mizrachi, Leon1 aAitken, A.

Its pheromone is a blend of (2S,9S)-diacetoxyundecane, (2S,10S)-diacetoxyundecane and (2S)-acetoxyundecane. The pheromone is used in monitoring traps, and this study examines possible ways to optimise the traps.RESULTS: Two dispenser types were compared: polyethylene dispensers and cotton dispensers. Polyethylene dispensers attracted male C. nasturtii for more than 6 weeks, whereas cotton dispensers were attractive for only 2 weeks. All three pheromone components were important for attraction of male midges in the field. The importance of the stereoisomeric compositions of the pheromone compounds was also tested--both in the wind tunnel and in the field. In the case of 2,9-diacetoxyundecane and 2-acetoxyundecane, the non-natural stereoisomers did not inhibit male C. nasturtii attraction, whereas one or both of the stereoisomers of 2,10-diacetoxyundecane did.CONCLUSION: Pheromone traps with the synthetic pheromone in a 1:2:0.02 ratio emitted from PE dispensers were highly effective and long lasting. As the mixture of stereoisomers of 2,10-diacetoxyundecane strongly inhibited attraction of male C. nasturtii while those of 2,9-diacetoxyundecane and 2-acetoxyundecane did not have any inhibitory effect, it is possible to produce traps that are effective and long lasting but cheaper to produce and maintain. 3acotton 3ainsect pests 3adispensers 3awind tunnels 3ainsect pheromones 3amales 3aplant pests 3apheromone traps 3apolyethylene 3aContarinia nasturtii 3afield experimentation 3afemales 3astereoisomers 2aAnimals 2aCotton Fiber 2aDipteraxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPest Controlxeconomicsxmethods. 2aPheromonesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPolyethylenexchemistry 2aStereoisomerism 3aDenmark 0aoptimization 0aContarinia1 aSkals, Niels1 aWirén, Marit1 aBaur, Robert1 aRauscher, Stefan1 aHillbur, Ylva0 tPest management science.g2009 Aug., v. 65, no. 8 p.851-856dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.17623Available from publisher's Web site  a20090916b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03832naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163100001900172245016200191300001600353500002400369500001500393520151300408650001101921650000901932650001701941650002201958650001901980650001201999650002002011650001402031650001102045650001702056650003002073650001602103650001602119650002502135650002202160650001602182650002202198650003302220650003002253650001402283650002602297650002902323650002702352650006902379650003302448650003402481650002602515650004002541650002002581650004302601650002502644650003302669653002002702653002302722653002302745700001502768700001502783700001702798773010602815852000902921856007502930930003303005945002503038946001103063655001203074IND4423431920221121150617.0090718e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442343192DNAL7 a194184432pmid7 a10.1002/ps.17662doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF9001 aSong, Xiaoling10aPotential gene flow from transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.) to different weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea) accessions based on reproductive compatibility  ap. 862-869.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: The possibility of gene flow from transgenic crops to wild relatives may be affected by reproductive capacity between them. The potential gene flow from two transgenic rice lines containing the bar gene to five accessions of weedy rice (WR1-WR5) was determined through examination of reproductive compatibility under controlled pollination.RESULTS: The pollen grain germination of two transgenic rice lines on the stigma of all weedy rice, rice pollen tube growth down the style and entry into the weedy rice ovary were similar to self-pollination in weedy rice. However, delayed double fertilisation and embryo abortion in crosses between WR2 and Y0003 were observed. Seed sets between transgenic rice lines and weedy rice varied from 8 to 76%. Although repeated pollination increased seed set significantly, the rank of the seed set between the weedy rice accessions and rice lines was not changed. The germination rates of F₁ hybrids were similar or greater compared with respective females. All F₁ plants expressed glufosinate resistance in the presence of glufosinate selection pressure.CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of gene flow between different weedy rice accessions and transgenic herbicide-resistant rice may differ owing to different reproductive compatibility. This result suggests that, when wild relatives are selected as experimental materials for assessing the gene flow of transgenic rice, it is necessary to address the compatibility between transgenic rice and wild relatives. 3aovules 3arice 3aOryza sativa 3atransgenic plants 3aembryo (plant) 3aselfing 3aplant fertility 3agene flow 3astigma 3apollen tubes 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3aglufosinate 3agrass weeds 3aherbicide resistance 3aseed productivity 3apollination 3aabortion (plants) 2aAminobutyratesxpharmacology 2aDrug Resistancexgenetics 2aGene Flow 2aGerminationxgenetics 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aOryzaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPollenxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPollinationxgenetics 2aReproductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aRisk Assessment 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aTransgenesxgenetics 2aZygotexgrowth & development 0aweedy relatives 0aplant reproduction 0apollen germination1 aLiu, Linli1 aWang, Zhou1 aQiang, Sheng0 tPest management science.g2009 Aug., v. 65, no. 8 p.862-869dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.17663Available from publisher's Web site  a20090917b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02209naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245018100142300001600323520092800339650002201267650002601289650001001315650001901325650001901344650002001363650001801383650001301401651002101414653002001435700001501455700001701470700001401487700001301501700001401514700001501528700002001543700001601563700001601579773007801595852000901673930003301682945002501715946001101740655001201751IND4372146920221121150647.0050711e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437214692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPasick, J.10aIntersegmental recombination between the haemagglutinin and matrix genes was responsible for the emergence of a highly pathogenic H7N3 avian influenza virus in British Columbia  ap. 727-731.  aIn February 2004 a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak erupted in British Columbia. Investigations indicated that the responsible HPAI H7N3 virus emerged suddenly from a low pathogenic precursor. Analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes of the low and high pathogenic viruses isolated from the index farm revealed the only difference to be a 21 nt insert at the HA cleavage site of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. It was deduced that this insert most probably arose as a result of non-homologous recombination between the HA and matrix genes of the same virus. Over the course of the outbreak, a total of 37 isolates with, and 3 isolates without inserts were characterized. The events described here appear very similar to those which occurred in Chile in 2002 where the virulence shift of another H7N3 virus was attributed to non-homologous recombination between the HA and nucleoprotein genes. 3aInfluenza A virus 3agenetic recombination 3agenes 3aviral proteins 3ahemagglutinins 3aavian influenza 3apathogenicity 3achickens 3aBritish Columbia 0amatrix proteins1 aHandel, K.1 aRobinson, J.1 aCopps, J.1 aRidd, D.1 aHills, K.1 aKehler, H.1 aCottam-Birt, C.1 aNeufeld, J.1 aBerhane, Y.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 Mar., v. 86 p.727-731x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20051025b20051102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03549naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163100003300172245011500205300001600320500002400336520133500360650002901695650002701724650001801751650002501769650002301794650002501817650002301842650002301865650001301888650002001901650002201921650002001943650002401963650002401987650003802011650002102049650005702070650003802127650004202165650003902207650001802246650002202264650002802286650001302314650002202327650002602349650002802375653003102403653002802434700003602462700003002498700002202528700002302550700001902573773010602592852000902698856007502707930003302782945002502815946001102840655001202851IND4423432320140725000000.0090718e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442343232DNAL7 a194184812pmid7 a10.1002/ps.17702doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aCañas-Gutiérrez, Gloria P.10aAnalysis of the CYP51 gene and encoded protein in propiconazole-resistant isolates of Mycosphaerella fijiensis  ap. 892-899.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet causes black sigatoka, the most important disease in bananas and plantains. Disease control is mainly through the application of systemic fungicides, including sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). Their intensive use has favoured the appearance of resistant strains. However, no studies have been published on the possible resistance mechanisms.RESULTS: In this work, the CYP51 gene was isolated and sequenced in 11 M. fijiensis strains that had shown different degrees of in vitro sensitivity to propiconazole, one of the most widely used DMI fungicides. Six mutations that could be related to the loss in sensitivity to this fungicide were found: Y136F, A313G, Y461D, Y463D, Y463H and Y463N. The mutations were analysed using a homology model of the protein that was constructed from the crystallographic structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Zoff.) Lehmann & Neumann. Additionally, gene expression was determined in 13 M. fijiensis strains through quantitative analysis of products obtained by RT-PCR.CONCLUSION: Several changes in the sequence of the gene encoding sterol 14α-demethylase were found that have been described in other fungi as being correlated with resistance to azole fungicides. No correlation was found between gene expression and propiconazole resistance. 3aMycosphaerella fijiensis 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apropiconazole 3afungicide resistance 3agenetic resistance 3anucleotide sequences 3astrain differences 3adefense mechanisms 3amutation 3afungal proteins 3aprotein structure 3agene expression 3agenetic correlation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCatalytic Domain 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDrug Resistance, Fungalxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aSequence Homology 2aSterol 14-Demethylase 2aTriazolesxpharmacology 0asterol 14alpha-demethylase 0amolecular sequence data1 aAngarita-Velásquez, Mónica J.1 aRestrepo-Flórez, Juan M.1 aRodríguez, Paola1 aMoreno, Claudia X.1 aArango, Rafael0 tPest management science.g2009 Aug., v. 65, no. 8 p.892-899dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.17703Available from publisher's Web site  a20090916b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/08/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02951naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245009400202300001600296506007600312520160200388506003701990650001802027650002002045650001702065650002502082650001102107650001202118650003302130650003602163700002702199700001902226773017002245852000902415856008302424930003302507946001302540655001202553IND4400002820221207073107.0080113e20080108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440000282DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07051811052doi7 aPMC22241772pmcid7 a181722152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShyu, Y.

Determination of where and how each protein interacts with its partners provides significant insight into proteins' cellular roles. Although several assays, such as FRET and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), have been developed and widely used for visualization and identification of protein interactions in living cells, there is no simple and convenient assay to visualize and identify multiple protein complexes in living cells. Because many signaling molecules often function as ternary complexes, availability of an assay for visualization and identification of ternary complexes will significantly expand the repertoire of protein interaction studies in living cells. By using the Fos-Jun-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) ternary complex as a model and the fluorescent proteins Cerulean and Venus, two mutant proteins of CFP and YFP with better folding and less environment sensitivity, as a donor and acceptor, respectively, we have combined a Venus-based BiFC system with Cerulean to develop a BiFC-based FRET (BiFC-FRET) assay for visualization of ternary complexes in living cells with a conventional three-filter FRET setup. We also have applied the BiFC-FRET to identify a ternary complex formed between Fos-Jun heterodimers and the NF-κB subunit, p65. This finding reveals a cross-talk between AP-1 and NF-κB. Thus, the BiFC-FRET represents a convenient assay for identification and visualization of ternary complexes in living cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3acell structures 3afluorescence 3afluorescent proteins 3amodels 3amutants 3aprotein-protein interactions 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aSuarez, Christopher D.1 aHu, Chang-Deng0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 8, v. 105, no. 1 p.151-156dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07051811053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245013000171300001600301500002400317520127400341650002901615650001501644650002301659650001801682650001301700650001301713650003101726650001001757650001101767650001501778650002601793650001201819650002501831650001201856650001101868700002001879700001701899700002501916700002301941700002501964773009501989852000902084856008902093655001202182IND4436973520221121115440.0100514s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443697352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmara, Walid A.M.10aConditional cell-wall mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as delivery vehicles for therapeutic agents in vivo to the GI tract  ap. 136-143.  aIncludes references  aStrains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae capable of lysis upon conditional down-regulation of cell-wall biogenesis genes (SRB1 and PKC1) have been reported. Here, we show that they lyse and release recombinant protein not only under laboratory conditions, but (more importantly) under conditions found in the human stomach and duodenum. These findings provide proof that, in principle, such conditional lysis strains could be used as an integral part of a system for the oral delivery of therapeutic proteins. However, the current mechanism of conditional lysis is based on the use of the MET3 promoter which requires addition of methionine and cysteine for down-regulation of SRB1 and PKC1. This requirement makes it difficult to apply in vivo. We reasoned that promoters, suitable for in vivo down-regulation of lysis-inducing genes, could be identified amongst yeast genes whose transcript abundance is reduced under conditions found in the human gut. A microarray experiment identified a number of candidate genes with significantly reduced transcript levels under simulated human gut conditions.

Here I discuss the extent to which these tenets regarding seamounts may be inappropriate, suffer from a lack of support, and be over-generalizations of a broad range of environmental types encountered on seamounts. Ultimately, for seamount science to progress, we need to challenge our conventional wisdom on these habitats and the extent to which all seamounts function in a similar manner. 3abiodiversity 3acorals 3agardens 3ahabitats 3aislands 3aoases 3aresearchers 0adeep sea 0aecological oasis 0aendemism 0ahotspot 0aisland biogeography 0aseamount0 tJournal of biogeography.g2007 Dec., v. 34, no. 12 p.2001-2008dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01783.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071118b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04116naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245016200169300001600331520185600347650004302203650001302246650002002259650001002279650001302289650002202302650002202324650001802346650002502364650002502389650002502414650001502439650001902454650003602473653001102509653002302520653001102543653002802554653002102582653002102603653002102624653002102645653002102666653002102687653002102708653002102729653002102750653002102771653002102792653002102813653002102834653002102855653002102876653002102897653002102918653002102939653002102960653001902981700001403000700001503014700001403029700001503043700001503058700001503073700001703088773007103105852000903176856009203185930003303277945001303310946001103323655001203334IND2202079820221121063741.0991228e199906  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220207982DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00483.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZegzouti, H.10aEthylene-regulated gene expression in tomato fruit: characterization of novel ethylene-responsive and ripening-related genes isolated by differential display  ap. 589-600.  aDifferential display was used to isolate early ethylene-regulated genes from late immature green tomato fruit in order to obtain a broader understanding of the molecular basis by which ethylene coordinates the ripening process. Nineteen novel ethylene-responsive (ER) cDNA clones were isolated that fell into three classes: (i) ethylene up-regulated (ii) ethylene down-regulated, and (iii) transiently induced. Expression analysis revealed that ethylene-dependent changes in mRNA accumulation occurred rapidly (15 min) for most of the ER clones. The predicted proteins encoded by the ER genes are putatively involved in processes as diverse as primary metabolism, hormone signalling and stress responses. Although a number of the isolated ER clones correspond to genes already documented in other species, their responsiveness to ethylene is described here for the first time. Among the ER clones sharing high homology with regulatory genes, ER43, a putative GTP-binding protein, and ER50, a CTR1-like clone, are potentially involved in signal transduction. ER24 is homologous to the multi-protein bridging factor MBF1 involved in transcriptional activation, and finally, two clones are homologous to genes involved in post-transcriptional regulation: ER49, a putative translational elongation factor, and ER68, a mRNA helicase-like gene. Six ER clones correspond to as yet unidentified genes. The expression studies indicated that all the ER genes are ripening-regulated, and, depending on the clone, show changes in transcript accumulation either at the breaker, turning, or red stage. Analysis of transcript accumulation in different organs indicated a strong bias towards expression in the fruit for many of the clones. The potential roles for some of the ER clones in propagating the ethylene response and regulating fruit ripening are discussed. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aethylene 3agene expression 3agenes 3aripening 3aplant development 3acomplementary DNA 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3abiochemical pathways 3ametabolism 3aplant proteins 3achemical constituents of plants 0astress 0agenetic regulation 0afruits 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af096246 0agenbank/af065247 0agenbank/af096247 0agenbank/af096248 0agenbank/af096249 0agenbank/af096250 0agenbank/af096251 0agenbank/af096252 0agenbank/af096253 0agenbank/af096254 0agenbank/af096255 0agenbank/af096256 0agenbank/af096257 0agenbank/af096258 0agenbank/af096259 0agenbank/af096260 0agenbank/af096261 0agenbank/af096262 0agenbank/af096263 0agenbank/u777191 aJones, B.1 aFrasse, P.1 aMarty, C.1 aMaitre, B.1 aLatche, A.1 aPech, J.C.1 aBouzayen, M.0 tplant journal.g1999 June, v. 18, no. 6 p.589-600x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313x.1999.00483.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03615naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002000182245016000202300001400362500002400376500001500400520157200415650002101987650001602008650001902024650001202043650001202055650002302067650002002090650001802110650001202128650001602140650000902156650001202165650001602177650002302193650002002216650003202236650003802268650003502306650002802341650002402369650002302393650002102416650000902437650001902446650003302465650000902498650001702507650003502524650002502559653002102584700002302605700002502628773011302653852000902766856008502775930003302860945002502893946001102918655001202929IND4423494420221121042443.0090723e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442349442DNAL7 a190798402pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145081590132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aOliva, Maria E.10aSoya protein reverses dyslipidaemia and the altered capacity of insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in the skeletal muscle of sucrose-rich diet-fed rats  ap. 60-68.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe present study investigates the benefits of dietary intake of soya protein upon dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance in rats chronically (8 months) fed a sucrose-rich (63 %) diet (SRD). For this purpose, we analysed the effectiveness of soya protein isolate in improving or reversing these metabolic abnormalities. Wistar rats were fed a SRD for 4 months. By the end of this period, stable dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance were present in the animals. From months 4 to 8, half the animals continued with the SRD and the other half were fed a SRD in which the source of protein casein was substituted by soya. The control group received a diet in which the source of carbohydrate was maize starch. The results showed that: (1) soya protein normalized plasma TAG, cholesterol and NEFA levels in the SRD-fed rats. Moreover, the addition of soya protein reversed the hepatic steatosis. (2) Glucose homeostasis was normalized without changes in circulating insulin levels. Whole-body peripheral insulin sensitivity substantially improved. Besides, soya protein moderately decreases body weight gain limiting the accretion of visceral fat. (3) By shifting the source of dietary protein from casein to soya during the last 4 months of the feeding period it was possible to reverse both the diminished insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation and disposal in the skeletal muscle of SRD-fed rats. This study provides new data showing the beneficial effect of soya protein upon lipid and glucose homeostasis in the experimental model of dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance. 3aprotein isolates 3asoy protein 3ahyperlipidemia 3aglucose 3asucrose 3aexperimental diets 3askeletal muscle 3aanimal models 3ainsulin 3ahomeostasis 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkers. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDietary Sucrose 2aDyslipidemiasxdrug therapy 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aGlucosexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aGlucose Clamp Technique 2aInsulinxphysiology 2aInsulin Resistance 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMale 2aModels, Animal 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSoybean Proteinsxpharmacology 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0asoybean products1 aChicco, Adriana G.1 aLombardo, Yolanda B.0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2009 July, v. 102, no. 1 p.60-68dCambridge University Pressx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145081590133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b20091002c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/08/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03025naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072000900143100001500152245013500167300001600302500002400318500001500342520150400357650003301861650003201894650003801926650002001964650001901984650001402003650002102017650002802038650001802066650002202084650001202106650002002118650002202138653001302160653003702173700001402210700001702224700001902241773010802260852000902368856008302377930003302460945002502493946001302518655001202531IND4405385620221121042256.0080509e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440538562DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-98-4-04642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8331 aSasaya, T.10aFurther Evidence of Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus but Not of Lettuce big-vein associated virus with Big-Vein Disease in Lettuce  ap. 464-468.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMirafiori lettuce big-vein virus (MLBVV) and Lettuce big-vein associated virus (LBVaV) are found in association with big-vein disease of lettuce. Discrimination between the two viruses is critical for elucidating the etiology of big-vein disease. Using specific antibodies to MLBVV and LBVaV for western blotting and exploiting differences between MLBVV and LBVaV in host reaction of cucumber and temperature dependence in lettuce, we separated the two viruses by transfering each virus from doubly infected lettuce plants to cucumber or lettuce plants. A virus-free fungal isolate was allowed to acquire the two viruses individually or together. To confirm the separation, zoospores from MLBVV-, LBVaV-, and dually infected lettuce plants were used for serial inoculations of lettuce seedlings 12 successive times. Lettuce seedlings were infected at each transfer either with MLBVV alone, LBVaV alone, or both viruses together, depending on the virus carried by the vector. Lettuce seedlings infected with MLBVV alone developed the big-vein symptoms, while those infected with LBVaV alone developed no symptoms. In field surveys, MLBVV was consistently detected in lettuce plants from big-vein-affected fields, whereas LBVaV was detected in lettuce plants not only from big-vein-affected fields but also from big-vein-free fields. LBVaV occurred widely at high rates in winter-spring lettuce-growing regions irrespective of the presence of MLBVV and, hence, of the presence of the big-vein disease. 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3aLettuce big-vein associated virus 3aCucumis sativus 3aLactuca sativa 3acucumbers 3aWestern blotting 3apathogen identification 3apathogenicity 3adisease incidence 3alettuce 3amixed infection 3adisease diagnosis 0aetiology 0aMirafiori lettuce big-vein virus1 aFujii, H.1 aIshikawa, K.1 aKoganezawa, H.0 tPhytopathology.g2008 Apr., v. 98, no. 4 p.464-468dAmerican Phytopathological Societyx0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-4-04643Available from publisher's Web site  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/11/26  aOther US 7aarticle02129naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004500092040001800137072000900155072000900164100001700173245007900190300001400269500002400283500001500307520085900322650002201181650001801203650001601221650001301237650002101250650001501271650002301286653001701309653002901326700001401355700001701369700001501386700001501401773009401416852000901510856009501519930003301614945002501647946001101672655001201683IND4405386420221121042502.0080509e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440538642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2008.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aJ7001 aBentaher, H.10aThree-point hitch-mechanism instrumentation for tillage power optimization  ap. 24-30.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn order to study tillage power optimization, a tillage-force measuring system has been built with transducers in the three-point hitch mechanism, and then has been calibrated and tested in the field. The uniqueness of this system is its ability to measure the three orthogonal components of the tillage force despite using only three force sensors; this was possible by using a three-dimensional analysis of the tractor linkage mechanism. A dynamic calculus program was developed to take into consideration the changes of the three-point hitch-mechanism geometry during the tillage operation. The calibration results showed a linear relation between the applied and the measured forces. The preliminary field tests proved the stability of the system results. The developed system can readily be applied in studies to minimize tillage energy consumption. 3apower requirement 3alinear models 3acalibration 3atractors 3aequipment design 3akinematics 3atillage implements 0aoptimization 0aagricultural engineering1 aHamza, E.1 aKantchev, G.1 aMaalej, A.1 aArnold, W.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2008 May, v. 100, no. 1 p.24-30dAcademic Pressx1537-51107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2008.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080703b20080801c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/07/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02779naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245008800176300001800264520151000282650001401792650001401806650002601820650001001846650002201856650001001878650002001888651001101908653002501919653001701944653001901961653001601980653002001996653003002016653002302046700002002069773012302089852000902212856009202221930003302313946001102346655001202357IND4397732920221121030750.0071111e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439773292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01554.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrytnes, John Arvid10aElevational species richness patterns for vascular plants on Mount Kinabalu, Borneo  ap. 1838-1849.  aWe quantify the elevational patterns of species richness for all vascular plants and some functional and taxonomic groups on a regional scale on a tropical mountain and discuss some possible causes for the observed patterns. Mount Kinabalu, Sabah, Borneo. A data base containing elevational information on more than 28,000 specimens was analysed for vascular plant distribution, taking into account sampling effort. The total species richness pattern was estimated per 300-m elevational interval by rarefaction analyses. The same methods were also applied to quantify species richness patterns of trees, epiphytes, and ferns. Total species richness has a humped relationship with elevation, and a maximum species richness in the interval between 900 and 1200 m. For ferns and epiphytes the maximum species richness is found at slightly higher elevations, whereas tree species did not have a statistically significant peak in richness above the lowest interval analysed. For the first time a rigorous estimate of an elevational pattern in species richness of the whole vascular plant flora of a tropical mountain has been quantified. The pattern observed depends on the group studied. We discuss the differences between the groups and compare the results with previous studies of elevational patterns of species richness from other tropical areas. We also discuss the methods used to quantify the richness pattern and conclude that rarefaction gives an appropriate estimate of the species richness pattern. 3adatabases 3aepiphytes 3aferns and fern allies 3aflora 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3avascular plants 3aBorneo 0aAltitudinal gradient 0amacroecology 0aMount Kinabalu 0ararefaction 0asampling effort 0aspecies richness gradient 0atropical mountains1 aBeaman, John H.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2006 Oct., v. 33, no. 10 p.1838-1849dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01554.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02931naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008200126300001600208500021300224500002300437500001500460520168300475650002002158650002002178650001002198650002002208650001102228650001802239650002402257650001702281650001902298650003302317650001302350651001302363653001702376773008702393852000902480939003302489946001102522655001202533IND9205820720221121021400.0920918s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920582072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShereni, W.10aStrategic and tactical developments in tsetse control in Zimbabwe (1981-1989)  ap. 399-409.  aSpecial issue: Tsetse population and behavior / edited by L.H.

The main approach has been pesticidal control, involving ground spraying, aerial spraying, cattle dipping and artificial bait techniques, in some circumstances in combination. This represents a change in tactic from the pre-independence period when control relied solely on ground spraying. Factors which have influenced choice of technique are discussed in the paper, including scale of trypanosomiasis problem, technical limitations of the technique, cost-effectiveness and environmental considerations. Ground spraying, the mainstay of tsetse control operations in Zimbabwe prior to 1980, is becoming increasingly unfavourable because of high logistical requirements and environmental reasons, but remains an effective technique under a wide range of circumstances. Aerial spraying has proved very effective for management of crisis situations but is comparatively expensive, capital intensive in hilly terrain and less effective against Glossina pallidipes than G. morsitans. Vector control by applying insecticide (deltamethrin) to cattle appears technically feasible at a very competitive cost. This is a most promising technique in areas where there are already cattle and few wild hosts. Control of tsetse using odour-baited and insecticide-treated screens has proven technically feasible in a wide range of terrain, and appears economically competitive with ground spraying. Both technical and financial performance of the technique are still being improved. Bait technology offers scope for the new approaches to the control of the fly and defence of cleared areas from reinvasion. 3atrypanosomiasis 3adisease vectors 3abaits 3aDDT (pesticide) 3acattle 3acost analysis 3aGlossina pallidipes 3adeltamethrin 3ainsect control 3aGlossina morsitans morsitans 3aspraying 3aZimbabwe 0ainsecticides0 tInsect science and its application.g1990, v. 11, no. 3 p.399-409x0191-90407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03500naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002000181245011900201300001800320500002400338506007600362520146800438506003701906650002301943650002701966650001801993650001202011650001502023650001002038650001502048650001402063650001502077650001402092650001802106650001002124650001102134650001402145650001902159650001702178650001202195650003502207650002402242650002602266650002602292650002802318650000902346650002302355650001902378650003002397650001702427650001002444700002002454700002102474700002502495700002202520700002302542700001902565700002402584773011702608852000902725856008002734655001202814IND4437357420221207070820.0100522s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443735742DNAL7 a203083052pmid7 aPMC28765382pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00170-102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIyer, Janaki K.10aInflammatory Cytokine Response to Bacillus anthracis Peptidoglycan Requires Phagocytosis and Lysosomal Trafficking  ap. 2418-2428.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring advanced stages of inhalation anthrax, Bacillus anthracis accumulates at high levels in the bloodstream of the infected host. This bacteremia leads to sepsis during late-stage anthrax; however, the mechanisms through which B. anthracis-derived factors contribute to the pathology of infected hosts are poorly defined. Peptidoglycan, a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, can provoke symptoms of sepsis in animal models. We have previously shown that peptidoglycan of B. anthracis can induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by cells in human blood. Here, we show that biologically active peptidoglycan is shed from an active culture of encapsulated B. anthracis strain Ames in blood. Peptidoglycan is able to bind to surfaces of responding cells, and internalization of peptidoglycan is required for the production of inflammatory cytokines. We also show that the peptidoglycan traffics to lysosomes, and lysosomal function is required for cytokine production. We conclude that peptidoglycan of B. anthracis is initially bound by an unknown extracellular receptor, is phagocytosed, and traffics to lysosomes, where it is degraded to a product recognized by an intracellular receptor. Binding of the peptidoglycan product to the intracellular receptor causes a proinflammatory response. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which B. anthracis triggers sepsis during a critical stage of anthrax disease.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aanimal models 3aanthrax 3abacteremia 3ablood 3ablood flow 3abreathing 3acell walls 3acytokines 3aencapsulation 3ahosts 3ahumans 3alysosomes 3apeptidoglycans 3aphagocytosis 2aAnimals 2aBacillus anthracisximmunology 2aBloodxmicrobiology 2aCytokinesximmunology 2aLysosomesxmetabolism 2aMacrophagesximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aPeptidoglycanximmunology 2aPhagocytosis 2aSheep1 aKhurana, Taruna1 aLanger, Marybeth1 aWest, Christopher M.1 aBallard, Jimmy D.1 aMetcalf, Jordan P.1 aMerkel, Tod J.1 aCoggeshall, K.

In July 1998, a similar trial was started in Lambwe Valley, Western Kenya. Glossina pallidipes is the sole vector in the valley and is present in very high densities. In Galana Ranch trial, octenol and acetone are used as odours while in Lambwe Valley, natural cow urine is used in addition to acetone and octenol. Tsetse population densities were assessed weekly for 3 weeks, before deployment or targets and thereafter at monthly intervals. A herd of cattle is used to monitor the effect of the control measures on disease incidence. On Galana Ranch, the block where the initial trial began has remained free of G. pallidipes for a period of 3 years. In a period of 9 months in the second year of the trial, the berenil index in a herd of cattle was 0.07 in the controlled area compared to 2.5 in the uncontrolled area. In Lambwe Valley a 99.9% reduction in trap catches has been observed in most parts of the park at the end of the first year. The berenil index in the cattle has dropped from 6.3 to 0 and there is a general improvement in the health of the animals. Observations are continuing at both sites. 3acattle 3aGlossina pallidipes 3ainsect control 3abaits 3adeltamethrin 3adisease vectors 3aodors 3apopulation density 3atrypanosomiasis 3aKenya1 aNjogu, A.R.1 aOmuse, J.K.0 tInsect science and its application.g1990, v. 11, no. 3 p.417-425x0191-90407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04329naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245008900167300001800256520236800274650002502642650001302667650001202680650001502692650002202707650001502729650001502744650001002759650001302769650002202782650001402804650001902818650002202837650002502859650002002884650001102904650001302915651001802928651001202946651001402958651001202972651001002984653001902994653001203013653002503025653002503050653002903075700001703104700002003121700002103141700001603162700001403178700001403192700001903206700001603225700001803241700001603259700002303275700001403298700001403312700001403326773012203340852000903462856009203471930003303563946001103596655001203607IND4392592420221121000359.0070624e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439259242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01697.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHailer, F.10aPhylogeography of the white-tailed eagle, a generalist with large dispersal capacity  ap. 1193-1206.  aLate Pleistocene glacial changes had a major impact on many boreal and temperate taxa, and this impact can still be detected in the present-day phylogeographic structure of these taxa. However, only minor effects are expected in species with generalist habitat requirements and high dispersal capability. One such species is the white-tailed eagle, Haliaeetus albicilla, and we therefore tested for the expected weak population structure at a continental level in this species. This also allowed us to describe phylogeographic patterns, and to deduce Ice Age refugia and patterns of postglacial recolonization of Eurasia. Breeding populations from the easternmost Nearctic (Greenland) and across the Palaearctic (Iceland, continental Europe, central and eastern Asia, and Japan). Sequencing of a 500 base-pair fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region in 237 samples from throughout the distribution range. Our analysis revealed pronounced phylogeographic structure. Overall, low genetic variability was observed across the entire range. Haplotypes clustered in two distinct haplogroups with a predominantly eastern or western distribution, and extensive overlap in Europe. These two major lineages diverged during the late Pleistocene. The eastern haplogroup showed a pattern of rapid population expansion and colonization of Eurasia around the end of the Pleistocene. The western haplogroup had lower diversity and was absent from the populations in eastern Asia. These results suggest survival during the last glaciation in two refugia, probably located in central and western Eurasia, followed by postglacial population expansion and admixture. Relatively high genetic diversity was observed in northern regions that were ice-covered during the last glacial maximum. This, and phylogenetic relationships between haplotypes encountered in the north, indicates substantial population expansion at high latitudes. Areas of glacial meltwater runoff and proglacial lakes could have provided suitable habitats for such population growth. This study shows that glacial climate fluctuations had a substantial impact on white-tailed eagles, both in terms of distribution and demography. These results suggest that even species with large dispersal capabilities and relatively broad habitat requirements were strongly affected by the Pleistocene climatic shifts. 3aHaliaeetus albicilla 3abreeding 3aclimate 3ademography 3agenetic variation 3aglaciation 3ahaplotypes 3alakes 3alatitude 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3apopulation growth 3apopulation structure 3arefuge habitats 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3aArctic region 3aEurasia 3aGreenland 3aIceland 3aJapan 0aControl region 0aEurasia 0aHaliaeetus albicilla 0apopulation expansion 0apostglacial colonization1 aHelander, B.1 aFolkestad, A.O.1 aGanusevich, S.A.1 aGarstad, S.1 aHauff, P.1 aKoren, C.1 aMasterov, V.B.1 aNygård, T.1 aRudnick, J.A.1 aShiraki, S.1 aSkarphedinsson, K.1 aVolke, V.1 aWille, F.1 aVilà, C.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2007 July, v. 34, no. 7 p.1193-1206dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01697.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070624b20070702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01916naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245005600134300001600190500021300206500002300419500001500442520070600457650002601163650002401189650001501213650001301228650002401241650002401265653002801289653002001317653002301337653002001360700002201380773008701402852000901489939003301498946001101531655001201542IND9205820220221120235929.0920918s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920582022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies-Cole, J.O.A.10aMating efficiency in females of Glossina pallidipes  ap. 355-361.  aSpecial issue: Tsetse population and behavior / edited by L.H.

Females mated as early as 6 days old but reached peak receptivity at 9-13 days old (60-80%). Females did not immediately mate with more than one male. The mean spermathecal value (MSV) was highest between 7 and 14 days of age, and declined thereafter. The duration of copulation was comparatively short (mean = 24 min), and did not vary significantly with age. High female receptivity corresponded with maturity of ovariole A, which reached maximum length at an age of 10 days. These results are discussed in relation to mass rearing of G. pallidipes. 3areproductive behavior 3aGlossina pallidipes 3acopulation 3aduration 3asexual reproduction 3aovarian development 0amean spermathecal value 0asexual behavior 0asexual receptivity 0amating behavior1 aChaudhury, M.F.B.0 tInsect science and its application.g1990, v. 11, no. 3 p.355-361x0191-90407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02888naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001800163245009800181300001600279500002400295500001500319520130700334650001501641650001801656650001901674650002001693650001701713650001801730650002501748650001301773650001501786650001501801650001301816650000901829650001601838650002201854650001101876650002301887651001001910653001801920653001801938653001201956700001701968700001501985700001602000700001702016773011402033852000902147856008502156930003302241945002502274946001102299655001202310IND4405509620221121000524.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440550962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11259-008-9043-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aX2001 aVilar, J.

Certain parameters, such as the angles of both front and hind fetlock joints, stride length, stride frequency and average speed in youngs and adults are presented, examinated and compared with statistical tests. The angles and stride length were obtained using ONTRACK® software over frames extracted from two CANON® MV630i digital videocameras. For the stride frequency, a third identical videocamera filmed the horses to count the number of beats per minute. The average speed was calculated by multiplying the stride frequency by the stride length and transforming the result into kilometers per hour. The data reveal that as speed increases, younger horses have more extended fetlock joints than adults. Contrary to this, at the maximum speed (hereafter referred to as sprint speed) the adults increase both their stride frequency and stride length, while young horses increase stride frequency and decrease stride length. We think that the knowledge of these parameters in competition breeds could have potential relevance as they may reveal early indicators of the development of proper and adequate characteristics in young horses of those breeds. 3alocomotion 3ayoung animals 3alimbs (animal) 3avideo recorders 3aStandardbred 3anormal values 3aathletic performance 3abiometry 3aracehorses 3akinematics 3atrotting 3agait 3ameasurement 3acomputer software 3aadults 3aracing performance 3aItaly 0aadult animals 0agait analysis 0arunning1 aSpadari, A. 1 aBilli, V. 1 aDesini, V. 1 aSantana, A. 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2008 June, v. 32, no. 5 p.367-376dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-008-9043-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080909b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/08/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02588naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009800164300001600262520167000278651001001948653002401958653002201982653002002004653002002024773011602044852000902160856008502169930003302254946001102287655001202298IND4401553620221120235953.0080217e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440155362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-005-0089-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubba Rao, N. 10aSeasonal variation of groundwater quality in a part of Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, India  ap. 413-429.  aThe area in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, India, is selected to discuss the impact of seasonal variation of groundwater quality on irrigation and human health, where the agriculture is the main livelihood of rural people and the groundwater is the main source for irrigation and drinking. Granite gneisses associated with schists and charnockites of the Precambrian Eastern Ghats underlie the area. Groundwater samples collected seasonally, pre- and post-monsoons, during three years from forty wells in the area were analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, TA, TH, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, CO ₃ ²- , HCO ₃ - , Cl-, SO ₄ ²- , NO ₃ - and F-. The chemical relationships in Piper's diagram, Chebotarev's genetic classification and Gibbs's diagram suggest that the groundwaters mainly belong to non-carbonate alkali type and Cl- group, and are controlled by evaporation-dominance, respectively, due to the influence of semi-arid climate, gentle slope, sluggish drainage conditions, greater water-rock interaction, and anthropogenic activities. A comparison of the groundwater quality in relation to drinking water quality standards proves that most of the water samples are not suitable for drinking, especially in post-monsoon period. US Salinity Laboratory's and Wilcox's diagrams, and %Na⁺ used for evaluating the water quality for irrigation suggest that the majority of the groundwater samples are not good for irrigation in post-monsoon compared to that in pre-monsoon. These conditions are caused due to leaching of salts from the overlying materials by infiltrating recharge waters. A management plan is suggested for sustainable development of the area. 3aIndia 0aGroundwater quality 0aAgricultural area 0aManagement plan 0aGuntur district0 tEnvironmental geology.g2006 Jan., v. 49, no. 3 p.413-429dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-005-0089-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03505naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164100002300173245011300196300001600309500002400325500001500349520124900364650001801613650001201631650001701643650002501660650002001685650001501705650001901720650001101739650001001750650002001760650002501780650002001805650002301825650002701848650002301875650002101898650002001919650002101939650002401960650003701984650002802021650001202049650003802061650002302099650006802122650007302190650001102263650006802274650000902342650001602351653002602367653001702393700002302410700002702433700002502460700002102485773011402506852000902620856008502629930003302714945002502747946001102772655001202783IND4405510020221120225449.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440551002DNAL7 a182660682pmid7 a10.1007/s11259-008-9035-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8101 aPicco, Eduardo J. 10aPharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of chlorpyrifos in male and female cattle after topical administration  ap. 401-410.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this work was to study the pharmacokinetic behaviour and the inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activities of chlorpyrifos in male and female cattle after pour-on administration. Determination of cholinesterase activity in plasma and erythrocyte was carried out according to Ellman kinetic method. The mean baseline activities were 9338.39 ± 1331.61 and 13220.69 ± 2274.18 to acetylcholinesterase and 624.65 ± 39.32 and 641.68 ± 88.08 IU/L to butyrylcholinesterase in females and males, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase was the predominant form of cholinesterase analyzed, with low levels of butyrylcholinesterase. The basal acetylcholinesterase activities of the bulls were significantly greater than those of cows. The inhibitory effect of topical chlorpyrifos administration was lower on butyrylcholinesterase than on acetylcholinesterase. Chlorpyrifos peak plasma concentration (male:10.920 ± 4.18; female:12.12 ± 3.88 μg/L) were reached at 11.92 ± 9.19 and 8.17 ± 7.67 h in male and female, respectively. The values of area under curve were 185.96 ± 168.45 and 278.89 ± 270.00 μg·h/L and mean residence time were 13.95 ± 8.10 and 14.90 ± 9.80 h in male and female, respectively. 3aneurotoxicity 3afemales 3achlorpyrifos 3aacetylcholinesterase 3ablood chemistry 3abiomarkers 3adrug excretion 3acattle 3amales 3adrug evaluation 3apour-on formulations 3aadverse effects 3agender differences 3aphysiological response 3acholinergic agents 3atoxicity testing 3aenzyme activity 3apharmacokinetics 3atopical application 2aAcetylcholinesterasexmetabolism 2aAdministration, Topical 2aAnimals 2aButyrylcholinesterasexmetabolism 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aChlorpyrifosxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aFemale 2aInsecticidesxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aMale 2aSex Factors 0abutyrylcholinesterase 0abiochemistry1 aRubio, Marcelo R. 1 aDíaz David, Diego C. 1 aRodríguez, Casilda 1 aBoggio, Juan C. 0 tVeterinary research communications.g2008 June, v. 32, no. 5 p.401-410dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-73807nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11259-008-9035-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080909b20081011c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/08/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01292naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245013300166300001600299500002400315520031700339650002500656650001500681650001100696650001400707700001900721773017700740852000900917856008800926655001201014IND4437347120221120225532.0100522s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443734712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, Katsuya10aEnhancing activity and stability of Burkholderia cepacia lipase by immobilization on surface-functionalized mesoporous silicates  ap. 615-617.  aIncludes references  aBurkholderia cepacia lipase was immobilized on various types of phenyl-functionalized mesoporous silicates (MPS).

South Africa, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zimbabwe. Data comprised presence/absence by quarter-degree grid cell for forest-dependent and forest-associated birds, non-volant mammals and frogs. Twenty-one forest subregions were assigned to one of three previously identified forest types: Afrotemperate, scarp, and Indian Ocean coastal belt. Differences among forest types were examined through patterns and gradients of species richness and endemism, assemblage similarity, species turnover, and coefficients of species dispersal direction. The influence of contemporary environment on assemblage composition was investigated using partial canonical correspondence analysis. Several alternative biogeographical hypotheses for the recolonization of forest faunas were tested. Afrotemperate faunas are relatively species-poor, have low species turnover, and are unsaturated and infiltrated by generalist species. In northern and central regions, communities are supplemented by recolonization from scarp forest refugia, and among frogs by autochthanous speciation in localized refugia. Scarp faunas are relatively species-rich, contain many forest-dependent species, have high species turnover, and overlap with coastal and Afrotemperate faunas. Coastal forests are relatively species-rich with high species turnover. Afrotemperate communities were affected most by climatic extinction filtering events. Scarp forests were Afrotemperate refugia during the LGM and are a contemporary overlap zone between Afrotemperate and coastal forest. Coastal faunas derive from post-LGM colonization along the eastern seaboard from tropical East African refugia. The greatest diversity is achieved in scarp and coastal forest faunas in northern KwaZulu-Natal province. This historical centre of diversity has influenced the faunal diversity of nearly all other forests in South Africa. The response of vertebrate taxa to large-scale, historical processes is dependent on their relative mobility: forest birds best illustrate patterns resulting from post-glacial faunal dispersal, while among mammals and frogs the legacy of climatic extinction filtering remains stronger. 3arefuge habitats 3acoastal forests 3afauna 3aspecies dispersal 3acenter of diversity 3acorrespondence analysis 3aextinction 3aspecies diversity 3aindigenous species 3aforest types 3amammals 3afrogs 3abirds 3aSouth Africa 3aEswatini 3aMozambique 3aIndian Ocean 3aZimbabwe 0aSwaziland 0afaunal dispersal 0ahistorical processes 0aforest faunas 0aClimatic extinction filtering 0alast glacial maximum1 aEeley, Harriet A.C.1 aFindlay, Nicola J.1 aForbes, Dale0 tJournal of biogeography.g2007 July, v. 34, no. 7 p.1246-1264dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01696.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070624b20070702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02424naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002300148245015000171300001600321500002400337520127200361650002701633650002501660650001601685650003501701650000901736650001801745700002201763700002301785700001601808773017701824852000902001856008802010655001202098IND4437347320221120215525.0100522s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443734732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokumoto, Yasuhito10aComparison of efficiency of terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells versus embryonic stem cells in vitro  ap. 622-628.  aIncludes references  aOligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and defects in these cells can result in the loss of CNS functions. Although oligodendrocyte progenitor cells transplantation therapy is an effective cure for such symptoms, there is no readily available source of these cells. Recent studies have described the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) from somatic cells, leading to anticipation of this technique as a novel therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine. In this study, we evaluated the ability of iPS cells derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and compared this with the differential ability of mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells). Experiments using an in vitro oligodendrocyte differentiation protocol that was optimized to ES cells demonstrated that 2.3% of iPS cells differentiated into O4⁺ oligodendrocytes compared with 24.0% of ES cells. However, the rate of induction of A2B5⁺ oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) was similar for both iPS-derived cells and ES-derived cells (14.1% and 12.6%, respectively). These findings suggest that some intracellular factors in iPS cells inhibit the terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes from the OPC stage. 3acentral nervous system 3aembryonic stem cells 3afibroblasts 3ainduced pluripotent stem cells 3amice 3asomatic cells1 aOgawa, Shinichiro1 aNagamune, Teruyuki1 aMiyake, Jun0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2010 June, v. 109, no. 6 p.622-628dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2009.11.0133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02362naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245007500168300001600243500001500259520092000274650002201194650003001216650003901246650002501285650001501310650002501325650002501350650001801375650003201393650001901425653001301444653001101457653001701468653002801485653001901513653001201532700001601544700001601560700001601576700001501592700002001607773007101627852000901698856009201707930003301799945001301832946001101845655001201856IND2202576320221120194628.0000215e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220257632DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00510.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHop, D. van10aSuppression of pea nuclear topoisomerase I enzyme activity by pea PCNA  ap. 153-162.  a2019-12-04  aProliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a highly conserved DNA polymerase accessory protein of eukaryotic kingdom, has not been studied thoroughly in biochemical terms in plants. We describe the isolation of the cDNA encoding PCNA from the pea cDNA library using the PCR approach. The cDNA was used for expression of pea PCNA in bacteria as a fusion protein (GST.PCNA) with the GST tag at the amino terminal end. The GST.PCNA stimulated the partially purified pea DNA polymerases approximately 30-fold. The stimulation was due to the oligomeric form of GST.PCNA. The pea PCNA interacted with the recombinant type I pea topoisomerase as well as the native pea nuclear topoisomerase I and repressed the DNA relaxation activities. However, the DNA binding activity of Topo I remained undisturbed in the presence of high amounts of PCNA, thereby signifying that the catalysis of Topo I was probably affected by PCNA. 3acomplementary DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aamino acid sequences 3aisomerases 3anucleotide sequences 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aPisum sativum 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aplant proteins 0aantigens 0anuclei 0abiochemistry 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/y16796 0abinding1 aGaikwad, A.1 aYadav, B.S.1 aReddy, M.K.1 aSopory, S.1 aMukherjee, S.K.0 tplant journal.g1999 July, v. 19, no. 2 p.153-162x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00510.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01696naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008000164300001600244500002400260520070100284650002800985650001001013650002501023653002201048653001501070653002001085653001601105700001901121700002401140773011201164852000901276856008501285655001201370IND4437126320221120194507.0100514s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443712632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0382-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirota, Yusuke10aSeparation characteristics of animal cells using a dielectrophoretic filter  ap. 607-612.  aIncludes references  aThe separation characteristics of a wire-wire type dielectrophoretic (DEP) filter were evaluated using animal cells.

Antisense and cosuppression potato transformants with decreased expression of sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) have been used to analyse the importance of SPS for the regulation of this water-stress induced change in partitioning. (i) In the absence of water stress, a 70-80% decrease in SPS activity led to a 30-50% inhibition of sucrose synthesis and a slight (10-20%) increase of starch synthesis in tuber discs in short-term labelling experiments with low concentrations of labelled glucose. Similar changes were seen in short-term labelling experiments with intact tubers attached to well-watered plants. Provided plants were grown with ample light and water, transformant tubers had a slightly lower water and sucrose content and a similar or even marginally higher starch content than wild-type tubers. (ii) When wild-type tuber slices were incubated with labelled glucose in the presence of mannitol to generate a moderate water deficit (between -0.12 and -0.72 MPa), there was a marked stimulation of sucrose synthesis and inhibition of starch synthesis. A similar stimulation was seen in labelling experiments with wild-type tubers that were attached to water-stressed wild-type plants. These changes were almost completely suppressed in transformants with a 70-80% reduction of SPS activity. (iii) Decreased irrigation led to an increase in the fraction of the dry-matter allocated to tubers in wild-type plants. This shift in allocation was prevented in transformants with reduced expression of SPS. (iv) The results show that operation of SPS and the sucrose cycle in growing potato tubers may lead to a marginal decrease in starch accumulation in non-stressed plants. However, SPS becomes a crucial factor in water-stressed plants because it is required for adaptive changes in tuber metabolism and whole plant allocation. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atubers 3awater stress 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3asucrose 3agene expression 3ahexosyltransferases 3astarch 3aantisense DNA 3atransgenic plants 3aisotope labeling 3alight 3amannitol 3anucleotide sequences 0agenetic regulation 0ainhibition 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x734771 aReimholz, R.1 aDeiting, U.1 aSonnewald, U.1 aStitt, M.0 tplant journal.g1999 July, v. 19, no. 2 p.119-129x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00506.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03336naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245012000193300001800313520164000331650001701971650001201988650004702000650006102047650002102108650001102129650000902140650000902149650002302158650003802181650004202219650004702261650003702308650005602345650005202401653001502453653002302468653002602491700001802517700002202535700001402557773012402571852000902695856009202704930003302796946001302829655001202842IND4404867420221120194052.0080425e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440486742DNAL7 a181944362pmid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05225.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButt, Christopher10aEndogenous cannabinoid anandamide inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function in mouse thalamic synaptosomes  ap. 1235-1243.  aThe effects of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide [arachidonylethanolamide (AEA)] on the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) were investigated using the ⁸⁶Rb⁺ efflux assay in thalamic synaptosomes. AEA reversibly inhibited ⁸⁶Rb⁺ efflux induced by 300 μM ACh with an IC₅₀ value of 0.9 ± 2 μM. Pre-treatment with the cannabinoid (CB₁) receptor antagonist SR141716A (1 μM), the CB₂ receptor antagonist SR144528 (1 μM), or pertussis toxin (0.2 mg/mL) did not alter the inhibitory effects of AEA, suggesting that known CB receptors are not involved in AEA inhibition of nAChRs. AEA inhibition of ⁸⁶Rb⁺ efflux was not reversed by increasing acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations. In radioligand binding studies, the specific binding of [³H]-nicotine was not altered in the presence of AEA, indicating that AEA inhibits the function of nAChR in a non-competitive manner. Neither the amidohydrolase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mM) nor the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, (5 μM) affected AEA inhibition of nAChRs, suggesting that the effect of AEA is not mediated by its metabolic products. Importantly, the extent of AEA inhibition of ⁸⁶Rb⁺ efflux was significantly attenuated by the absence of 1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin pre-treatment, supporting previous findings that fatty acid-like compounds modulate the activity of nAChRs. Collectively, the results indicate that AEA inhibits the function of nAChRs in thalamic synaptosomes via a CB-independent mechanism and that the background activity of these receptors is affected by fatty acids and AEA. 3acannabinoids 2aAnimals 2aArachidonic Acidsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCannabinoid Receptor Modulatorsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aEndocannabinoids 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNicotinic Antagonistsxmetabolism 2aPolyunsaturated Alkamidesxmetabolism 2aProtein Bindingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aReceptors, Nicotinicxphysiology 2aSynaptosomesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aThalamusxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aanandamide 0anicotinic receptor 0athalamic synaptosomes1 aAlptekin, Alp1 aShippenberg, Toni1 aOz, Murat0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 May, v. 105, no. 4 p.1235-1243dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05225.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03002naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245020900167300001600376500001500392520167600407650002602083650002002109650002002129650001902149650001402168650001702182650001802199650001802217650002102235650002502256653001002281653002302291700002202314700001502336773007102351852000902422856009202431930003302523945001302556946001102569655001202580IND2202574720221120173757.0000215e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220257472DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00499.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCercos, M.10aHormonal regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene, EPB-1, in barley aleurone layers: cis- and trans-acting elements involved in the co-ordinated gene expression regulated by gibberellins and abscisic acid  ap. 107-118.  a2019-12-04  aThe synthesis of EPB, a cysteine proteinase responsible for the degradation of seed endosperm storage proteins in barley (Hordeum vulgare), is induced by gibberellins (GA) and repressed by abscisic acid (ABA). The EPB gene family consists of two very similar members, EPB-1 and EPB-2, with the former being more highly induced by GA. We have functionally characterized the cis-acting elements in the EPB-1 promoter and determined that a gibberellin response element (GARE), a pyrimidine box and an upstream element are necessary for GA induction. By comparison with the promoters of alpha-amylase genes, which are also induced by GA, we suggest that GARE is coupled with the upstream element and the pyrimidine box to form a GA response complex. In addition, we have shown that the 3'-untranslated/untranscribed region of the EPB-1 gene is required for a low background expression in the absence of GA. Constitutive expression of a transcription factor, GAMyb, in the absence of GA leads to the transactivation of EPB-1 expression in a dosage dependent manner with the highest level comparable to that in fully GA-induced tissue. Co-expression of a truncated version of GAMyb containing only the DNA binding domain blocks the GA-induction of EPB-1, further supporting the role of GAMyb in the regulation of gene expression. Although ABA is very effective in blocking the GA induction of EPB-1, it has no effect on the GAMyb-mediated expression of EPB-1. We suggest that ABA acts upstream of the formation of functional GAMyb which co-ordinates the hormonal regulation of a diverse group of genes in cereal aleurone layers, including those encoding EPB and alpha-amylases. 3atranscription factors 3aHordeum vulgare 3agene expression 3aaleurone layer 3aendosperm 3agibberellins 3aabscisic acid 3aalpha-amylase 3apromoter regions 3acysteine proteinases 0aseeds 0agenetic regulation1 aGomez-Cadenas, A.1 aHo, T.H.D.0 tplant journal.g1999 July, v. 19, no. 2 p.107-118x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00499.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03800naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245013400192300001600326500001500342520154100357650002501898650001301923650001701936650001801953650002301971650002501994650002002019650002802039650002302067650001902090650001202109650001702121650003702138650003802175650003602213650005302249650003502302650003202337650001402369650002702383650002802410650003802438650002402476650001302500650001402513650003302527650003102560650004202591650002902633650003302662650001902695650001302714650002602727653001502753653002602768700001702794700001802811700002002829773007102849852000902920856009202929930003303021945001303054946001103067655001203078IND2202576620221122002021.0000215e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220257662DNAL7 a104760632pmid7 a10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00513.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomma, B.P.H.J.10aDeficiency in phytoalexin production causes enhanced susceptibility of Arabidopsis thaliana to the fungus Alternaria brassicicola  ap. 163-171.  a2019-12-04  aThe phytoalexin-deficient Arabidopsis mutant pad3-1, which is affected in the production of the indole-type phytoalexin camalexin, has previously been shown not to display altered susceptibility to either the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (Glazebrook and Ausubel, 1994; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91: 8955-8959) or the biotrophic fungi Peronospora parasitica (Glazebrook et al., 1997; Genetics, 146: 381-392) and Erysiphe orontii (Reuber et al., 1998; Plant J. 16: 473-485). We now show that this mutant is markedly more susceptible than its wild-type parental line to infection by the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria brassicicola, but not to Botrytis cinerea. A strong camalexin response was elicited in wild-type plants inoculated with either Alternaria brassicicola or Botrytis cinerea, whereas no camalexin could be detected in pad3-1 challenged with these fungi. Hence, PAD3 appears to be a key determinant in resistance to at least A. brassicicola. The induction of salicylate-dependent and jasmonate/ethylene-dependent defense genes was not reduced in Alternaria-challenged pad3-1 plants compared to similarly treated wild-type plants. Camalexin production could not be triggered by exogenous application of either salicylate, ethylene or jasmonate and was not, or not strongly, reduced in mutants with defects in perception of these defense-related signal molecules. Camalexin-production appears to be controlled by a pathway that exhibits little crosstalk with salicylate-, ethylene- and jasmonate-dependent signalling events. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aethylene 3abiosynthesis 3ajasmonic acid 3adefense mechanisms 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3aAlternaria brassicicola 3adisease resistance 3asalicylic acid 3amutants 3aphytoalexins 2aAlternariaxgrowth & development 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxmetabolism 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aBotrytisxgrowth & development 2aCyclopentanesxpharmacology 2aDefensins 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIndolesxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aOxylipins 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Extractsxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aSalicylic Acidxpharmacology 2aSesquiterpenes 2aTerpenes 2aThiazolesxmetabolism 0ametabolism 0abiological resistance1 aNelissen, I.1 aEggermont, K.1 aBroekaert, W.F.0 tplant journal.g1999 July, v. 19, no. 2 p.163-171x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00513.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02337naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245010500143300001800248500001500266520100400281650002001285650002901305650001101334650002501345650002601370650001301396650002001409650003701429650002601466653002701492653001901519653001901538653001901557653002101576653001801597700001801615700001701633700001601650700001601666700001501682773008001697852000901777930003301786945002501819946001101844655001201855IND4372143120221120163731.0050711e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437214312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Homogeneous sets consisting of N, P and L plasmids derived from one virus were able to generate reporter gene expression from either mini-genomic construct. Heterogeneous sets of proteins from different viruses were not functional, with the exception that a low level of activity was obtained when MV N and P protein were combined with RPV L protein in the rescue of the MV mini-genomic construct, or CDV N was combined with RPV P and L in the rescue of the RPV mini-genome. However, only homogeneous sets of plasmids were able to rescue infectious virus from full-length anti-genome-expressing plasmids. 3aphosphoproteins 3aRinderpest morbillivirus 3agenome 3aCanine morbillivirus 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3anucleocapsid proteins 0aCanine distemper virus 0alarge proteins 0agenetic rescue 0aviral proteins 0aRinderpest virus 0aMeasles virus1 aCollins, F.M.1 aDuprex, W.P.1 aBaron, M.D.1 aBarrett, T.1 aRima, B.K.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 Apr., v. 86 p.1077-1081x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02907naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245017600176300001800352520160300370653002701973653001502000653002902015653002202044653002802066653001702094700002102111700002502132700002002157700002602177700002302203700002002226773014002246852000902386856009202395930003302487946001302520655001202533IND4406404020221120163713.0080606e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440640402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05297.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiacentini, Roberto10aDysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis is responsible for neuronal death in an experimental model of selective hippocampal degeneration induced by trimethyltin  ap. 2109-2121.  aTrimethyltin (TMT) intoxication is considered a suitable experimental model to study the molecular basis of selective hippocampal neurodegeneration as that occurring in several neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously shown that rat hippocampal neurons expressing the Ca²⁺-binding protein calretinin (CR) are spared by the neurotoxic action of TMT hypothetically owing to their ability to buffer intracellular Ca²⁺ overload. The present study was aimed at determining whether intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis dysregulation is involved in the TMT-induced neurodegeneration and if intracellular Ca²⁺-buffering mechanisms may exert a protective action in this experimental model of neurodegeneration. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, TMT produced time- and concentration-dependent [Ca²⁺]i increases that were primarily due to Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores although Ca²⁺ entry through Cav1 channels also contributed to [Ca²⁺]i increases in the early phase of TMT action. Cell pre-treatment with the Ca²⁺ chelator, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (2 μM) significantly reduced the TMT-induced neuronal death. Moreover, CR⁺ neurons responded to TMT with smaller [Ca²⁺]i increases. Collectively, these data suggest that the neurotoxic action of TMT is mediated by Ca²⁺ homeostasis dysregulation, and the resistance of hippocampal neurons to TMT (including CR⁺ neurons) is not homogeneous among different neuron populations and is related to their ability to buffer intracellular Ca²⁺ overload. 0acalcium dyshomeostasis 0acalretinin 0aconfocal calcium imaging 0aneurodegeneration 0arat hippocampal neurons 0atrimethyltin1 aGangitano, Carlo1 aCeccariglia, Sabrina1 aFà, Aurora Del1 aAzzena, Gian Battista1 aMichetti, Fabrizio1 aGrassi, Claudio0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2008 June, v. 105, no. 6 p.2109-2121dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:28254x1474-16447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05297.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03808naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100002100171245017000192300001800362500002400380520198400404650001202388650001902400650002102419650001402440650002502454650002402479650001602503650001702519650001302536650001802549650001202567650001202579650002502591650001402616650001602630650002002646650002402666650002402690650002702714653003802741653001602779700002402795700001802819700001902837700001802856773014902874852000903023856007703032856004003109930003303149945002503182946001103207655001203218IND4405542620181004000000.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440554262DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.32382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSárraga, Carmen10aNutritional and sensory qualities of raw meat and cooked brine-injected turkey breast as affected by dietary enrichment with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and vitamin E  ap. 1448-1454.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: This aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding turkeys with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and vitamin E on the fatty acid profile, proteolytic enzyme activities and oxidative status of raw breast meat and cooked brine-injected breast meat. Four treatments were investigated: T1, basal diet (control); T2, basal diet plus 15 g kg⁻¹ DHA; T3, basal diet plus 100 mg kg⁻¹ vitamin E; T4, basal diet plus 5.4 g kg⁻¹ DHA plus 100 mg kg⁻¹ vitamin E. A sensory analysis of cooked brine-injected breasts was conducted in order to assess the sensory characteristics of these products and relate them to the expected nutritional benefits.RESULTS: Among the four treatments tested, no differences were observed in enzyme activities. No activities of cathepsin B, cathepsins B + L and catalase were detected in cooked brine-injected breast meat. Glutathione peroxidase activity was reduced and superoxide dismutase activity was similar to that measured in raw meat. The diets supplemented with DHA increased eicosapentaenoic acid and DHA levels in comparison with the control in both raw and cooked products. The increase in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) led to a reduction in n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio to values between 1.01 ± 0.11 and 2.94 ± 0.47. In cooked brine-injected breast, treatment with 15 g kg⁻¹ DHA (T2) induced a considerable fishy flavour, while treatment with 5.4 g kg⁻¹ DHA plus 100 mg kg⁻¹ vitamin E (T4) induced a slight fishy flavour. However, fishy odour in T4 did not differ significantly from that of the control.CONCLUSION: By feeding turkeys with 5.4 g kg⁻¹ pure DHA plus 100 mg kg⁻¹ vitamin E, the nutritional quality is improved through the introduction of a natural antioxidant and the reduction in n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio. With this treatment the sensory characteristics were similar to those of control samples, except for the fishy flavour, which could probably be masked by modifying the technological process. 3aturkeys 3aturkey feeding 3afeed supplements 3avitamin E 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3avitamin supplements 3aturkey meat 3ameat quality 3araw meat 3abreast muscle 3acooking 3abrining 3aantioxidant activity 3aoff odors 3aoff flavors 3anutritive value 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3afatty acid composition 0acooked brine-injected breast meat 0abreast meat1 aGuàrdia, M.

An extracellular protease (Hnsp) was detected in liquid culture of Hirsutella rhossiliensis OWVT-1 with nematodes (Panagrellus redivivus) as the unique nitrogen source and purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Its molecular mass was about 32 kDa, and the optimal reaction pH value and temperature were pH 7 and 40°C, respectively. The Hnsp activity was stable at pH 6-8 and decreased radically at 50°C for 10 min. Hnsp was highly sensitive to inhibitor of PMSF and well decomposed the substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, suggesting that it belonged to the chymotrypsin/subtilisin of serine proteases. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of Hnsp was SVTDQQGADCGLARISHRE, which showed high homology with other serine proteases from nematophagous fungi. Ability to kill nematode and degrade its cuticle in vitro indicated that Hnsp could be involved in the infection of nematode. 3aHirsutella rhossiliensis 3anematophagous fungi 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntinematodal Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHypocrealesxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNematodaxdrug effects 2aPhenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoridexpharmacology 2aProtease Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 0apurification 0acharacterization 0aserine protease1 aWu, Wenping 1 aLiu, Xingzhong 0 tMycopathologia.g2007 Mar., v. 163, no. 3 p.169-176dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0301-486X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11046-007-0100-y3electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02768naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007300144300001400217520135800231650000901589650002701598650002301625650001401648650002001662650002301682650001801705650001401723650001901737650002001756650001301776650002601789650001201815650002801827650001801855650002201873650001101895650002501906650001301931650004901944650002301993650002602016650001002042700002002052700001602072773008202088852000902170930003302179945001302212946001302225655001202238IND2200979420221120143712.0991007e199901  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220097942DNAL7 a99218272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMussa, D.M.10aHigh-pressure destruction kinetics of Listeria monocytogenes on pork  ap. 40-45.  aPackaged fresh pork chops (30-g samples) containing an indigenous bacterial population of approximately 10(7) CFU/g were inoculated with 10(7) CFU of Listeria monocytogenes Scott A per g, heat sealed, and subjected to high-pressure processing at 200 to 400 MPa for up to 90 min. Total counts and the number of surviving L. monocytogenes cells were determined by a spread plate technique on tryptic soy agar and modified Oxford medium, respectively. The pressure destruction was characterized by a dual-behavior, consisting of a step change in the number of survivors (P(ko)) with the application of a pressure pulse and a first-order rate drop in the number of survivors during the pressure hold period. Higher pressures resulted in higher rates of microbial inactivation, as indicated by their associated lower D values (and higher k values). The pressure sensitivities of the kinetic parameters were evaluated on the basis of Arrhenius and pressure death time (PDT)-type models. The results suggested that L. monocytogenes was more resistant to pressure inactivation than the indigenous microflora (the volume change of activation, deltaV(not equal to)[Arrhenius model]), and z(p) values (PDT model) were -4.17 x 10(-5) m(3) mole(-1) and 134 MPa for indigenous microflora and -3.43 x 10(-5) m(3) mole(-1) and 163 MPa for L. monocytogenes respectively. 3apork 3aListeria monocytogenes 3apressure treatment 3amortality 3adecontamination 3afood contamination 3aculture media 3adetection 3amicroorganisms 3afood processing 3akinetics 3abiological resistance 2aAnimals 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFood Handling 2aFood Microbiology 2aHumans 2aHydrostatic Pressure 2aKinetics 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aMeat-Packing Industry 2aSwine1 aRamaswamy, H.S.1 aSmith, J.P.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.40-45x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02529naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245016400129300001600293520122100309650003901530650003701569650002201606650001501628650001501643650001601658650001201674650001001686650002501696650002101721650001401742650002501756650001301781650002501794700001601819700001501835700001701850700001901867700001801886700001701904773011901921856004602040852000902086655001202095IND60617826320221120143606.0181026e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061782632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yancun10aComplete genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis SLPE1-3, a novel lactic acid bacterium causing postharvest decay of the mushroom Pleurotus eryngii  ap. 467-476.  aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis is a pathogenic bacterium causing postharvest decay of the cultivated mushroom Pleurotus eryngii, whose pathogenic mechanism is little known. Sequencing of its complete genome is a prerequisite for revealing the molecular mechanism of infection. In this research, the complete genome of SLPE1-3 was obtained using the Single Molecular Real Time (SMRT) sequencing strategy. The genome was analyzed both structurally and functionally. The complete genome of SLPE1-3 consists of a single, circular chromosome (2,522,493 bp; 34.91% GC content) without any plasmid. The results showed the feasibility and superiority of SMRT in bacterial complete-genome research. The genome of SLPE1-3 has the specific features of L. lactis subsp. lactis not just in the phylogenesis and genome structure, but also in functional classification. Compared with L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403, L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 and L. lactis subsp. lactis KF147, 23 peculiar genes were identified in SLPE1-3 which were involved in lipid metabolism, cell wall biogenesis and some functional enzymes. In addition, 37 potential genes relating to antifungal function were filtered for further mechanism research. 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aPleurotus eryngii 3abiogenesis 3acell walls 3achromosomes 3aenzymes 3agenes 3alactic acid bacteria 3alipid metabolism 3amushrooms 3anucleotide sequences 3aplasmids 3apostharvest diseases1 aZhu, Runjie1 aWang, Ying1 aSong, Zhiwei1 aShan, Chengjun1 aQiu, Jingping1 aLiu, Fenquan0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2018 Oct., v. 100, no. 3 p.467-476dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s42161-018-0101-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245011800129300001600247520118300263650003501446650002001481650002401501650002201525650001301547650002401560650001001584650002301594650001701617650001301634650001701647650001501664650001401679651001001693700001801703700001901721700001901740700001601759700002001775700001701795700001801812700001601830773011901846856004601965852000902011655001202020IND60617826220221120143428.0181026e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061782622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Tongbing10aEvaluating multiple resistance to major diseases in a core set of inbred lines of Brassica rapa at seedling stage  ap. 457-465.  aYears of continuous cropping of Brassica rapa crops in main producing areas in China lead to the outbreak of some diseases, such as downy mildew (DM), turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), black rot (BR), verticillium wilt (VW), and club root (CR), causing severe loss in yield and quality. Resistance to the aforementioned diseases of 302 inbred lines of Brassica rapa to DM, TuMV, BR, VW, and CR were evaluated under controlled conditions at seedling stage. Forty lines were identified to be highly resistant to DM, 13 to TuMV, 0 to BR, 30 to VW, and 24 to CR. Among the 302 lines, 121 exhibited high resistance to two diseases, 70 to three diseases, and eight to four diseases, but none of these lines showed comprehensive resistance to all the five diseases. Chinese cabbage lines XDYFX, 536S, 536Q, DY×T, and CR-C, and Pak choi lines DFAK×SH, NB, and SYHTC showed high resistance to four diseases and therefore represent elite materials in multiple-disease resistance breeding. In addition, different disease resistance tendencies were discovered in diverse Chinese cabbage groups which were classified in different ways, such as the ecotype, heading-type, and geographical origin. 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aChinese cabbage 3aTurnip mosaic virus 3aVerticillium wilt 3abreeding 3acontinuous cropping 3acrops 3adisease resistance 3adowny mildew 3aecotypes 3ainbred lines 3aprovenance 3aseedlings 3aChina1 aYu, Shuancang1 aGong, Zhenping1 aZhang, Fenglan1 aYu, Yangjun1 aZhang, Deshuang1 aZhao, Xiuyun1 aWang, Weihong1 aLi, Peirong0 tJournal of plant pathology.g2018 Oct., v. 100, no. 3 p.457-465dEdizioni ETSwJournal:jnl4181443x1125-46537nnas40uhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s42161-018-0095-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009600146300001400242500001500256520149200271650002501763650001801788650001701806650001601823650002301839650001001862650001801872650001401890650001201904650002301916650003901939650004501978650002202023650002502045650002602070650001202096650003902108653001402147653001602161653001502177700002202192773008202214852000902296930003302305945001302338946001302351655001202364IND2200980320221120143443.0991007e199901  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220098032DNAL7 a99218312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeger, S. de10aFlow-through membrane-based enzyme immunoassay for rapid detection of ochratoxin A in wheat  ap. 65-69.  a2019-12-05  aA flow-through membrane-based enzyme immunoassay for the rapid detection of ochratoxin A in wheat was developed (patent pending). An Immunodyne ABC membrane was coated with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins and free protein binding sites were blocked. After these antibody-coated membranes were placed on an absorbent layer in a plastic test device, a sequential competitive enzyme immunoassay was performed. The following reactants were successively dropped onto the membrane: wash solution, a dilution of monoclonal anti-ochratoxin A immunoglobulins, wash solution, ochratoxin A standard solution or sample extract solution, a dilution of ochratoxin A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and wash solution. Finally, substrate solution (H(2)O(2)-3,3',5,5'- tetramethylbenzidine) was added for color reaction. The dot color intensity on the membrane was visually compared with that of the negative control, which showed the most intense blue color because of the inverse relationship between toxin concentration and color development. A portable colorimeter was used to confirm and quantify the visual observations. An ochratoxin A concentration of 0.4 ng/ml in buffer solution suppressed the color development completely. With the use of a simple sample preparation procedure it was possible to eliminate matrix interference. A wheat sample spiked with 4 microgram/kg resulted in a complete color suppression. With coated membranes, the immunoassay could be performed in less than 15 min. 3achemical composition 3afood analysis 3aimmunoassays 3aochratoxins 3afood contamination 3awheat 3abinding sites 3adetection 2aAnimals 2aFood Contamination 2aHorseradish Peroxidaseximmunology 2aImmunoenzyme Techniquesxinstrumentation 2aMicropore Filters 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aOchratoxinsxanalysis 2aRabbits 2aTriticumxchemistryxmicrobiology. 0amembranes 0amethodology 0aevaluation1 aPeteghem, C. van.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 Jan., v. 62, no. 1 p.65-69x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02611naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100002100165245015800186300001800344500002400362500001500386520076100401650002101162650001801183650001401201650001701215650004301232650001901275650003301294650001601327650001501343650001101358650001201369650001301381650004201394650005001436650002001486650003101506650001901537650003701556650003101593650001301624653001701637653002301654700001901677700001901696773016101715852000901876856007701885930003301962945002501995946001302020655001202033IND4405590520221120143530.0080513e20080514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440559052DNAL7 a184191252pmid7 a10.1021/jf07354322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5031 aMariutti, L.R.B.10aOptimization and Validation of Analytical Conditions for Cholesterol and Cholesterol Oxides Extraction in Chicken Meat Using Response Surface Methodology  ap. 2913-2918.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe analytical conditions for the extraction of cholesterol and cholesterol oxides in chicken meat were optimized by means of response surface methodology.

Heat treatments can significantly affect viscous properties, which have functional and nutritional importance. Oat flour slurries (23%, w/w, solids dry basis) made from steamed (for 20 min) or autoclaved (at 121 degrees C, 15 psi, for 10 min) grain developed high viscosities, whereas flour slurries made from raw or kilned (105 degrees C for 90 min) oats did not. Flour slurries made from raw groats, surface-sterilized by 1% hypochlorite, were more viscous than untreated raw groat flour slurries, suggesting that beta-glucan hydrolases on the surface of the groat caused the viscosity losses observed in raw or kilned groats. However, because viscosities developed by surface-sterilized groats were not as great as in steamed oat-flour slurries and because some roasting treatments also inactivated enzymes without enhancing viscosity, it appears steaming might also affect the beta-glucan polymer, resulting in its greater hydration in solution. Smaller particle size and higher incubation temperature also resulted in increased flour slurry viscosity, presumably because of increased hydration of the beta-glucan. Removal of lipids from steamed oat flour significantly increased the oat flour slurry viscosity, apparently by increasing the beta-glucan concentration in the flour. 3acultivars 3aoats 3aviscosity 3aparticle size 3aroasting 3alipids 3aduration 3awater content 3aflour 3asteaming 3aextraction 3amixtures 3aautoclaving 0aheat treatment1 aDoehlert, D.C.1 aMoore, W.R.0 tCereal chemistry.g1997 , v. 74, no. 6 p.722-726x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.6.7223Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02028naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001500147245014700162300001600309520086700325650001601192650001701208650001801225650001201243650001401255650002001269650001801289650001301307650001401320650002101334650004301355700001901398773007001417852000901487856008701496930003301583945001301616946001301629655001201642IND2123818420221120133228.0980706e199712  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212381842DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.6.7582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBean, S.R.10aSeparation of wheat proteins by two-dimensional reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography plus free zone capillary electrophoresis  ap. 758-765.  aGliadins and glutenins from four hard red winter wheat cultivars were separated by a novel two-dimensional (2D) technique.

Those fractions were then separated by free-zone capillary electrophoresis (FZCE) for the second dimension. Data was combined into 2D surface contour plots similar to traditional gel electrophoresis 2D maps. For HPLC, C8 and C18 columns were used in the first dimension to separate gliadins and glutenins, respectively. Uncoated fused silica capillaries (27 cm x 25 micrometers, i.d.) were used for the 2D FZCE separations.

The aim of the present study was to determine the bioavailability of Fe in cocoa using the Hb regeneration efficiency (HRE) method. Thirty-five F344/N male weanling rats were fed a low-Fe diet for 4 weeks to deplete body Fe stores. Then, four groups of seven animals each were repleted for 20 d using a modified AIN-93G diet fortified with ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate or two brands of cocoa powder to provide a total dietary Fe concentration of 20 mg/kg. As a negative control, seven rats were maintained on the low-Fe diet. The HRE were 0·733, 0·350, 0·357 and 0·336 for ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate and the two brands of cocoa powder, respectively. The relative biological values (RBV), defined as the ratio of the sample HRE to that of ferrous sulphate, were 0·478, 0·488 and 0·459 for ferric citrate and the two brands of cocoa powder, respectively. The Fe bioavailability of cocoa was significantly less than that of ferrous sulphate and was similar to that of ferric citrate. The difference in Fe bioavailability between the two brands of cocoa powder was negligible. When the negative control was used to correct the data, estimates of the RBV derived from Hb gain were similar to those derived from the HRE. These results suggest that cocoa is a significant source of moderately bioavailable Fe. 3airon 3adietary minerals 3anutrient availability 3airon deficiency anemia 3ahemoglobin 3acocoa powder 3arats 3aexperimental diets 3aanimal disease models 3anutrient deficiencies 3arepletion 3aferrous sulfate 3afood intake 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBiological Availability 2aBody Weight 2aCacao 2aFerric Compoundsxadministration & dosage 2aFerrous Compoundsxadministration & dosage 2aHematinicsxadministration & dosage 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aIron, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aModels, Animal 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F344 2aWeaning 0ahemoglobin regeneration efficiency 0aferric citrate1 aKonomi, Aki1 aOtagi, Miki0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2009 July, v. 102, no. 2 p.215-220dCambridge University Pressx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145081491823Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b20091002c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/08/06  aNon-US 7aarticle04081naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002700181245015700208300001800365500002400383506007600407520173800483506003702221650001002258650001602268650001202284650001502296650002102311650001302332650003902345650004202384650003002426650001702456650001802473650002602491650001602517650001102533650001402544650001302558650002702571650001802598650003202616650001402648650003102662650001202693650002102705650005402726650001702780650004302797650001002840650004402850650004102894650004102935650004102976650004703017651001803064700001903082700001903101700002003120700002503140773011703165852000903282856008003291655001203371IND4437358220221207062541.0100522s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443735822DNAL7 a203083012pmid7 aPMC28765642pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01435-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStearns-Kurosawa, D.J.10aDistinct Physiologic and Inflammatory Responses Elicited in Baboons after Challenge with Shiga Toxin Type 1 or 2 from Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli  ap. 2497-2504.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aShiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli is a principal source of regional outbreaks of bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome in the United States and worldwide. Primary bacterial virulence factors are Shiga toxin types 1 and 2 (Stx1 and Stx2), and we performed parallel analyses of the pathophysiologies elicited by the toxins in nonhuman primate models to identify shared and unique consequences of the toxemias. After a single intravenous challenge with purified Stx1 or Stx2, baboons (Papio) developed thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute renal failure with loss of glomerular function, in a dose-dependent manner. Differences in the timing and magnitude of physiologic responses were observed between the toxins. The animals were more sensitive to Stx2, with mortality at lower doses, but Stx2-induced renal injury and mortality were delayed 2 to 3 days compared to those after Stx1 challenge. Multiplex analyses of plasma inflammatory cytokines revealed similarities (macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) and differences (interleukin-6 [IL-6] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) elicited by the toxins with respect to the mediator induced and timing of the responses. Neither toxin induced detectable levels of plasma TNF-α. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the in vivo consequences of the toxins have been compared in a parallel and reproducible manner in nonhuman primates, and the data show similarities to patient observations. The availability of experimental nonhuman primate models for Stx toxemias provides a reproducible platform for testing antitoxin compounds and immunotherapeutics with outcome criteria that have clinical meaning.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPapio 3aShiga toxin 3aanimals 3aantitoxins 3achemoattractants 3adiarrhea 3aenterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 3agranulocyte colony-stimulating factor 3ahemolytic uremic syndrome 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3aintravenous injection 3amacrophages 3amodels 3amortality 3apatients 3aphysiological response 3arenal failure 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avirulence 2aAnemiaxchemically induced 2aAnimals 2aCytokinesxblood 2aEnterohemorrhagic Escherichia colixpathogenicity 2aInflammation 2aMonkey Diseasesxmortalityxpathology. 2aPapio 2aRenal Insufficiencyxchemically induced 2aShiga Toxin 1ximmunologyxtoxicity. 2aShiga Toxin 2ximmunologyxtoxicity. 2aThrombocytopeniaxchemically induced 2aToxemiaxmortalityxpathologyxveterinary. 3aUnited States1 aCollins, Valta1 aFreeman, Scott1 aTesh, Vernon L.1 aKurosawa, Shinichiro0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 June, v. 78, no. 6 p.2497-2504dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01435-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03887naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002500182245013400207300001600341500002400357520168400381650001602065650000902081650002102090650002602111650002202137650001102159650000902170650002002179650002302199650002502222650002302247650002102270650001602291650001802307650001602325650001202341650002302353650001602376650002302392650000902415650003902424650000902463650002302472650001502495650003602510650004102546650000902587650002502596650002202621650002702643650003402670650002802704650001202732650003402744700002102778700002602799700002102825700001702846773011502863852000902978856008502987930003303072945002503105946001103130655001203141IND4423498820221120102724.0090723e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442349882DNAL7 a192228742pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145081590372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aMerrells, Krystal J.10aRelationship between abnormal sperm morphology induced by dietary zinc deficiency and lipid composition in testes of growing rats  ap. 226-232.  aIncludes references  aThe present study investigated the effect of dietary Zn deficiency during sexual maturation on sperm integrity and testis phospholipid fatty acid composition. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised into four dietary groups for 3 weeks: Zn control (ZC; 30 mg Zn/kg); Zn marginally deficient (ZMD; 9 mg Zn/kg); Zn deficient (ZD; < 1 mg Zn/kg); pair fed (PF; 30 mg Zn/kg) to the ZD group. Morphology of cauda epididymal sperm and lipid profiles of testis phospholipids were analysed. The rats fed the ZD diet had a lower testis weight (P < 0·02). Seminal vesicles and prostate weight were also lower in the ZD and PF groups. Rats fed the ZD diet, but not the ZMD diet, had 34-35 % more abnormal spermatozoa and 24 % shorter sperm tail length than the ZC and PF rats (P < 0·001). Testis cholesterol concentration was higher in the ZD rats compared with the ZC and PF rats (P < 0·04). Testes were highly enriched with n-6 fatty acids by showing n-6 : n-3 fatty acid ratios of 27:1 in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and 23:1 in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The dominant fatty acid in testes was docosapentaenoic acid (22 : 5n-6), comprising 15 and 24 % of PC and PE, respectively. This fatty acid was significantly lower in the ZD rats, whereas 18 : 2n-6 was higher compared with the rats in the other diet groups. These results demonstrate that severe Zn deficiency adversely affects sperm integrity and modulates testis fatty acid composition by interrupting essential fatty acid metabolism. This suggests that Zn deficiency-associated abnormal testicular function is perhaps preceded by altered membrane fatty acid composition, especially of a major fatty acid, 22 : 5n-6. 3aspermatozoa 3azinc 3adietary minerals 3anutrient deficiencies 3alipid composition 3atestes 3arats 3asexual maturity 3aexperimental diets 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3atriacylglycerols 3acholesterol 3aanimal models 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBody Weight 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDiet 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxanalysis 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aOrgan Size 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxchemistry 2aPhosphatidylethanolaminesxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSexual Maturation 2aSpermatozoaxpathology 2aTestisxchemistryxpathology. 2aTriglyceridesxanalysis 2aWeaning 2aZincxdeficiencyxmetabolism.1 aBlewett, Heather1 aJamieson, Jennifer A.1 aTaylor, Carla G.1 aSuh, Miyoung0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2009 July, v. 102, no. 2 p.226-232dCambridge University Pressx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145081590373Available from publisher's Web site  a20090905b20091002c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/08/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02508naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001600147245007900163300001600242520118900258650000901447650001201456650001301468650001601481650001501497650001501512650001401527650002301541650002801564650003001592650001501622653001001637653000901647653001501656653001501671653001601686653001401702653001501716700002001731700001801751700002001769773007001789852000901859856008701868930003301955945001301988946001302001655001202014IND2123821620221120092855.0980706e199712  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212382162DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.6.8582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKatta, S.K.10aDistribution of Fusarium molds and fumonisins in dry-milled corn fractions  ap. 858-863.  aThe distribution of Fusarium molds and fumonisins was determined in commercial and experimental dry-milled corn fractions. Fusarium infection of the commercial whole corn samples ranged from 10 to 28%; F. moniliforme was the predominant species. Fusarium counts in corn fractions were <100 colony-forming units (CFU)/g in flaking grits, <100 -- 6.4 x 10(4) CFU/g in bran, <100 -- 1.6 x 10(4) CFU/g in germ, and <100 -- 2.7 x 10(3) CFU/g in flour. Fumonisin concentrations were less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/g in flaking grits, 0.2-1.1 micrograms/g in flour, 0.1-2.0 micrograms/g in germ, and 1.5-3.2 micrograms/g in bran. Yellow, blue, and white dent corns naturally contaminated with varying levels of fumonisins (25.4, 3.9, and 0.3 micrograms of fumonisin B1 per gram) and Fusarium molds (3.9 x 10(6), 8.0 x 10(5), and 2.6 x 10(4) CFU/g) were experimentally dry milled with a horizontal drum degermer. Number 5 grits contained significantly lower Fusarium counts and fumonisin concentrations than the whole kernel corn. Fusarium counts and fumonisins increased as grit size decreased, and high Fusarium counts and fumonisin concentrations were found in germ, bran, and fines. 3acorn 3amilling 3aFusarium 3aplate count 3acorn flour 3afumonisins 3acultivars 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3afungal diseases of plants 3aoccurrence 0amolds 0agrit 0amaize germ 0amaize bran 0ayellow corn 0ablue corn 0awhite corn1 aCagampang, A.E.1 aJackson, L.S.1 aBullerman, L.B.0 tCereal chemistry.g1997 , v. 74, no. 6 p.858-863x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM.1997.74.6.8583Available from publisher's Web site  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02984naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245011800185300001600303520086700319650002301186650001601209650002201225650001301247650002001260650001301280650001201293650002001305650001001325650001401335650001001349650001801359650002201377650002401399650001001423650001901433650001301452650001701465650002401482650001201506650002301518650003301541650004601574650002601620650002601646650002801672650002401700650004201724650005201766650002301818650001501841650005201856653000901908653002001917700001601937700001601953700001201969700001601981700001101997773012102008852000902129856009202138930003302230946001102263655001202274IND4405727720221120102750.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440572772DNAL7 a183972782pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2008.00795.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, G.-Y.10aMolecular cloning and developmental expression of the vitellogenin gene in the endoparasitoid, Pteromalus puparum  ap. 227-233.  aA cDNA of the vitellogenin (Vg) protein gene was isolated from the endoparasitoid Pteromalus puparum and characterized.

The chemically determined N-terminal amino acid sequence of vitellin completely matched the deduced amino acid sequence that follows a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acid residues. The Vg mRNA was detected in the fat body of late female pupae, whereas the ovary and male fat body lacked the Vg transcript. The Vg mRNA level in the fat body depended significantly on the developmental stage, reaching the highest level 0 h after eclosion. The haemolymph Vg titre appeared 24 h after the appearance of Vg transcript. A positive correlation between the titre and transcript level of Vg in individual female wasps was found. 3aPteromalus puparum 3aamino acids 3acomplementary DNA 3aeclosion 3aendoparasitoids 3afat body 3afemales 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahemolymph 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular cloning 3aopen reading frames 3apupae 3asignal peptide 3avitellin 3avitellogenin 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aHemolymphxmetabolism 2aHymenopteraxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aParasitesxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aTitrimetry 2aVitellogeninsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acDNA 0amRNA expression1 aDong, S.-Z.1 aSong, Q.-S.1 aShi, M.1 aChen, X.-X.1 aHu, C.0 tInsect molecular biology.g2008 June, v. 17, no. 3 p.227-233dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2583.2008.00795.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080516b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02415naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009000165300001200255520104200267650001701309650001901326650001601345650002201361650001001383650002501393650001301418650002201431650001401453650003201467650001701499653002601516653003001542653003301572653003701605700002301642700001901665700002401684773012301708852000901831856008501840930003301925946001101958655001201969IND4401574520221120092744.0080217e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440157452DNAL7 a10.1007/s00438-005-0026-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakayama, Gaku 10aSite-specific gene integration in cultured silkworm cells mediated by φC31 integrase  ap. 1-8.  aThe integrase from the Streptomyces bacteriophage φC31 carries out efficient recombination between an attP site in the phage genome and an attB site in the host chromosome. In the present study, we have used the φC31 integrase system to mediate site-specific recombination in the cultured silkworm cell line BmN4. A plasmid containing a cDNA encoding DsRed flanked by two φC31 attP sites was co-transfected together with a helper plasmid encoding the φC31 integrase into a cell line in which φC31 attB sites inserted between a baculovirus IE2 promoter, and a polyadenylation signal are present in one chromosome. Seven days after transfection, expression of DsRed was observed in transformed cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that the expected recombination between the attB and attP sites had been precisely carried out by the φC31 integrase. These results indicate that the φC31 site-specific recombination system should be widely applicable for efficient site-specific gene integration into silkworm chromosomes. 3aStreptomyces 3abacteriophages 3achromosomes 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aplasmids 3asequence analysis 3asilkworms 3asite-specific recombination 3atransfection 0aφC31 phage integrase 0aSite-specific integration 0aPhage attachment site (attP) 0aBacterial attachment site (attB)1 aKawaguchi, Yutaka 1 aKoga, Katsumi 1 aKusakabe, Takahiro 0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2006 Jan., v. 275, no. 1 p.1-8dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-005-0026-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20080218b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03193naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012100186300001600307520145000323650001301773650001701786650001101803650001501814650002101829650001201850650001201862650001101874650002001885650001501905650001301920650001501933650000901948650002201957650001201979650004701991650002102038650001402059650001402073650002402087650002402111650002402135650002402159651001802183651001102201653000902212653002302221653002702244700002202271700002102293700002102314773010602335852000902441856008502450930003302535946001102568655001202579IND4400463520221120092832.0080127e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440046352DNAL7 a160253562pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-005-0136-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonlan, C.

Nested subset analysis has been advocated as such a tool for the prediction of extinction-prone species and populations. However, such advocacy has not been without skepticism and debate, and in the majority of published examples assessing extinction vulnerability, actual extinctions are based on assumptions rather than direct evidence. Here, we empirically test the power of nested subset analysis to predict extinction-prone species, using documented Holocene insular mammal extinctions on three island archipelagos off the west coast of North America. We go on to test whether the introduction of invasive mammals promotes nestedness on islands via extinction. While all three archipelagos were significantly nested before and after the extinction events, nested subset analysis largely failed to predict extinction patterns. We also failed to detect any correlations between the degree of nestedness at the genus-level with area, isolation, or species richness and extinction risk. Biogeography tools, such as nested subset analysis, must be critically evaluated before they are prescribed widely for conservation planning. For these island archipelagos, it appears detailed natural history and taxa-specific ecology may prove critical in predicting patterns of extinction risk. 3aadvocacy 3abiogeography 3acoasts 3aextinction 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3amammals 3amodels 3anatural history 3anestedness 3aplanning 3aprediction 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcologyxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aGeography 2aMammalsxphysiology 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSpecies Specificity 3aNorth America 0aMexico 0aBaja 0aIntroduced mammals 0aNested subset analysis1 aKnowlton, Jessie 1 aDoak, Daniel F. 1 aBiavaschi, Noah 0 tOecologia.g2005 Sept., v. 145, no. 3 p.475-485dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0136-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080127b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02530naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171072001700188100002100205245010900226300001600335500002400351520085500375650000901230650001601239650002001255650001801275650001501293650001601308650002101324650002201345650001201367650002801379650003001407650001101437650005501448650000901503650002101512650004201533700002301575700002501598700001901623773013101642852000901773856009201782856005501874930003301929945002501962946001301987655001202000IND4405427420221120082156.0080509e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440542742DNAL7 a185467862pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2008.00366.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The sample population consisted of 100 apparently healthy, volunteered, adult dogs. The data were normally distributed, thus mean, SD, and Pearson's correlation were used. Repeatability of ultrasound measures was assessed as the percentage of differences between duplicate measures that were within 2 SDs of the differences: all measures were at least 93% repeatable (differences typically were =0.4 cm with width or height, or >=1.0 cm in length, in a follow up measurement probably represents a true biological change rather than measurement error. 3adogs 3alymph nodes 3aultrasonography 3arepeatability 3aanimal age 3abody weight 2aAge Distribution 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aDogsxanatomy & histology 2aFemale 2aLymph Nodesxanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 2aMale 2aReference Values 2aUltrasonographyxmethodsxveterinary.1 aScrivani, Peter V.1 aTHOMPSON, MARGRET S.1 aERB, HOLLIS N.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2008 , v. 49, no. 3 p.277-281dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2008.00366.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1740-8261.2008.00366.x  a20110617b20110701c00000000  aINDdDFXe2009/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle03464naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245013900195300001600334520165700350650002702007650001902034650001502053650001902068650001202087650001102099650003902110650001202149650001502161650003402176650003502210650007002245650003102315650001402346650002702360650007002387650002402457650002502481653001502506653002702521700002402548700002402572700001902596700002102615700002002636773012102656852000902777856009202786930003302878946001102911655001202922IND4404237320221120092727.0080412e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440423732DNAL7 a183736852pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00470.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreugelmans, Philip10aArchitecture and spatial organization in a triple-species bacterial biofilm synergistically degrading the phenylurea herbicide linuron  ap. 271-282.  aMembers of a triple-species 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methyl urea (linuron)-mineralizing consortium, i.e. the linuron- and 3,4-dichloroaniline-degrading Variovorax sp. WDL1, the 3,4-dichloroaniline-degrading Comamonas testosteroni WDL7 and the N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine-degrading Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans WDL6, were cultivated as mono- or multi-species biofilms in flow cells irrigated with selective or nonselective media, and examined with confocal laser scanning microscopy. In contrast to mono-species biofilms of Variovorax sp. WDL1, the triple-species consortium biofilm degraded linuron completely through apparent synergistic interactions. The triple-species linuron-fed consortium biofilm displayed a heterogeneous structure with an irregular surface topography that most resembled the topography of linuron-fed mono-species WDL1 biofilms, indicating that WDL1 had a dominating influence on the triple-species biofilm architecture. This architecture was dependent on the carbon source supplied, as the biofilm architecture of WDL1 growing on alternative carbon sources was different from that observed under linuron-fed conditions. Linuron-fed triple-species consortium biofilms consisted of mounds composed of closely associated WDL1, WDL7 and WDL6 cells, while this association was lost when the consortium was grown on a nonselective carbon source. In addition, under linuron-fed conditions, microcolonies displaying associated growth developed rapidly after inoculation. These observations indicate that the spatial organization in the linuron-fed consortium biofilm reflected the metabolic interactions within the consortium. 3aComamonas testosteroni 3aHyphomicrobium 3aVariovorax 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3alinuron 3atopography 2aAniline Compoundsxmetabolism 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aComamonadaceaexisolation & purificationxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDimethylaminesxmetabolism 2aEcosystem 2aHerbicidesxmetabolism 2aHyphomicrobiumxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aLinuronxmetabolism 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 0aconsortium 0ametabolic interactions1 aBarken, Kim Bundvig1 aTolker-Nielsen, Tim1 aHofkens, Johan1 aDejonghe, Winnie1 aSpringael, Dirk0 tFEMS microbiology ecology.g2008 May, v. 64, no. 2 p.271-282dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0168-64967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2008.00470.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080412b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02629naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245008800184300001400272520116800286650001301454650001901467650001001486650000901496650001301505650001301518650001101531650001801542650004601560650009601606650001601702650002301718650002301741653002201764653001001786653001301796653002001809700001401829700001701843700001601860773012601876852000902002856009202011930003302103946001102136655001202147IND4406731320221120082234.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440673132DNAL7 a184983162pmid7 a10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02381.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZemb, O.10aEfficient method to isolate and purify viruses of bacteria from marine environments  ap. 41-45.  aTo isolate viruses of specific heterotrophic bacterial strains from marine environments using a host addition/virus amplification protocol (HAVAP) for use in phage/host systems. Bacteria-free seawater samples containing natural viruses assemblages were inoculated with a single laboratory grown bacterial host of interest in a nutrient-enriched [peptone, Fe(III) and yeast extract] seawater suspension. These conditions enhanced the replication of only those virus(s) capable of infecting the host bacterium. After incubation, free viruses were recovered at concentrations ranging 10⁵-10¹⁰ infectious virus particles per ml of seawater. Using this approach, 15 viruses were isolated and represented 12 unique phage/host systems. Two of the hosts tested were infected by more than one virus. Isolation of high concentrations of specific viruses is possible even if their initial concentrations in native waters are low. This approach allows the recovery of phage/host systems that may not be numerically dominant. This host enrichment protocol for virus detection and isolation is well-suited for aquatic viral ecology studies that require phage/host systems. 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3ahosts 3airon 3apeptones 3aseawater 3avirion 3ayeast extract 2aBacteriaxgrowth & developmentxvirology. 2aBacteriophagesxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aSeawaterxvirology 2aWater Microbiology 0aaquatic ecosystem 0alytic 0aprotocol 0avirus isolation1 aUrios, L.1 aCoetsier, C.1 aLebaron, P.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2008 July, v. 47, no. 1 p.41-45dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2008.02381.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02960naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245006800147300001600215500001500231520153100246650002801777650001001805650002601815650001801841650002701859650001801886650001401904650001501918650004001933650008101973650002802054650002902082650003202111650009002143650003202233653002402265653001902289653001402308700001702322773008302339852000902422930003302431945001302464946001302477655001202490IND2202832420221120082159.0000302e199905  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220283242DNAL7 a103406642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, L.G.10aDevelopment of a new medium for the isolation of Arcobacter spp  ap. 456-462.  a2019-12-05  aArcobacter, the newly reclassified Campylobacter species, has been shown to cause diarrhea in both humans and animals. Few studies have been conducted regarding its occurrence in foods because of the lack of effective isolation and identification methods. The purpose of this study was to develop a plating medium that would be selective for the three most commonly found Arcobacter species. The effect of common components used in media intended for the isolation of Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and other gram-negative rods was examined. These components were divided into five distinct groups: (1) basic growth nutrients, (2) reducing and growth-promoting agents, (3) detoxifying agents, (4) antibiotics, and (5) color-enhancing compounds. Components from each of these groups were tested for their ability to recover Arcobacter on a solid medium when incubated aerobically at 30 degrees C for up to 72 h. Growth was evaluated by the ecometric technique, colony size, and differential colony morphology after incubation. After initial evaluations, five formulas showing the best results were selected and tested in detail and compared with brucella agar. A medium containing a basal nutrient mix along with 0.05% thioglycolic acid, 0.05% sodium pyruvate, and 5% sheep's blood (pH 6.9 +/- 0.2) was found to be the most effective for the growth of A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, and A. nitrofigilis. In addition to superior growth characteristics, a deep red color around the colonies also was observed with this formulation. 3ainterspecific variation 3afoods 3anutrient availability 3aculture media 3aanatomy and morphology 3aCampylobacter 3apathogens 2aAerobiosis 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCampylobacterxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 0aspecies differences 0aidentification 0aisolation1 aMurano, E.A.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 May, v. 62, no. 5 p.456-462x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01631naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245006200161300001600223520064100239650002600880650002500906650001200931650002000943650002500963653001800988653001401006773009701020852000901117856008501126930003301211945001301244946001301257990002301270655001201293IND2059925020221120071804.0970926s1995    nbu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205992502DNAL7 a10.1080/155753395094898562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaffer, R.10aAchieving sustainable economic development in communities  ap. 145-154.  aThe options available for communities to work toward sustainable community economic development are explored through four fundamental elements of community economic development theory.

The dimensions of time, space, marginalized social-economic groups, and dynamic economies broaden the concept of sustainable development beyond the more traditional physical-biological definition. 3acommunity development 3aeconomic development 3amarkets 3adecision making 3alaws and regulations 0aexternalities 0aresources0 tJournal of the Community Development Society.g1995, v. 26, no. 2 p.145-154x0010-38297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/155753395094898563Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03594naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245013600173300001800309520182500327650001502152650002202167650001302189650001002202650002002212650001002232650001202242650001002254650001102264650001902275650002502294650001102319650001402330650003802344651001102382651001402393651001802407651001502425651001602440651001802456651001302474653000902487653002102496653002002517653001402537653001302551653002802564653002102592653000902613653001502622700002102637700002202658700002002680773012302700852000902823856009202832930003302924946001102957655001202968IND4397967920221120082116.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439796792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01749.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, Nigel P.10aMolecular dating of the 'Gondwanan' plant family Proteaceae is only partially congruent with the timing of the break-up of Gondwana  ap. 2012-2027.  aThe flowering plant family Proteaceae is putatively of Gondwanan age, with modern and fossil lineages found on all southern continents. Here we test whether the present distribution of Proteaceae can be explained by vicariance caused by the break-up of Gondwana. Africa, especially southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, South America, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Southeast Asia, Sulawesi, Tasmania. We obtained chloroplast DNA sequence data from the rbcL gene, the rbcL-atpB spacer, and the atpB gene from leaf samples of forty-five genera collected from the field and from living collections. We analysed these data using Bayesian phylogenetic and molecular dating methods, with five carefully selected fossil calibration points to obtain age estimates for the nodes within the family. Four of eight trans-continental disjunctions of sister groups within our sample of the Proteaceae post-date the break-up of Gondwana. These involve independent lineages, two with an Africa-Australia disjunction, one with an Africa-South America disjunction, and one with a New Zealand-Australasia disjunction. The date of the radiation of the bird-pollinated Embothriinae corresponds approximately to the hypothesized date of origin of nectar-feeding birds in Australia. The findings suggest that disjunct distributions in Proteaceae result from both Gondwanan vicariance and transoceanic dispersal. Our results imply that ancestors of some taxa dispersed across oceans rather than rafting with Gondwanan fragments as previously thought. This finding agrees with other studies of Gondwanan plants in dating the divergence of Australian, New Zealand and New Caledonian taxa in the Eocene, consistent with the existence of a shared, ancestral Eocene flora but contrary to a vicariance scenario based on accepted geological knowledge. 3aProteaceae 3aage determination 3aancestry 3abirds 3achloroplast DNA 3aflora 3afossils 3agenes 3aleaves 3anectar feeding 3anucleotide sequences 3aoceans 3aphylogeny 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aAfrica 3aIndonesia 3aNew Caledonia 3aNew Guinea 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth America 3aTasmania 0aAtpB 0aatpB-rbcL spacer 0aBayesian dating 0adispersal 0aGondwana 0ahistorical biogeography 0amolecular dating 0arbcL 0avicariance1 aWeston, Peter H.1 aRutschmann, Frank1 aSauquet, Hervé0 tJournal of biogeography.g2007 Dec., v. 34, no. 12 p.2012-2027dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01749.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071118b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04090naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001700228245007200245300001800317520210500335650002102440650002302461650004302484650001202527650001202539650001802551650001802569650002702587650002002614650001502634650001602649650002502665650001102690650002502701650001502726650001602741650000902757650002302766650002702789650002502816650001602841650003002857650001802887650002302905650001202928650002502940650001102965650002402976650001203000650001703012650000903029651001503038651001503053700001703068700001703085773010503102852000903207856008103216930003303297945002503330946001303355655001203368IND4441220020221120071700.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444122002DNAL7 a207099642pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2010-007182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHarper, L.A.10aAmmonia emissions from broiler production in the San Joaquin Valley  ap. 1802-1814.  aAmmonia is the primary basic gas in the atmosphere and has the most important role in the neutralization of atmospheric acids generated by fossil fuel combustion. The reaction product forms a NH₄⁺ aerosol, which is a major component of atmospheric particulates. These NH₄⁺ particulates are part of atmospheric haze and may be transported long distances from the production site before returning to the surface by dry deposition or scavenged by precipitation. Animal production produces a significant component of anthropogenic NH₃ emissions and the National Academy of Sciences concluded that NH₃ emissions estimates from animal feeding operations have not been characterized sufficiently, leading the US Environmental Protection Agency to institute studies in the United States to obtain NH₃ emissions from animal feeding operations under the US Environmental Protection Agency Air Consent Agreement. The objective of this study is to obtain additional broiler NH₃ emissions estimates using a backward Lagrangian stochastic technique. This technique uses NH₃ concentrations measured upwind and downwind of the farm, wind observations, and atmospheric dispersion model calculations to obtain whole-farm emissions. Ammonia emissions were low at bird placement and increased steadily after about the third week of growth. At the end of the flock (47 d, approximately 297,000 birds), cumulative emissions for the flock cycle period were 0.016 kg of NH₃·bird⁻¹·flock⁻¹. Between-flock emissions, including bird harvest, cleanout, temporary storage of litter outside of the buildings, and downtime (buildings closed), added another 0.003 kg of NH₃·bird⁻¹·flock⁻¹. Emissions from this broiler farm were less than from some eastern US broiler farms but were comparable to broiler farms in Europe. Based on the results of this study and a similar winter study at this same farm, total flock wintertime and summertime (flock cycle plus between-flock) NH₃ emissions from this farm represented 7.8 and 8.3% of feed N as NH₃-N, respectively, or an annual average of 8.1%. 3abroiler chickens 3apoultry production 3aconcentrated animal feeding operations 3aexcreta 3aammonia 3agas emissions 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric deposition 3arisk assessment 3aprediction 3ameasurement 3aprobability analysis 3asummer 3astochastic processes 3asanitation 3adispersions 3awind 3aseasonal variation 3ageographical variation 3aprobabilistic models 2aAgriculture 2aAir Pollutantsxchemistry 2aAir Pollution 2aAmmoniaxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aManure 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 2aWind 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia1 aFlesch, T.K.1 aWilson, J.D.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Sept., v. 89, no. 9 p.1802-1814dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2010-007183Available from publisher's Web site  a20101110b20101204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/10/05  aOther US 7aarticle03498naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011900172300001600291520199900307650002702306650001502333650001202348650001302360650001502373650002302388650002202411650001802433650005002451650001402501650002202515650002402537650001902561650001002580650001202590650002102602651001202623653002502635653002202660653002302682653001002705700002102715773012302736852000902859856009202868930003302960946001102993655001203004IND4408966920221120071641.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440896692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00500.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Cho-ying10aClimate anomalies provide opportunities for large-scale mapping of non-native plant abundance in desert grasslands  ap. 875-884.  aNative plant communities are susceptible to climate anomalies, which would favour the invasion of non-native species. However, climate anomalies may also provide opportunities for detecting non-native plants at a regional scale using remote sensing. Based on this mechanism, we propose a direct and effective remote sensing approach to map the abundance of South African Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees (Lehmann lovegrass), a highly invasive, non-native plant in the desert grasslands of southwestern North America. The desert grassland of Fort Huachuca Military Reservation (31°34'N, 110°26'W) in southern Arizona, USA. Simple linear regression models were used to examine the relationships between additional (comparing to the normal level) remotely sensed greenness (delta Enhanced Vegetation Index (ΔEVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)), and field actual (g m⁻²) and percentage (%) biomass of E. lehmanniana in an abnormal wet, cool period in October 2000. There was a strong and positive agreement (P < 0.005) between ΔEVI and field observations (R² = 0.72 and 0.64 for actual and percentage biomass of E. lehmanniana, respectively). These relationships allowed us to estimate the abundance of E. lehmanniana in the desert grassland. Phenology of native grass communities is quite similar to systems dominated by E. lehmanniana but responses differ when there are substantial amounts of precipitation in cool seasons. Eragrostis lehmanniana can produce significant amount of new tissues and seeds with sufficient cool season moisture, while native grasses are still in senescence or dormancy. Therefore, amplitude of ΔEVI during wet, cool seasons would indicate the abundance of E. lehmanniana. Long-term climate records denote an amplification of cool season precipitation in the southwestern USA. This regional climatic trend should allow us to monitor E. lehmanniana and possibly other non-native species frequently in this vast arid region. 3aEragrostis lehmanniana 3aarid zones 3abiomass 3adormancy 3agrasslands 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3alinear models 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aphenology 3aplant communities 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3aseeds 3atissues 3avegetation index 3aArizona 0aBiological invasions 0adesert grasslands 0aherbaceous biomass 0aMODIS1 aGeiger, Erika L.0 tDiversity & distributions.g2008 Sept., v. 14, no. 5 p.875-884dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1366-95167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00500.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02182naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001900188245012400207300001400331500002400345520067500369650001501044650001701059650001701076650002401093650003001117650001301147650002201160650002301182650001701205650001901222651001201241653003901253653002001292700001901312700002501331700001901356700002201375773010901397852000901506856009201515930003301607945002501640946001101665655001201676IND4405439320221120071629.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440543932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1445-6664.2008.00277.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF600 0aH000 0aF2001 aSOLTANI, NADER10aGrowth and fitness of triazine-susceptible and triazine-resistant common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus var. rudis)  ap. 73-77.  aIncludes references  aTwo greenhouse trials were conducted over a 2 year period (2004 and 2005) to compare the relative growth potential and fitness of triazine-susceptible (TS) and triazine-resistant (TR) waterhemp biotypes.

Six field trials were conducted over a 2 year period (2004 to 2005) at three Ontario locations to evaluate the response of soybean to amitrole or 2,4-D ester applied at 14 days preplant (DPP), 7 DPP, 1 day after planting (DAP), and 7 DAP. The application of amitrole resulted in as much as 5.8, 3.9, 1.7, and 1% visible crop injury in soybean at 7, 14, 28, and 56 days after emergence (DAE), respectively. There was no visible injury in soybean with any amitrole treatment at 56 DAE, except for amitrole applied at 7 DAP, which caused 1% visible injury in soybean at 2310 g ha⁻¹. The application of the 2,4-D ester caused ≤8.3, 9.7, 4.6, and 1.3% visible injury in soybean at 7, 14, 28, and 56 DAE, respectively.The visible injury decreased over time.There was no visible injury in soybean with any of the 2,4-D ester treatments at 56 DAE, except for the 2,4-D ester treatment applied at 7 DAP, which caused 1% visible injury at 1155 g ha⁻¹ and 1.3% visible injury at 2310 g ha⁻¹. Soybean generally responded similarly to amitrole and 2,4-D ester when applied at 14 and 7 DPP; however, soybean was more tolerant to amitrole compared to 2,4-D ester when applied at 1 or 7 DAP. The application of amitrole and 2,4-D ester resulted in no biomass or yield reduction in soybean compared to the weed-free, untreated control at all doses and application timings evaluated. Soybean is tolerant to the preplant and pre-emergence application of amitrole or 2,4-D ester at the doses evaluated. 3aGlycine max 3aamitrole 3apesticide application 3aphytotoxicity 3asoybeans 3apreemergent weed control 3apreplanting treatment 3acrop losses 3aherbicide resistance 3a2,4-D 3aapplication rate 3aOntario 0aweed control 0a2,4-D ester1 aSwanton, Clarence J.1 aHAMILL, ALLAN S.1 aVYN, JOSHUA D.1 aSIKKEMA, PETER H.0 tWeed biology and management.g2008 June, v. 8, no. 2 p.139-144dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1444-61627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-6664.2008.00287.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110511b20110603c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03777naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100002500188245011600213300001600329500002400345520217500369650002202544650002002566650001902586650001702605650002102622650002602643650001502669650001802684650001402702650001502716650002102731650002502752650002102777650002402798650001702822651001002839653001502849653001802864653001402882653002402896700002202920773011102942852000903053856009203062930003303154945002503187946001103212655001203223IND4405438820221120061717.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440543882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1445-6664.2008.00283.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aF900 0aF600 0aH0001 aCHHOKAR, RAJENDER S.10aMultiple herbicide resistance in littleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor): A threat to wheat production in India  ap. 112-123.  aIncludes references  aLittleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor Retz.), a troublesome weed of wheat in India, has evolved multiple herbicide resistance across three modes of action: photosynthesis at the photosystem II site A, acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACCase), and acetolactate synthase inhibition. The multiple herbicide-resistant (MHR) populations had a low level of sulfosulfuron resistance but a high level of resistance to clodinafop and fenoxaprop (ACCase inhibitors). Some of the populations had GR₅₀ (50% growth reduction) values for clodinafop that were 11.7-fold greater than that of the most susceptible population. The clodinafop-resistant populations also showed a higher level of cross-resistance to fenoxaprop (fop group) but a low level of cross-resistance to pinoxaden (den group). Although clodinafop and pinoxaden are from two different chemical families (fop and den groups), their same site of action is responsible for cross-resistance behavior. The populations that were resistant to four groups of herbicides (phenylureas, sulfonylurea, aryloxyphenoxypropionate, and phenylpyrazolin) were susceptible to the triazine (metribuzin and terbutryn) and dinitroaniline (pendimethalin) herbicides. The P. minor populations that were resistant to the aryloxyphenoxypropionate and phenylurea herbicides were effectively controlled by the sulfonylurea herbicide, sulfosulfuron. In the fields infested with P. minor that was resistant to clodinafop, a sulfosulfuron application (25 g ha⁻¹) increased the wheat yield by 99.2% over that achieved using the recommended rate of clodinafop (60 g ha⁻¹). However, the evolution of multiple resistance against the four groups is a threat to wheat production. To prevent the spread of MHR P. minor populations, as well as the extension of multiple resistance to new chemicals, concerted efforts in developing and implementing a sound, integrated weed management program are needed. The integrated approach, consisting of crop and herbicide rotation with cultural and mechanical weed control tactics, should be considered as a long-term resistance management strategy that will help to sustain wheat productivity and farmers' income. 3aTriticum aestivum 3acrop production 3aPhalaris minor 3aweed control 3achemical control 3apesticide application 3ametribuzin 3apendimethalin 3aterbutryn 3afenoxaprop 3aapplication rate 3aherbicide resistance 3across resistance 3amechanism of action 3aweed biology 3aIndia 0aclodinafop 0asulfosulfuron 0apinoxaden 0amultiple resistance1 aSHARMA, RAMESH K.0 tWeed biology and management.g2008 June, v. 8, no. 2 p.112-123dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1444-61627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-6664.2008.00283.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110510b20110603c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02176naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245008200160300001600242500001500258520088400273650002401157650002201181650002601203650002001229650002101249650002601270651001701296653001601313653001401329653002001343653002301363653001201386653001801398653002101416700002001437773009701457852000901554856008501563930003301648945001301681946001301694990002301707655001201730IND2163453820221120061521.0980817s1997    nbu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216345382DNAL7 a10.1080/155753397094897822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSell, R.S.10aSocioeconomic impacts of school consolidation on host and vacated communities  ap. 186-205.  a2019-12-04  aMany rural communities across the Great Plains have experienced patterns of out-migration and depopulation. These changes have resulted in a reallocation of public educational resources. For example, in North Dakota the number of public high school districts declined from 256 in 1970 to 186 in 1994. Thirty-one percent of the decline in the number of districts occurred from 1990 to 1994. In this article we present the results of a mail survey of patrons who paid property taxes to eight different North Dakota school districts that had undergone school district consolidation and/or school closure during the last five years. Host communities were defined as those gaining the majority of students from the consolidation while vacated communities' schools were closed. Community involvement, retail services, and quality of life for host and vacated communities were compared. 3aresource allocation 3arural communities 3acitizen participation 3aquality of life 3aretail marketing 3aeducational resources 3aNorth Dakota 0acomparisons 0amigration 0aretail services 0arural depopulation 0amergers 0aout-migration 0aregional surveys1 aLeistritz, F.L.0 tJournal of the Community Development Society.g1997, v. 28, no. 2 p.186-205x0010-38297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/155753397094897823Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02210naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245010700146300001600253500001500269520100600284650001201290650000901302650002501311650001701336650001401353650001801367650002101385650001901406650001501425650002301440650001601463650004401479653002701523653001001550700003301560700002701593773007801620852000901698930003301707945002501740946001101765655001201776IND4437156220221120082314.0100517e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443715622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To investigate the role of these factors in early canine distemper neuropathogenesis, we infected ferrets either intranasally or intraperitoneally with the neurovirulent canine distemper virus strain Snyder Hill. Regardless of the route of inoculation, the virus primarily targeted the olfactory bulb, brainstem, hippocampus and cerebellum, whereas only occasional foci were detected in the cortex. The infection led to widespread neuronal loss, which correlated with the clinical signs observed. Increased numbers of activated microglia, reactive gliosis and different pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected in the infected areas, suggesting that the presence and ultimate death of infected cells at early times after infection trigger strong local immune activation, despite the observed systemic immunosuppression. 3aneurons 3adogs 3aCanine morbillivirus 3ainflammation 3acytokines 3apathogenicity 3acanine distemper 3aolfactory bulb 3acerebellum 3aviral encephalitis 3ahippocampus 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 0aCanine distemper virus 0abrain1 aBastien-Hamel, Louis-Etienne1 aVon Messling, Veronika0 tJournal of general virology.g2010 Apr., v. 91 p.980-989x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20100519b20100605c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02933naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012400128300001800252500001500270520148800285650001401773650002201787650001101809650002801820650002401848650003701872650002501909650003001934650001401964650001201978650001001990650000802000651001202008653003102020700002202051700001802073700002102091700002202112700002102134700002002155700002302175700001902198700001802217700002702235700002102262773007902283852000902362930003302371946001102404655001202415IND4437583020221120082423.0100524e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443758302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhioua, Elyes10aPunique virus, a novel phlebovirus, related to sandfly fever Naples virus, isolated from sandflies collected in Tunisia  ap. 1275-1283.  a2019-12-05  aSandflies are widely distributed around the Mediterranean Basin. Therefore, human populations in this area are potentially exposed to sandfly-transmitted diseases, including those caused by phleboviruses. Whilst there are substantial data in countries located in the northern part of the Mediterranean basin, few data are available for North Africa. In this study, a total of 1489 sandflies were collected in 2008 in Tunisia from two sites, bioclimatically distinct, located 235 km apart, and identified morphologically. Sandfly species comprised Phlebotomus perniciosus (52.2 %), Phlebotomus longicuspis (30.1 %), Phlebotomus papatasi (12 .0%), Phlebotomus perfiliewi (4.6 %), Phlebotomus langeroni (0.4 %) and Sergentomyia minuta (0.5 %). PCR screening, using generic primers for the genus Phlebovirus, resulted in the detection of ten positive pools. Sequence analysis revealed that two pools contained viral RNA corresponding to a novel virus closely related to sandfly fever Naples virus. Virus isolation in Vero cells was achieved from one pool. Genetic and phylogenetic characterization based on sequences in the three genomic segments showed that it was a novel virus distinct from other recognized members of the species. This novel virus was provisionally named Punique virus. Viral sequences in the polymerase gene corresponding to another phlebovirus closely related to but distinct from sandfly fever Sicilian virus were obtained from the eight remaining positive pools. 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 3abasins 3aPhlebotomus perniciosus 3aSergentomyia minuta 3aSandfly fever Naples phlebovirus 3aPhlebotomus papatasi 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3aviruses 3agenes 3aRNA 3aTunisia 0aSandfly fever Naples virus1 aMoureau, Grégory1 aChelbi, Ifhem1 aNinove, Laetitia1 aBichaud, Laurence1 aDerbali, Mohamed1 aChamps, Mylène1 aCherni, Saifeddine1 aSalez, Nicolas1 aCook, Shelley1 aLamballerie, Xavier de1 aCharrel, Remi N.0 tJournal of general virology.g2010 May, v. 91 p.1275-1283x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20100524b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02827naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245018700149300001600336500001500352520105000367650001801417650002701435650000901462650002301471650001301494650001901507650001701526650002001543650001201563650002601575650002801601650002701629650003501656650002901691650002001720650001101740650003101751650006701782650006201849650004401911651001801955653001501973653001301988653001602001653002702017700001902044700001502063700001902078773008402097852000902181930003302190945001302223946001302236655001202249IND2201114720221120061113.0991015e199902  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220111472DNAL7 a100306272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalski, C.B.10aUse of capillary tubes and plate heat exchanger to validate U.S. Department of Agriculture pasteurization protocols for elimination of Salmonella enteritidis from liquid egg products  ap. 112-117.  a2019-12-05  aD values for a five-strain cocktail of Salmonella Enteritidis in five different liquid egg products (whole egg, egg yolk, egg white, egg yolk + 5% sucrose + 5% NaCl, and egg yolk + 10% NaCl) were determined using 100-microliter capillary tubes.

Results of experiments with capillary tubes suggested that almost all processes would result in less than the 9D process recommended by the USDA. However, when the egg products were pasteurized using the plate heat exchanger, a greater than 9D process was achieved for Salmonella Enteritidis in all products except egg yolk containing 5% sucrose + 5% NaCl, which received approximately a 4D process. 3afood analysis 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aUSDA 3astrain differences 3avalidity 3apasteurization 3aegg products 3aheat exchangers 2aAnimals 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aEgg Shellxmicrobiology 2aEgg Yolkxmicrobiology 2aEggsxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aFood Handlingxstandards 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSalmonella Food Poisoningxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aSalmonella enteritidisxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aUnited States Department of Agriculture 0aUnited States 0aevaluation 0aefficacy 0amethodology 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aBrackett, R.E.1 aHung, Y.C.1 aEzeike, G.O.I.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.112-117x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03239naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245011800206300001600324506007600340520177500416506003702191650000902228650002502237650001402262650001402276650000902290650002102299650002202320650001302342650001702355650002302372650001402395650001402409650001502423650001202438700002202450773017102472852000902643856008302652930003302735946001302768655001202781IND4400289720221207063710.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440028972DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07100511052doi7 aPMC22065812pmcid7 a181804552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalsh, Matthew R.10aInteractions between the direct and indirect effects of predators determine life history evolution in a killifish  ap. 594-599.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe ecological impacts of the indirect effects of predators are well established, but the evolutionary consequences are unknown. Predators often decrease prey density, which indirectly increases the resources available to surviving prey. This ecological effect could provide a link to evolution because it is generally assumed that resource availability influences life history evolution. Yet, predictions from theory that consider food availability are inconsistent, and evidence for an important role of resources in shaping life history evolution is absent. We compared life history traits in a Trinidadian killifish, Rivulus hartii, from fish communities that differ in predation intensity; predators are associated with lower population density and faster growth rates. To determine whether the indirect effects of predators influence evolutionary change, we reared second-generation-born fish under two food levels that approximated natural differences in resources between communities. Rivulus from sites with predators are younger and smaller at maturity. They have increased reproductive investment and produce many small eggs and smaller hatchlings. Such divergence is predicted as a direct effect of predation. We also found significant interactions between predator community and food level for age and size at maturity, fecundity, and egg size. These interactions, whereby the differences between communities were more pronounced at high-food levels, argue that evolution in Rivulus has been influenced by the indirect effects of predators mediated through resource availability. Rivulus from sites with predators better exploit the higher resources in those habitats. Therefore, both direct and indirect effects of predators have evolutionary consequences.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeggs 3aenvironmental impact 3aevolution 3afecundity 3afish 3afish communities 3afood availability 3ahabitats 3alife history 3apopulation density 3apredation 3apredators 3aprediction 3arearing1 aReznick, David N.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.594-599dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07100511053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03184naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001400194245013500208300001600343500001500359520141300374650002301787650002101810650002001831650002401851650001001875650001001885650002601895650001201921650002201933650001801955650002301973650001101996650002002007650002802027650001602055650001202071650002202083650001802105650002502123650002602148650001702174650001802191650003302209650001302242653001502255653001602270700002102286773010202307852000902409856008102418930003302499945002502532946001302557655001202570IND4434611420221120061013.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443461142DNAL7 a203083992pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-004092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The experimental diets with DDGS at levels of 0, 10, and 20% were offered ad libitum for 7, 5, and 3 d, starting on 14, 16, and 18 d of age. Titanium dioxide was used as an indigestible marker. Six pens of 10 birds were allocated to each treatment. Digesta was sampled on a pen basis from the distal two-thirds of the intestine section between Meckel's diverticulum and 2 cm anterior to the ileo-ceca-colonic junction. Ingested and digested amounts of AA were determined for each pen. Digestibility of AA in the diets was not significantly affected by the duration of prefeeding but was significantly reduced by inclusion of DDGS. Digestibility of AA in DDGS was determined by using a linear regression approach. The digestibility of AA in DDGS ranged from 76% (Arg, 5 d of feeding) to 33% (Asp, 3 d of feeding). There was no significant effect of prefeeding time on AA digestibility of DDGS. Lysine digestibility of DDGS was 72%. The mean digestibility of the AA Arg, Cys, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, and Val of DDGS across the 3 prefeeding times was 66%. This study gave evidence that 3 d of prefeeding a diet is sufficient in studying prececal AA digestibility in broilers when low-digestible feeds are used. 3atemporal variation 3abroiler chickens 3anutrient intake 3aexperimental design 3acecum 3awheat 3aessential amino acids 3adigesta 3adistillers grains 3adigestibility 3aad libitum feeding 3achicks 3abroiler feeding 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCecumxmetabolism 2aEdible Grain. 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aDistillation 2aEnergy Intake 2aIntestine, Smallxmetabolism 2aTriticum 0aprefeeding 0aamino acids1 aRodehutscord, M.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.681-687dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-004093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/12  aOther US 7aarticle03879naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001500194245010600209300001600315500001500331520211100346650001802457650001002475650001602485650002402501650002102525650001502546650001402561650001902575650002202594650002302616650001902639650001202658650002302670650001102693650002402704650001502728650000902743650002002752650001602772650003302788653004002821653002002861700001502881700002002896700002202916700001602938700001902954700001702973773010202990852000903092856008103101930003303182945002503215946001303240655001203253IND4434611220221120061302.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443461122DNAL7 a203083972pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-005432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKönig, S.10aEvaluation of inbreeding in laying hens by applying optimum genetic contribution and gene flow theory  ap. 658-667.  a2019-12-04  aDue to consistent increases of inbreeding of on average 0.95% per generation in layer populations, selection tools should consider both genetic gain and genetic relationships in the long term. The optimum genetic contribution theory using official estimated breeding values for egg production was applied for 3 different lines of a layer breeding program to find the optimal allocations of hens and sires. Constraints in different scenarios encompassed restrictions related to additive genetic relationships, the increase of inbreeding, the number of selected sires and hens, and the number of selected offspring per mating. All these constraints enabled higher genetic gain up to 10.9% at the same level of additive genetic relationships or in lower relationships at the same gain when compared with conventional selection schemes ignoring relationships. Increases of inbreeding and genetic gain were associated with the number of selected sires. For the lowest level of the allowed average relationship at 10%, the optimal number of sires was 70 and the estimated breeding value for egg production of the selected group was 127.9. At the highest relationship constraint (16%), the optimal number of sires decreased to 15, and the average genetic value increased to 139.7. Contributions from selected sires and hens were used to develop specific mating plans to minimize inbreeding in the following generation by applying a simulated annealing algorithm. The additional reduction of average additive genetic relationships for matings was up to 44.9%. An innovative deterministic approach to estimate kinship coefficients between and within defined selection groups based on gene flow theory was applied to compare increases of inbreeding from random matings with layer populations undergoing selection. Large differences in rates of inbreeding were found, and they underline the necessity to establish selection tools controlling long-term relationships. Furthermore, it was suggested to use optimum genetic contribution theory for conservation schemes or, for example, the experimental line in our study. 3agenetic merit 3asires 3alaying hens 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic distance 3ainbreeding 3agene flow 3aegg production 3agenetic variation 3aselection criteria 3abreeding value 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Flowxgenetics 2aInbreeding 2aMale 2aModels, Genetic 2aOviposition 2aSelection, Geneticxgenetics 0aoptimum genetic contribution theory 0aanimal breeding1 aTsehay, F.1 aSitzenstock, F.1 avon Borstel, U.U.1 aSchmutz, M.1 aPreisinger, R.1 aSimianer, H.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.658-667dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-005433Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/12  aOther US 7aarticle04400naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211072001700228100001500245245012300260300001600383500001500399520220000414650001102614650001902625650001202644650002302656650002002679650001802699650001902717650001302736650001602749650002202765650002302787650002002810650002502830650003102855650002202886650001202908650003202920650002002952650002602972650002602998650001303024650001103037650000903048650001803057650002303075650002403098650003303122650002603155651001003181653002103191653001303212653001903225653001603244653002003260653002003280700001803300700001703318700002003335773010203355852000903457856008103466930003303547945002503580946001303605655001203618IND4434610920221120061211.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443461092DNAL7 a203083942pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-002882doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSuhr, C.L.10aShort-term spatial memory responses in aged Japanese quail selected for divergent adrenocortical stress responsiveness  ap. 633-642.  a2019-12-04  aStress-induced glucocorticoids can dampen learning and spatial memory via neuronal damage to the hippocampus. Cognition losses can be transient (associated with acute stress episodes) or permanent as in aged individuals who show chronic glucocorticoid-induced accelerated brain aging and neurodegeneration (dementia). Thus, chronic versus acute stress effects on spatial memory responses of quail selected for reduced (low stress, LS) or exaggerated (high stress, HS) plasma corticosterone (B) response to brief restraint were assessed. Aged food-motivated male LS and HS quail were tested for 10 min in a feed-baited 8-arm radial arm maze (RAM) 1) at 255 d of age (quail who had experienced lifelong management stressors but who were otherwise never intentionally stressed; that is, chronically stressed birds), 2) on the next day post-acute stressor treatment (5 min of restraint), and 3) on the next day without treatment (acute stress recovery). The RAM tests used the win-shift procedure in which visited arms were not rebaited. Radial arm maze performance was measured by determination of the total number of arm choices made, the number of correct entries made into baited arms out of the first 8 choices, the time required to make a choice, and the number of pellets eaten. Line effects (P < 0.001 in all cases) were detected for total number of arm choices made (HS < LS), number of correct entries made into baited arms out of the first 8 choices (HS < LS), time required to make a choice (HS > LS), and number of pellets eaten (HS < LS). However, neither the effects of day of RAM testing nor its interaction with line further influenced these variables. Thus, although selection for divergent plasma B responsiveness to an acute stressor was found to be associated with severe impairment of spatial memory in aged male HS compared with LS quail, the observed spatial memory impairments (HS > LS) could not be further altered by acute stressor treatment. Line differences in cognition may reflect lifelong management-induced stress episodes that periodically produce higher plasma B responses in HS than LS quail, which underlie HS quail memory deficits, or other etiologies, or both. 3amemory 3aadrenal cortex 3aelderly 3atemporal variation 3ablood chemistry 3aanimal stress 3acorticosterone 3agenotype 3afeed intake 3aCoturnix japonica 3aselection criteria 3aanimal handling 3aartificial selection 2aAdrenal Cortexxphysiology 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBrainxgrowth & development 2aChoice Behavior 2aCognitionxphysiology 2aCorticosteronexblood 2aCoturnix 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMaze Learning 2aMemoryxphysiology 2aRestraint, Physical 2aSpace Perceptionxphysiology 2aStress, Psychological 0aJapan 0aanimal husbandry 0alearning 0aspatial memory 0aold animals 0aJapanese quails 0aglucocorticoids1 aSchmidt, J.B.1 aTreese, S.T.1 aSatterlee, D.G.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.633-642dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-002883Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/12  aOther US 7aarticle03965naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001300228245014100241300001600382500001500398520187200413650002302285650002102308650002102329650001702350650002002367650001802387650002002405650001802425650002002443650001902463650001602482650001802498650001402516650001402530650001802544650001802562650001102580650001502591650001602606650000702622650002002629650001602649650004702665650001202712650002502724650005202749650002102801650002402822650002002846650001502866653003502881653001702916700001302933700001102946700001102957773010202968852000903070856008103079930003303160945002503193946001303218655001203231IND4433292120221120061131.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443329212DNAL7 a201818782pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-003192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Birds were randomly segregated into 12 groups so that 3 replicates were available for each of the 3 treatments (T-1, T-2, and T-3) and control groups. The control groups were fed a basal diet without any probiotic and other groups were fed the diets that consisted of 3 probiotic levels at initial concentrations of 1.0 x 10⁶ cfu·g⁻¹ (T-1), 2.0 x 10⁶ cfu·g⁻¹ (T-2), and 5.0 x 10⁶ cfu·g⁻¹ (T-3). The lowest final weight and daily weight gain were found in control groups (P < 0.05) and there were no significant differences among probiotic-treated groups. Significantly lower feed conversion ratio and higher survival rate were observed in T-2 and T-3 than that of the control. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in contents of breast chemical composition including moisture, CP, crude fat, and crude ash among all groups. For the meat quality parameter assays, the pH, shear force, and drip loss were used as indicators. As for pH values of breasts, no significant difference was found across all treatments. Higher shear force was observed (P < 0.05) in T-2 compared with T-1 and the control. Similar significant difference was also observed in T-1 compared with the control. However, there was no significant difference in shear force between T-3 and the other probiotic treatment groups (T-1 and T-2). As for probiotic-treated groups, there was significant difference (P < 0.05) in breast drip loss compared with that of the control (6.22 ± 0.18%), with the lowest drip loss found in T-3 (5.38 ± 0.25%). However, no significant difference was observed in drip loss between T-2 and T-3. 3aBacillus coagulans 3afood composition 3abroiler chickens 3achicken meat 3aliveweight gain 3acrude protein 3abroiler feeding 3abreast muscle 3afeed conversion 3achicken breeds 3abody weight 3awater content 3amortality 3adrip loss 3alipid content 3aanimal growth 3adosage 3aprobiotics 3aash content 3apH 3ameat tenderness 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBacillusxphysiology 2aChickensxclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aMeatxstandards 2aProbiotics 0aGuangxi Yellow (chicken breed) 0ameat quality1 aWang, Y.1 aGu, Q.1 aLi, W.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.588-593dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-003193Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle03198naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245015900184300001600343520134500359650001501704650002001719650002601739650003301765650004401798650001201842650003801854650004101892650003601933650006301969650001402032650007402046650002802120650003002148650002302178650001202201650002702213650001002240650004402250651001102294653003302305653001202338700002102350700001702371700002302388773010702411852000902518856008502527930003302612946001102645655001202656IND4395800820221120061104.0071007e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439580082DNAL7 a177218282pmid7 a10.1007/s11046-007-9045-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMysterud, Ivar 10aMolecular characterization and evaluation of plant litter-associated fungi from the spring 'grazing corridor' of a sheep herd vulnerable to alveld disease  ap. 201-215.  aThis study sample and identify species of fungi on withered vegetation in the spring 'grazing corridor' from infields to Narthecium bogs for a sheep herd almost chronically vulnerable to phototoxic disease. Hepatogen photosensitizing disorders like alveld attack grazing sheep, especially lambs, in various parts of the world. It has been hypothesized that saponin metabolites in the monocotyledonous plant Narthecium ossifragum causes the disorder in Norway, however, this has not been verified. Thus, the search for other causal agents or saponin cofactors (the cofactor hypothesis) has been intensified, and endophytic poisonous fungi associated with dead N. ossifragum leaves and grasses are among the prime suspects. The fungal diversity was targeted by obtaining axenic cultures from surface-sterilized plant material, with subsequent DNA isolation, PCR, and sequencing of the ITS nrDNA region. The taxonomic affinities of the obtained sequences were thereafter explored by similarity searches against the public access sequence database EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ. Among the spectrum of identified taxa were representatives of Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma, all of which are well known as potential producers of toxins. A possible involvement of these toxic species in the etiology of alveld is evaluated and discussed. 3amycotoxins 3aDeuteromycotina 3aNarthecium ossifragum 3ainternal transcribed spacers 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxgenetics 2aFungixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGeography 2aMitosporic Fungixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Poisoningxetiology 2aSaponinsxtoxicity 2aSeasons 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxetiologyxmicrobiology. 0aNorway 0aHepatogen photosensitization 0aSaponin1 aHøiland, Klaus 1 aKoller, Gry 1 aStensrud, Øyvind 0 tMycopathologia.g2007 Nov., v. 164, no. 5 p.201-215dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0301-486X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11046-007-9045-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02641naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245013000206300001600336500001500352506007600367520100000443506003701443650001101480650001801491650001701509650001501526650000901541650004801550650001901598650001001617650001401627653003901641700002001680700002201700700002301722700002301745700002401768700002401792700002201816773017101838852000902009856008302018930003302101946001302134655001202147IND4400290320221207065812.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440029032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07112001052doi7 aPMC22065872pmcid7 a181847982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIannacone, Matteo10aPlatelets prevent IFN-α/β-induced lethal hemorrhage promoting CTL-dependent clearance of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus  ap. 629-634.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe found that mice infected with different isolates of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) develop a mild hemorrhagic anemia, which becomes severe and eventually lethal in animals depleted of platelets or lacking integrin β3. Lethal hemorrhagic anemia is mediated by virus-induced IFN-α/β that causes platelet dysfunction, mucocutaneous blood loss and suppression of erythropoiesis. In addition to the life-threatening hemorrhagic anemia, platelet-depleted mice fail to mount an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and cannot clear LCMV. Transfusion of functional platelets into these animals reduces hemorrhage, prevents death and restores CTL-induced viral clearance in a manner partially dependent on CD40 ligand (CD40L). These results indicate that, upon activation, platelets expressing integrin β3 and CD40L are required for protecting the host against the induction of an IFN-α/β-dependent lethal hemorrhagic diathesis and for clearing LCMV infection through CTLs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanemia 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytotoxicity 3ahemorrhage 3amice 3aLymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus 3aerythropoiesis 3adeath 3aintegrins 0aLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus1 aSitia, Giovanni1 aIsogawa, Masanori1 aWhitmire, Jason K.1 aMarchese, Patrizia1 aChisari, Francis V.1 aRuggeri, Zaverio M.1 aGuidotti, Luca G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.629-634dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07112001053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02740naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245008600143300001600229500001500245520118900260650001301449650003301462650002501495650002201520650002301542650001901565650001401584650003601598650001901634650002501653650003401678650002301712650002101735650002001756650003301776650003101809650002501840653003501865653001901900653001301919653001401932700002001946700001601966700001901982700001602001700001702017773008402034852000902118930003302127945001302160946001302173655001202186IND2200983020221120052301.0991007e199903  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220098302DNAL7 a100902532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, B.Z.10aDistribution of antifungal proteins in maize kernel tissues using immunochemistry  ap. 295-299.  a2019-12-05  aThis study examined the distribution of two antifungal proteins, ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) and zeamatin, in maize kernel tissues. Proteins were extracted from endosperm (including aleurone layer) and embryo tissues of imbibed maize kernels. Western blot analyses revealed that RIP-like protein was present at higher levels in endosperm than in embryo tissues, whereas zeamatin-like protein was more concentrated in embryo tissues than in endosperm tissues. However, there were three protein bands in the endosperm and two bands in the embryo that reacted to anti-RIP antibody in Western blot analyses. Tissue prints were conducted to localized the antifungal proteins. Imbibed kernels were cut longitudinally and transversely and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Using antibodies against maize RIP and zeamatin, RIP was found primarily in the aleurone layer of the endosperm and glandular layer of scutellum, whereas zeamatin was located mainly in the kernel embryo. These results provide insight into the potential functions of these antifungal proteins, especially since the presence of RIP and zeamatin within maize kernels uniquely protects kernels from pathogens. 3aZea mays 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aantifungal agents 3adefense mechanisms 3aaleurone layer 3aendosperm 3achemical constituents of plants 3aplant proteins 2aAflatoxinsxanalysis 2aAntifungal Agentsxmetabolism 2aAspergillus flavus 2aImmunity, Innate 2aImmunochemistry 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aZea maysxmetabolism 0aribosome-inactivating proteins 0aembryo (plant) 0azeamatin 0ascutellum1 aCleveland, T.E.1 aBrown, R.L.1 aWidstrom, N.W.1 aLynch, R.E.1 aRussin, J.S.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 Mar., v. 62, no. 3 p.295-299x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02057naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002400154245007600178300001600254500002400270520086900294650001601163650001601179650001301195650002001208650003201228650002501260650002501285651001801310653001501328700002201343700002101365773010801386852000901494856008501503930003301588945002501621946001301646655001201659IND4405518020221120052325.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440551802DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-008-9127-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2021 aWorosz, Michelle R.10aResilience in the US red meat industry: the roles of food safety policy  ap. 187-191.  aIncludes references  aWe use the case of red meat food safety to illustrate the need to problematize policy. Overtime, there have been numerous red meat scandals and scares. We show that the statutes and regulations that arose out of these events provided the industry with a means of demonstrating safety, facilitating large-scale trade, legitimizing conventional production, and limiting interference into its practices. They also created systemic fragility, as evidenced by many recent events, and hindered the development of an alternative, small-scale sector. Thus, the accumulated rules help to structure the sector, create superficial resilience, and are used in place of an actual policy governing safety. We call for rigorous attention to not only food safety, but also the role and effect of agrifood statutes and regulations in general, and engagement in policy more broadly. 3afood safety 3afood policy 3ared meat 3ameat production 3alivestock and meat industry 3aproduction economics 3alaws and regulations 3aUnited States 0aresilience1 aKnight, Andrew J.1 aHarris, Craig K.0 tAgriculture and human values.g2008 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.187-191dSpringer Netherlandsx0889-048X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-008-9127-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110607b20110701c00000000  aINDdRLGe2008/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle01887naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002400154245009000178300001600268500002400284520080400308650003101112650001701143650002801160650002001188650001901208650002101227653001601248773010801264852000901372856008501381930003301466945002501499946001301524655001201537IND4405518120221123044220.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440551812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-008-9115-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP1201 aMariola, Matthew J.14aThe local industrial complex?

In this essay I critique four key assumptions that underlie this connection between local foods and energy. I then describe two competing conclusions implied by the critique. On the one hand, local food systems may need a more extensive and integrated transportation infrastructure to achieve sustainability. On the other hand, the production, transportation, and consumption of local foods are fundamentally as reliant on fossil fuels as are long distance foods. A more holistic approach to energy use in the food system is needed to determine which particular sociotechnical factors optimize energetic sustainability. 3aenergy use and consumption 3afossil fuels 3asustainable agriculture 3afood production 3afood transport 3afood consumption 0alocal foods0 tAgriculture and human values.g2008 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.193-196dSpringer Netherlandsx0889-048X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-008-9115-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20110607b20110701c00000000  aINDdRLGe2008/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle04183naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100002600194245012900220300001800349500001500367520180000382650002002182650002102202650002202223650002502245650002202270650001602292650002102308650001602329650001902345650002102364650002702385650002202412650002102434650001902455650001702474650002702491650002802518650002002546650001202566650004402578650001302622650002602635650002002661650004902681650004002730650000902770650001502779650003302794650003202827650003802859650003802897653001302935653003802948653001802986700001603004700002403020700001903044700001403063700001603077700002103093700002103114773010503135852000903240856008103249930003303330945002503363946001303388655001203401IND4441221120221123044244.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444122112DNAL7 a207099752pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2010-008122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Physiological, hormonal, and immunological deficits as well as increases in animals' susceptibility to diseases have been reported after different stressors in broiler chickens. The aim of the current experiment is to describe the effects of 2 different heat stressors (31 ± 1 and 36 ± 1°C/10 h per d) applied to broiler chickens from d 35 to 42 of life on the corticosterone serum levels, performance parameters, intestinal histology, and peritoneal macrophage activity, correlating and discussing the obtained data under a neuroimmune perspective. In our study, we demonstrated that heat stress (31 ± 1 and 36 ± 1°C) increased the corticosterone serum levels and decreased BW gain and food intake. Only chickens submitted to 36 ± 1°C, however, presented a decrease in feed conversion and increased mortality. We also showed a decrease of bursa of Fabricius (31 ± 1 and 36 ± 1°C), thymus (36 ± 1°C), and spleen (36 ± 1°C) relative weights and of macrophage basal (31 ± 1 and 36 ± 1°C) and Staphylococcus aureus-induced oxidative burst (31 ± 1°C). Finally, mild multifocal acute enteritis characterized by an increased presence of lymphocytes and plasmocytes within the jejunum's lamina propria was also observed. The stress-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation was taken as responsible for the negative effects observed on the chickens' performance and immune function and also the changes of the intestinal mucosa. The present obtained data corroborate with others in the field of neuroimmunomodulation and open new avenues for the improvement of broiler chicken welfare and production performance. 3apathophysiology 3abroiler chickens 3ahormone secretion 3atemperature profiles 3aimmunosuppression 3amacrophages 3apoultry diseases 3aheat stress 3acorticosterone 3adisease severity 3aphysiological response 3aintestinal mucosa 3aendocrine system 3anervous system 3apathogenesis 3abiochemical mechanisms 3ahypothalamic regulation 3asmall intestine 2aAnimals 2aBursa of Fabriciusxanatomy & histology 2aChickens 2aCorticosteronexblood 2aHot Temperature 2aIntestinal Diseasesxmetabolismxveterinary. 2aMacrophages, Peritonealxphysiology 2aMale 2aOrgan Size 2aPoultry Diseasesxmetabolism 2aSpleenxanatomy & histology 2aStress, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aThymus Glandxanatomy & histology 0aimmunity 0aimmunosuppression (physiological) 0acomplications1 aRibeiro, A.1 aFerraz-de-Paula, V.1 aPinheiro, M.L.1 aSakai, M.1 aSá, L.R.M.1 aFerreira, A.J.P.1 aPalermo-Neto, J.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Sept., v. 89, no. 9 p.1905-1914dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2010-008123Available from publisher's Web site  a20101117b20101204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle04239naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245012900205300001600334506007600350520178300426506003702209650003102246650003102277650002602308650000802334650001302342650001602355650002002371650002102391650002202412650002002434650001002454650002002464650001902484650001802503650001202521650002602533650003602559650003602595651001702631700002602648700001902674700002302693700001702716700002602733700002002759700002102779700001602800700003002816700002202846700002302868700002002891700002002911700002202931700001802953700002102971700001802992700002503010700001603035700002403051700002603075700002803101700001903129773017103148852000903319856008303328930003303411946001303444655001203457IND4400290620221207063649.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440029062DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07099691052doi7 aPMC22065902pmcid7 a181743282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorcia, Maria G.10aFunctional deficit of T regulatory cells in Fulani, an ethnic group with low susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum malaria  ap. 646-651.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrevious interethnic comparative studies on the susceptibility to malaria performed in West Africa showed that Fulani are more resistant to Plasmodium falciparum malaria than are sympatric ethnic groups. This lower susceptibility is not associated to classic malaria-resistance genes, and the analysis of the immune response to P. falciparum sporozoite and blood stage antigens, as well as non-malaria antigens, revealed higher immune reactivity in Fulani. In the present study we compared the expression profile of a panel of genes involved in immune response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from Fulani and sympatric Mossi from Burkina Faso. An increased expression of T helper 1 (TH1)-related genes (IL-18, IFNγ, and TBX21) and TH2-related genes (IL-4 and GATA3) and a reduced expression of genes distinctive of T regulatory activity (CTLA4 and FOXP3) were observed in Fulani. Microarray analysis on RNA from CD4⁺CD25⁺ (T regulatory) cells, performed with a panel of cDNA probes specific for 96 genes involved in immune modulation, indicated obvious differences between the two ethnic groups with 23% of genes, including TGFβ, TGFβRs, CTLA4, and FOXP3, less expressed in Fulani compared with Mossi and European donors not exposed to malaria. As further indications of a low T regulatory cell activity, Fulani showed lower serum levels of TGFβ and higher concentrations of the proinflammatory chemokines CXCL10 and CCL22 compared with Mossi; moreover, the proliferative response of Fulani to malaria antigens was not affected by the depletion of CD25⁺ regulatory cells whereas that of Mossi was significantly increased. The results suggest that the higher resistance to malaria of the Fulani could derive from a functional deficit of T regulatory cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aGATA transcription factors 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aRNA 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3achemokine CCL22 3achemokine CXCL10 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-4 3amalaria 3amicroarray technology 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3atransforming growth factor beta 3aBurkina Faso1 aSantarlasci, Veronica1 aCosmi, Lorenzo1 aClemente, AnnMaria1 aMaggi, Laura1 aMangano, Valentina D.1 aVerra, Federica1 aBancone, Germana1 aNebie, Issa1 aSirima, Bienvenu Sodiomon1 aLiotta, Francesco1 aFrosali, Francesca1 aAngeli, Roberta1 aSeverini, Carlo1 aSannella, Anna R.1 aBonini, Paolo1 aLucibello, Maria1 aMaggi, Enrico1 aGaraci, E.q(Enrico)1 aColuzzi, M.1 aCozzolino, Federico1 aAnnunziato, Francesco1 aRomagnani, S.q(Sergio)1 aModiano, David0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.646-651dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07099691053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03673naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201100002200218245013900240300001600379500001500395506007600410520178000486506003702266650002402303650001802327650002702345650001402372650002602386650001302412650002102425650002002446650001002466650001202476650002002488650002402508650001002532653002302542653001802565653002702583653001902610700002302629700002402652700002302676700002802699700002202727773017102749852000902920856008302929930003303012945002503045946001303070655001203083IND4400291620221207073558.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440029162DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07093381052doi7 aPMC22066002pmcid7 a181848052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The bacteria invade and colonize the roots through structures called infection threads. S. meliloti unable to produce the exopolysaccharide succinoglycan are unable to establish a symbiosis because they are defective in initiating the production of infection threads and in invading the plant. Here, we use microarrays representing 16,000 M. truncatula genes to compare the differential transcriptional responses of this host plant to wild-type and succinoglycan-deficient S. meliloti at the early time point of 3 days postinoculation. This report describes an early divergence in global plant gene expression responses caused by a rhizobial defect in succinoglycan production, rather than in Nod factor production. The microarray data show that M. truncatula inoculated with wild-type, succinoglycan-producing S. meliloti more strongly express genes encoding translation components, protein degradation machinery, and some nodulins than plants inoculated with succinoglycan-deficient bacteria. This finding is consistent with wild-type-inoculated plants having received a signal, distinct from the well characterized Nod factor, to alter their metabolic activity and prepare for invasion. In contrast, M. truncatula inoculated with succinoglycan-deficient S. meliloti more strongly express an unexpectedly large number of genes in two categories: plant defense responses and unknown functions. One model consistent with our results is that appropriate symbiotically active exopolysaccharides act as signals to plant hosts to initiate infection thread formation and that, in the absence of this signal, plants terminate the infection process, perhaps via a defense response.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aprotein degradation 3amessenger RNA 3atranslation (genetics) 3asymbiosis 3amicroarray technology 3anodulins 3aEnsifer meliloti 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3apolysaccharides 3aMedicago truncatula 3aroots 0aexopolysaccharides 0asuccinoglycan 0aSinorhizobium meliloti 0aplant proteins1 aSharopova, Natalya1 aLohar, Dasharath P.1 aZhang, Jennifer Q.1 aVandenBosch, Kathryn A.1 aWalker, Graham C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.704-709dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07093381053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle02579naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100002700163245012300190300001600313500002400329520141400353650003401767650002301801650002401824650001201848650002601860650001601886650002001902651001001922773010801932852000902040856008502049930003302134945002502167946001302192655001202205IND4405518920221123044703.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440551892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-007-9098-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ710 0aX8401 aGoldberger, Jessica R.10aNon-governmental organizations, strategic bridge building, and the “scientization” of organic agriculture in Kenya  ap. 271-289.  aIncludes references  aThis paper contributes to the growing social science scholarship on organic agriculture in the global South. A “boundary” framework is used to understand how negotiation among socially and geographically disparate social worlds (e.g., non-governmental organizations (NGOs), foreign donors, agricultural researchers, and small-scale farmers) has resulted in the diffusion of non-certified organic agriculture in Kenya. National and local NGOs dedicated to organic agriculture promotion, training, research, and outreach are conceptualized as “boundary organizations.” Situated at the intersection of multiple social worlds, these NGOs engage in “strategic bridge building” and “strategic boundary-work.” Strategic bridge building involves the creation and use of “boundary objects” and “hybrid forms” that serve as meeting grounds for otherwise disconnected social worlds. Strategic boundary-work involves efforts to “scientize,” and thereby legitimize, organic agriculture in the eyes of foreign donors, potential research collaborators, the Kenyan state, and farmers. Examples of strategic bridge building and boundary-work are presented in the paper. The Kenyan case illustrates that different social actors can unite around a shared objective - namely, the promotion and legitimization of organic agriculture as an alternative to the Green Revolution (GR) technological package. 3anongovernmental organizations 3aorganic production 3asmall-scale farming 3afarmers 3aagricultural research 3aresearchers 3asocial sciences 3aKenya0 tAgriculture and human values.g2008 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.271-289dSpringer Netherlandsx0889-048X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-007-9098-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20110613b20110701c00000000  aINDdRLGe2008/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle02945naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154100001700163245011800180300001600298500002400314500001500338520170400353650002202057650002102079650002102100650001602121650002202137650001802159651001802177653002002195653002102215700002602236773010802262852000902370856008502379930003302464945002502497946001302522655001202535IND4405518620221123044353.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440551862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10460-007-9107-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aD500 0aE2001 aLobao, Linda14aThe community effects of industrialized farming: Social science research and challenges to corporate farming laws  ap. 219-240.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSocial scientists have a long history of concern with the effects of industrialized farming on communities. Recently, the topic has taken on new importance as corporate farming laws in a number of states are challenged by agribusiness interests. Defense of these laws often requires evidence from social science research that industrialized farming poses risks to communities. A problem is that no recent journal articles or books systematically assess the extent to which research to date provides evidence of these risks. This article addresses the gap in the literature. We evaluate studies investigating the effects of industrialized farming on community well-being from the 1930s to the present. Using a pool of 51 studies, we document the research designs employed, evaluate results as to whether adverse consequences were found, and delineate the aspects of community life that may be affected by industrialized farming. Of these studies, 57% found largely detrimental impacts, 25% were mixed, finding some detrimental impacts, and 18% found no detrimental impacts. Adverse impacts were found across an array of indicators measuring socioeconomic conditions, community social fabric, and environmental conditions. Few positive effects of industrialized farming were found across studies. The results demonstrate that public concern about industrialized farms is warranted. Scholars often debate whether research should be oriented around disciplines' accumulated body of knowledge or, conversely, provide critical knowledge in the public interest. Social scientists' long-term engagement in building the body of research on industrialized farming allows for accomplishment of both objectives. 3arural communities 3aagricultural law 3acommunity health 3aagriculture 3afarm corporations 3asocial impact 3aUnited States 0asocial sciences 0aindustrial farms1 aStofferahn, Curtis W.0 tAgriculture and human values.g2008 June, v. 25, no. 2 p.219-240dSpringer Netherlandsx0889-048X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10460-007-9107-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20110613b20110701c00000000  aINDdRLGe2008/06/16  aOther US 7aarticle02339naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245010100201300001600302506007600318520116300394506003701557650002201594650001301616650002501629700001401654700002401668773017101692852000901863856008301872930003301955946001301988655001202001IND4400288720221207072214.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440028872DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07073781052doi7 aPMC22065712pmcid7 a181786272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chun-Biu10aMultiscale complex network of protein conformational fluctuations in single-molecule time series  ap. 536-541.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConformational dynamics of proteins can be interpreted as itinerant motions as the protein traverses from one state to another on a complex network in conformational space or, more generally, in state space. Here we present a scheme to extract a multiscale state space network (SSN) from a single-molecule time series. Analysis by this method enables us to lift degeneracy--different physical states having the same value for a measured observable--as much as possible. A state or node in the network is defined not by the value of the observable at each time but by a set of subsequences of the observable over time. The length of the subsequence can tell us the extent to which the memory of the system is able to predict the next state. As an illustration, we investigate the conformational fluctutation dynamics probed by single-molecule electron transfer (ET), detected on a photon-by-photon basis. We show that the topographical features of the SSNs depend on the time scale of observation; the longer the time scale, the simpler the underlying SSN becomes, leading to a transition of the dynamics from anomalous diffusion to normal Brownian diffusion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aelectron transfer 3aproteins 3atime series analysis1 aYang, Haw1 aKomatsuzaki, Tamiki0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.536-541dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07073781053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03222naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201072001700218100002700235245010100262300001600363506007600379520145300455506003701908650001801945650000901963650001701972650002301989650002402012650002202036650002202058650001402080650002602094650002002120650001402140650001902154653001802173653001702191653001702208700001802225700001402243700002002257700002202277700002302299773017102322852000902493856008302502930003302585945002502618946001302643655001202656IND4400288420221207062536.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440028842DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07080981052doi7 aPMC22065682pmcid7 a181824922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

For these studies, female mosquitoes were fed a sucrose solution containing ¹⁵NH₄Cl, [5-¹⁵N]-glutamine, [¹⁵N]-proline, allantoin, or allantoic acid. At 24 h after feeding, the feces were collected and analyzed in a mass spectrometer. Specific enzyme inhibitors confirmed that mosquitoes incorporate ¹⁵N from ¹⁵NH₄Cl into [5-¹⁵N]-glutamine and use the ¹⁵N of the amide group of glutamine to produce labeled uric acid. More importantly, we found that [¹⁵N₂]-uric acid can be metabolized to [¹⁵N]-urea and be excreted as nitrogenous waste through an uricolytic pathway. Ae. aegypti express all three genes in this pathway, namely, urate oxidase, allantoinase, and allantoicase. The functional relevance of these genes in mosquitoes was shown by feeding allantoin or allantoic acid, which significantly increased unlabeled urea levels in the feces. Moreover, knockdown of urate oxidase expression by RNA interference demonstrated that this pathway is active in females fed blood or ¹⁵NH₄Cl based on a significant increase in uric acid levels in whole-body extracts and a reduction in [¹⁵N]-urea excretion, respectively. These unexpected findings could lead to the development of metabolism-based strategies for mosquito control.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aurea 3abiosynthesis 3aurea cycle enzymes 3anitrogen metabolism 3ainsect physiology 3aammonium chloride 3aglutamine 3aamino acid metabolism 3agene expression 3aallantoin 3aallantoic acid 0aurate oxidase 0aallantoinase 0aallantoicase1 aTan, Guanhong1 aIsoe, Jun1 aWysocki, Vicki.1 aWells, Michael A.1 aMiesfeld, Roger L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.518-523dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07080981053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle03044naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245006600206300001600272506007600288520158700364506003701951650001101988650002201999650001402021650002002035650001702055650001402072650001002086650001802096650002102114650003102135650001302166650000902179650002002188650002202208650002002230650001502250773017102265852000902436856008302445930003302528946001302561655001202574IND4400289220221207062544.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440028922DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07072211052doi7 aPMC22065762pmcid7 a181824962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraham, Andrea L.10aEcological rules governing helminth-microparasite coinfection  ap. 566-570.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCoinfection of a host by multiple parasite species has important epidemiological and clinical implications. However, the direction and magnitude of effects vary considerably among systems, and, until now, there has been no general framework within which to explain this variation. Community ecology has great potential for application to such problems in biomedicine. Here, metaanalysis of data from 54 experiments on laboratory mice reveals that basic ecological rules govern the outcome of coinfection across a broad spectrum of parasite taxa. Specifically, resource-based ("bottom-up") and predator-based ("top-down") control mechanisms combined to determine microparasite population size in helminth-coinfected hosts. Coinfection imposed bottom-up control (resulting in decreased microparasite density) when a helminth that causes anemia was paired with a microparasite species that requires host red blood cells. At the same time, coinfection impaired top-down control of microparasites by the immune system: the greater the helminth-induced suppression of the inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-γ, the greater the increase in microparasite density. These results suggest that microparasite population growth will be most explosive when underlying helminths do not impose resource limitations but do strongly modulate IFN-γ responses. Surprisingly simple rules and an ecological framework within which to analyze biomedical data thus emerge from analysis of this dataset. Through such an interdisciplinary lens, predicting the outcome of coinfection may become tractable.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanemia 3acommunity ecology 3acytokines 3adata collection 3aerythrocytes 3ahelminths 3ahosts 3aimmune system 3ainterferon-gamma 3alaboratory experimentation 3amedicine 3amice 3amixed infection 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3aprediction0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.566-570dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07072211053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03234naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001700194245009400211300001800305500001500323520130300338650001901641650002501660650001901685650001801704650001801722650001601740650002001756650001301776650002601789650001501815650001401830650001301844650002001857650001801877650002501895650001001920650001201930650002801942650002601970650004701996650001202043650002502055650001302080650002102093650002602114650003402140650000902174650001002183653001702193653002002210700001802230700001802248700001602266773010502282852000902387856008102396930003302477945002502510946001302535655001202548IND4441221820221123022716.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444122182DNAL7 a207099822pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-005592doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Finely ground partially dehulled extruded (ESM), partially dehulled solvent-extracted (SESM), extensively cleaned dehulled and extruded safflower meal (CSM), or soybean meal 44 (SBM 44) was intubated to 9 fasted mature roosters with 40 g per rooster and total excreta was collected.The concentrations of all essential amino acids in CSM were higher than those in ESM and SESM. Also, compared with SBM 44, CSM was deficient in lysine, slightly higher in TSAA and tryptophan, but much higher in arginine. The AMEn and TMEn of CSM were 2,413 and 2,832 kcal/kg, respectively, and were higher than those of SBM 44 (P < 0.01). The true lysine digestibilities of CSM and SBM 44 were similar but were higher than those of ESM and SESM (P < 0.05). However, ESM, SESM, and CSM had similar true tryptophan and threonine digestibilities that were lower than that of SBM 44 (P < 0.05). With respect to TSAA, all feed ingredients under investigation had similar apparent and true digestibilities. In conclusion, extensive hull removal of safflower seeds followed by cold extrusion produced a low-fiber CSM rich in both energy and protein that makes it a promising feed ingredient for poultry. 3asafflower meal 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aenergy content 3adietary fiber 3afiber content 3aamino acids 3afeed processing 3asolvents 3anonthermal processing 3aextraction 3aextrusion 3agrinding 3aprotein content 3adigestibility 3ametabolizable energy 3ahulls 3apoultry 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCarthamus tinctorius 2aChickens 2aDietxveterinary 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aMale 2aSeeds 0afeed quality 0anutritive value1 aBarbour, G.W.1 aUsayran, N.N.1 aKayouli, C.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Sept., v. 89, no. 9 p.1962-1966dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-005593Available from publisher's Web site  a20101110b20101204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/10/06  aOther US 7aarticle03376naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245011300190300001600303520139600319650001401715650003401729650001201763650003001775650006701805650001901872650002801891650002601919650001101945650002701956650002501983650002502008650001702033650002802050650003602078650003502114650000902149650002402158650005602182650006502238650003302303653001602336653000802352653002702360653001502387700002302402700002302425700001702448700001902465700002302484700002002507773011302527852000902640856006902649930003302718946001102751655001202762IND4389640720221122233309.0070325e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438964072DNAL7 a173567922pmid7 a10.1007/s11046-007-0095-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavanelli, Wander R. 10aProtection induced in BALB/c mice by the high-molecular-mass (hMM) fraction of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis  ap. 117-128.  aParacoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a granulomatous disease caused by a dimorphic fungus, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The present study investigated the protective activity of the P. brasiliensis high-molecular-mass (hMM) fraction (~380 kDa) in experimental murine PCM. In the first step, lymphocyte proliferation and production of IFNγ (but not IL-4) were observed in “in vitro” spleen cells (from female BALB/c mice infected (i.v.) with P. brasiliensis) that were stimulated with hMM fractions. In the second step, female BALB/c mice were previously immunized (s.c.) with hMM fraction (25 μg/protein = F-25 and 50 μg/protein = F-50), and the colony-forming units (CFU) of the lung and spleen, the histopathological characteristics of the granulomatous lesions, and plasmatic gp43 soluble antigens and anti-hMM IgG levels were analyzed at 28 and 56 days after infection. The lung and liver CFU were lower in mice previously immunized with the hMM fraction (P < 0.05). The granulomatous lesions revealed a greater degree of compaction and organization, with no dissemination of the fungus to other organs. Lower soluble antigen levels (P < 0.05) and higher IgG anti-hMM fraction (P < 0.05) were observed in immunized groups. The results for CFU, histopathology and antigenemia suggest that the hMM fraction has a protective effect in experimental paracoccidioidomycosis in BALB/c mice. 3agranuloma 3aParacoccidioides brasiliensis 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Fungalxblood 2aAntigens, Fungalxbloodximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aChromatography 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCytokinesximmunology 2aFemale 2aFungal Proteinsxblood 2aGlycoproteinsxblood 2aGranulomaxpathology 2aImmunization 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aLiverxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aLungxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aParacoccidioidesxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aParacoccidioidomycosisximmunologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aSpleenxcytologyxpathology. 0aantigenemia 0aCFU 0aparacoccidioidomycosis 0aprotection1 aKaminami, Mari S. 1 aGeres, Juliana R. 1 aSano, Ayako 1 aOno, Mario A. 1 aCamargo, I.

When potato tuber slices were inoculated with one of two L. monocytogenes strains (Scott A and ATCC 15313), an increase in numbers of 3 to 4 logs per gram of tissue was observed with samples that were stored at 20 degrees C for 6 days. However, an increase of about 2 logs was observed with samples that were stored at 8 degrees C for 12 days. When potato slices were simultaneously inoculated with L. monocytogenes and one of the four soft rot bacteria, the growth of L. monocytogenes was inhibited in the presence of P. fluorescens or P. viridiflava but was not significantly affected in the presence of E. carotovora or X. campestris. The antagonism of the two pseudomonads to L. monocytogenes was also observed in potato tuber extract and in culture media. Formation of inhibition zones was observed only in iron-deficient media but not in the medium supplemented with FeCl3. In addition, production of fluorescent siderophore (pyoverdin) by these two pseudomonads was demonstrated. L. monocytogenes was unable to colonize macerated plant tissue induced by soft-rotting bacteria 2 days before inoculation of the pathogen. These results indicate that growth of L. monocytogenes on potato tuber slices is differentially affected by soft rot bacteria and that antagonism of fluorescent pseudomonads to L. monocytogenes is possibly caused by the production of iron-chelating siderophore by these pseudomonads. 3ainterspecific variation 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum 3aXanthomonas campestris 3astorage 3apostharvest diseases 3aPseudomonas viridiflava 3afood contamination 3airon 3amicrobial contamination 3asiderophores 3apotatoes 3aListeria monocytogenes 3atemperature 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aListeria monocytogenesxgrowth & development 2aPectobacterium carotovorumxgrowth & development 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonadaceaexgrowth & development 2aSiderophoresxmetabolism 2aSolanum tuberosumxmicrobiology 0acolonization 0aspecies differences 0aexperimental infections 0ainteractions 0ainhibition 0agrowth1 aSapers, G.M.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 Apr., v. 62, no. 4 p.343-348x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02955naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245012000167300001600287500001500303520171900318650001102037650001402048650001502062650001302077650001902090650001902109650001602128650001002144650001302154653000902167653002702176653001502203653001502218700001602233700001402249700001702263773007102280852000902351856009202360930003302452945001302485946001102498655001202509IND2202577720221122223353.0000215e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220257772DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00512.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, J.D.10aConfocal measurement of the three-dimensional size and shape of plant parenchyma cells in a developing fruit tissue  ap. 229-236.  a2019-12-04  aParenchyma cells from the inner mesocarp of a grape berry (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay) were visualised in three-dimensions within a whole mount of cleared, stained tissue using confocal laser scanning microscopy and digital image reconstruction. The whole berry was fixed, bisected longitudinally, cleared in methyl salicylate, stained with safranin O and mounted in methyl salicylate. Optical slices were collected at 1.0 micrometer intervals to a depth of 150 micrometer. Neighbouring z-series were joined post-collection to double the field-of-view. Attenuation at depth of the fluorescent signal from cell walls was quantified and corrected. Axial distortion due to refractive index mismatch between the immersion and mounting media was calibrated using yellow-green fluorescent microspheres and corrected. Transmission electron microscopy was used to correct fluorescent measurements of cell wall thickness. Digital image reconstructions of wall-enclosed spaces enabled cells to be rendered as geometric solids of measurable surface area and volume. Cell volumes within the inner mesocarp tissue of a single grape berry exhibited a 14-fold range, with polysigmoidal distribution and groupings around specific size classes. Cell shape was irregular and the planes of contact were rarely flat or simple. Variability in cell shape was indicated by the range in surface area to volume ratios, from 0.080 to 0.198 micrometer(-1). Structural detail at the internal surface of the cell wall was apparent. The technique is applicable to a wide range of morphometric analyses in plant cell biology, particularly developmental studies, and reveals details of cell size and shape that were previously unattainable. 3avolume 3athickness 3acell walls 3amesocarp 3aVitis vinifera 3aultrastructure 3ameasurement 3ashape 3afruiting 0asize 0abiochemical techniques 0aparenchyma 0aevaluation1 aKolesik, P.1 aHoj, P.B.1 aCoombe, B.G.0 tplant journal.g1999 July, v. 19, no. 2 p.229-236x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1999.00512.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02828naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245006000205300001600265506007600281520131000357506003701667650002501704650001801729650001101747650001901758650002201777650001201799650002701811700003101838700002601869700002701895700001901922700002201941700002201963700002601985700002002011700001802031773017102049852000902220856008302229930003302312946001302345655001202358IND4400292120221207062135.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440029212DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07109911052doi7 aPMC22066052pmcid7 a181847992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIacoangeli, Anna10aOn BC1 RNA and the fragile X mental retardation protein  ap. 734-739.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the functional absence of which causes fragile X syndrome, is an RNA-binding protein that has been implicated in the regulation of local protein synthesis at the synapse. The mechanism of FMRP's interaction with its target mRNAs, however, has remained controversial. In one model, it has been proposed that BC1 RNA, a small non-protein-coding RNA that localizes to synaptodendritic domains, operates as a requisite adaptor by specifically binding to both FMRP and, via direct base-pairing, to FMRP target mRNAs. Other models posit that FMRP interacts with its target mRNAs directly, i.e., in a BC1-independent manner. Here five laboratories independently set out to test the BC1-FMRP model. We report that specific BC1-FMRP interactions could be documented neither in vitro nor in vivo. Interactions between BC1 RNA and FMRP target mRNAs were determined to be of a nonspecific nature. Significantly, the association of FMRP with bona fide target mRNAs was independent of the presence of BC1 RNA in vivo. The combined experimental evidence is discordant with a proposed scenario in which BC1 RNA acts as a bridge between FMRP and its target mRNAs and rather supports a model in which BC1 RNA and FMRP are translational repressors that operate independently.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA-binding proteins 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3anon-coding RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3asynapse 3atranslation (genetics)1 aRozhdestvensky, Timofey S.1 aDolzhanskaya, Natalia1 aTournier, Barthélémy1 aSchütt, Janin1 aBrosius, Jürgen.1 aDenman, Robert B.1 aKhandjian, Edouard W.1 aKindler, Stefan1 aTiedge, Henri0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.734-739dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07109911053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01700naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002000186245005600206300001600262520069300278653005300971653002101024653002901045653003601074700002001110773011801130852000901248856008501257930003301342946001101375655001201386IND4430744220221122201208.0100101e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443074422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11205-006-9079-x2doi7 aPMC28062172pmcid7 a200767762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, Jeffrey 10aMobile phones in Africa: how much do we really know  ap. 117-126.  aMobile phones are a crucial mode of communication and welfare enhancement in poor countries, especially those lacking an infrastructure of fixed lines. In recent years much has been written about how mobile telephony in Africa is rapidly reducing the digital divide with developed countries. Yet, when one examines the evidence it is not at all clear what is really happening. In one country, Tanzania, for example, some observers point to the fact that 97% of the population lives under the mobile footprint, while others show that ownership is very limited. These extreme values prompted us to review the situation in Africa as a whole, in an effort to discover what is really going on. 0aConcepts of mobile reach in developing countries 0aMobile footprint 0aAfrica as a special case 0aImplications for digital divide1 aVersteeg, Mila 0 tSocial indicators research.g2007 Oct., v. 84, no. 1 p.117-126dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0303-83007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-006-9079-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02848naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245013200158300001600290500001500306520157600321650003001897650002301927650002101950650001301971650001101984650002701995650001302022650000902035650001602044650002802060650001802088650001902106653000802125653002502133653002002158700001702178700003902195773007802234852000902312930003302321945002502354946001102379655001202390IND4372139320221122201109.0050711e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437213932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this study, several approaches to induce cytotoxicity against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) were evaluated. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with BHV-1 induced a strong humoral, but no CTL, response, which may be due to downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. In contrast, vaccinia virus expressing glycoprotein B (gB) elicited a weaker antibody response, but strong cytotoxicity, in mice. As an approach to inducing both strong humoral and cellular immune responses, a plasmid vector was then used to express gB. Both antibody and CTL responses were induced by the plasmid encoding gB in C57BL/6 and C3H mice, regardless of the type of vector backbone. This demonstrated that DNA immunization induces a broad-based immune response to BHV-1 gB. Interestingly, removal of the membrane anchor, which resulted in secretion of gB from transfected cells, did not result in reduced cytotoxicity. Here, it is shown that, compared with the cell-associated counterpart, plasmid-encoded secreted protein may induce enhanced immune responses in cattle. Therefore, calves were immunized intradermally with pMASIAtgB, a plasmid encoding the secreted form of gB (tgB), using a needle-free injection system. This demonstrated that pMASIAtgB elicited both humoral responses and activated gamma interferon-secreting CD8(+) CTLs, suggesting that a DNA vaccine expressing tgB induces a CTL response in the natural host of BHV-1. 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aantibody formation 3ahumoral immunity 3avaccines 3acattle 3acell-mediated immunity 3aplasmids 3amice 3avaccination 3acytotoxic T-lymphocytes 3aglycoproteins 3aviral antigens 0aDNA 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0aimmune response1 aBabiuk, L.A.1 aVan Drunen Littel-van den Hurk, S.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 Apr., v. 86 p.887-898x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02868naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245011000176300001600286500001500302520145300317650003701770650001901807650002501826650002901851650002001880650001001900650003001910650002201940650002001962650002101982653002802003653002502031700001302056700001702069700001502086700002202101700001402123700001802137700002702155700002402182773007802206852000902284930003302293945002502326946001102351655001202362IND4372140820221122165135.0050711e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437214082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGillet, L.10aDevelopment of bovine herpesvirus 4 as an expression vector using bacterial artificial chromosome cloning  ap. 907-917.  a2019-12-05  aSeveral features make bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) attractive as a backbone for use as a viral expression vector and/or as a model to study gammaherpesvirus biology. However, these developments have been impeded by the difficulty in manipulating its large genome using classical homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. In the present study, the feasibility of exploiting bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cloning and prokaryotic recombination technology for production of BoHV-4 recombinants was explored. Firstly, the BoHV-4 genome was BAC cloned using two potential insertion sites. Both sites of insertion gave rise to BoHV-4 BAC clones stably maintained in bacteria and able to regenerate virions when transfected into permissive cells. Reconstituted virus replicated comparably to wild-type parental virus and the loxP-flanked BAC cassette was excised by growing them on permissive cells stably expressing Cre recombinase. Secondly, BoHV-4 recombinants expressing Ixodes ricinus anti-complement protein I or II (IRAC I/II) were produced using a two-step mutagenesis procedure in Escherichia coli. Both recombinants induced expression of high levels of functional IRAC molecules in the supernatant of infected cells. This study demonstrates that BAC cloning and prokaryotic recombination technology are powerful tools for the development of BoHV-4 as an expression vector and for further fundamental studies of this gammaherpesvirus. 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aIxodes ricinus 3arecombinant proteins 3ahomologous recombination 3agene expression 3agenes 3aBovine gammaherpesvirus 4 3amolecular cloning 3agenetic vectors 3aEscherichia coli 0aanti-complement protein 0aBovine herpesvirus 41 aDaix, V.1 aDonofrio, G.1 aWagner, M.1 aKoszinowski, U.H.1 aChina, B.1 aAckermann, M.1 aMarkine-Goriaynoff, N.1 aVanderplasschen, A.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 Apr., v. 86 p.907-917x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20060222b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/08/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02900naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100002400201245008600225300001600311500001500327506007600342520129400418506003701712650001901749650002401768650002101792650003201813650001701845650001001862650001101872650001101883650002901894653002101923653001901944700002001963700002001983700001702003700002002020700002002040773017102060852000902231856008302240930003302323945002502356946001302381655001202394IND4400293220221207051204.0080120e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440029322DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.07089471052doi7 aPMC22066162pmcid7 a181848082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The biological function of day respiratory metabolism is a major conundrum of plant photosynthesis research: because the rate of CO₂ evolution is partly inhibited in the light, it is viewed as either detrimental to plant carbon balance or necessary for photosynthesis operation (e.g., in providing cytoplasmic ATP for sucrose synthesis). Systematic variations in the rate of day respiration under contrasting environmental conditions have been used to elucidate the metabolic rationale of respiration in the light. Using isotopic techniques, we show that both glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle activities are inversely related to the ambient CO₂/O₂ ratio: day respiratory metabolism is enhanced under high photorespiratory (low CO₂) conditions. Such a relationship also correlates with the dihydroxyacetone phosphate/Glc-6-P ratio, suggesting that photosynthetic products exert a control on day respiration. Thus, day respiration is normally inhibited by phosphoryl (ATP/ADP) and reductive (NADH/NAD) poise but is up-regulated by photorespiration. Such an effect may be related to the need for NH₂ transfers during the recovery of photorespiratory cycle intermediates.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3aXanthium strumarium 3aphotorespiration 3agas production (biological) 3agas exchange 3alight 3aoxygen 3aleaves 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 0acell respiration 0aphotosynthesis1 aBligny, Richard1 aGout, Elizabeth1 aMahé, Aline1 aHodges, Michael1 aCornic, Gabriel0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 105, no. 2 p.797-802dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.07089471053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080328b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/28  aOther US 7aarticle02920naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245021700171300001600388520132900404650002501733650001201758650002201770650003801792650003701830650001701867650001001884650001501894650001501909650001101924650002501935650003701960650001301997653002502010653000902035653000902044653000902053653000902062700002702071700002002098700002102118700001902139773012302158852000902281856009202290930003302382946001102415655001202426IND4431310820221122165134.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443131082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01874.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiko, Angelika10aEvaluation of multiple-locus variable number of tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) as a method for identification of clonal groups among enteropathogenic, enterohaemorrhagic and avirulent Escherichia coli O26 strains  ap. 137-146.  aA published multiple-locus variable number of tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) scheme was compared with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for genotyping of 62 Escherichia coli O26 strains from humans, animals and food. The strains were isolated between 1947 and 2006 in eight countries on three continents and divided into 23 enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), 33 enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), one enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and five avirulent strains. ETEC and avirulent E. coli serotyped as O26:H32. EHEC and EPEC O26 strains shared flagellar type H11 and the eae-β gene, and divided into two clonal lineages by their arcA gene sequence and fermentation of rhamnose and dulcitol. The rhamnose/dulcitol-nonfermenting (RDF-), 'arcA allele 1' type comprised 22 EHEC and 15 EPEC strains. The rhamnose/dulcitol-fermenting (RDF+), 'arcA allele 2' type encompassed 17 EPEC and one EHEC strain. PFGE typing of the 62 O26 strains revealed 54 distinct patterns, whereas 29 profiles were obtained by MLVA. Like PFGE, MLVA divided RDF- and RDF+ O26:[H11] strains into two distinct clusters of related strains. The O26:H32 strains formed a separate PFGE cluster and two clusters by MLVA. MLVA was found as suitable, but more rapid and easier to standardize than PFGE for identifying genetically related E. coli O26 strains. 3aEscherichia coli O26 3aalleles 3aavirulent strains 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3afermentation 3afoods 3agalactitol 3agenotyping 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arhamnose 0aEscherichia coli O26 0aSTEC 0aEPEC 0aPFGE 0aMLVA1 aLindstedt, Bjørn-Arne1 aBrandal, Lin T.1 aLøbersli, Inger1 aBeutin, Lothar0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2010 Feb., v. 303, no. 2 p.137-146dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01874.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02580naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245005900189300001600248520158500264650000801849653001201857653002401869653000801893653000801901700001401909700002901923700001401952700001301966773010601979852000902085856009202094930003302186946001102219655001202230IND4432881320221122165110.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443288132DNAL7 a205003962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03260.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGONZÁLEZ, M.10aAnalysis of damaged region of carbon implanted alumina  ap. 359-363.  aImplantation was performed on surface-polished and thermal-treated alumina discs with 75 keV monocharged carbon ions at doses of 1 x 10¹⁷ and 5 x 10¹⁷ ions cm⁻². The alumina targets were kept at room temperature. The structural modifications induced during ion irradiation were studied by the scanning and scanning transmission electron microscopes. Alumina is readily amorphized at room temperature with carbon ions. The width of the ion-beam induced disordered area increases with ion dose. As it was established by selected area electron diffraction and electron energy loss spectra, low implanted specimens still show subsurface crystalline areas whose diffraction patterns could be assigned to a deformed structure of alumina. This deformed belt is shown beneath the amorphous region on highly implanted samples. Electron energy loss spectroscopy allows to follow the carbon line profile from surface into the bulk material, pointing the maximum concentration of implanted ion on the lower half of the amorphous region. Structural changes of Al₂O₃ caused by carbon ion irradiation were corroborated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments showed that the oxygen concentration in the vicinity of the implanted alumina surface was reduced suggesting that this element was selectively sputtered by carbon irradiation. As a function of depth, peaks referring to Al-O bindings diminish while contributions of reduced aluminium and metal carbides were found, reaching the corresponding maxima at a depth of about 130 nm. 3aeel 0aAlumina 0acarbon implantation 0aTEM 0aXPS1 aRoman, R.1 aGONZÁLEZ-CASABLANCA, J.1 aGomez, A.1 aHOLE, D.0 tJournal of microscopy.g2010 Mar., v. 237, no. 3 p.359-363dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-27207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03260.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02177naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245006900178300001600247520108300263650001101346650002601357650001801383650001801401650003301419650001701452650001401469650001501483651001801498653002301516700002101539773010801560852000901668856009201677930003301769946001301802655001201815IND4439319020221122132351.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443931902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00620.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaraloto, Christopher10aFine-scale Microhabitat Heterogeneity in a French Guianan Forest  ap. 420-428.  aWe examined fine-scale heterogeneity of environmental conditions in a primary rain forest in French Guiana to describe variation in microhabitats that plants may experience during establishment. We characterized both the range as well as the spatial structuring of 11 environmental factors important for seedling establishment in six hexagonal sampling grids, one each in gap and understory sites at three points representing the predominant geomorphic units in this primary forest. Each grid contained 37 sampling points separated by 31 cm-20 m. Monte-Carlo tests of semivariograms against complete spatial randomness indicated that for many variables in all six sampling grids, spatial dependence did not exceed 1 m. A principal component analysis of all sampling points revealed a lack of spatial microhabitat structure, rather than homogeneous patches associated with canopy structure or geomorphology. Our results suggest that ample fine-scale spatial heterogeneity exists to support the coexistence of plant species with differential abiotic requirements for regeneration. 3acanopy 3aenvironmental factors 3ageomorphology 3amicrohabitats 3aprincipal component analysis 3arain forests 3aseedlings 3aunderstory 3aFrench Guiana 0alight availability1 aCouteron, Pierre0 tBiotropica.g2010 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.420-428dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx0006-36067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00620.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03171naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158100001700175245003800192300001600230500001500246520191100261650002602172650003202198650002602230650001002256650001302266650002002279650003102299650002102330650001902351650002002370650001702390650001202407653002002419653002302439773010202462852000902564856008102573930003302654945002502687946001302712655001202725IND4434612820221122132411.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443461282DNAL7 a10.3382/ps.2009-005652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPardue, S.L.10aFood, energy, and the environment  ap. 797-802.  a2019-12-04  aDuring the 2009 annual meeting of the Poultry Science Association, a symposium entitled "Global Views of New Agriculture: Food, Energy, and the Environment" was held that focused on several major issues affecting agriculture. Issues included future funding for basic agricultural research, sustainability, bioenergy, and their effects on global food markets. In many ways, a subtitle for the symposium could have been "Agriculture--Why What We Do Matters." It matters because of the fiscal and physical realities the planet will face in the coming decades relative to human population growth and the increasing demands to feed a hungry world. The challenges are daunting and the technologies to address them will require us to reevaluate the structure and policies we have established relative to agricultural research. In this case, change is all the more difficult because the traditional model of agricultural research has been so successful. One only needs to note the remarkable increases in productivity of the past half century of commodities such as corn and soybeans or feed efficiencies among broilers, laying hens, and turkeys to recognize the significant advancements that have been achieved. However, these historic gains have frequently required increased inputs, most notably fossil fuels. Food production in the future will likely be confronted with concerns involving energy, water, climate change, and the threat of agroterrorism. For example, we will need to develop crops that are more drought-resistant and more tolerant to a wider range of salinities as access to fresh water becomes more problematic. Animal agriculture will also need to adapt to diets composed of atypical feedstuffs. Whether future generations will inherit a world described by Paul Roberts in his books The End of Oil and The End of Food will be in part determined by the research model we adopt in the near term. 3ainput output analysis 3alivestock and meat industry 3aagricultural research 3afeeds 3asalinity 3afeed conversion 3aenergy use and consumption 3awater management 3aclimate change 3afood production 3afossil fuels 3apoultry 0apoultry science 0aliterature reviews0 tPoultry science.g2010 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.797-802dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-005653Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/12  aOther US 7aarticle02960naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245017800148300001800326520164000344650002201984650001202006650002602018650001402044650001902058650003202077650002002109650002102129650001902150650001802169650003202187650001702219650002602236653001502262700001902277700001502296700002402311700002102335773008002356852000902436930003302445945002502478946001102503655001202514IND4432851020221122073132.0100218e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443285102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSunpapao, Anurag14aThe 2b protein of cucumber mosaic virus is essential for viral infection of the shoot apical meristem and for efficient invasion of leaf primordia in infected tobacco plants  ap. 3015-3021.  aIt has been reported previously that a 2b protein-defective mutant of the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Pepo strain ((delta)2b) induces only mild symptoms in systemically infected tobacco plants. To clarify further the role of the (delta)2b protein as an RNA silencing suppressor in mosaic symptom expression during CMV infection, this study monitored the sequential distribution of (delta)2b in the shoot meristem and leaf primordia (LP) of inoculated tobacco. Time-course histochemical observations revealed that (delta)2b was distributed in the shoot meristem at 7 days post-inoculation (p.i.), but could not invade shoot apical meristem (SAM) and quickly disappeared from the shoot meristem, whereas wild-type (Pepo) transiently appeared in SAM from 4 to 10 days p.i. In LP, (delta)2b signals were detected only at 14 and 21 days p.i., whereas dense Pepo signals were observed in LP from 4 to 18 days p.i. Northern blot analysis showed that small interfering RNA (siRNA) derived from (delta)2b RNA accumulated earlier in the shoot meristem and LP than that of Pepo. However, a similar amount of siRNA was detected in both Pepo- and (delta)2b-infected plants at late time points. Tissue printing analysis of the inoculated leaves indicated that the areas infected by Pepo increased faster than those infected by (delta)2b, whereas accumulation of (delta)2b in protoplasts was similar to that of Pepo. These findings suggest that the 2b protein of the CMV Pepo strain determines virulence by facilitating the distribution of CMV in the shoot meristem and LP via prevention of RNA silencing and/or acceleration of cell-to-cell movement. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atobacco 3aCucumber mosaic virus 3ainfection 3aviral proteins 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ashoot meristems 3aapical meristems 3aleaf primordia 3apathogenicity 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3apathogenesis 3asmall interfering RNA 0a2b protein1 aNakai, Takashi1 aDong, Fang1 aMochizuki, Tomofumi1 aOhki, Satoshi T.0 tJournal of general virology.g2009 Dec., v. 90 p.3015-3021x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20100223b20100305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/02/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03738naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001900211245008800230300001600318500008600334520179700420650002102217650002002238650002202258650001802280650001802298650002302316650002502339650002402364650002002388650001402408650001302422650001502435650002502450650002202475650001402497650002002511650002002531650002002551650002402571650003002595650001202625650002402637650004602661650001102707650000902718650004202727650001402769653002302783700001902806773010202825852000902927856008102936930003303017945002503050946001303075655001203088IND4434613220221122073710.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443461322DNAL7 a203084172pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-004392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKatanbaf, M.N.10aPrimary broiler breeding--Striking a balance between economic and well-being traits  ap. 822-824.  aPaper presented at a symposium held July 20-23, 2009, in Raleigh, North Carolina.  aPrimary breeders are well aware that selecting for better health and well-being along with economic traits such as faster growth rate, higher levels of meat yield, and improved efficiency of feed utilization are critical to balanced long-term genetic progress of their pure lines as well as to increased production efficiency of broiler products for the broiler industry. Cobb collects and selects on over 50 phenotypic observations per pedigree candidate at various ages. Over 50% of these collections are involved with evaluation of each bird's health, welfare, and fitness. Some examples of these traits are various chick defects, various broiler age skeletal and leg abnormalities, feather cover, various physiological measures of heart and lung functions, and specific causes of mortality. Large pedigree populations, massive data collection infrastructure, integration of better technologies in evaluation of phenotypes, and sophisticated data analysis capability have allowed geneticists to perform selections that are balanced for both economic and welfare traits. Cobb's internal as well as worldwide sponsored research has facilitated geneticists to make science-based breeding decisions. Each pedigree line per product available to primary breeders exhibits their own unique characteristics that are enhanced by selective breeding and positioned in special mating schemes to produce the product and welfare performance that our customers demand. Additionally, most if not all primary breeding companies now offer different products for different markets that exhibit varying levels of performance and behavior to fit customer needs. Future expansion of these products and creation of new products by breeding companies will be in large dictated by both our customers and consumers. 3abroiler breeders 3aanimal breeding 3aanimal well-being 3aanimal health 3acarcass yield 3aselection criteria 3aartificial selection 3agenetic improvement 3afeed conversion 3aphenotype 3apedigree 3aanimal age 3aabnormal development 3aanimal physiology 3amortality 3adata collection 3aconsumer demand 3aanimal behavior 3aproduct development 2aAnimal Welfarexstandards 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxstandards 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMolecular Biologyxstandardsxtrends. 2aPhenotype 0aliterature reviews1 aHardiman, J.W.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.822-824dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-004393Available from publisher's Web site  a20100607b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/12  aOther US 7aarticle02905naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245011700145300001600262500001500278520103300293650001801326650001701344650001501361650001201376650002301388650000901411650001601420650001201436650002201448650001601470650001501486650001001501650000901511650001001520650001901530650002201549650002401571650002901595650002001624650001101644650002301655650001601678650002701694650005801721650005901779651001701838651001701855653001801872653001401890653002101904653001601925700001701941700001401958700001601972700001701988700001802005700001502023700001702038773008402055852000902139930003302148945001302181946001302194655001202207IND2201115020221122063224.0991015e199902  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220111502DNAL7 a100306282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShapiro, R.10aSalmonella Thompson associated with improper handling of roast beef at a restaurant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota  ap. 118-122.  a2019-12-05  aIn October 1996, we investigated an outbreak of Salmonella serotype Thompson infections associated with Restaurant A in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and conducted two cohort studies among persons who ate at luncheons catered by Restaurant A. Fifty-two Salmonella Thompson infections were identified between 29 September and 14 October 1996. Infections occurred among employees and patrons at Restaurant A and among attendees at three luncheons catered by the restaurant on 7 October. Roast beef cooked at Restaurant A was the only food item significantly associated with illness. Cooking times and storage temperatures for roast beef were inadequate to prevent multiplication of Salmonella, and the chefs were unaware of proper cooking and storage temperatures. We conclude that improper handling of roast beef probably caused this outbreak of Salmonella Thompson infections. Better knowledge of food safety practices by the cooking staff at Restaurant A, through required food safety education, might have prevented the outbreak. 3afood handling 3aepidemiology 3aSalmonella 3acooking 3afood contamination 3abeef 3arestaurants 3astorage 3agenetic variation 3atemperature 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aChild 2aCohort Studies 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFood Handlingxstandards 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aMiddle Aged 2aRestaurantsxstandards 2aSalmonellaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aSalmonella Food Poisoningxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 3aSouth Dakota 0aSouth Dakota 0ameat products 0aoutbreaks 0afood preparation 0afood safety1 aAckers, M.L.1 aLance, S.1 aRabbani, M.1 aSchaefer, L.1 aDaugherty, J.1 aThelen, C.1 aSwerdlow, D.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.118-122x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02999naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245006500151300001600216520180500232650001002037650001102047650001402058650001802072650001602090650001702106650001002123650001702133650001002150650002202160650002602182650002102208650001102229650002702240700001602267700002102283700002202304773011002326852000902436856007602445930003302521946001102554655001202565IND4436811820221121033616.0100508e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443681182DNAL7 a10.1002/jms.17342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yunsen10aMass spectrometry of fluorocarbon-labeled glycosphingolipids  ap. 504-519.  aA method for generation of novel fluorocarbon derivatives of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) with high affinity for fluorocarbon phases has been developed, and their potential applications to mass spectrometry (MS)-based methodologies for glycosphingolipidomics have been investigated. Sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase (SCDase) is used to remove the fatty acid from the ceramide moiety, after which a fluorocarbon-rich substituent (F-Tag) is incorporated at the free amine of the sphingoid. In initial trials, a neutral GSL, globotriaosylceramide (Gb₃Cer), three purified bovine brain gangliosides, and four fungal glycosylinositol phosphorylceramides (GIPCs) were de-N-acylated, derivatized by prototype F-Tags, and recovered by solid phase extraction on fluorocarbon-derivatized silica (F-SPE). The efficacy of SCDase treatment of GIPCs was here demonstrated for the first time. Compatibility with subsequent per-N,O-methylation was established for the F-tagged Gb₃ Cer and purified gangliosides, and extensive mass spectra (MS¹ and MS²) consistent with all of the expected products were acquired. The potential use of F-tagged derivatives for a comprehensive MS based profiling application was then demonstrated on a crude ganglioside mixture extracted from bovine brain. Finally, a simple trial in microarray format demonstrated fixation of F-tagged GM₁ ganglioside to a fluorous glass surface, with the glycan intact and available for interaction with a fluorescent derivative of cholera toxin B chain. The methods described thus provide a new avenue for rapid GSL recovery or cleanup, potentially compatible with a variety of platforms for mass spectrometric profiling and structure analysis, as well as parallel analysis of functional interactions.

This was used to establish which factors, including application technique (very small, small, medium and large drop-size), crop characteristics (short/tall, thin/dense) and pattern application of the operator (walking towards or away from the treated area) are relevant to the dermal exposure levels of greenhouse applicators. The results showed that the highest exposure by pesticides during field applications in greenhouses, in the climatic conditions and in the crop conditions typical of a southern European country, occurs on the lower legs and front thighs of the applicators. Similar results were obtained by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Drop-size seems to be very important in determining total exposure, while height and density of crops have little influence on total exposure under the conditions of the present study. No pesticide type is a major factor in total exposure. The application of multiple regression analysis (MRA) allowed assessment of the relationships between the pesticide exposure of the less affected parts of the body with the most affected parts. 3aclimatic factors 3acluster analysis 3adermal exposure 3agas chromatography 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3ahumans 3apesticides 3aplant density 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3athighs 3awalking 3aEurope1 aGonzález, Francisco J Egea1 aFrenich, Antonia Garrido1 aGalera, María Martínez1 aAguilera, Pedro A.1 aCarrique, Enrique López0 tPest management science.g2002 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.784-790wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.5243Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140403  aNon-US 7aarticle02541naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245011400168300001400282500013300296520103900429650002401468650004001492650002101532650001301553650001401566650002301580650002901603650001401632650001401646650000901660650001001669650001401679650002801693650001401721650001001735651001001745651001601755700002001771700001601791700001701807700001601824700001201840773014301852856005501995852000902050655001202059IND60608928620221120230934.0180814e20180630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060892862DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1203.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTahir, J.10aTolerance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae in a kiwifruit breeding parent is conferred by multiple loci  ap. 67-70.  aPaper presented at the IV International Symposium on Molecular Markers in Horticulture held March 7-10 2017, Napier, New Zealand  aInternationally, commercial cultivars of kiwifruit species have exhibited significant susceptibility to the disease caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa biovar 3) since its outbreak in Italy in 2008. Actinidia germplasm provides a key resource for breeding tolerance against Psa biovar 3-induced cankers into commercial kiwifruit cultivars. Our goal was to characterize the genetic basis of tolerance or resistance to bacterial canker in an Actinidia chinensis genetic background. We crossed the highly susceptible gold-fleshed cultivar 'Hort16A' with the male parent 'Russell', a genotype that has exhibited field tolerance against Psa biovar 3 since the incursion of the disease into New Zealand in 2010. Using genotyping by sequencing in the 'Hort16A' × 'Russell' population, we generated genetic maps of all 29 chromosomes. Using these maps and phenotype data of individual seedlings, we identified quantitative trait loci for tolerance to symptomatic responses of kiwifruit vines to natural Psa biovar 3 infection. 3aActinidia chinensis 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae 3abacterial canker 3abreeding 3acultivars 3agenetic background 3agenotyping by sequencing 3agermplasm 3akiwifruit 3aloci 3amales 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseedlings 3avines 3aItaly 3aNew Zealand1 aGardiner, S.

The antioxidant capacity of plant foods and beverages included in National food consumption data was determined. TDAC of the Spanish diet was estimated at 6014 and 3549 micromol trolox equivalents by FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and ABTS (free radical-scavenging capacity) procedures, respectively. About 68% of TDAC came from beverages and 20% from fruits and vegetables, with a very low contribution from cereals. The capacity to inhibit in vitro LDL oxidation of plant foods and beverages was consistent with their antioxidant capacity. The recommended daily intakes of antioxidant vitamins, C and E, represent about 10% of TDAC. Total phenolics intake was estimated as 1171 mg gallic acid/person/day by the Folin-Ciocalteau method. TDAC may be a parameter to be considered in nutritional and epidemiological studies. 3afood intake 3adietary recommendations 3agrain crops 3afree radicals 3alipid peroxidation 3avitamin E 3aphenolic compounds 3alow density lipoprotein 3ain vitro studies 3avegetables 3aantioxidant activity 3adietary surveys 3aantioxidants 3abeverages 3aascorbic acid 3aSpain 0afruits (food) 0aMediterranean diet 0ahuman nutrition1 aGoni, I.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 Feb., v. 94, no. 3 p.442-447x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060613b20060702c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/01/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01521naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001400138245013300152300001800285520039800303650001400701650002600715650002000741650001100761650001500772650001300787650001100800650001400811700001600825700002600841700001700867773014200884852000901026856007801035930003301113946001301146655001201159IND4436806620221120210025.0100508e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443680662DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.240172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelon, C.10aOvercoming the oxygen inhibition in the photopolymerization of acrylates: A study of the beneficial effect of triphenylphosphine  ap. 2462-2469.  aTriphenylphosphine (TPP) was used in free-radical UV-curable resins to reduce oxygen inhibition effect.

  1 aPelosi, Celine10aEarthworm community in conventional, organic and direct seeding with living mulch cropping systems  ap. 287-295.  aThe loss of biodiversity by intensification of agricultural practices is a major environmental issue that calls for the design of new cropping systems. For instance, negative effects of tillage on earthworm populations have been reported. However, few field studies have compared full cropping systems. Here, we assessed diversity, density and biomass of earthworm populations for 3 years. We use a combined method involving a diluted solution of allyl isothiocyanate to expel earthworms followed by hand sorting. In a long-term trial, we compared 3 systems: (1) a conventional system, (2) a direct seeding living mulch-based cropping system, named a living mulch cropping system, and (3) an organic system. These three cropping systems differed in terms of soil tillage, pesticide and nitrogen use, and crop biomass production. The results showed that measured variables, except diversity, varied depending on the year of sampling. Further, anecic and epigeic density was 3.2-7.2 times higher in the living mulch cropping system than in the conventional and organic systems. There were 3.4-12.5 times more anecic and epigeic earthworm biomass in the living mulch cropping system. The conventional and organic systems showed, respectively, 2.8 and 2.2 times more earthworm density, and 1.9 and 1.8 times more endogeic earthworm biomass than in the living mulch cropping system. Shannon-Wiener and equitability indices were superior in the living mulch cropping system compared with the conventional and organic systems. Cropping systems thus modified specific and functional diversity as well as earthworm community biomass. On the other hand, the organic and conventional systems did not differ in their earthworm density, biomass or diversity. 3aearthworms 3apopulation density 3aspecies diversity 3abiomass 3alive mulches 3adirect seeding 3atillage 3apesticide application 3afertilizer application 3aorganic production 3asoil properties 3aFrance1 aBertrand, Michel1 aRoger-Estrade, Jean0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2009 , v. 29, no. 2 p.287-2957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.edpsciences.org/journal/index.cfm?edpsname=agro&niv1=contents&niv2=archives3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090512b20090608c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/05/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03376naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100001900134245013500153300001600288520175700304650002802061650001102089650002002100650001502120650001302135650001702148650001702165650001702182650001702199650002102216650001502237650001802252650001502270650001902285650001702304650002702321650002402348650001602372650001302388650002002401650001302421650001502434650001302449650001202462650001702474650001502491650001302506651001302519700002802532700001802560773008102578852000902659856007402668939003302742946001102775655001202786IND4479429420221120210055.0140403e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447942942DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.5312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Mushtaq10aBroad-spectrum insecticide resistance in obliquebanded leafroller Choristoneura rosaceana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) from Michigan  ap. 834-838.  aNineteen insecticides, belonging to nine chemical classes, were bioassayed by dietary exposure against two strains of obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana, collected from Michigan apple orchards. Berrien is a putatively organophosphate-resistant strain from a commercial orchard with a history of insecticide use, and Kalamazoo a susceptible strain from an isolated and unsprayed orchard. The Berrien strain was moderately resistant (about 25-fold) to organophosphates such as azinphos-methyl and chlorpyrifos. Very low resistance (<10-fold) was also observed to pyrethroids such as cypermethrin, zeta-cypermethrin, bifenthrin, deltamethrin and esfenvalerate, to the ecdysone agonists tebufenozide and methoxyfenozide, and to the chlorinated pyrrole chlorfenapyr. Endosulfan and carbamates such as thiodicarb, methomyl and carbaryl had low intrinsic toxicities against both strains, with little difference in sensitivity between them. There was no resistance to spinosad. Emamectin benzoate was found to be the most toxic insecticide against C rosaceana, with slightly higher lethal doses required for the Berrien strain. Unexpectedly, Berrien exhibited a very high level of resistance (>700-fold) to indoxacarb, which has never been used in Michigan to control this insect pest. The active metabolite of indoxacarb, DCJW, was considerably more toxic than the parent compound, but the resistance against DCJW was comparable to that seen with indoxacarb. This indicates that a failure to activate indoxacarb was not the mechanism of resistance in Berrien. The low level of resistance to several chemistries recorded in Michigan C rosaceana can be managed at this stage by adopting a rotation of chemistries having different modes of action. 3aChoristoneura rosaceana 3aapples 3aazinphos-methyl 3abifenthrin 3acarbaryl 3achlorfenapyr 3achlorpyrifos 3acypermethrin 3adeltamethrin 3adietary exposure 3aendosulfan 3aesfenvalerate 3aindoxacarb 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticide resistance 3amechanism of action 3ametabolites 3amethomyl 3amethoxyfenozide 3aorchards 3apyrethrins 3aspinosad 3astrains 3atebufenozide 3athiodicarb 3atoxicity 3aMichigan1 aHollingworth, Robert M.1 aWise, John C.0 tPest management science.g2002 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.834-838x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.5313Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140403  aNon-US 7aarticle02400naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008700128300001800215520139900233650000801632650001001640650001401650650001001664650001301674650001101687650000901698650001301707650002501720650001001745650003501755700002101790700002301811700002001834700001901854773008801873852000901961930003301970946001102003655001202014IND4430358020221120195517.0091225e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443035802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiard, Samuel10aPatrocles: a database of polymorphic miRNA-mediated gene regulation in vertebrates  ap. D640-D651.  aThe Patrocles database (http://www.patrocles.org/) compiles DNA sequence polymorphisms (DSPs) that are predicted to perturb miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Distinctive features include: (i) the coverage of seven vertebrate species in its present release, aiming for more when information becomes available, (ii) the coverage of the three compartments involved in the silencing process (i.e. targets, miRNA precursors and silencing machinery), (iii) contextual information that enables users to prioritize candidate 'Patrocles DSPs', including graphical information on miRNA-target coexpression and eQTL effect of genotype on target expression levels, (iv) the inclusion of Copy Number Variants and eQTL information that affect miRNA precursors as well as genes encoding components of the silencing machinery and (v) a tool (Patrocles finder) that allows the user to determine whether her favorite DSP may perturb miRNA-mediated gene regulation of custom target sequences. To support the biological relevance of Patrocles' content, we searched for signatures of selection acting on 'Patrocles single nucleotide polymorphisms (pSNPs)' in human and mice. As expected, we found a strong signature of purifying selection against not only SNPs that destroy conserved target sites but also against SNPs that create novel, illegitimate target sites, which is reminiscent of the Texel mutation in sheep. 3aDNA 3aTexel 3adatabases 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amice 3amicroRNA 3anucleotide sequences 3asheep 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aCharlier, Carole1 aCoppieters, Wouter1 aGeorges, Michel1 aBaurain, Denis0 tNucleic acids research.g2010 Jan., v. 38, no. suppl_1 p.D640-D651x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL  a20091225b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03694naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245007700192300001300269500002400282520218700306650001402493650003102507650001602538650001302554650001802567650002102585650001502606650002002621650001302641650001002654650003802664650004502702650001102747650001502758650001202773650002702785650002802812651001202840700002302852700001902875700002402894700002102918700002202939700002302961700002302984773009303007852000903100856005503109655001203164IND4446177320221120195408.0101208s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444617732DNAL7 a169096542pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00356.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKAINER, KAREN A.12aA Graduate Education Framework for Tropical Conservation and Development  ap. 3-13.  aIncludes references  aConventional graduate training related to tropical conservation and development has typically separated the two fields, with students focusing on either conservation from the perspective of the biophysical sciences or development as an extension of the social sciences. On entering the workforce, however, graduates find they are required to work beyond disciplinary boundaries to address the complex interconnectivity between biological conservation and human well-being. We devised a framework for graduate education that broadens students' skill sets to learn outside their immediate disciplines and think in terms of linked socioecological systems, work in teams, communicate in nonacademic formats, and reflect critically on their own perspectives and actions. The University of Florida's Tropical Conservation and Development program has adopted a learning and action platform that blends theory, skills, and praxis to create an intellectual, social, and professionally safe space where students, faculty, and other participants can creatively address the complex challenges of tropical conservation and development. This platform operates within a nondegree-granting program and includes core courses that are taught by a team of biophysical and social scientists. It incorporates a range of alternative learning spaces such as student-led workshops, retreats, visiting professionals, practitioner experiences, and a weekly student-led seminar that collectively encourage students and faculty to enhance their skills and systematically and thoroughly reflect on program activities. Challenges to the described approach include increased service demands on faculty, a redefinition of research excellence to include effective and equitable collaboration with host-country partners, and the trade-offs and uncertainties inherent in more collaborative, interdisciplinary research. Despite these challenges, growing interdisciplinary programs, coupled with adaptive educational approaches that emphasize learning and action networks of students, faculty, and field partners, provide the best hope for responding to the emerging challenges of tropical conservation and development. 3aeducation 3ainterdisciplinary research 3alabor force 3alearning 3aprofessionals 3aprogram planning 3ascientists 3asocial sciences 3astudents 3ateams 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEducation, Graduatexmethodsxstandards. 2aHumans 2aLeadership 2aMentors 2aProblem-Based Learning 2aProfessional Competence 0aFlorida1 aSchmink, Marianne.1 aCOVERT, HANNAH1 aSTEPP, JOHN RICHARD1 aBRUNA, EMILIO M.1 aDain, Jonathan L.1 aESPINOSA, SANTIAGO1 aHumphries, Shoana.0 tConservation biology.g2006, v. 20, no. 1 p.3-13dBlackwell Science Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00356.x 7aarticle02565naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002100134245012900155300001600284520134400300650002101644650000901665650002401674650000901698650002201707650001001729650001401739650001801753650002801771650001401799650001301813650001301826650001301839650001301852650001501865700002101880700002201901773008101923852000902004856007402013939003302087946001102120655001202131IND4479429220221120190111.0140403e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447942922DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.5302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWanner, Kevin W.10aLaboratory evaluation of two novel strategies to control first-instar gypsy moth larvae with spinosad applied to tree trunks  ap. 817-824.  aTwo strategies for controlling first-instar larvae of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar (L)), insecticidal bait and contact insecticide applied directly to the tree trunk, were evaluated in the laboratory. Spinosad was selected as a candidate natural-product insecticide that is active both by contact and ingestion. Incorporated into artificial diet-based bait, spinosad was toxic to neonate larvae with a minimal 10-s feeding period, with an LC50 value of 20 (15–26, 95% confidence interval) mg liter−1. It was significant that neonate larvae did not discriminate between spinosad-treated and control diet. Efficacy of diet-based bait in the laboratory, however, was significantly impacted by previous exposure to diet; fed larvae did not stop at the bait and did not incur mortality, as compared to unfed larvae. Oak bark was a suitable substrate from which neonate larvae could contact spinosad residues. Spinosad applied directly to oak bark resulted in significant mortality after 1- and 4-min crawling contact exposure times (LC50 = 24 [20–29, 95% CI] and 8.7 [6.9–11, 95% CI] mg liter−1, respectively) and contact activity persisted for 2 weeks. While contact activity was more potent on glass surfaces than on oak bark, the LC50 values differed only by factors of 2.4 and 3.6, for 1- and 4-min exposures respectively. 3aLymantria dispar 3abark 3aconfidence interval 3adiet 3aexposure duration 3aglass 3aingestion 3ainsect larvae 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3aneonates 3aspinosad 3asurfaces 3atoxicity 3atree trunk1 aHelson, Blair V.1 aHarris, Brenda J.0 tPest management science.g2002 Aug., v. 58, no. 8 p.817-824x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.5303Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140403  aNon-US 7aarticle02687naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001600138245015300154300001800307520144900325650004401774650001601818650002101834650003801855650001901893650001301912650003301925650001501958650002101973650003701994700001902031773014202050852000902192856007802201930003302279946001302312655001202325IND4436805420221120180450.0100508e20100601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443680542DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.240012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Haoyu10aPoly(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate)-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes from surface-initiated ring-opening polymerizations of N-carboxylanhydride  ap. 2340-2350.  aSingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been functionalized with poly(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) by ring-opening polymerizations of γ-benzyl-L-glutamic acid-based N-carboxylanhydrides (NCA-BLG) using amino-functionalized SWCNTs (SWCNT-NH₂) as initiators. The SWCNT functionalization has been verified by FTIR spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The FTIR study reveals that surface-attached PBLGs adopt random-coil conformations in contrast to the physically absorbed or bulk PBLGs, which exhibit α-helical conformations. Raman spectroscopic analysis reveals a significant alteration of the electronic structure of SWCNTs as a result of PBLG functionalization. The PBLG-functionalized SWCNTs (SWCNT-PBLG) exhibit enhanced solubility in DMF. Stable DMF solutions of SWCNT-PBLG/PBLG with a maximum SWCNTs concentration of 259 mg L⁻¹ can be readily obtained. SWCNT-PBLG/PBLG solid composites have been characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, wide/small-angle X-ray scattering (W/SAXS), scanning electron microscopy, and polarized optical microscopy for their thermal or morphological properties. Microfibers containing SWCNT-PBLG and PBLG can also be prepared via electrospinning. WAXS characterization reveals that SWCNTs are evenly distributed among PBLG rods in solution and in the solid state where PBLGs form a short-range nematic phase interspersed with amorphous domains. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3acarbon nanotubes 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZhang, Donghui0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 June 01, v. 48, no. 11 p.2340-2350dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.240013Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03373naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245011900176300001600295520189500311650001802206650001602224650001702240650001502257650001602272650002402288650001402312650002002326650001302346650001502359650001902374650001202393650001102405650001802416650001502434650001702449650001102466700001802477700001402495700001702509700001502526700001702541773007902558852000902637856012802646930003302774945002502807946001102832655001202843IND4420088620221120190050.0090507e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442008862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHjorth, M.10aNutrient value, odour emission and energy production of manure as influenced by anaerobic digestion and separation  ap. 329-338.  aCrop fields can be fertilised by application of manure because manure contains fertilising elements such as N and P, and organic matter that enhances soil physical properties. However, application of manure may also cause P and N pollution of surroundings, odour emission and waste of energy. A solution may be to apply an improved liquid manure fraction resulting from manure separation and anaerobic digestion. As previous studies have only focused on the factors individually, we carried out here a system analysis with the aim of optimising all the factors simultaneously. We tested three solid-liquid separations on raw manure and manure pre-digested in a biogas reactor, with the separation treatments being coagulation, flocculation and filtration, which differed mainly with respect to coagulant volume, and the N:P ratio of the products was measured. The NH3 and odour emission was determined from the liquid fractions during storage and after soil application, while the energy produced at anaerobic digestion of the solid fractions was measured. Our results show that energy production at digestion increased with decreasing coagulant volume, but was largely unaffected by anaerobic digestion whether performed both before and after or only after separation. Odour generation was reduced by pre-digestion. With increasing coagulant volume and without pre-digestion, the nutrient value of the liquid fraction was improved the most, as shown by an increase in the N/P ratio of the liquid fraction and by a decrease in NH3 emissions from stores and fields. The data proved that mechanical separation of raw manure, added coagulant and polymer, followed by anaerobic digestion of the solid fraction was the optimum strategy from a whole animal manure management perspective. The coagulant volume can be adjusted to favour either nutrient value and NH3 emission, or energy production. 3aliquid manure 3acoagulation 3aflocculation 3afiltration 3abioreactors 3aanaerobic digestion 3apollution 3asoil amendments 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aodor emissions 3aammonia 3abiogas 3agas emissions 3aseparation 3afermentation 3aenergy1 aNielsen, A.M.1 aNyord, T.1 aHansen, M.N.1 aNissen, P.1 aSommer, S.G.0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2009 , v. 29, no. 2 p.329-3387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.edpsciences.org/journal/index.cfm?edpsname=agro&niv1=contents&niv2=archives3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090512b20090608c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/05/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02917naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001100144245011300155300001600268520137800284650002501662650001901687650002101706650001701727650002501744650002501769650001801794650000901812650001501821650002101836650002301857650002201880650004301902650003701945650002501982650002302007650001202030650001302042650001302055650002902068653001702097700001302114700001302127700001402140700001302154700002102167700001402188773007102202852000902273930003302282945002502315946001102340655001202351IND4376684620221120170404.0051212e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437668462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, less attention has been given to its antioxidant activities. In our study the antioxidant activities of the feverfew extract and its bioactive components in terms of their free radical-scavenging activities against the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and their Fe(2+)-chelating capacities were determined. In addition, the bioactive constituents in feverfew were determined by GC-MS and HPLC-UV. The results showed that feverfew powder extracted by 80% alcohol contained camphor, parthenolide, luteolin and apigenin in 0.30 +/- 0.08%, 0.22% +/- 0.03%, 0.84% +/- 0.10% and 0.68% +/- 0.07%, respectively. Total phenolic content of the feverfew extract was measured in 21.21 +/- 2.11 microgram gallic acid equivalent per mg dry material. The feverfew alcoholic extract possessed a strong DPPH free radical-scavenging activity of 84.4% and moderate Fe(2+)-chelating capacity of 53.1%. Luteolin also showed strong DPPH scavenging activity of approximately 80% at greater than or equal to 0.52 mg/mL. Parthenolide exhibited weak DPPH scavenging activity of 15% and moderate Fe(2+)-chelating capacity of nearly 60%. Similar moderate Fe(2+)-chelating activity (approximately 60%) was observed for luteolin and apigenin at 2 mg/mL. 3aTanacetum parthenium 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal plants 3aantioxidants 3amedicinal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radicals 3airon 3ametal ions 3achelating agents 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3achemical composition 3aphenolic compounds 3acamphor 3aluteolin 3aapigenin 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 0aparthenolide1 aChen, F.1 aWang, X.1 aKim, H.J.1 aHe, G.Q.1 aHaley-Zitlin, V.1 aHuang, G.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 May, v. 96, no. 2 p.220-227x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060321b20060402c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/12  aNon-US 7aarticle03276naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002400161245008800185300001600273520196800289650002602257650002202283650001002305650001802315650002502333650001802358650001802376650002902394650001202423650001502435650001502450651001002465700002302475700002402498700002302522773007902545852000902624856012802633930003302761945002502794946001102819655001202830IND4420090520221120170413.0090507e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442009052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJurado-Exposito, M.12aA digital elevation model to aid geostatistical mapping of weeds in sunflower crops  ap. 391-400.  aA major concern in landscape management and precision agriculture is the variable-rate application of herbicides in order to reduce herbicide treatment load. These applications require a correct assessment and knowledge of the density and potential spatial variability of weed species within fields. This article addresses the issue of incorporating a digital elevation model as secondary spatial information into the mapping of main weed species present in two sunflower crops in Andalusia, Spain. Two prediction methods were used and compared for mapping weed density for precision agriculture. The primary information was obtained from an intensive grid weed density sampling and the secondary spatial information, e.g., elevation from a digital elevation model. The prediction methods were two geostatistical algorithms: ordinary kriging and kriging with an external drift, which takes into account the influence of landscape. Mean squared error was used to evaluate the performance of the map prediction quality. The best prediction method for mapping most of the weed species was kriging with an external drift, with the smallest mean squared error, indicating the highest accuracy. The results showed that kriging with an external drift with elevation reduced the prediction variance compared with ordinary kriging. Maps obtained from these kriged estimates showed that the incorporation of a digital elevation model as secondary exhaustive information can improve the accuracy of predicted weed densities within fields. These results suggest that kriging with an external drift of weed density data with elevation as a secondary exhaustive variable could be used in such situations, and in this way, the accuracy of maps for precision agriculture, which is the preliminary step in a precision agricultural management program, could be improved with little or no additional cost, since a digital elevation model could be obtained as part of other analyses. 3aprecision agriculture 3aHelianthus annuus 3aweeds 3aplant density 3aspatial distribution 3athematic maps 3ageostatistics 3adigital elevation models 3akriging 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 3aSpain1 aLopez-Granados, F.1 aPena-Barragan, J.M.1 aGarcía-Torres, L.0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2009 , v. 29, no. 2 p.391-4007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.edpsciences.org/journal/index.cfm?edpsname=agro&niv1=contents&niv2=archives3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090512b20090608c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/05/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02188naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245010800171300001600279500002400295520116500319650001601484650001401500650001101514650001201525653001901537653001401556653001601570653001501586700002101601700002801622700002001650773010401670852000901774856005501783655001201838IND4416213220221120155711.0090213e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441621322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2008.00630.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMooney, Ben D.10aSurvey for karlotoxin production in 15 species of gymnodinioid dinoflagellates (kareniaceae, dinophyta)  ap. 164-175.  aIncludes references  aToxin analysis of 15 species of Kareniaceae revealed the presence of karlotoxin, KmTx 2, in only a single species (Karlodinium veneficum) but with variable activity in strains from the Swan (KmSwanTx 2-1, 2.1 pg · cell⁻¹; and KmSwanTx 2-2, 0.53 pg · cell⁻¹), Huon (KmHuonTx 2, 0.86 pg · cell⁻¹), and Derwent rivers (<0.001 pg · cell⁻¹) in Australia. A newly isolated Southern Ocean species, Karlodinium conicum, contained a novel poorly hemolytic karlotoxin analogue (KmconicumTx, 2.8 pg · cell⁻¹). The hemolytic potency (HD50%) of the Australian karlotoxins were as follows: KmSwanTx 2-1 (65.9 ± 4.8 ng) and KmSwanTx 2-2 (63.4 ± 3.7 ng), KmHuonTx 2 (343 ± 4.9 ng), and KmconicumTx (>4,000 ng). Species from the closely related genera Takayama (T. helix, T. tasmanica, T. tuberculata), Karenia (K. asterichroma, K. brevis, K. mikimotoi, K. papilionacea, K. umbella), and Karlodinium (Ka. australe, Ka. antarcticum, Ka. ballantinum, Ka. corrugatum, Ka. decipiens) were all consistently negative for karlotoxin production.

Design: Experimental study with a randomized design. Subjects: Twenty healthy women and 20 healthy men. Interventions: Subjects were randomly assigned to consume each of two mixed natural diets for 4 weeks in a cross-over design. Reference and walnut diets were designed and the walnut diet had 12.5% of the energy derived from walnuts (44-58 g/day). Results: The total cholesterol and serum apolipoprotein B concentrations, and the ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol was significantly lowered in women and men when fed on the walnut diet, than when on the reference diet (P less than or equal to 0.05). The LDL cholesterol concentration was significantly lowered in women on the walnut diet (0.22 mmol/l, P = 0.0008), whereas this decrease was not significant in men (0.18 mmol/l, P = 0.078). The most prominent change in the fatty acid composition of the cholesteryl esters from serum after the walnut diet was an elevation of alpha-linolenic acid in women (76%, P < 0.001) and men (107%, P < 0.001). This elevation was negatively correlated to the change in LDL cholesterol in women (r = 0.496, P = 0.019) and men (r = 0.326, P = 0.138). The LDL oxidizability in women was not influenced by the diets (P = 0.19). Conclusions: alpha-Linolenic acid in the walnut diet appears to be responsible for the lowering of LDL cholesterol in women. 3amen 3awomen 3ablood lipids 3awalnuts 3afood intake 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3acholesteryl esters 3alinoleic acid 3agender differences 2aAdult 2aApolipoproteins Bxblood 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol Estersxchemistry 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLinoleic Acidxmetabolism 2aMale 2aNuts 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSex Factors 2aSingle-Blind Method 2aTriglyceridesxblood 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aImaizumi, K.1 aSato, M.1 aHirooka, Y.1 aSakai, K.1 aTakeshita, A.1 aKono, M.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2002 July, v. 56, no. 7 p.629-637x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02164naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245015500143300001600298520097700314650001201291650002201303650004401325650001101369650002201380650000701402650001701409650001601426650001901442700001801461700001901479700002001498700001601518700002001534700001901554700002001573773007101593852000901664930003301673945002501706946001101731655001201742IND4376685120221120133808.0051212e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437668512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPopov, K.I.10a13C NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric study of sucrose aqueous solutions at high pH: NMR measurement of sucrose dissociation constant  ap. 248-253.  aThe 13C NMR technique is used for the measurement of the first dissociation constant of sucrose (HL) in highly alkaline solutions. In 1.0 M NaCl/NaOH medium and for 25 degrees C, the concentration dissociation constant (pK1) was 13.1 +/- 0.3; and, for 60 degrees C, pK1 = 12.30 +/- 0.05. The beta-D-fructofuranosyl ring was found to be responsible for dissociation. The NMR data reveal no clear evidence of the second dissociation step below pH 14, either at 25 degrees C or at 60 degrees C. In the solutions with 4-10 mol dm(-3) NaOH content the 13C NMR technique indicated the chemical shift changes, treated as the second dissociation step of sucrose and a sodium complex formation. A very rough estimation, for variable ionic strength, gives the value: pK2 approximately 15.8 +/- 0.8. The anionic species L(-) and NaH(-1)L(-) have been registered by electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-ToF MS) for 0.01 M sucrose solutions with initial pH 13. 3asucrose 3aaqueous solutions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3acarbon 3amass spectrometry 3apH 3adissociation 3atemperature 3aionic strength1 aSultanova, N.1 aRonkkomaki, H.1 aHannu-Kuure, M.1 aJalonen, J.1 aLajunen, L.H.J.1 aBugaenko, I.F.1 aTuzhilkin, V.I.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 May, v. 96, no. 2 p.248-253x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060321b20060402c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01357naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005000127300001600177520044100193650002000634650002200654650002600676650001700702650002300719651001800742653001100760653001100771653006000782773014600842852000900988939003300997946001301030655001201043IND9000287520221120130512.0900118e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900028752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevins, R.A.12aA software package for teaching farm planning  ap. 157-162.  a"Finding Your Agricultural Advantage" is a collection of four programs--one to generate case studies, one to do "trial-and-error" solutions, one to display linear programming solutions, and one to maintain case study data files.

Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the five types of risk and overall risk and the relationship between types of risk and information sources used. Perceived physical risk ranked highest and perceived social risk ranked lowest for the respondents. Performance and social risk were significantly correlated with overall risk at the .05 level. However, the correlation of various types of risk with the use of specific information sources was not significant except for a negative correlation between social risk and neutral information sources. Information sources most often used by respondents were mail order catalogs and family members. Those with cogenital disability perceived higher overall risk than those with acquired disability. 3aclothing 3apeople with disabilities 3ainformation services 3arisk 0apurchasing habits1 aFeather, B.L.1 aVann, J.W.1 aDillard, B.G.0 tClothing and textiles research journal.g1988 Fall, v. 7, no. 1 p.15-22x0887-302X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04149naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193072001700210100001400227245015200241300001800393500001500411520193600426650001602362650000902378650001702387650002402404650001802428650001902446650001202465650001402477650001302491650002102504650002102525650001302546650002902559650001402588650001202602650004202614650002202656650004202678650003802720650002802758650001102786650005602797650004002853650002402893650002402917650002302941650003802964650001003002650001203012650001103024650003903035653001603074653001003090700001403100700001403114700001403128700001403142773007503156852000903231856008003240930003303320945002503353946001303378655001203391IND4382970520221120113357.0060821e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438297052DNAL7 a169034822pmid7 a10.1093/ps/85.8.14822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Raw and cooked samples from 32 treatments were tested by 8 trained sensory panelists for turkey aroma and irradiation off-aroma. Based on the sensory scores, the 3 dietary treatments producing the most and the least off-aroma were selected and used for a consumer acceptance study. Sensory results of raw meat showed that turkey aroma was intense in aerobically packaged meat, whereas irradiation off-aroma was intense with vacuum packaging. Raw meats from dietary treatments containing CLA (CLA, VE + CLA, Se + CLA, VE + Se + CLA) had greater turkey aroma scores, whereas those containing VE (VE and VE + Se) had lower scores than the control. Dietary treatments containing VE (VE, VE + Se, VE + Se + CLA) significantly lowered (P < 0.05) irradiation off-aroma in raw turkey breast meat, whereas CLA increased it, especially when the meats were packaged aerobically. In cooked meat, however, irradiation and packaging had no effect on turkey meat aroma and irradiation off-aroma. Cooked meat from turkeys supplemented with VE (VE and VE + Se) had less (P < 0.05) irradiation off-odor than other dietary treatments. Dietary CLA increased the irradiation off-aroma in cooked meat, which could not be reduced, even when VE and Se were combined in the diet. Irradiation off-aroma of raw meat was not pleasant for most consumers, and dietary supplementation of VE and VE + Se improved consumer acceptance of irradiated raw meat. For cooked meat samples, consumers preferred both color and flavor of irradiated meat to nonirradiated meat. 3aturkey meat 3adiet 3acooked foods 3aconsumer acceptance 3abreast muscle 3afeed additives 3aturkeys 3avitamin E 3aselenium 3avacuum packaging 3afood irradiation 3araw meat 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3aoff odors 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosage 2aConsumer Behavior 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aFood Irradiationxadverse effects 2aFood Packagingxmethods 2aHumans 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxadministration & dosage 2aMeatxradiation effectsxstandards. 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosage 2aTaste 2aTurkeys 2aVacuum 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosage 0acooked meat 0aodors1 aLee, E.J.1 aNam, K.C.1 aMin, B.R.1 aAhn, D.U.0 tPoultry science.g2006 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.1482-1489x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/85.8.14823Available from publisher's Web site  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdJITe2006/08/29  aOther US 7aarticle01633naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008800126300001600214520058300230650001800813650002000831650001600851650002200867650001000889650002400899650001500923650001600938650001700954650001100971651001400982653002200996653002201018700001801040773014601058852000901204939003301213946001301246655001201259IND9000277720221120113450.0900118e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900027772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaden, K.L.10aFactors which contribute to the financial performance of selected Tennessee dairies  ap. 105-112.  aThe objective of this study was to identify factors which contributed to the financial performance of 81 selected dairy farms in Tennessee.

Its ovicidal effect results from the combined action of temperature and relative humidity (RH). Wettable sulfur becomes effective at 27.5 °C and 75% RH. Beyond this threshold, the acaricidal effect increases with rising temperature or humidity, to become complete at a temperature of 35 °C and 90% RH. Within the range of temperatures and humidities 20 °C/30% RH and 35 °C/90% RH the mortality of immatures (from protonymphs to teleiochrysalis) was total. Under similar experimental conditions, females usually died before the end of the experiment. Temperature and relative humidity increased the adulticidal potential of wettable sulfur. The fecundity of the sulfur-treated females and the viability of their progeny was found to depend on temperature and RH. According to the same climatic conditions, eggs were less susceptible than females, which were in turn less susceptible than juvenile stages. 3aTetranychus urticae 3aclimatic factors 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3aimmatures 3ajuveniles 3amortality 3apest management 3aprogeny 3arelative humidity 3asulfur 3atemperature 3aviability1 aGuichou, Sabine1 aKreiter, Serge0 tPest management science.g2003 May, v. 59, no. 5 p.559-565wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6653Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140401  aNon-US 7aarticle03756naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245006300168300001600231500002400247500001500271520246900286650001802755650001902773650004302792650000902835650001702844650001102861650001402872650005202886650001202938650002502950650001702975650001402992650001903006650000803025650002103033650002203054653001703076700001603093773011603109852000903225856007603234655001203310IND4378807020221120094414.0060315s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437880702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2005.02850.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimonet, J.10aDegradation of the Poliovirus 1 genome by chlorine dioxide  ap. 862-870.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis study was undertaken to gain an understanding of the factors that influence viral RNA degradation in the presence of chlorine dioxide (ClO₂), which will be very useful in helping to define the significance of the presence of the viral genome in disinfected water. We focused our investigation on the influence of ClO₂ on extracted RNA on the one hand, and on the infectious virus on the other. Our first results show that RNA degradation, like viral inactivation, is dose dependent. The influence of the spatial organization of the targeted genomic sequence, as well as that of its size and location (and/or sequence) on degradation of the Poliovirus 1 genome by ClO₂, was studied using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results show that the preferential sites of action of ClO₂ appear to be located in the untranslated regions, 5[prime]- and 3[prime]-UTR, a phenomenon influenced by both the presence of secondary structures and the genomic sequence in these regions. Our results also reveal a rapid decrease of infectious particles quantified by the cell culture for the applied dose. Comparison between cell culture and real-time PCR for viral detection reveals disagreement following disinfection treatment, even for the largest targeted fragment (a 6989-base fragment representing the quasi-whole viral genome). The detection of genome fragments is insufficient to confirm the presence of the infectious virus, as each targeted fragment shows a different sensitivity. Hence, the smallest targeted fragment (76 bp) persisted throughout the analysis period, while the longest targeted fragment (6989 bp) disappeared very rapidly. Highly sensitive regions (i.e. 5[prime]- and 3[prime]-UTR) should be targeted to avoid an overestimation of the risk of viral infection using molecular biology methods in water following disinfection. Further studies in this area are needed. To date, it has not been possible to routinely apply virological controls to drinking water because of the time-consuming nature of the gold standard technique (cell culture) and its inability to detect all serotypes (e.g. Norovirus). Molecular techniques (e.g. real-time RT-PCR) constitute a solution to the rapid and specific detection of all the serotypes. However, ignorance of the mechanisms of viral degradation prevents the validation of PCR for the measurement of the risk of infection to humans following disinfection treatment. 3aEnterovirus C 3ahuman diseases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3acell culture 3agenome 3aserotypes 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3anucleotide sequences 3adisinfection 3aNorovirus 3adrinking water 3aRNA 3achlorine dioxide 3amolecular biology 0amicrobiology1 aGantzer, C.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2006 Apr., v. 100, no. 4 p.862-870dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2005.02850.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02754naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002400092040001800116100002200134245011600156300001600272520155000288650002501838650002201863650002401885650001101909650000901920650001701929650001001946650001401956650001101970650001901981650001402000650001302014650002002027650001202047650001002059650001602069700002802085773008002113852000902193856007402202939003302276946001102309655001202320IND4479320220221120094258.0140401e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447932022DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.6602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToews, Michael D.10aContribution of contact toxicity and wheat condition to mortality of stored-product insects exposed to spinosad  ap. 538-544.  aSpinosad, a reduced-risk commercial insecticide derived from a bacterial fermentation product, possesses both contact and oral toxicities against insects. Contact toxicity of spinosad to adults of Rhyzopertha dominica (F), Sitophilus oryzae (L), and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) was evaluated by exposure for 24 or 48 h to treated glass Petri dishes. Adults were exposed to different deposits (0.001–0.79 mg cm−2) of spinosad in 24-h tests and to deposits of 0, 0.0016 and 0.016 mg cm−2 in 48-h tests. Rhyzopertha dominica was most susceptible to spinosad in 24- and 48-h tests, followed by S oryzae, and T castaneum. The 24-h LD50 values were 0.0004, 0.077 and 0.189 mg cm−2 for R dominica, S oryzae, and T castaneum, respectively. All R dominica adults were dead following 48 h exposure to both spinosad deposits, whereas mortality of S oryzae and T castaneum ranged from 10 to 85% and 12 to 48%, respectively. Rhyzopertha dominica, T castaneum, and O surinamensis adults were exposed for 14 days to whole wheat, cracked wheat and wheat flour treated with 0, 0.1 and 1.0 mg kg−1 of spinosad. Rhyzopertha dominica adults were highly susceptible to spinosad, followed by O surinamensis and T castaneum. Immatures (eggs and larvae) of T castaneum and O surinamensis exposed for 14 days were more susceptible on spinosad-treated whole wheat than on treated cracked wheat and wheat flour. This is the first report documenting contact activity of spinosad, and the effect of grain condition on spinosad toxicity, to stored-product insects. 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aSitophilus oryzae 3aTribolium castaneum 3aadults 3aeggs 3afermentation 3aglass 3aimmatures 3alarvae 3alethal dose 50 3amortality 3aspinosad 3astorage insects 3atesting 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aSubramanyam, Bhadriraju0 tPest management science.g2003 May, v. 59, no. 5 p.538-544x1526-498X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6603Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140401  aNon-US 7aarticle02460naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011200162300001600274500002400290520149900314650001101813650001601824650001901840650002001859650001801879650001101897650001601908650000901924700002101933700001901954773009201973852000902065856004802074655001202122IND4457618520221120094443.0110506e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445761852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11119-010-9185-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fumin.12aA comparison of three methods for estimating leaf area index of paddy rice from optimal hyperspectral bands  ap. 439-447.  aIncludes references  aThis paper follows previous research that identified 15 hyperspectral wavebands that were suitable to estimate paddy rice leaf area index (LAI). The objectives of the study were to: (1) test the efficiency of the wavebands selected in the previous study, (2) to evaluate the potential of least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) to estimate paddy rice LAI from canopy hyperspectral reflectance and (3) to compare multiple linear regression-MLR, partial least squares-PLS regression and LS-SVM to determine paddy rice LAI using the selected wavebands. In the study, measurements of hyperspectral reflectance (350-2500 nm) and corresponding LAI were made for a paddy rice canopy throughout the growing seasons. On the basis of the wavebands selected previously, models based on MLR, PLS and LS-SVM to estimate rice LAI were compared using the data from 123 observations, which were split randomly for model calibration (2/3) and validation (1/3). Root mean square errors (RMSEs) and the correlation coefficients (r) between measured and predicted LAI values from model calibration and validation were calculated to evaluate the quality of the models. The results showed that the LS-SVM model using the 15 selected wavebands produced more accurate estimates of paddy rice LAI than the PLS and MLR models. We concluded that the LS-SVM approach may provide a useful exploratory and predictive tool for estimating paddy rice LAI when applied to reflectance data using the 15 selected wavebands. 3acanopy 3acorrelation 3agrowing season 3aleaf area index 3aleast squares 3amodels 3areflectance 3arice1 aHuang, Jing-feng1 aLou, Zhang-hua0 tPrecision agriculture.g2011 June, v. 12, no. 3 p.439-447dSpringer USx1385-22567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11119-010-9185-2 7aarticle02497naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100002100178245015800199300001300357500001500370520102900385650001301414650002501427650001401452650001801466650001801484650002101502650001501523650001601538650002101554650004301575650001701618650002501635650000901660650002601669650002001695650001101715653002501726700001801751700001801769700001901787700001401806773006901820852000901889930003301898945002501931946001101956655001201967IND4377518120221120073037.0060131e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437751812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Distinguishable identification of lard contamination in some vegetable oils has been attempted in this study. Vegetable oils, namely palm oil (PO), palm kernel oil (PKO), and canola oil (CLO), were spiked with different proportions of animal fats, such as lard (GLD), beef tallow (BT), and chicken fat (CF). High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analyses were performed to monitor the triacylglycerol (TAG) compositional changes in the oil samples before and after adulteration. The results showed that qualitative determination of lard contamination in PKO was possible by a visual comparison of TAG profiles of PKO adulterated with different animal fats with those of the animal fats. This approach was not useful for PO and CLO. However, by subjecting liquid chromatographic data to multivariate procedures, distinguishable grouping of lard-contaminated samples was achieved for all three oils. 3achickens 3aproduct authenticity 3apalm oils 3afood analysis 3avegetable oil 3apoultry products 3acanola oil 3abeef cattle 3atriacylglycerols 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3afood quality 3aadulterated products 3alard 3amultivariate analysis 3apalm kernel oil 3atallow 0aanimal fats and oils1 aGhazali, H.M.1 aChe Man, Y.B.1 aPeiris, T.S.G.1 aLai, O.M.0 tFood chemistry.g2005 June, v. 91, no. 1 p.5-14x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01886naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245005700161300001400218500002400232500001500256520066300271650001700934650000900951650001800960650001900978650002000997650002501017650001901042650001601061651001301077653002501090700001801115773013501133852000901268856008501277856005701362930003301419945001301452946001101465655001201476IND2322145420221120062851.0010723s2000    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232214542DNAL7 a10.1108/000707000103106322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllaway, A.10aShopping for food in socially contrasting localities  ap. 52-59.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStudies the food shopping practices and priorities among residents (in their mid-40s and mid-60s) of four socially contrasting neighbourhoods in Glasgow, Scotland.

Translocation of radioactivity in the different plant parts varied among biotypes. Translocation in the whole plant after treatment with the three 14C-chemicals varied among biotypes but was not correlated with their tolerance to herbicides. Detailed analysis of distribution of radioactivity in the primary rhizome showed that more 14C was found in the apical sections after treatment with 14C-sucrose. A similar pattern was observed after 14C-glyphosate application with all biotypes except one. Very low radioactivity was found in rhizomes after 14C-quizalofop application, but a preferential accumulation in apical sections of the primary rhizome was detected in two biotypes. The tolerance of one biotype to glyphosate was explained by the absence of radioactivity accumulation in the apical sections of the rhizome. 3aElymus repens subsp. repens 3abiotypes 3aherbicide resistance 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3aglyphosate 3aquizalofop 3arhizomes 3asucrose 3astable isotopes 3aspatial distribution 3aperennial weeds 3aweed control 3achemical control 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 0asystemic action 0auptake1 aLeroux, G.D.0 tWeed science.g1993 , v. 41, no. 3 p.341-346x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02844naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245019300176300001400369520146300383650001601846650002201862650001301884650000901897650002101906650001601927650001101943650001401954650001301968650001401981650001201995650002102007650001302028653001902041653002002060653001602080653002302096700002302119773012702142852000902269856007602278930003302354946001102387655001202398IND4387871520221120035018.0070213e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438787152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00197.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFUKUNAGA, Yasuyoshi10aToxicity of the aphid Aulacorthum magnoliae to the predator Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and genetic variance in the assimilation of the toxic aphids in H. axyridis larvae  ap. 45-53.  aLarvae of the ladybird Harmonia axyridis are reported to suffer high mortality when they are fed with the aphid Aulacorthum magnoliae associated with the elder Sambucus sieboldiana. In the present study we first examined whether aphid toxicity to H. axyridis was altered when the aphids were reared on different host plants, and second whether some ladybird families could adapt specially to the toxic aphids. Ladybird larvae from each egg batch were divided into two groups; one group was fed with A. magnoliae reared on potato, and the other group was fed with A. magnoliae reared on elder. The ladybird larvae fed with elder aphids suffered significantly higher mortality and grew more slowly than did larvae fed with potato aphids. This result indicates that A. magnoliae aphids absorbed toxic substances or their precursors from S. sieboldiana. We suggest that host association of A. magnoliae with the primary host plant S. sieboldiana has been maintained because of the advantage of deterring predation. Significant and positive correlation was detected across H. axyridis sib families between the mean weight of larvae fed with elder aphids and the mean weight of larvae fed with potato aphids. The hypothesis that some ladybird families adapt specially to the toxic aphids was not supported. However, the available evidence showed that a large amount of genetic variance in performance is maintained in a wild population of the ladybird H. axyridis. 3aAulacorthum 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aSambucus 3aeggs 3agenetic variance 3ahost plants 3alarvae 3amortality 3apotatoes 3apredation 3arearing 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aallelochemical 0aindirect effect 0ainteraction 0asecondary compound1 aAKIMOTO, Shin-ichi0 tEntomological science.g2007 Mar., v. 10, no. 1 p.45-53dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1343-87867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00197.x3electronic resource  a20070213b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle00865naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245003900130300001400169520026400183650002600447650002000473773006700493852000900560939003300569945000800602946001300610655001200623991559939680742620221120035108.0911118e199109  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910035022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeters, L.10aVegetarian travelers vs. fast food  ap. 73-77.  aEating in fast food restaurants can be a problem for vegetarians.

The mycophagous drosophilids, their fungal food resources and parasitoids were studied by carrying out an intensive census throughout the activity seasons of 4 years (2000-2003) in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Five hymenopterous parasitoid species, four braconids and one eucoilid, were found. Parasitoids of mycophagous drosophilids are reported for the first time from Asia. Most parasitism (99.2%) was by braconids, in contrast to the dominance of eucoilids in Europe. Parasitism was restricted to the summer, and the rate was high from early July to early August every year. There was considerable yearly variation in the composition of abundant fungus, drosophilid and parasitoid species, especially between 2000 and 2001. The alternation of dominant host species was coupled with the alternation of dominant parasitoid species that differed in host use. Despite the yearly variation in the system, the most dominant host species suffered disproportionately heavy parasitism by the correspondingly dominant parasitoid species every year. The parasitism rate was positively correlated with the relative host abundance. This thus indicates that the disproportionate parasitism mechanism may operate, via which species coexistence is promoted by a higher rate of parasitism of the dominant species. 3aBraconidae 3aDrosophilidae 3acorrelation 3afungi 3afungivores 3ahosts 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3asummer 3aEurope 3aJapan 0acoexistence 0along-term census0 tEntomological science.g2006 Mar., v. 9, no. 1 p.13-22dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1343-87867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00149.x3electronic resource  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02145naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010100127300001400228500001500242520106400257650001801321650001901339650002401358650001301382650001201395650001801407650001101425650002701436650001801463650001001481650001101491653002201502653002501524700002101549700002001570773007901590852000901669930003301678945001301711946001101724655001201735IND2206407020221117174722.0000814e200001  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220640702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranklin, G.10aFactors affecting regeneration of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.

Shoots were produced from the apical region of embryonal axes after 20 days of dark incubation on modified Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium containing 8.86 micromolars benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 1.07 micromolar alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). When the explants were cultured under light-dark (16-8 hrs) conditions, shoots were initiated only after 65 days of culture initiation. The explants lost their ability to regenerate plantlets when they were cultured in continuous light. Regenerated shoots elongated either in the same medium or in MS basal medium. About 40% of the elongated shoots sequentially produced simple, bifoliate and finally trifoliate leaves instead of producing trifoliate leaves directly. The elongated shoots were rooted efficiently upon transferring them to half strength MS medium supplemented with 2.41 micromolars indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). Rooted plantlets were successfully transferred to soil after hardening. 3aCajanus cajan 3aembryo (plant) 3aindole butyric acid 3aexplants 3arooting 3abenzyladenine 3aleaves 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aculture media 3alight 3ashoots 0aplant development 0aregenerative ability1 aJeyachandran, R.1 aIgnacimuthu, S.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2000 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.31-36x0167-69037nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02636naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245007400161300001600235500010000251500002400351500001500375520123000390650001801620650001701638650002401655650002701679650001201706650001701718650001101735650001001746650002301756651001101779653002201790653001401812653001901826773013701845852000901982856008501991856005702076930003302133945001302166946001102179655001202190IND2322145920221117174705.0010723s2000    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232214592DNAL7 a10.1108/000707000103322782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlitsch, K.10aConsumer perceptions of fresh meat quality: cross-national comparison  ap. 177-194.  aIn the special issue: Consumer behavior and quality policy / edited by T.

Quality evaluation of fresh meat in this study is supposed to consist of two phases: a stage previous to the actual purchase and a stage after the purchase while eating the meat. Concerning the first stage, it becomes obvious that for beef and pork the place of purchase plays a major role as quality indicator, while the price was distinctly considered to be at least helpful. "Colour" is the most important intrinsic quality cue for all three meats. In the second phase of quality evaluation after purchase, "flavour" is one of the most significant quality characteristics. Concerning the safety of beef, pork and chicken, "freshness" was shown to be the most important indicator. Consequently, it would be advisable for producers and retailers to use appropriate signals in order to communicate "freshness" to the consumers. Concerns about meat are rated very highly in each of the countries. Trustworthy signals of meat safety are required, which are able to reduce the risk felt by consumers. 3ameat products 3asupermarkets 3anutrition education 3ageographical variation 3asurveys 3afood quality 3aflavor 3acolor 3aconsumer attitudes 3aEurope 0aconsumer behavior 0aconsumers 0afresh products0 tBritish food journal.g2000, v. 102, no. 3 p.177-194dBritish Food JournalaBritish food journal (Croydon, England)x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707000103322783Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.emerald-library.com/3electronic resource  a20050224b20050301c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01227naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006100125300001800186520035100204650002200555650002300577650001400600650001400614650001000628650002300638650001600661650001100677653001500688700001700703700001700720773007200737852000900809930003300818945001300851946001300864655001200877IND2041838920221117174650.0940907e199012  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204183892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMersie, W.10aEvaluation of bean introductions for ozone insensitivity  ap. 1581-1582.  aPlant introductions of Phaseolus vulgaris L. were grown from seed in a growth chamber and exposed to O3 at 0.6 microliter/liter for 2 hours.

Phages in the processing plant environment may play critical roles in determining the Listeria population that becomes established in the plant. In this study, we pursued the isolation of Listeria-specific phages from environmental samples from four turkey processing plants in the United States. These environmental samples were also utilized to isolate Listeria spp. Twelve phages were isolated and classified into three groups in terms of their host range. Of these, nine (group 1) showed a wide host range, including multiple serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes, as well as other Listeria spp. (L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. seeligeri, and L. ivanovii). The remaining phages mostly infected L. monocytogenes serotype 4b as well as L. innocua, L. ivanovii, and/or L. welshimeri. All but one of the strains of the serotype 4b complex (4b, 4d, 4e) from the processing plant environment could be readily infected by the wide-host-range phages isolated from the environment of the processing plants. However, many strains of other serotypes (1/2a [or 3a] and 1/2b [or 3b]), which represented the majority of L. monocytogenes strains isolated from the environmental samples, were resistant to infection by these phages. Experiments with two phage-resistant strains showed reduced phage adsorption onto the host cells. These findings suggest that phage resistance may be an important component of the ecology of L. monocytogenes in the turkey processing plants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aadsorption 3abacteriophages 3ahost range 3ahosts 3ameat processing plants 3aserotypes 3aUnited States1 aSiletzky, Robin M.1 aKathariou, Sophia0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Nov. 1, v. 74, no. 21 p.6623-6630dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01282-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02206naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245013600170300001600306500001500322520090700337650001401244650001901258650001001277650001001287650001101297650001301308650001001321650000901331650001201340651001301352653001401365653001901379653001801398653001801416653002201434700002701456700002001483773012801503852000901631856007601640930003301716946001101749655001201760IND4381132220221117161108.0060619e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438113222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00165.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKUROSU, Utako10aAstegopteryx spinocephala (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a new aphid species producing sterile soldiers that guard eggs laid in their gall  ap. 181-190.  a2019-12-05  aAstegopteryx spinocephala sp. nov., a soldier-producing aphid species forming banana-bunch shaped galls on Styrax benzoides in northern Thailand, is described. We found that galls of the species are formed in approximately June and last for almost 1 year, and that the aphid completes its life cycle without migrating to secondary hosts. Many alate sexuparae appeared in March/April, when many sexuals (arostrate males and rostrate females) and eggs were found in live subgalls guarded by soldiers that plugged the ostiole with their sclerotized, spiny heads. Two healthy galls sampled in April contained 2799 and 2659 eggs, respectively. Many live galls were still found in May, and some at the beginning of June. These galls contained both active soldiers and eggs, some of which had already hatched. This indicates that soldiers of A. spinocephala guard eggs until they hatch in at least some galls. 3aAphididae 3asclerotization 3ahosts 3amales 3aStyrax 3ahatching 3agalls 3aeggs 3afemales 3aThailand 0aHemiptera 0aArostrate male 0aCerataphidini 0aHormaphidinae 0aStyrax benzoides 1 aBURANAPANICHPAN, Sawai1 aAOKI, Shigeyuki0 tEntomological science.g2006 June, v. 9, no. 2 p.181-190dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1343-87867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00165.x3electronic resource  a20060619b20060702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03983naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100001300195245019900208300001600407500001500423520207800438650002702516650001502543650001702558650002302575650002102598650001902619650001202638650001802650650002602668650001302694650001702707650001702724650001602741650002002757650002402777650001402801650001802815650001602833650002302849650002302872650001202895650002002907650002402927651001202951653001002963653001502973653003302988653003103021653002003052653002403072653002003096700001603116700001503132773007203147852000903219930003303228945002503261946001103286655001203297IND4379225720221123024030.0060331e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437922572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Concentrations of heavy metals in edible muscle, liver and gill tissues were determined while the oxidative rancidities in unsalted and salted smoke-dried fish cakes, packed in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags and stored at 30 +/- 1 degrees C were assessed using peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value, free fatty acid (FFA) contents and sensory evaluation techniques. Generally the analytical data for Cu, Zn and Pb in the muscle, gills and liver of test samples were significantly low. Similarly, insignificant concentrations (<0.001 mg/100 g) of Hg, As, Cr and Cd were obtained in the fish tissues. The protein and lipid contents of the fish cakes ranged from 60.8-63.9% to 7.3-9.1%, respectively. Salting caused minimal reductions in the nutrient contents of the dried fish cakes. The POV, TBA, FFA and taste panel scores were highest during the first week of storage and declined thereafter. Salted smoke-dried samples had higher POV, TBA and FFA values than unsalted samples. Panel preference ratings for flavour/aroma and desirability characteristics of the fish cakes were in the order: C. nigrodigitatus > O. nilotichus > E. fimbriata > I. africana > P. keolreuteri. Palmitic acid (C16:0) was the predominant saturated fatty acid in the test samples. The eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) contents of unsalted smoke-dried C. nigrodigitatus was 4.9%, Oreochromis niloticus 6.5%, Ilisha africana 2.6%, E. fimbriata 5.6% and P. koelreuteri 7.64%. The docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contents of salted smoked dried fish were 1.8% (C. nigrodigitatus), 4.8% (O. niloticus), 9.5% (I. africana), 5.5% (E. fimbriata) and 12.3% (P. koelreuteri). 3afatty acid composition 3adried fish 3aheavy metals 3alipid peroxidation 3afree fatty acids 3afood packaging 3asalting 3afood analysis 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aseafoods 3afood storage 3afood quality 3asmoked fish 3astorage quality 3aoxidative stability 3arancidity 3alipid content 3asalted fish 3afood contamination 3asensory properties 3acatfish 3aprotein content 3aTilapia (Cichlidae) 3aNigeria 0abonga 0amudskipper 0aChsysichthyes nigrodigitatus 0aPeriophthalmus koelreuteri 0aIlisha africana 0aEthmalosa fimbriata 0afood processing1 aMepba, H.D.1 aEkpo, M.B.0 tFood chemistry.g2006 Aug., v. 97, no. 3 p.490-497x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02309naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010800126300001400234500001500248520101300263650001501276650001601291650002501307650002201332650001901354650001201373650002501385650004201410650001401452650002001466650001601486650001801502653003501520653001501555653001501570653002001585653001701605653001101622700001601633700001501649700001801664773007901682852000901761930003301770945001301803946001101816655001201827IND2206409520221123024055.0000814e200001  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220640952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiquery, L.10aSenescence of leaf sheaths of ryegrass stubble: changes in enzyme activities related to H2O2 metabolism  ap. 71-77.  a2019-12-05  aChanges in the levels of reactive oxygen species (O2(.)-, H2O2), and of activities of enzymes involved in their detoxification were investigated during senescence of leaf sheaths of ryegrass stubble. The accumulation of H2O2 in the medium leaf sheaths coincided with a drop in the levels of total glutathione, of pyridine nucleotides and of activities of monodehydroascorbate reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase. Conversely, a paradoxical increase in the ascorbate/ascorbate plus dehydroascorbate ratio was observed, which appears to be inconsistent with H2O2 accumulation. Our results suggest that oxalate might be an essential source of H2O2 in senescent leaf sheaths, and that oxalate oxidase might be involved in the defence of foliar tissue against pathogens during the progress of senescence. Moreover, it is assumed that glucid catabolism of the ryegrass stubble might be a starting point of a metabolic drain leading to ascorbate, then to oxalate during the late phase of leaf sheath senescence. 3ametabolism 3aglutathione 3adehydroascorbic acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aLolium perenne 3astubble 3apyridine nucleotides 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3aoxidation 3aenzyme activity 3aoxalic acid 3aascorbic acid 0amonodehydroascorbate reductase 0asenescence 0ainhibitors 0aoxidoreductases 0aleaf sheaths 0aratios1 aDavoine, C.1 aHuault, C.1 aBillard, J.P.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2000 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.71-77x0167-69037nnas  aDNAL  a20001102b20001113c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02188naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245010400143300001400247500018400261500001500445520096500460650001701425650001101442650002801453650002301481650002101504650001701525650002101542650001901563653001801582653002301600653001401623773008701637852000901724930003301733945002501766946001101791655001201802IND4374256520221123005835.0050913e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437425652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

S4-S9.  aPaper presented at the Fourth International Heelsum Workshop Empowering Family Doctors and Patients in Nutrition Communication held December 13-15, 2004, Heelsum, The Netherlands.  a2019-12-05  aA proposal by Wald and Law (2003) for a single pill containing a statin, three half-dose antihypertensives, aspirin, and folic acid, met with a storm of controversy and seemed to have been relegated as much to the fanciful as to the accolades it might have deserved. The benefits such a Polypill could confer on people age 55 + y were to reduce both cardiovascular and stroke events by 80% or more. Considering the daunting and, at best, slow process of changing the same risk factors through health promotion interventions on food policy, dietary and physical activity behaviors, and urban planning to make less prevalent the sedentary lifestyles developed over decades, the argument here is to view the Polypill as a harm reduction strategy that would complement health promotion, as Nicotine Replacement Therapy did for tobacco control, seat belts did for traffic injuries, and needle exchange programs did for secondary complications of injection drug use. 3adrug therapy 3ahumans 3acardiovascular diseases 3adisease prevention 3ahealth promotion 3arisk factors 3achronic diseases 3arisk reduction 0apublic health 0aliterature reviews 0aPolypills0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g2005 Aug., v. 59 p.S4-S9x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a20060119b20060202c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/21  aNon-US 7aarticle04195naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100001900192245023600211300001800447500002400465506007600489520111800565506003701683650002501720650002301745650001801768650001701786650002201803650001201825650001701837650002001854650001301874650002101887650003701908650001201945650000901957650002701966650001601993650005102009650001202060650001702072650005502089650006002144650004302204650001902247650002002266650005002286650001102336650004702347650005202394650002802446650005702474650006102531650006902592650000902661650002402670650002302694650002602717650004602743650002302789650004602812650005502858650004102913650004202954700001902996700002103015700001603036700002003052700002103072700002403093700001903117773011703136852000903253856009103262655001203353IND4379059720221207095814.0060326s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437905972DNAL7 a165520582pmid7 aPMC14189332pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.74.4.2277-2285.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTartz, Susanne10aImmunization with a Circumsporozoite Epitope Fused to Bordetella pertussis Adenylate Cyclase in Conjunction with Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4 Blockade Confers Protection against Plasmodium berghei Liver-Stage Malaria  ap. 2277-2285.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe adenylate cyclase toxoid (ACT) of Bordetella pertussis is capable of delivering its N-terminal catalytic domain into the cytosol of CD11b-expressing professional antigen-presenting cells such as myeloid dendritic cells. This allows delivery of CD8⁺ T-cell epitopes to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation pathway. Recombinant detoxified ACT containing an epitope of the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (CSP), indeed, induced a specific CD8⁺ T-cell response in immunized mice after a single application, as detected by MHC multimer staining and gamma interferon (IFN-[gamma]) ELISPOT assay. This CSP-specific response could be significantly enhanced by prime-boost immunization with recombinant ACT in combination with anti-CTLA-4 during the boost immunization. This increased response was accompanied by complete protection in a number of mice after a challenge with P. berghei sporozoites. Transient blockade of CTLA-4 may overcome negative regulation and hence provide a strategy to enhance the efficacy of a vaccine by amplifying the number of responding T cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBordetella pertussis 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aT-lymphocytes 3aactive sites 3aadenylate cyclase 3acytosol 3acytotoxicity 3adendritic cells 3aepitopes 3ainterferon-gamma 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amalaria 3amice 3asecondary immunization 3asporozoites 2aAdenylate Cyclase Toxinxgeneticsximmunology. 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, CD 2aAntigens, Differentiationximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aBordetella pertussisxenzymologyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCD8-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCTLA-4 Antigen 2aCells, Cultured 2aEpitopes, T-Lymphocytexgeneticsximmunology. 2aFemale 2aForkhead Transcription Factorsxmetabolism 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class Iximmunology 2aImmunization, Secondary 2aLiver Diseases, Parasiticximmunologyxparasitology. 2aMalariaximmunologyxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aMalaria Vaccinesxadministration & dosagexgeneticsximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aOvalbuminximmunology 2aPlasmodium bergheixgeneticsximmunology. 2aProtozoan Proteins 2aProtozoan Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aT-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxicximmunology 2aT-Lymphocytes, Regulatoryxmetabolism1 aKamanova, Jana1 aSimsova, Marcela1 aSebo, Peter1 aBolte, Stefanie1 aHeussler, Volker1 aFleischer, Bernhard1 aJacobs, Thomas0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.2277-2285dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.74.4.2277-2285.20063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02914naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007900125300001400204500001500218520177100233650001302004650002202017650002202039650001802061650001802079650001302097650002002110650001502130650001802145653001102163653001602174653002802190653002202218700001602240700001602256700001402272700002102286700001502307773008002322852000902402930003302411945001302444946001102457655001202468IND2268227220221118214533.0010406e200009  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226822722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, M.S.10aResponses of strawberry fruit to 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and ethylene  ap. 83-90.  a2019-12-05  a1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a competitive inhibitor of ethylene action, binds to the ethylene receptor to regulate tissue responses to ethylene. In this work, we investigated the effects of 1-MCP and exogenous ethylene on ripening, respiration rate, ionic conductivity and peroxidase activity in strawberry fruit. Strawberry fruit can ripen without exogenous ethylene treatment, but exogenous ethylene induces secondary ripening processes. Results indicated that stimulation of respiration by ethylene was dose-dependent. Fruit colour development and softening were slightly accelerated by ethylene, but changes in soluble solid content were not. 1-MCP may/may not affect the respiratory rise induced by exogenous ethylene dependent on fruit maturity. Cycloheximide (CHI) reduced the ethylene-induced respiratory increase. Combinations of 1-MCP and CHI reduced respiration more than CHI alone. 1-MCP and CHI did not influence the primary respiratory change in non ethylene-treated fruit. This indicates that ethylene induced respiratory increase may involve an ethylene receptor in early harvested fruit, but not in later harvested fruit. Exogenous ethylene stimulated respiration by regulating new respiratory enzyme(s) synthesis in strawberry fruit. Ethylene induced an ionic leakage increase, and this was positively correlated to fruit water loss and peroxidase activity. These results suggest that non-climacteric fruit, such as strawberry, may have different ethylene receptor(s) and/or ethylene receptor(s) may have different regulatory functions. It may be the secondary effect of ethylene to stimulate respiration in strawberry. Non-climacteric fruit ripening may be related to the development of active oxygen species (AOS) induced by postharvest stress. 3aethylene 3aprotein synthesis 3aFragaria ananassa 3aion transport 3abinding sites 3aripening 3aenzyme activity 3aperoxidase 3acycloheximide 0afruits 0arespiration 0aplant growth substances 0amaturation period1 aPrakash, S.1 aElgar, H.J.1 aYoung, H.1 aBurmeister, D.M.1 aRoss, G.S.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2000 Sept., v. 32, no. 1 p.83-90x0167-69037nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02206naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007900127300001600206500002400222500001500246520108500261650001001346650001901356650001801375650001801393650002401411650002301435650001501458650002201473651001901495653002701514700001601541773014001557852000901697856005701706930003301763945001301796946001101809655001201820IND2322149020221122233845.0010723s2000    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232214902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, S.H.10aGenetically modified food issues: attitudes of Irish university scientists  ap. 669-691.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGenetically modified (GM) food is currently being intensely debated in Ireland and throughout Europe. Academic scientists are important players in both the public discourse and in the public policy formulation process. This paper reveals and explores the perceptions and attitudes of Irish university based academic scientists to issues regarding GM food. Most notably, 79.1 per cent of respondents stated that there should be no immediate complete ban of all GM foods and their production. The majority of respondents (70.1 per cent) believed it unlikely that within the next 20 years a substantial reduction in world hunger would occur, due to developments within modern biotechnology. Important opinions and standpoints of Irish academic scientists, which the public, industry and policy makers often look to for informed opinion on matters of a scientific content, are discussed. Results also show that the Irish Science community representatives pro-GM food stance at the National Public Consultation process was justified as it reflected the majority view among respondents. 3afoods 3apublic opinion 3abiotechnology 3afood security 3agenetic engineering 3aconsumer attitudes 3ascientists 3aissues and policy 3aIrish Republic 0aattitudes and opinions1 aAdley, C.C.0 tBritish food journal.g2000, v. 102, no. 9/10 p.669-691dBritish Food JournalaBritish food journal (Croydon, England)x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.emerald-library.com/3electronic resource  a20050224b20050301c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02449naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245015800160300001600318500001500334520117300349650001401522650002801536650002301564650002001587650001801607650001401625650001401639653002801653653002801681653002801709700001801737700001301755700001901768700001601787773007301803852000901876856008501885930003301970945001302003946001102016655001202027IND2198895720221122234011.0990524e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219889572DNAL7 a10.1080/030794598084193812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuiken, T.10aExcretion of pathogenic Newcastle disease virus by double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in absence of mortality of clinical signs of disease  ap. 541-546.  a2019-12-04  aPathogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) caused several epidemics of Newcastle disease in double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in recent years. Eleven 16-week-old cormorants were infected with, or exposed to, pathogenic NDV from one of these epidemics and monitored for 70 days. No birds died, four birds had transient ataxia between 12 and 27 days post-infection (d.p.i.), and one bird had neuronal necrosis and non-suppurative encephalitis characteristic for Newcastle disease. The mean haemagglutination inhibiting antibody titre to NDV peaked at 1:630, 21 d.p.i., and decreased to 1:56 70 d.p.i. Duration of NDV excretion from the cloaca was 15 +/- 6.2 d.p.i., with a maximum of 28 d.p.i. The absence of mortality in these birds may have been due to age-related resistance. The excretion of NDV by cormorants in the absence of mortality or clinical signs of disease suggests that the cormorant population could maintain pathogenic NDV through serial infection of susceptible birds. The greatest risk of NDV transmission from cormorants to poultry probably is during autumn migration, through contact with infected birds, excreta or contaminated water. 3amorbidity 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3adisease resistance 3aimmune response 3aPhalacrocorax 3amortality 3aexcretion 0aexperimental infections 0aasymptomatic infections 0aNewcastle disease virus1 aHeckert, R.A.1 aRiva, J.1 aLeighton, F.A.1 aWobeser, G.0 tAvian pathology.g1998 Dec., v. 27, no. 6 p.541-546x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794598084193813Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02144naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010500161300001600266520105800282650002101340650001201361650002101373650001301394650002001407650001601427650001001443650002101453653001201474700001601486700001801502700001401520773007301534852000901607856008501616930003301701945001301734946001101747655001201758IND2198896120221122223938.0990524e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219889612DNAL7 a10.1080/030794598084193852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerzich, M.10aEffect of Poultry Litter Treatment (PLT) on the development of respiratory tract lesions in broilers  ap. 566-569.  aIn previous studies, Poultry Litter Treatment (PLT) was shown to reduce atmospheric ammonia levels and ascites death rates, and produce higher profit value in broiler chickens. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of PLT on atmospheric ammonia levels, the development of respiratory tract lesions, and body weight gains in broiler chickens. Data were collected from chicks that were raised in containment conditions that resembled commercial settings. Atmospheric ammonia levels, gross thoracic air sac lesion scores, and the numbers and magnitudes of histopathologic tracheal mucosal injuries were significantly (P = 0.001) reduced in chickens that were raised on PLT-treated litter than in their untreated-litter control counterparts. In addition, mean body weights and lung:body weight ratios were significantly (P < 0.03) larger in broilers that were raised on treated litter. The reductions in respiratory tract lesions among broilers raised on PLT-treated litter were attributed to reductions in atmospheric ammonia levels. 3abroiler chickens 3aammonia 3aveterinary drugs 3aair sacs 3aliveweight gain 3abody weight 3alungs 3alitter (bedding) 0alesions1 aQuarles, C.1 aGoodwin, M.A.1 aBrown, J.0 tAvian pathology.g1998 Dec., v. 27, no. 6 p.566-569x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794598084193853Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02636naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001500198245013900213300001600352500001500368520093300383650002401316650001201340650003301352650002701385650002301412650002301435650002201458650002601480650002101506650002401527650003301551650003301584650003301617650002401650651001001674653003401684700001201718700001501730700001501745773007601760852000901836856010701845856008501952930003302037945002502070946001102095655001202106IND4420388220221122224101.0090512e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442038822DNAL7 a196809062pmid7 a10.1080/026520308023506722doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Pesticides were extracted using acetonitrile into an oil fraction containing little of the peanut matrix. After changing the solvent to the mobile phase (1 : 1 cyclohexane : ethyl acetate), clean-up was carried out using GPC, the final collected solution being automatically concentrated to a fixed volume and transferred into vials for gas chromatography (GC) injection. The pesticides were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Average recoveries (spiked levels of 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1 μg g-1) were between 70 and 117%. The relative standard deviation of the method was 3.5-21% (n = 6). This approach gave comparable results with a previously published method. 3aautomatic detection 3apeanuts 3acapillary gas chromatography 3amaximum residue limits 3apesticide residues 3agel chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amultiresidue analysis 3aArachis hypogaea 2aArachisxchemistry. 2aChromatography, Gelxmethods 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aReference Standards 0aChina 0agel permeation chromatography1 aCai, F.1 aWang, Y.L.1 aWang, X.L.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 Mar., v. 26, no. 3 p.333-3397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520308023506723Available from publisher's Web site  a20090602b20090703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/06/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01915naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245017700162300001600339500001500355520060900370650001300979650001700992650003001009650001701039650002101056650002701077650001901104650001901123650002001142653002801162653002701190700001701217700001801234700001701252773007301269852000901342856008501351930003301436945001301469946001101482655001201493IND2198896420221122204122.0990524e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219889642DNAL7 a10.1080/030794598084193882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarrow, P.A.10aEffect of enrofloxacin administration on excretion of Salmonella enteritidis by experimentally infected chickens and on quinolone resistance of their Escherichia coli flora  ap. 586-590.  a2019-12-04  aChickens which had been experimentally-infected with a strain of Salmonella enteritidis and treated by administration of enrofloxacin at commercially recommended concentrations in the drinking water, virtually eliminated this organism from the alimentary tract.

The salt-tolerant and the salt-sensitive cell lines differed in the time at which, and the type of sugar, that increased during salt stress. However, recovery in sugar content parameters during relief from stress were similar in the two cell lines.

Seedlings have relatively low vigor, compound leaves, and leaflets with deeply serrated margins with higher length : width ratios than normal seedings. Some leaves are both pinnate and palmately compound and some leaflets are lobed. The segregation ratio of lace-leafed seedlings for one gene controlling a polymorphic genetic marker supports the hypothesis that lace-leafed seedlings result from selfing of 'Riverside'. Nine percent (three of 33) of seedlings derived from selfing of 'Riverside' exhibited the lace-leafed morphology, suggesting a recessive trait controlled by one or two genes.

Innate immune cells recognize B. burgdorferi by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that use the intracellular molecule MyD88 to mediate effector functions. To determine whether impaired TLR signaling enhances Ixodes scapularis acquisition of B. burgdorferi, we fed nymphs on wild-type (WT) and MyD88[superscript -/-] mice previously infected with two clinical isolates of B. burgdorferi, BL206, a high-virulence strain, and B348, an attenuated strain. Seventy-three percent of the nymphs that fed on BL206-infected WT mice and 40% of the nymphs that fed on B348-infected WT mice acquired B. burgdorferi, whereas 100% of the nymphs that fed on MyD88[superscript -/-] mice became infected, irrespective of B. burgdorferi strain. Ticks that acquired infection after feeding on MyD88[superscript -/-] mice harbored more spirochetes than those that fed on WT mice, as assessed by quantitative PCR for B. burgdorferi DNA. Vector transmission of BL206 and B348 was also enhanced when MyD88[superscript -/-] mice were the blood meal hosts, with the mean pathogen burden at the skin inoculation site significantly higher than levels in WT mice. These results show that the absence of MyD88 facilitates passage of both low- and high-infectivity B. burgdorferi strains between the tick vector and the mammal and enhances the infectivity of a low-infectivity B. burgdorferi strain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aDNA 3aIxodes scapularis 3ahosts 3aimmunity 3amice 3anymphs 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3aticks 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingxdeficiencyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aArachnid Vectorsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aBacteremiaxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitology. 2aBorrelia burgdorferiximmunology 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aIxodesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aLyme Diseasexgeneticsxparasitologyxtransmission. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMyeloid Differentiation Factor 88 2aTick Infestationsximmunologyxmicrobiology.1 aLiu, Nengyin1 aSchwartz, Ira1 aFish, Durland0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.2154-2160dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.74.4.2154-2160.20063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01989naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245007700128300001800205500001500223520096600238650002701204650001801231650001401249650001401263650003001277650001601307650001301323650001201336650001801348650002001366653003301386653003001419700001401449773007201463852000901535930003301544945001301577946001301590655001201603IND2039309720221122110124.0940506e199110  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203930972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuehnle, A.R.10aInduction of tumors in Anthurium andraeanum by Agrobacterium tumefaciens  ap. 1325-1328.  a2019-12-05  aA method was devised for infecting Anthurium andraeanum Linden ex Andre, an economically important ornamental monocot, with Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

DNA amplification and hybridization studies showed that the DNA from these tumors, but not from noninoculated anthurium tissue, contained sequences homologous to the nopaline synthase gene of A. tumefaciens T-DNA. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aneoplasms 3aAnthurium 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3amutagenesis 3aexplants 3astrains 3aculture media 3acarcinogenicity 0aornamental herbaceous plants 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aSugii, N.0 tHortScience.g1991 Oct., v. 26, no. 10 p.1325-1328x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle01198naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245002900131300001400160300002800174520045000202650003200652650001200684650001700696653001100713653001600724700001500740773007800755852000900833939003300842945000800875946001300883655001200896991559926730742620221122075724.0870928e198509  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870019442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHackman, R.14aThe art of brown bagging  ap. 31-34.  ap. 31-34. ill., charts.  aPacking lunches, once meant for only school children and blue collar workers, is now being done by over 55% of adult Americans, many with above-average incomes.

E. coli K1 is the leading gram-negative organism causing neonatal meningitis, but the microbial basis of E. coli K1 meningitis is incompletely understood. Here we employed comparative genomic hybridization to investigate 11 strains of E. coli K1 isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with meningitis. These 11 strains cover the majority of common O serotypes in E. coli K1 isolates from CSF. Our data demonstrated that these 11 strains of E. coli K1 can be categorized into two groups based on their profile for putative virulence factors, lipoproteins, proteases, and outer membrane proteins. Of interest, we showed that some open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the type III secretion system apparatus were found in group 2 strains but not in group 1 strains, while ORFs encoding the general secretory pathway are predominant in group 1 strains. These findings suggest that E. coli K1 strains isolated from CSF can be divided into two groups and these two groups of E. coli K1 may utilize different mechanisms to induce meningitis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ameningitis 3aopen reading frames 3alipoproteins 3aproteinases 3aserotypes 3aurinary tract diseases 3acerebrospinal fluid 3aouter membrane proteins 3atype III secretion system 3apatients 3acomparative genomic hybridization 3avirulence 3aEscherichia coli 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aLipoproteinsxgenetics 2aMeningitis, Escherichia colixcerebrospinal fluidxmicrobiology. 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aVirulence Factorsxgenetics 0aType III secretion system1 aXie, Yi1 aKim, Kwang-sik.0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 Apr., v. 74, no. 4 p.2196-2206dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.74.4.2196-2206.20063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02525naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245008800175300001600263520139000279650001501669650001001684650001801694650002901712650001201741650001101753650001501764650001301779650000801792650001001800651001001810653002001820653001001840653002001850773012801870852000901998856007602007930003302083946001102116655001202127IND4384796020221118214807.0061029e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438479602DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00183.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Stephen J.10aEarly collapse of Vespa simillima (Hymenoptera, Vespidae) colonies in central Japan  ap. 373-376.  aDuring the past 15 years in the Ina Valley, Japan, mature fifth instar larvae of the yellow hornet, Vespa simillima, have been occasionally ejected from colonies during September. During 2005, this unusual behavior was particularly widespread, and collection of several V. simillima colonies confirmed that very few fifth instar larvae were present. When compared with an average colony, constructed from 41 colonies collected 20 years previously, colonies in 2005 had 80% fewer fifth instar larvae, despite queen egg-laying rates remaining similar. It may be that the amount of food provided to the larvae by workers is less than the amount of larval secretions received by workers, which is causing the larvae to become emaciated and preventing them from pupating. This phenomenon normally occurs naturally at the end of the colony cycle in November, when prey abundance decreases and larval secretions or other sources of carbohydrates, for example from ripe fruit, tree sap, or aphid secretions, are needed by sexuals to build up fat reserves. However, another possibility is that the unexplained appearance of this phenomenon in September, which is causing colonies to collapse without producing any or very few sexuals, is due to foragers feeding the larvae prey that are contaminated with insect growth regulators, via pesticides, which are known to prevent successful pupation. 3aAphidoidea 3aVespa 3acarbohydrates 3ainsect growth regulators 3ainstars 3alarvae 3apesticides 3apupation 3asap 3atrees 3aJapan 0acolony collapse 0alarva 0aVespa simillima0 tEntomological science.g2006 Dec., v. 9, no. 4 p.373-376dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1343-87867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00183.x3electronic resource  a20061029b20061102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02901naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245014300181300001600324520106800340650001401408650005701422650001001479650000901489650001101498650001101509650006401520650007201584650002601656650002601682650002401708650006601732650000901798650001601807650003601823650008001859650003001939653001001969653001001979653001001989653001501999700001602014700001602030700001502046700002002061700001602081773011002097852000902207856008502216930003302301946001302334655001202347IND4417392220221118213843.0090306e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441739222DNAL7 a187630272pmid7 a10.1007/s10875-008-9233-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaproni, M. 10aSerum Levels of IL-17 and IL-22 Are Reduced by Etanercept, but not by Acitretin, in Patients with Psoriasis: a Randomized-Controlled Trial  ap. 210-214.  aIntroduction There are no controlled trials comparing etanercept and acitretin efficacy and therapeutic mechanisms in psoriasis. Materials and methods In the present study, 30 patients were given etanercept 50 mg twice weekly and 30 patients acitretin 0.4 mg/kg per day, both for 12 weeks. Before and after treatment, psoriasis area and severity index was calculated, and serum levels of interleukin (IL)-17, IL-22, and IL-23 were investigated. Results After treatment, psoriasis area and severity index was significantly lower for both groups. However, etanercept-treated patients showed lower psoriasis area and severity index than acitretin-treated ones. Psoriasis patients showed higher IL-17 and IL-22 levels than controls, while no IL-23 was found in any serum. Furthermore, a correlation between IL-17 levels and psoriasis severity was found. Only etanercept was able to reduce IL-17 and IL-22 levels. Conclusions Our findings suggest that etanercept is more effective than acitretin in the treatment of psoriasis and that it is able to affect Th17 system. 3apsoriasis 2aAcitretinxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aAdult 2aAged 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aImmunosuppressive Agentsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aInterleukin-17xblood 2aInterleukin-23xblood 2aInterleukinsxblood 2aKeratolytic Agentsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPsoriasisxbloodxdrug therapy. 2aReceptors, Tumor Necrosis Factorxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aSeverity of Illness Index 0aIL-17 0aIL-22 0aIL-23 0aetanercept1 aAntiga, E. 1 aMelani, L. 1 aVolpi, W. 1 aDel Bianco, E. 1 aFabbri, P. 0 tJournal of clinical immunology.g2009 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.210-214dBoston : Springer USx0271-91427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10875-008-9233-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03300naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245021100161300001600372520181400388653004802202653002402250653002802274653003802302653003302340653006102373653001702434653004502451700002202496700002002518700001802538700001902556700002202575700002202597700002102619773011002640852000902750856008502759930003302844946001302877655001202890IND4417392520221118214842.0090306e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441739252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10875-008-9253-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Wen-I 10aChinese Patients with Defective IL-12/23-Interferon-γ Circuit in Taiwan: Partial Dominant Interferon-γ Receptor 1 Mutation Presenting as Cutaneous Granuloma and IL-12 Receptor β1 Mutation as Pneumatocele  ap. 238-245.  aBackground IL-12/23-interferon-γ circuit enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis in macrophage to attack intracellular pathogens such as mycobacteria and salmonella. Defective ROS in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) have increased susceptibility to these pathogens. However, patients with defective IL-12/23-interferon-γ circuit rather than CGD are not recognized in Taiwan, endemic for tuberculosis and salmonella. Aim The purpose of this study was to identify Taiwanese patients with defective IL-12/23-IFN-γ circuit. Patients and Methods In a long-term molecular study of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD), the tentative CGD patients presenting with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-induced infection, refractory atypical mycobacterial cutaneous granuloma and osteomyelitis, recurrent salmonella sepsis, and pneumatocele were studied for the IL-12/23-IFN-γ circuit. ROS was first measured to exclude CGD. Candidate genes of IL12RB1, IFNRG1, IL12p40, IFNRG2, signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, and NF-κB essential modulator and their encoding protein expressions were analyzed. Results Of the 175 Taiwanese PIDD patients during a 28-year period, three patients from two unrelated families were identified with the hotspot INFRG1 deletion mutation (818del4) and had CGD features, presenting as cutaneous granuloma, and multiple osteomyelitis infected by non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, Mycobacteria avium complex and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum. Another with mis-sense IL12RB1 mutation (Arg211Pro) was noted as recurrent Salmonella enteritidis D sepsis and pneumatocele. Conclusion Patients with defective IL-12/23-IFN-γ circuit may resemble or overlap CGD manifestations of refractory cutaneous atypical mycobacterial granuloma and salmonella pneumatocele. 0aBacille Calmette-Guerin infection (BCGitis) 0acutaneous granuloma 0aIL-12/23-IFN-γ circuit 0aInterferon-γ receptor 1 (IFNGR1) 0aIL-12 receptor β1 (IL12RB1) 0aMendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) 0apneumatocele 0aprimary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD)1 aHuang, Jing-Long 1 aLin, Tzou-Yien 1 aHsueh, Chuen 1 aWong, Alex M. 1 aHsieh, Meng-Ying 1 aChiu, Cheng-Hsun 1 aJaing, Tang-Her 0 tJournal of clinical immunology.g2009 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.238-245dBoston : Springer USx0271-91427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10875-008-9253-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090306b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01343naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245008000149300001600229300002400245520024200269650002000511650001400531650002600545650002300571650001200594650001500606650001400621650003200635650001400667650001100681650004000692650003500732773010200767852001300869939003300882945000800915946001300923852000900936655001200945991559921650742620221118214847.0890411e198903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890006792DNAL7 a29214472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPicus, S.S.10aEvaluation of the nutrition counseling environment of hospitalized patients  ap. 403-405.  ap. 403-405. charts.  aThis study was designed to examine the environment in which hospital sessions occur.

UK legislation reinforces the EU position that food businesses are responsible for the implementation of good hygiene practices. The response of the food industry has been to develop audited standards of hygiene, higher than explicit legal requirements. Small businesses have, however, been slow to adopt industry hygiene standards. A case study of small manufacturers of ready to eat meat products investigated the reasons for this. Businesses were first audited to the EFSIS[1] standard, to compare current practice with recommended best practice. Second, technical managers or owner-managers were interviewed, to gain an insight into their knowledge of industry standards in particular, and the process of hygiene management in general. The analysis found significant differences in the knowledge of technical managers and owner-managers, with the latter often unaware of the existence of audited standards. It is argued, therefore, that in order to increase the implementation of good hygiene practices, further programmes to inform small food businesses about industry standards are required. 3ameat products 3adisease prevention 3afood industry 3aguidelines 3afoodborne illness 3asmall businesses 3afood safety 3ahygiene 3aEurope 0afoods1 aHenson, S.J.0 tBritish food journal.g2000, v. 102, no. 4 p.320-337dBritish Food JournalaBritish food journal (Croydon, England)x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1108/000707000103277423Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.emerald-library.com/3electronic resource  a20050224b20050301c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01900naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245008200150300001600232300002400248520054200272650001300814650002000827650001900847650002400866650001400890650001000904650000900914650003600923650001100959650001800970650001100988650000900999650001801008650001601026650003101042650002301073650001501096650002401111653001501135700002001150700001701170700001701187773010201204852001301306939003301319945000801352946001301360852000901373655001201382991559920590742620221118214757.0890411e198903  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890006802DNAL7 a29214482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBethea, C.D.10aComparison of conventional and videotaped diabetic exchange lists instruction  ap. 405-406.  ap. 405-406. charts.  aIn this study, a quasi-experimental research design was used to determine effectiveness of videotaped instruction compared with conventional instruction.

In the following winter, the hardiness of two hardy and two tender selections was analyzed by differential thermal analysis (DTA) to screen selections for hardiness. In a mild winter, when buds remained at their minimum hardiness level, the hardy selections consistently were >2C hardier than the tender selections. About one-half of that hardiness difference was associated with differences in tissue water content, the other half with unknown factors. Buds of the tender selections began to develop earlier and bloomed earlier than the hardy selections. DTA analysis of floral bud populations separated selections that clearly differed in floral bud hardiness. 3aPrunus avium 3aplant tissues 3awinter hardiness 3abuds 3afrost injury 3awater content 3adormancy 3aselection criteria 3athermal analysis 0aWashington 0adifferential diagnosis1 aProebsting, E.L.0 tHortScience.g1994 Feb., v. 29, no. 2 p.104-106x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle01574naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006900127300001600196520071500212650002200927650002200949650002300971650002300994650003001017650001401047700001701061700001901078700001401097773006901111852000901180930003301189945001301222946001301235655001201248IND2040492820221118214540.0940623e199402  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204049282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoyhan, G.E.12aA new source of resistance to anthracnose (race 2) in watermelon  ap. 111-112.  aIn an anthracnose [Colletotricum obiculare (Berk. & Mont.)

Our findings demonstrate that microsatellites developed for C. amplexicaulis var. barbarae will be useful for population-genetic studies in taxa throughout the Streptanthoid Complex. 3aBrassicaceae 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats1 aPEPPER, ALAN E.0 tMolecular ecology notes.g2006 Sept., v. 6, no. 3 p.770-772dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1471-82787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01337.x3electronic resource  a20060820b20060906c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02614naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072001700152072001700169100001800186245019900204300001600403520108800419650001801507650001401525650001601539650001101555650001301566650001201579650001901591650002201610650001701632650001201649650001301661650001201674650001301686650001201699650002701711650001401738650002601752650001701778700001501795700002001810773010801830852000901938856009201947930003302039945002502072946001102097655001202108IND4371767720221118214232.0050625e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437176772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.00976.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Before toasting the products were given a drying-tempering step. Two process variables (extrusion temperature and moisture content before toasting) were manipulated in order to obtain products with different physical characteristics. Density, hardness, hydration kinetics and textural changes of the products during soaking were studied in order to analyse the influence of these variables on the product quality. Both the variables significantly affected the product quality indices such as hardness and density. The processing conditions had only a slight influence on product water uptake during hydration but a dramatic influence on product softening. The hydration and softening rates were negatively correlated with density. When density was equal samples extruded at different extrusion temperatures showed different water uptake and softening rates. Products with the same values of initial hydration rate showed different initial softening rates because of extrusion temperature. 3awater content 3aextrusion 3atemperature 3adrying 3akinetics 3atexture 3aextruded foods 3abreakfast cereals 3alow fat milk 3acooking 3atoasting 3adensity 3ahardness 3asoaking 3arheological properties 3amouthfeel 3afunctional properties 3afood quality1 aPittia, P.1 aPinnavaia, G.G.0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2005 June, v. 40, no. 6 p.655-663x0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.00976.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080401b20080404c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/01/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03425naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245011600131300001400247500001500261520205300276650001802329650001602347650002002363650001802383650002102401650001702422650001902439650001802458650001602476650002802492650002002520650001902540650001802559653001102577653001302588653002402601653001302625653001602638653001602654653001702670653002302687653002402710653001502734700001202749773008002761852000902841930003302850945001302883946001102896655001202907IND2268226820221118214310.0010406e200009  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226822682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinnersley, A.M.10aReceptor modifiers indicate that 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a potential modulator of ion transport in plants  ap. 65-76.  a2019-12-05  aGABA (4-aminobutyric acid) is a ubiquitous non-protein amino acid that accumulates rapidly in plants in response to stress. GABA was first identified in plants (potato tubers) and animals (brain tissue) 50 years ago. Although GABA is now recognized as the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the role of GABA in plants remains unclear. Studies were performed using Lemna to investigate the possibility that GABA elicits a response in plants that may be related to that of a signaling molecule as described for GABA effects on the CNS. Lemna growth was increased 2 to 3-fold by 5 mM GABA, but growth was strongly inhibited by 0.5 mM of the isomers 3-aminobutyric acid and 2-aminobutyric acid. Growth promotion by GABA was rapidly terminated by addition of 2-aminobutyric acid to the culture medium, but inhibitory effects of 2-aminobutyric acid were not reversed by GABA regardless of amounts added. Promotion of Lemna growth by GABA was associated with an increase in mineral content of treated plants in a dose dependent manner. Results support the hypothesis that GABA activity in plants involves an effect on ion transport and an interaction with a receptor. Evidence for GABA receptors in Lemna was obtained from experiments with pharmacological agents that have been used to identify GABA receptors in animals. GABA mediated promotion of Lemna growth was inhibited by bicuculline and picrotoxin, which are respectively competitive and non-competitive antagonists of GABA receptors in the CNS. Growth inhibition by bicuculline was not relieved by increasing the amounts of GABA in the medium, indicating that the alkaloid is not acting, as in the CNS, by competitive antagonism of GABA at GABA receptor sites. Baclofen, a GABA agonist that promotes GABA activity in animals significantly increased GABA mediated promotion of Lemna growth. These findings and the known action of GABA in regulating ion channels in animals suggests a way that GABA could amplify the stress response in plants. 3adose response 3acell growth 3astress response 3aion transport 3atoxic substances 3abutyric acid 3acarboxy-lyases 3abinding sites 3aLemna minor 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aenzyme activity 3aaquatic plants 3aglutamic acid 0auptake 0apicrotin 0a2-aminobutyric acid 0abaclofen 0aderivatives 0abicuculline 0apicrotoxinin 0achemical structure 0a3-aminobutryic acid 0aregulation1 aLin, F.0 tPlant growth regulation.g2000 Sept., v. 32, no. 1 p.65-76x0167-69037nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01734naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010500125300001600230500002400246500001500270520065400285650002300939650001200962651001200974653002200986653001401008653001801022653001201040700001301052700001601065700001601081773014001097852000901237856005701246930003301303945001301336946001101349655001201360IND2322149120221122233916.0010723s2000    enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232214912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClarke, I.10aThinking the thoughts they do: symbolism and meaning in the consumer experience of the "British pub"  ap. 692-710.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe paper argues the need for an appraisal of the symbolic meaning of the "pub" and derivative managerialist concepts from the perspective of the consumers' experience.

The paper draws on extensive interviews with a stratified purposive sample of customers of pub formats in the north-west of England to undertake a semiotic appraisal of the reason why consumers "think the thoughts they do" about managerial developments of this distinctly social phenomenon. 3aconsumer attitudes 3asurveys 3aEngland 0aconsumer behavior 0aconsumers 0apublic houses 0asymbols1 aKell, I.1 aSchmidt, R.1 aVignali, C.0 tBritish food journal.g2000, v. 102, no. 9/10 p.692-710dBritish Food JournalaBritish food journal (Croydon, England)x0007-070X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.emerald-library.com/3electronic resource  a20050224b20050301c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01500naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245013800171300001600309520045600325650001300781650002500794650001200819650002700831650001000858700002000868700001600888700002100904773012000925852000901045856007601054930003301130946001101163655001201174IND4382920720221118214552.0060820e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438292072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01321.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTAKAYAMA, KOJI10aIsolation and characterization of microsatellites in the sea hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus L., Malvaceae) and related hibiscus species  ap. 721-723.  aMicrosatellite loci were isolated from the sea hibiscus (Hibiscus tiliaceus L., Malvaceae), a pantropical plant with sea-drifted seeds.

Energy intakes of children (4 - 11 years), equivalent to 1.1 times basal metabolic rate (BMR) were inadequate for normal growth and activity. Intakes of adolescents (11 - 18y) were marginal (1.5 BMR). Adult women and men had energy intakes corresponding to 2.0 and 1.5 BMR respectively. These amounts were compatible with the intensive physical activity of women and lighter activity of men on one hand, and with their small body size on the other. Mean daily protein intakes, after correction for digestibility and amino acid score according to FAO/WHO/UNU (1985) recommendations, were 0.63, 0.60 and 0.47 g/kg for children, adolescents and adults, respectively and corresponded to only 50 to 70% of recommended levels, and were thus in accordance with the commonly observed clinical and biochemical signs of protein depletion. Protein and fat accounted for only 4.5% and 9%, respectively, of energy intake. This situation is the result of the high consumption of cassava combined with the poor availability of foods rich in protein and fat. Dietary protein inadequacy, unlikely when energy requirements are met in populations with cereal food staples, can be a major problem in root tuber consuming populations. 3adietary protein 3aenergy intake 3adietary fat 3anutrient content 3awomen 3amen 3adietary fiber 3anutritional adequacy 3adietary carbohydrate 3aamino acids 3aprotein intake 3achildren 3abasal metabolism 3afood composition 3aadolescents 3adietary surveys 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 0anutrient intake 0adiet1 aMauron, J.1 aBlondel, A.1 aVerwilghen, A.M.1 aVan Geert, C.1 aDirren, H.0 tNutrition research.g1993 May, v. 13, no. 5 p.523-534x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a20140417b20140502c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02975naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009000125300001800215500001500233520182600248650001002074650002002084650001302104650001802117650001902135650001602154650002002170653001202190653003302202653002802235653002002263653001002283700001702293700001402310700001602324700001802340700001602358700001502374773007202389852000902461930003302470945001302503946001302516655001202529IND2048833420221118214623.0951117e199312  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204883342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnes, C.10aAccuracy of quantum sensors measuring yield photo flux and photosynthetic photon flux  ap. 1197-1200.  a2019-12-05  aPhotosynthesis is fundamentally driven by photon flux rather than energy flux, but not all absorbed photons yield equal amounts of photosynthesis. Thus, two measures of photosynthetically active radiation have emerged: photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), which values all photons from 400 to 700 nm equally, and yield photon flux (YPF), which weights photons in the range from 360 to 760 nm according to plant photosynthetic response. We selected seven common radiation sources and measured YPF and PPF from each source with a spectroradiometer. We then compared these measurements with measurements from three quantum sensors designed to measure YPF, and from six quantum sensors designed to measure PPF. There were few differences among sensors within a group (usually <5%), but YPF values from sensors were consistently lower (3% to 20%) than YPF values calculated from spectroradiometric measurements. Quantum sensor measurements of PPF also were consistently lower than PPF values calculated from spectroradiometric measurements, but the differences were <7% for all sources, except red-light-emitting diodes. The sensors were most accurate for broad-band sources and least accurate for narrow-band sources. According to spectroradiometric measurements, YPF sensors were significantly less accurate (>9% difference) than PPF sensors under metal halide, high-pressure sodium, and low-pressure sodium lamps. Both sensor types were inaccurate (>18% error) under red-light-emitting diodes. Because both YPF and PPF sensors are imperfect integrators, and because spectroradiometers can measure photosynthetically active radiation much more accurately, researchers should consider developing calibration factors from spectroradiometric data for some specific radiation sources to improve the accuracy of integrating sensors. 3alamps 3asolar radiation 3aaccuracy 3alight quality 3aphotosynthesis 3ameasurement 3agrowth chambers 0asensors 0aspectral photon distribution 0acontrolled environments 0alight relations 0alight1 aTibbitts, T.1 aSager, J.1 aDeitzer, G.1 aBubenheim, D.1 aKoerner, G.1 aBugbee, B.0 tHortScience.g1993 Dec., v. 28, no. 12 p.1197-1200x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdLJS  aOther US 7aarticle02751naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245013900152300001600291500001500307520119700322650001201519650001301531650001401544650001001558650001001568650002201578650002501600650001201625650001501637650001001652650004201662650002901704650006301733650001101796650005101807650001101858650004201869650003201911650001301943650001601956653001201972653001801984700002002002700001902022700001802041773008902059852000902148939003302157945000802190946001102198655001202209991559912410742620221118214616.0930610e199305  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930018582DNAL7 a83893402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGardiner, H.M.10aFluvoxamine: an open pilot study in moderately obese female patients suffering from atypical eating disorders and episodes of bingeing  ap. 301-305.  a2019-12-04  aThe results of a small pilot study using Fluvoxamine (Faverin) in the treatment of non-vomiting bingeing female patients and women with bulimia nervosa is presented. Ten non-vomiting subjects and six with bulimia nervosa were treated on an open basis with Fluvoxamine 100-200 mg daily. Assessment was made using established questionnaires for severity of eating disorder and abnormality of mood. Five non-vomiting patients and three with bulimia nervosa completed the study. Non-vomiters showed a significant weight loss; a significant reduction in number of binges; a significant reduction in the scores on the BITE and the EAT; and a significant reduction in anxiety. Those with bulimia nervosa had a significant reduction in hunger and a reduction in depression which tended towards significance. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn from this study as it is an open pilot study of a small number of women. However, the results indicate that Fluvoxamine may have a role in the treatment of eating disorders where bingeing is a prominent symptom and that further research would be valuable. Comments are also made on the usefulness of various questionnaires designed to assess eating disorders. 3abinging 3avomiting 3aserotonin 3awomen 3adrugs 3amedical treatment 3apsychosocial factors 3aobesity 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBulimiaxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aDepressionxdrug therapy 2aFeeding and Eating Disordersxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aFemale 2aFluvoxaminexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aHumans 2aObesityxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aVomiting 2aWeight Loss 0abulimia 0aweight losses1 aFreeman, C.P.L.1 aJesinger, D.K.1 aCollins, S.A.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g1993 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.301-305x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle02301naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001700142245008400159300001600243520105900259650001301318650000801331650001001339650001201349650001301361650001901374650001901393650001601412650001201428650001801440650001501458650001501473650002001488653002001508700001601528700001401544700001801558700001801576700001601594773007301610852000901683856008201692930003301774945001301807946001101820655001201831IND2201222320221118214619.0991021e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220122232DNAL7 a10.1080/030794599948942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArshad, S.S.10aTropism of subgroup J avian leukosis virus as detected by in situ hybridization  ap. 163-169.  aThe HPRS-103 strain of avian retrovirus is the prototype of subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J) and causes myeloid leukosis in meat-type chickens. Using immunohistochemical detection of the viral group-specific antigen (Gag) we have previously demonstrated that the induction of myeloid leukosis by ALV-J is associated with viral tropism for myelomonocytic cells. In this paper we describe an in situ hybridization (ISH) technique using digoxigenin (DIG)-labelled probes for detecting RNA transcripts in tissues from chickens infected with avian leukosis viruses (ALV) of subgroups J (HPRS-103 strain) and A (RAV-1 strain). Virus-specific RNA was detected mainly in the heart, kidney, proventriculus and adrenal in locations similar to those of the Gag protein. Viral gene expression could not be detected in the bone marrow or tumour tissues using this test. Higher levels of viral gene expression in the bursa of Fabricius infected with RAV-1, but not with HPRS-103, might help explain the inability of the latter virus to induce lymphoid leukosis. 3achickens 3aRNA 3aheart 3akidneys 3atropisms 3aproventriculus 3aadrenal glands 3adigoxigenin 3astrains 3ahybridization 3aDNA probes 3aRNA probes 3agene expression 0aavian oncovirus1 aSmith, L.M.1 aHowes, K.1 aRussell, P.H.1 aVenugopal, K.1 aPayne, L.N.0 tAvian pathology.g1999 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.163-169x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794599948943Available from publisher's Web site  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle02148naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245007500150300001600225500001500241520082900256650000801085650002001093650003301113650002101146650001601167650001201183650001001195650002901205650002301234650001201257650001101269650000901280650001101289650001301300650003001313650000901343650001601352650001901368650002501387653001601412700001801428700001801446700001601464773008901480852000901569939003301578945000801611946001101619655001201630991559911300742620221118214349.0930610e199305  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930018532DNAL7 a83893352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFisher, R.M.10aPost-prandial VLDL subfraction metabolism in normal and obese subjects  ap. 263-269.  a2019-12-04  aThe metabolic behaviour of very low density lipoprotein subfractions Sf 60-400 (VLDL1) and Sf 20-60 (VLDL2) was studied in five normal weight and five obese subjects following an overnight fast and after the consumption of a mixed meal.

  1 aZawadzki, A.10aBiodiesel Feedstock and Blend Level Sensing Using Visible Light Spectra and Neural Network  ap. 539-542.  aEven after biodiesel meets ASTM D6751 specifications, biodiesels from different feedstocks may have different properties. Biodiesel blend level influences the fuel properties, such as cloud point and emissions. Therefore, whether for performance reasons or other reasons, it is often required to detect the biodiesel percentage in a diesel-biodiesel blend. This research used a spectrophotometer to scan the blends of U.S. No. 2 diesel and biodiesel from three different feedstocks (rapeseed, soybean. and mustard oil) in the visible wavelength range of 380-530 nm. It was found that the shape of the absorption curve varied according to biodiesel feedstock; however, relative absorbance was proportional to the blend level. If the absorbance of the parent biodiesel can be measured, such as in a blending facility, then a single wavelength between 470 and 490 nm could be used to measure the biodiesel blend level with +/- 1.85% standard error at 95% confidence interval. A neural network was trained to measure the blend level when the parent biodiesel spectrum was unknown. It was concluded that even if the absorption spectrum of the parent biodiesel is not known, the absorption spectrum of the blend from 380-530 nm can be used along with a neural network to detect the biodiesel feedstock and for rough blend level estimation. 3arapeseed oil 3asoybean oil 3amustard oil 3abiodiesel 3amixtures 3aneural networks 3aspectrophotometers 3aabsorbance 0afeedstocks1 aShrestha, D.S.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2009 , v. 52, no. 2 p.539-5427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc_journals.asp?volume=52&issue=2&conf=t&orgconf=t20093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090629b20090703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/06/29  aOther US 7aarticle01673naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011600166300001600282520058100298650001500879650001200894650001400906650002200920650001200942650001200954650000900966650002700975650002201002700002301024700001501047773012001062852000901182856007601191930003301267946001101300655001201311IND4382921220221118214520.0060820e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438292122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01326.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBLOOR, P.10aHighly polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite loci for the eastern Canary Island lizard, Gallotia atlantica  ap. 737-739.  aWe describe 10 polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite loci from the eastern Canary Island lacertid lizard, Gallotia atlantica.

We examine changes in employment  associated with the lesser prairie chicken, which was listed as threatened in May 2014. Using  county-level employment data and variation in suitable prairie chicken habitat, we apply a difference-in-differences strategy to measure the employment effects of the listing decision. We find evidence that employment declined about 1.5% in affected counties. The effect is proportional  to habitat, which means counties with relatively more habitat experienced a larger share of employment losses. 3aEndangered Species Act of 1973 3aTympanuchus pallidicinctus 3aemployment 3aendangered species 3ahabitats 3alabor market 3aprivate lands 3awildlife 3aUnited States1 aLee, Kangil1 aByl, Jacob P.0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2018, v. 43, no. 3 p.346-363dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/UserFiles/file/JARE43.3September20183Melstrom346-363.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012300175300001600298520148000314650001601794650001201810650002401822650001201846650001101858650001101869650002301880650001601903650001001919650000901929650001301938650002101951650000901972653001401981653002301995653001302018700002202031773012802053852000902181856007602190930003302266946001102299655001202310IND4378363820221118213549.0060302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437836382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00158.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngram, Abigail L.10aStructure, mechanism and mechanical properties of pupal attachment in Greta oto (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Ithomiinae)  ap. 109-120.  aThe structure and mechanism of pupal attachment are described for the nymphalid Greta oto using electron microscopy, and high-speed and time-lapse photography. The cremaster is composed of a 3-D array of hooked setae that engage with silk fibers spun into layers in a pad on the lower leaf surface. Each seta comprises a shaft terminating in a strongly curved hook, tipped with two lateral barbs. These hook into the silk pad, which is densely laid and built-up in the central portion, flattening out peripherally. Time-lapse photography showed that silk pad construction by fifth instar larvae is completed in four distinct spinning movements, producing a random fiber arrangement. It is proposed that such a fiber arrangement provides isotropic strength, giving greater flexibility to the attachment. The cremaster is attached to the silk pad by a series of lateral movements of the pupa's posterior abdomen. This movement, together with the shape of the setal hooks, is thought to be integral to the attachment process. Tensile loading tests showed that attachment failure is due to the breakage of the silk pad, which undergoes gradual destruction before releasing the cremaster. The attachment was found to have high tensile strength and fracture toughness, both of which suggest that it has evolved for the dual purpose of preventing the pupa being pulled from the leaf by a predator and preventing the attachment being weakened by wind, which causes the pupa to swing. 3aNymphalidae 3aabdomen 3aelectron microscopy 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amodulus of rupture 3aphotography 3apupae 3asilk 3aspinning 3atensile strength 3awind 0acremaster 0afracture toughness 0astrength1 aParker, Andrew R.0 tEntomological science.g2006 Mar., v. 9, no. 1 p.109-120dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1343-87867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1479-8298.2006.00158.x3electronic resource  a20060305b20060402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04190naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100001500194245009100209300001600300500002400316500001500340520268000355650002003035650002303055650001903078650001903097650001003116650001603126650001403142650002303156650001503179650001903194650001903213650002803232650001403260650002103274653002103295653001903316653001303335700001303348773012003361852000903481856008903490930003303579945002503612946001103637655001203648IND4399418920221118213818.0071227e20071215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439941892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aM310 0aL810 0aL600 0aM0011 aRomano, N.10aEffects of potassium on nitrate mediated alterations of osmoregulation in marine crabs  ap. 202-208.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDetermining the acute nitrate tolerance of marine animals is important for conservation as high levels of nitrate may be discharged into aquatic ecosystems via various anthropogenic sources. Typically, sodium nitrate (NaNO3) is used to determine the acute nitrate toxicity of marine animals. The standard procedure involves dissolving NaNO3 salt in distilled water to create a stock solution, which is then diluted in seawater to obtain the desired nitrate concentration for the toxicity test. However, due to the relatively low toxicity of NO3-, large volumes of the stock solution are required to create high NaNO3-N concentrations in the test solutions for LC50 (median lethal concentration) calculations. As the stock solution contains no other elements, other than Na+ and NO3-, this can lead to drastically altered Na+/K+ ratios (compared to natural seawater) of the test solutions, which could significantly affect the osmo-ionoregulation of the animals, and subsequently bias survival data. Consequently, experiments were performed to determine if incorporating potassium chloride (KCl), at a K+ level equaling natural seawater at 30[per thousand], to the NaNO3-N stock solution influences the haemolymph osmolality, ion composition and LC50 values of two commercially important crab species, the mud crab Scylla serrata and the blue swimmer crab Portunus pelagicus. In each experiment with S. serrata and P. pelagicus, a total of 20 replicate crabs were exposed to NaNO3-N concentrations of 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 and 6000 mg l-1 with and without incorporated KCl. Mortality observations were made at 12-h interval for 96-h. After 96-h, the haemolymph osmolality, Na+, K+ and Ca2+ of the surviving crabs were measured. The 96-h LC50 values for early juveniles of S. serrata and P. pelagicus were 3601 (3314-3902) mg l-1 versus 4339 (4056-4518) mg l-1 and 3355 (3085-3620) mg l-1 versus 4132 (3864-4409) mg l-1, respectively for the treatments without and with incorporated KCl. Statistical analysis showed that the sole utilisation of NaNO3 led to a significantly (p < 0.01) lower LC50 value for both crabs, likely a consequence of their significantly lower (p < 0.05) haemolymph K+ levels. In contrast, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in haemolymph K+ was detected between crabs from the control and the treatment with incorporated KCl. It is therefore likely that previously reported acute nitrate toxicity tests have substantially underestimated the nitrate tolerances of marine animals. To avoid this problem, we propose incorporating KCl to the NaNO3-N stock solution as a standard protocol for future acute nitrate toxicity experiments on marine animals. 3awater pollution 3aPortunus pelagicus 3asodium nitrate 3aacute toxicity 3acrabs 3ahypokalemia 3ahemolymph 3apotassium chloride 3aosmolality 3aosmoregulation 3aabiotic stress 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3astress tolerance 0atoxicity testing 0aScylla serrata 0anitrates1 aZeng, C.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2007 Dec. 15, v. 85, no. 3 p.202-208dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.09.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/02/29  aNon-US 7aarticle01723naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245011400175300001600289520069100305650001100996650001801007650002701025650001401052650004801066700001801114700002801132773012001160852000901280856007601289930003301365946001101398655001201409IND4382917520221118214213.0060820e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438291752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01333.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPIGGOTT, MAXINE P.10aUse of SSCP to improve the efficiency of microsatellite identification from microsatellite-enriched libraries  ap. 613-615.  aAn inefficient aspect of marker identification from microsatellite-enriched libraries is the proportion of clones with identical sequences. This can substantially increase the number of clones that need to be sequenced in order to identify a sufficient number of microsatellite loci. We propose the use of single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis to identify unique clones prior to sequencing. We used this approach prior to sequencing from microsatellite-enriched libraries for three marine invertebrate species and were able to obtain a given number of unique clone sequences for only 28% of the sequencing effort that would have been required without SSCP screening. 3aclones 3ainvertebrates 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ascreening 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism1 aBANKS, SAM C.1 aBEHEREGARAY, LUCIANO B.0 tMolecular ecology notes.g2006 Sept., v. 6, no. 3 p.613-615dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1471-82787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01333.x3electronic resource  a20060820b20060906c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02782naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245007700142300001600219520103200235650004301267650002801310650002001338650003201358650001001390650001801400650001701418650001201435650001701447650001001464650002301474650002301497650002501520650002501545650002401570650001801594650002301612650001301635650001101648650003001659650004401689650002801733650006601761650002901827650004801856650003501904653001001939653002301949653002801972700001602000700001702016700001302033773008102046852000902127939003302136946001102169655001202180IND9201451820221118214337.0920316e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920145182DNAL7 a17319932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, S.W.10aReduced PAL gene suppression in Verticillium-infected resistant tomatoes  ap. 345-352.  aIn tomato, resistance to the wilt fungus Verticillium albo-atrum is determined primarily by the Ve locus. When two tomato near-isolines which differ at this locus and in their susceptibility to the pathogen were compared, more rapid suberin coating in the xylem of resistant plants correlated closely with a more rapid increase in the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5), an enzyme which is essential to the suberization process. In contrast, levels of mRNA did not increase proportionally to the measured enzyme activities; rather, there was a substantial suppression of mRNA levels in the susceptible tomato line, consistent with a much lower elevation of PAL activity and significantly less vascular coating. The suppression was absent or substantially reduced in the resistant line. The results indicate that the pathogen can suppress defense genes in susceptible plants but suggest that their expression is altered in resistant hosts and that post-transcriptional regulation plays a significant role. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aVerticillium albo-atrum 3agene expression 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3apathogenesis 3asuberin 3asuberization 3axylem 3adisease resistance 3adefense mechanisms 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aKinetics 2aLipids 2aMembrane Lipidsxanalysis 2aMitosporic Fungixgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenylalanine Ammonia-Lyasexchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Diseasesxgenetics 2aPlantsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aSuppression, Geneticxgenetics 0awilts 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data1 aNazar, R.N.1 aPowell, D.A.1 aRobb, J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1992 Jan., v. 18, no. 2 p.345-352x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01411naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245005300135300001600188300002100204520065300225650001400878650001800892650001300910653002000923773010200943852001301045939003301058945000801091946001301099852000901112655001201121991559904930742620221118214337.0890209e198901  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890002282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDougherty, D.A.10aPresident's Page: The Strategic Plan: The vision  ap. 110-112.  ap. 110-112. ill.  aIn our vision, the members of the Association are recognized by the public, government, industry, and allied professions as the experts on food and nutrition as they relate to the quality of life.

Inheritance studies confirmed the allelic nature of observed polymorphisms at all loci, while identifying null alleles at two loci. These loci, having varying degrees of polymorphism, should provide useful markers for applied genetic studies. A high degree of cross-amplification among 10 other cyprinid species suggests that these loci may have more widespread utility. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aDNA libraries 3aalleles 3aloci 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ainheritance (genetics) 3agenetic polymorphism 0aCyprinidae1 aCAIRNEY, M.1 aGILMOUR, A.E.1 aSATTAR, M.A.1 aDAS, T.K.1 aMcANDREW, B.J.1 aPENMAN, D.J.1 aTAGGART, J.B.0 tMolecular ecology notes.g2006 Sept., v. 6, no. 3 p.656-659dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1471-82787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01288.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110328b20110402c00000000  aINDdTEMeRHF 2011/0  aNon-US 7aarticle02530naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245009300150300001600243300002400259520127900283650002101562650002201583650002301605650002601628650002201654650000901676650002201685650000901707650001801716650001101734650002401745650000901769650001601778650002201794650002001816650001301836700001801849700001501867773010201882852001301984939003301997945000802030946001302038852000902051655001202060991559904660742620221118214309.0890228e198902  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890003612DNAL7 a29150972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManore, M.M.10aDevelopment and testing of a statistical and graphics-enhanced nutrient analysis program  ap. 246-250.  ap. 246-250. charts.  aThe authors have developed and tested a nutrient analysis program that will compute and present graphically summary statistics of population and population subgroup nutrient intakes.

Capabilities of the program include: storage of large numbers of diet records and evaluations of their nutrients; calculation of nutrient means and standard deviations; data sorting based on subject characteristics, such as age, sex, and supplement use; and generation of bar graphs and line plots for individual and/or group data. To test this computerized nutrient analysis program, two sets of 3-day diet records from 200 elderly individuals were analyzed. The program was then used to generate means, differences between means, and distribution frequencies of designated nutrients for various population subgroups (e.g., men greater than or equal to 65 years vs. men greater than or equal to 80 years) as well as comparisons with individual files (e.g., Mr. Smith vs. all men greater or equal to 65 years). The statistical and graphics capabilities also function within the context of recipe analysis and menu planning, which enhances the application of this program in institutional and community nutrition settings. 3anutrient content 3acomputer software 3anutrient databanks 3adiet study techniques 3acomputer graphics 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aDiet 2aFood Analysis 2aHumans 2aInformation Systems 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Surveys 2aNutritive Value 2aSoftware1 aVaughan, L.A.1 aLehman, W.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1989 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.246-250x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010400127300001400231500001500245520151300260650001701773650002501790650001801815650000901833650001201842650001901854650000901873650002301882650001801905650001501923650003601938650002101974653001501995653001102010653002702021700001702048773006702065852000902132930003302141945001302174946001302187655001202200IND2040491320221118214509.0940623e199402  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204049132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCreger, T.L.10aPhosphate fertilizer enhances arsenic uptake by apricot liners grown in lead-arsenate-enriched soil  ap. 88-92.  a2019-12-05  aPhosphate fertilizer additions to soils containing lead arsenate (LA) pesticide residues can increase As solubility. Apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) rootstock liners were grown in nondraining pots containing Burch loam soil that received a factorial treatment combination: 1) LA enrichment [no added LA (-LA), and LA added at 138 mg Pb/kg and 50 mg As/kg (+LA)]; 2) fertilizer type [monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and its sulfur analog ammonium hydrogen sulfate (AHS)]; and 3) fertilizer anion rate 0-26.1 mol/m3 soil). Measured response variables were soil salinity and pH, plant biomass, and plant As and Pb concentrations. Both MAP and AHS increased soil electrical conductivity (EC) and decreased soil pH, with AHS usually being more salinizing and acidifying than MAP was at equivalent rates. Adding LA reduced shoot and root mass and increased As and Pb concentration in shoots and roots. Shoot and root mass were inversely related to soil EC in the -LA soil but not in the +LA soil. Adding MAP increased shoot and root As concentration in the +LA soil, but adding AHS had no effect. Fertilizer type and rate did not influence shoot As concentration or root Pb concentration in the -LA soil or shoot Pb concentration in either the +LA or -LA soil. Adding AHS to the +LA soil increased root Pb concentration. These results are consistent with a P-enhanced solid-phase As release mechanism, which consequently increases plant uptake of soil As. Phosphate amendment had no effect on soil Pb phytoavailability. 3asoil physics 3adiammonium phosphate 3aphytotoxicity 3alead 3aarsenic 3asoil chemistry 3asoil 3apesticide residues 3alead arsenate 3arootstocks 3achemical constituents of plants 3aPrunus armeniaca 0aenrichment 0auptake 0amonoammonium phosphate1 aPeryea, F.J.0 tHortScience.g1994 Feb., v. 29, no. 2 p.88-92x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdAFJ  aOther US 7aarticle02091naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245007400152300001600226300002400242520086200266650002001128650001501148650001501163650001701178650000901195650001401204650002201218650002701240650001101267650003001278650004601308650001501354651001201369651001201381653002401393653001901417653001901436773010201455852001301557939003301570945000801603946001301611852000901624655001201633991559904170742620221118214441.0890228e198902  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890003622DNAL7 a24925712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFairfull, C.B.10aVolunteer experience of an American dietitian in Liberia, West Africa  ap. 251-254.  ap. 251-254. charts.  aAn American volunteer dietitian can make significant contributions in a developing country with the support of local personnel. Three objectives were achieved during a recent experience. The first objective was to become familiar with local foods and food customs and to revise the hospital diet manual to reflect Liberian food habits. Clinical observation of malnourished pediatric patients was the second objective, and this led to evaluation of the ELWA Hospital's kwashiorkor formula. The third objective was to provide in-service education to nurses and physicians at the ELWA and JFK Memorial Hospitals in Monrovia. Presentations were made on basic nutrition, diet manual revisions, and a kwashiorkor literature review. These objectives were set at the request of the ELWA Hospital administrator and accomplished with the support of the medical staff. 3anutritive value 3adietitians 3avolunteers 3amalnutrition 2aDiet 2aDietetics 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aFood Service, Hospital 2aHumans 2aKwashiorkorxdiet therapy 2aProtein-Energy Malnutritionxdiet therapy 2aVolunteers 3aLiberia 0aLiberia 0acultural influences 0afeeding habits 0ahospital diets0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g1989 Feb., v. 89, no. 2 p.251-254x0002-82237nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001600185245015000201300001600351500002400367520110700391650001901498650001901517650002201536650002001558650002401578650002501602650002301627650001801650650001701668650001601685650001501701650003401716650002701750650001801777650003801795650003201833650003101865650002401896650003301920650003001953650001701983651001002000651001002010700001202020700001502032700001402047700001502061773011902076852000902195856008802204930003302292945002502325946001102350655001202361IND4399417820221118214152.0071227e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439941782DNAL7 a173744252pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2007.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ2001 aZhang, J.J.10aTemporal change in the distribution patterns of hexachlorobenzene and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane among various soil organic matter fractions  ap. 234-242.  aIncludes references  aResidence time-dependent distribution patterns of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) among different soil organic matter fractions of three Chinese soils were investigated. Soil organic matter (SOM) was fractionated into fulvic acid (FA), humic acid (HA), bound-humic acid (BHA), lipid, and insoluble residue (IR) fractions using methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) method. Results revealed that as the residence time prolonged, the amounts of HCB and DDT in the FA, HA and BHA fractions decreased, while those in the lipid and IR fractions increased. One- and two-compartment first order, and one- and two-parameter pore-diffusion kinetic models were used to describe the mobility of HCB and DDT from the FA, HA and BHA fractions. The results suggest that excellent agreements were achieved between the experimental data and fits to the two-compartment first order kinetic model (R2 > 0.97). The transfer rates of HCB and DDT followed the order FA > HA > BHA. HCB and DDT tend to transfer from FA, HA and BHA fractions to lipid and IR fractions with increasing residence time. 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3ahexachlorobenzene 3aDDT (pesticide) 3asoil organic matter 3aspatial distribution 3atemporal variation 3afractionation 3afulvic acids 3ahumic acids 2aAdsorption 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aChemical Fractionation 2aDDTxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aHexachlorobenzenexanalysis 2aHumic Substancesxanalysis 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aTime Factors 3aChina 0aChina1 aWen, B.1 aShan, X.Q.1 aZhang, S.1 aKhan, S.U.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2007 Nov., v. 150, no. 2 p.234-242dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2007.01.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080219b20080301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/02/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02166naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245007700172300001600249520121700265650002601482650001201508650002101520650001901541650001101560650001301571653002501584700001601609773007201625852000901697856007801706939003301784946001101817655001201828IND9201447520221118213724.0920317s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920144752DNAL7 a242213332pmid7 a10.1007/BF002325142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, X.R.10aHigh frequency production of haploid embryos in asparagus anther culture  ap. 574-578.  aA method for obtaining a high frequency of haploid asparagus embryos through anther culture was developed. Flowers collected from plants in the field in July, August and September 1990, for the genotype G203, were stored at 5 degrees C for 24 h. Anthers were placed on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) containing 500 mg l-1 casein hydrolysate, 800 mg l-1 glutamine, 2 mg l-1 NAA, 1 mg l-1 BA and 5% sucrose at 32 degrees C in the dark for three to four weeks to induce calli. Calli were then grown at 25 degrees C with a 16 h photoperiod for three to four weeks. Developing embryos and calli were transferred to embryo maturation medium, MS containing 6% sucrose, 0.1 mg l-1 NAA, 0.1 mg l-1 kinetin and 0.65 mg l-1 ancymidol, for four weeks. More than 50% of the recovered mature embryos germinated on MS containing 1 mg l-1 GA3. Anthers with microspores at the late-uninucleate stage had the highest frequency of total and embryogenic calli formation, 40% and 15%, respectively. Each embryogenic callus usually produced 10-15 embryos. Approximately 75 plants per 100 anthers cultured were recovered: 76% haploid, 22% diploid and 2% triploid. High temperature was critical for the induction of embryogenic callus. 3aAsparagus officinalis 3aanthers 3ain vitro culture 3aembryo (plant) 3acallus 3ahaploidy 0aregenerative ability1 aWolyn, D.J.0 tPlant cell reports.g1991, v. 10, no. 11 p.574-578x0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002325143Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01800naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245017400177300001600351520070000367650000801067650001201075650001001087650002201097650001701119650000901136650002701145650001701172700002501189773011901214852000901333856007601342930003301418946001101451655001201462IND4386624020221118213907.0070107e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438662402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01557.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZAKHAROV, EVGUENI V.10aCharacterization of 17 polymorphic microsatellite loci in the Anise swallowtail, Papilio zelicaon (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), and their amplification in related species  ap. 144-146.  aFifteen polymorphic dinucleotide and two trinucleotide microsatellite loci were identified in the Anise swallowtail, Papilio zelicaon, from DNA genomic libraries enriched for simple sequence repeats. Allele numbers varied from eight to 29, with an excess of homozygotes observed for nine loci. This homozygosity is a feature of other lepidopteran microsatellites and is probably due to null alleles. Sixteen markers were amplified successfully in other representatives of Papilio with 11 loci retaining polymorphism in at least one species. These results suggest that the microsatellites reported here may be appropriate for measuring population genetic structure in a number of Papilio species. 3aDNA 3aPapilio 3aanise 3agenomic libraries 3ahomozygosity 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anull alleles1 aHELLMANN, JESSICA J.0 tMolecular ecology notes.g2007 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.144-146dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1471-82787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01557.x3electronic resource  a20070107b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01873naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245013100174300001600305520071300321650000801034650002701042650002001069650002201089650002701111650000901138650001701147650001401164651001101178700001801189700002201207700002201229773011901251852000901370856007601379930003301455946001101488655001201499IND4386624120221118213931.0070107e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438662412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2006.01559.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLARMUSEAU, M.H.D.10aDevelopment and characterization of nine polymorphic microsatellite markers in the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus (Gobiidae)  ap. 147-149.  aA microsatellite-enriched genomic library was constructed for the sand goby, Pomatoschistus minutus (Pallas 1770), and nine polymorphic DNA microsatellite markers of high quality were successfully optimized.

To further investigate these interactions, we isolated revertants in which the heat sensitivity caused by the apm2-1 mutation is lost. The heat-insensitive revertants were either fully or partially suppressed for the drug-resistance caused by the apm2-1 allele, In recombination tests the revertants behaved as if the suppressing mutation mapped within the APM2 locus; the partial suppressors of apm2-1 herbicide resistance failed to complement apm2-1, leading to the conclusion that they were likely to be intragenic pseudorevertants. The apm2-1 partial suppressor mutations reversed apm1-apm2-1 synthetic lethality in an allele-specific manner with respect both to apm1- alleles and apm2-1 suppressor mutations. Those apm1- apm2-1rev strains that regained viability also regained heat sensitivity characteristic of the original apm2-1 mutation, even though the apm2-1 suppressor strains were fully heat-insensitive. The Hs+ phenotypes of apm2-1 partial suppressors were also reversed by treatment with the microtubule-stabilizing agent deuterium oxide (D2O). In addition to the above interactions, we observed interallelic complementation and phenotypic enhancement of temperature conditionality among apm1- alleles. Evidence of a role for the products of the two genes in microtubule-based processes was obtained from studying flagellar assembly in apm1- and apm2- mutants. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aloci 3arecessive genes 3aalleles 3aherbicide resistance 3aamiprofos-methyl 3aoryzalin 3amicrotubules 3agene interaction 3aflagellum 3adeuterium oxide 3amutation 3agenetic complementation 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aChlamydomonas reinhardtiixdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDeuteriumxpharmacology 2aDeuterium Oxide 2aDrug Resistancexgenetics 2aFlagellaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aHot Temperature 2aMicrotubulesxdrug effects 2aMutation 2aNitrobenzenes 2aOrganothiophosphorus Compoundsxpharmacology 2aPhenotype 2aRegenerationxdrug effects 2aWaterxpharmacology 0agenetic change 0areversion 0aapm1 locus 0aapm2 locus 0ainterallelic complementation1 aLefebvre, P.A.0 tGenetics.g1992 Feb., v. 130, no. 2 p.305-314x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03198naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001900150245017300169300001600342500001500358520134800373650001401721650001301735650002301748650001201771650002001783650002001803650002301823650002801846650002801874650001201902650002301914650003801937650001101975650002001986650003302006650002002039650002002059650000902079650001402088650001302102650001402115650002502129653001802154653001902172653001602191653002502207653002002232653001002252653001602262653001702278653002002295700001802315700001602333700001602349700001602365700002102381773006702402852000902469939003302478946001302511655001202524IND9201446220221118214700.0920317e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920144622DNAL7 a15413932pmid7 aPMC12048532pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinclair, D.A.12aA cytogenetic and genetic characterization of a group of closely linked second chromosome mutations that suppress position-effect variegation in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 333-344.  a2019-12-04  aCharacterization of a group of dominant second chromosome suppressor of position-effect variegation (PEV) (Su(var)) mutants has revealed a variety of interesting properties, including: maternal-effect suppression of PEV, homozygous lethality or semilethality and male-specific hemizygous lethality, female infecundity, acute sensitivity to the amount of heterochromatin in the cell and sensitivity to sodium butyrate. Deficiency/duplication mapping and complementation tests have revealed that eight of the mutants define at least two genes in section 31 of the left arm of chromosome 2 and they suggest that a ninth corresponds to an additional nonessential Su(var) gene within or near this region. The effects of specific deficiencies and a duplication on PEV indicate that the expression of one or more of the Su(var) genes in this region of the chromosome is dose-dependent, i.e., capable of haplo-abnormal suppression and triplo-abnormal enhancement. Increasingly, the appearance of certain visible phenotypes among a subset of the mutants suggests that they may possess antimorphic properties. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that two of these Su(var) genes encode structural components of heterochromatin. We also report that two previously isolated mutants located in 31E and 31F-32A act as recessive suppressors of PEV. 3aphenotype 3amutation 3achromosome mapping 3amutants 3aheterochromatin 3arecessive genes 3alinkage (genetics) 3agenetic complementation 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenes, Dominant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenetic Linkage 2aHeterochromatin 2aMale 2aMosaicism 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aSuppression, Genetic 0asu(var) genes 0anucleoproteins 0avariegation 0anon-histone proteins 0ainhibitor genes 0agenes 0asuppressors 0acytogenetics 0aposition effect1 aRuddell, A.A.1 aBrock, J.K.1 aClegg, N.J.1 aLloyd, V.K.1 aGrigliatti, T.A.0 tGenetics.g1992 Feb., v. 130, no. 2 p.333-344x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02863naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001400198245012600212300001600338520079100354650001901145650001001164650001001174650001001184650001101194650002201205650002301227650001601250650002101266650002101287650002201308650001801330650007201348650002601420650002101446650001201467650001101479650005901490650004701549650002801596650005201624650002001676650003101696650003601727650002801763651001301791651001301804700001601817700001301833700002101846773007601867852000901943856010701952856008502059930003302144945002502177946001102202655001202213IND4423765120221118214732.0090727e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442376512DNAL7 a196809552pmid7 a10.1080/026520309027299082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The samples were screened for the β-agonists: bromobuterol, cimaterol, clenbuterol, clenpenterol, clenproperol, hydroxymethylclenbuterol, mapenterol, salbutamol and terbutaline. Only clenbuterol was found in all analyzed matrices and the most likely method of illegal administration to animals was through drinking water. Of all samples analysed, 14.15% of drinking water were found positive in the range 0.03-3.80 mg l-1 clenbuterol. Inclusion of hair samples in the Portuguese plan for clenbuterol residue control in live animals is discussed. 3adrinking water 3aurine 3ahairs 3afeeds 3acattle 3acattle production 3abans and sanctions 3aclenbuterol 3aveterinary drugs 3agrowth promotion 3agrowth regulators 3adrug residues 2aAdrenergic beta-Agonistsxadministration & dosagexanalysisxurine. 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aClenbuterolxadministration & dosagexanalysisxurine. 2aDrug Approvalxlegislation & jurisprudence 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxlegislation & jurisprudence 2aHairxchemistry 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSolid Phase Extractionxmethods 2aWater Supplyxanalysis. 3aPortugal 0aPortugal1 aBaeta, M.L.1 aReis, J.1 aSilveira, M.I.N.0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 June, v. 26, no. 6 p.814-8207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.metapress.com/openurl.asp?genre=journal&issn=0265-203X3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520309027299083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090823b20091002c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/08/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02670naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100001700185245012400202300001600326500002400342520085100366650001801217650001001235650001901245650001101264650001001275650001701285650001901302650001901321650001601340650001701356650001601373650002901389650004601418650001201464650002801476650001701504650003801521650002001559650001901579650005201598650005101650650002401701650001301725700001701738700001401755700001401769773011901783852000901902856008801911930003301999945002502032946001102057655001202068IND4399418120221118214713.0071227e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439941812DNAL7 a173744262pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2007.01.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF6001 aWittmann, C.10aEffects of ozone impact on the gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence of juvenile birch stems (Betula pendula Roth.)  ap. 258-266.  aIncludes references  aEffects of ozone impact on gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence of juvenile birch (Betula pendula) stems and leaves were investigated. Significant differences in the response of leaves and stems to ozone were found. In leaves, O3 exposure led to a significant decline in photosynthetic rates, whereas stems revealed an increased dark respiration and a concomitant increase in corticular photosynthesis. In contrast to birch leaves, corticular photosynthesis appeared to support the carbon balance of stems or even of the whole-tree under O3 stress. The differences in the ozone-response between leaves and stems were found to be related to ozone uptake rates, and thus to inherent differences in leaf and stem O3 conductance. Leaves of birch were more affected by ozone fumigation than corresponding stems, due to a higher ozone uptake rate. 3aair pollution 3aozone 3aBetula pendula 3aleaves 3astems 3agas exchange 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant pigments 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3atree growth 2aAir Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aBetulaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aFluorescence 2aOxidants, Photochemicalxtoxicity 2aOzonextoxicity 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stemsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Transpiration 2aSunlight1 aMatyssek, R.1 aPfanz, H.1 aHumar, M.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2007 Nov., v. 150, no. 2 p.258-266dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2007.01.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20080219b20080301c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/02/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02069naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245012600140300001600266520115600282650002801438650001001466650000901476650001801485650001401503651001401517653002301531700001901554700002301573773008401596852000901680939003301689945000801722946001301730655001201743991559897890742620221118213322.0930610e199304  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930018712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelazquez, L. del C.10aBiovars, serovars, and phagovars of Yersinia enterocolitica isolated from 450 samples of cold food in San Luis, Argentina  ap. 333-335.  aA search of Yersinia enterocolitica in foods of animal origin has been carried out. Isolates were obtained from 450 samples of cold foods: 100 samples of cooked ham, 150 samples of salami, 100 samples of porcine cheese (artisan cold foods), and 100 samples of mortadella. Enrichments were performed in 0.067 M phosphate buffered saline solutions, pH 7.6, containing 1% sorbitol and 0.15% biliary salts. The samples were postenriched in 0.5% KOH. Subcultures were done in Salmonella-Shigella agar and MacConkey agar. Isolates were identified through biochemical, serological, and phagotyping methods. The following biovars (B), serovars (0), and phagovars (Lis) were isolated from cooked ham B2 0:9 Lis X3 (1%), from salami B1 0:5 Lis X(Z) and B2 0:9 Lis X3 (1.33%), from porcine cheese B2 0:9 Lis X3 (2%), and from mortadella (O%). Virulence tests (calcium dependent growth at 37 degrees C and autoagglutination activity at 37 degrees C) were always negative. Serovar B2 0:9 Lis X3 associated with human disease was isolated. It is concluded from the results of this study that Y. enterocolitica isolates from cold foods lack of pathogenic importance. 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3afoods 3acold 3aculture media 3avirulence 3aArgentina 0aculture techniques1 aEscudero, M.E.1 aGuzman, A.M.S. de.0 tJournal of food protection.g1993 Apr., v. 56, no. 4 p.333-335x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02947naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100001400194245010600208300001600314500002400330520102600354650001601380650001801396650001001414650001301424650001301437650001801450650002001468650001601488650001601504650001501520650001601535650002401551650001401575650001801589650002901607650003501636650004601671650002701717650003801744650002101782650003101803650003801834650002001872650002901892650002901921651001301950651001301963700001701976700001901993773011902012852000902131856008802140930003302228945002502261946001102286655001202297IND4399418220221118214653.0071227e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439941822DNAL7 a173793642pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2007.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF841 0aF1201 aIshii, S.10aPhytotoxic risk assessment of ambient air pollution on agricultural crops in Selangor State, Malaysia  ap. 267-279.  aIncludes references  aThe phytotoxic risk of ambient air pollution to local vegetation was assessed in Selangor State, Malaysia. The AOT40 value was calculated by means of the continuously monitored daily maximum concentration and the local diurnal pattern of O3. Together with minor risks associated with the levels of NO2 and SO2, the study found that the monthly AOT40 values in these peri-urban sites were consistently over 1.0 ppm·h, which is well in exceedance of the given European critical level. Linking the O3 level to actual agricultural crop production in Selangor State also indicated that the extent of yield losses could have ranged from 1.6 to 5.0% (by weight) in 2000. Despite a number of uncertainties, the study showed a simple but useful methodological framework for phytotoxic risk assessment with a limited data set, which could contribute to appropriate policy discussion and countermeasures in countries under similar conditions.

The distribution of pelagic cnidarians was closely related to the presence of the shelf-slope front with most species mainly concentrated close to the front. Meroplanktonic antho- and leptomedusae predominated in coastal waters and more holoplanktonic trachy- and narcomedusae occurred both in shelf and open sea waters. P. noctiluca was more abundant than other medusae, including hydromedusae. Siphonophores, particularly Muggiaea atlantica, outnumbered medusae at most stations. The diet of P. noctiluca ephyrae contained mainly copepods, but ~12% of the prey were fish larvae. P. noctiluca exhibited positive prey selection for chaetognaths and mollusc larvae in day and night samples, but fish larvae were positively selected only at night. These differences may be related to the diel vertical distributions of P. noctiluca and their prey. Most of the ingested fish larvae belonged to the family Myctophidae, but anchovy and sparid larvae also were found in the gastric pouches. The size of ingested fish larvae increased as ephyra diameter increased; however, in the larger medusae (>12 mm) the number of prey increased with medusa size rather than the size of the larvae. The temporal and spatial co-occurrence of P. noctiluca with early life stages of fish suggests that P. noctiluca may be an important predator on summer ichthyoplankton. 3aCnidaria 3aanchovies 3acoastal water 3adiet 3afish larvae 3afisheries 3aichthyoplankton 3amolluscs 3aoceans 3apouches 3apredators 3aseawater 3aspring 3asummer 3aMediterranean Sea1 aPagès, Francesc1 aAtienza, Dacha1 aFuentes, Verónica1 aPurcell, J.

However, recent studies have suggested that epigenetic mechanisms may also influence the onset of ageing-associated diseases and longevity. Epigenetics is defined as processes that induce heritable changes in gene expression without a change in the DNA nucleotide sequence. The major epigenetic mechanisms are DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA. Such processes are involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression, cell differentiation and genomic imprinting. However, epigenetic dysregulation is frequently seen with ageing. Relatively little is known about the factors that initiate such changes. However, there is emerging evidence that the early life environment, in particular nutrition, in early life can induce long-term changes in DNA methylation resulting in an altered susceptibility to a range of ageing-associated diseases. In this review, we will focus on the changes in DNA methylation that occur during ageing; their role in the ageing process and how early life nutrition can modulate DNA methylation and influence longevity. Understanding the mechanisms by which diet in early life can influence the epigenome will be crucial for the development of preventative and intervention strategies to increase well-being in later life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3acell differentiation 3adiet 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenomic imprinting 3agenotype 3ahistones 3alongevity 3anon-coding RNA 3anucleotide sequences 0aEpigenetics 0aDNA methylation 0aAgeing 0aDevelopmental origins of adult disease 0aNutrition1 aHoile, Samuel P.1 aGrenfell, Leonie1 aBurdge, Graham C.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2014 Aug., v. 73, no. 3 p.413-421dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651140000813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04010naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002600169245008800195300001600283500001500299520152600314592002801840650001301868650002601881650001301907650003501920650001501955650001101970650001401981650001201995650001702007650002202024650003102046650002502077650001002102650001302112650001702125650001602142650007002158650002602228650004502254650002002299650001702319650004002336650008602376650001502462650003202477650004202509650003302551650004502584650005602629650002402685650004902709653001902758653001402777653002502791653002502816653001902841653002002860653001702880700001802897700002002915700002202935700002002957700002302977700002203000773012403022856008503146852000903231655001203240IND60113916620221116152144.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011391662DNAL7 a238458252pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLovisetto, Alessandro10aCharacterization of a bZIP gene highly expressed during ripening of the peach fruit  ap. 462-470.  a2019-12-04  aA ripening specific bZIP gene of peach was studied by ectopically expressing it in tomato. Two lines, with either a mild or a strong phenotype, respectively, were analyzed in detail. Transgenic fruit morphology was normal, yet the time spent to proceed through the various ripening stages was longer compared to wild type. In agreement with this finding the transgenic berries produced less ethylene, and also had a modified expression of some ripening-related genes that was particularly evident in berries with a strong phenotype. In particular, in the latter fruits polygalacturonase and lipoxygenase genes, but also genes coding for transcription factors (TFs) important for tomato ripening (i.e. TAGL1, CNR, APETALA2a, NOR) did not show the expected decreased expression in the red berries. As regards the RIN gene, its expression continued to increase in both mild and strong lines, and this is in agreement with the dilated ripening times. Interestingly, a metabolomic analysis of berries at various stages of ripening showed that the longer time spent by the transgenic berries to proceed from a stage to another was not due to a slackened metabolism. In fact, the differences in amount of stage-specific marker metabolites indicated that the transgenic berries had a very active metabolism. Therefore, the dilated ripening and the enhanced metabolism of the berries over-expressing the bZIP gene suggest that such gene might regulate ripening by acting as a pacemaker for some of the ripening metabolic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors 3aethylene 3agenetically modified organisms 3ametabolism 3afruits 3aphenotype 3apeaches 3asmall fruits 3apolygalacturonase 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3abiochemical pathways 3agenes 3aripening 3ametabolomics 3ametabolites 2aBasic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aFruitxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Plant 2aLipoxygenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSolanum lycopersicumxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMetabolome 2aPlant Developmentxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPolygalacturonasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPrunusxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aPrunus persica 0abZIP gene 0aSolanum lycopersicon 0aMetabolomic analysis 0aFruit ripening 0aGene expression 0alipoxygenase1 aGuzzo, Flavia1 aTadiello, Alice1 aConfortin, Enrico1 aPavanello, Anna1 aBotton, Alessandro1 aCasadoro, Giorgio0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2013 Sept., v. 70 p.462-470dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008500165300001800250520200900268592002802277650001202305650001102317650000902328650002502337650001602362651001002378700001402388700001502402773012702417856008202544852000902626655001202635IND60579788520221120192517.0180619e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057978852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-016-3409-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhter, Javed10aCMIP5 ensemble-based spatial rainfall projection over homogeneous zones of India  ap. 1885-1916.  aPerformances of the state-of-the-art CMIP5 models in reproducing the spatial rainfall patterns over seven homogeneous rainfall zones of India viz. North Mountainous India (NMI), Northwest India (NWI), North Central India (NCI), Northeast India (NEI), West Peninsular India (WPI), East Peninsular India (EPI) and South Peninsular India (SPI) have been assessed using different conventional performance metrics namely spatial correlation (R), index of agreement (d-index), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Ratio of RMSE to the standard deviation of the observations (RSR) and mean bias (MB). The results based on these indices revealed that majority of the models are unable to reproduce finer-scaled spatial patterns over most of the zones. Thereafter, four bias correction methods i.e. Scaling, Standardized Reconstruction, Empirical Quantile Mapping and Gamma Quantile Mapping have been applied on GCM simulations to enhance the skills of the GCM projections. It has been found that scaling method compared to other three methods shown its better skill in capturing mean spatial patterns. Multi-model ensemble (MME) comprising 25 numbers of better performing bias corrected (Scaled) GCMs, have been considered for developing future rainfall patterns over seven zones. Models’ spread from ensemble mean (uncertainty) has been found to be larger in RCP 8.5 than RCP4.5 ensemble. In general, future rainfall projections from RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 revealed an increasing rainfall over seven zones during 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The maximum increase has been found over southwestern part of NWI (12–30%), northwestern part of WPI (3–30%), southeastern part of NEI (5–18%) and northern and eastern part of SPI (6–24%). However, the contiguous region comprising by the southeastern part of NCI and northeastern part of EPI, may experience slight decreasing rainfall (about 3%) during 2020s whereas the western part of NMI may also receive around 3% reduction in rainfall during both 2050s and 2080s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3amodels 3arain 3astatistical analysis 3auncertainty 3aIndia1 aDas, Lalu1 aDeb, Argha0 tClimate dynamics.g2017 Sept., v. 49, no. 5-6 p.1885-1916dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3409-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012700176300001600303520117700319536027701496592002801773596007301801596004201874596005501916650001801971650002401989650001702013650001202030650001902042650001102061650002302072650002102095650002002116650001302136650001702149650004102166650000902207650001702216650001902233650002002252651001502272653002202287653001702309653000802326653000902334653001602343653001602359700003702375700002502412700002702437700002402464700002502488700002302513700002402536773011602560856008502676852000902761655001202770IND60682516920221119030532.0200128e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068251692DNAL7 a10.1080/01490451.2019.16669382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Md.

Plants can assimilate significant quantities of As on a daily basis. Consumption of rice contaminated with As from soil and irrigation water can elevate the daily As intake in humans. In this study, we aimed to identify indigenous As-tolerant bacteria with the ability to use different carbon and nitrogen sources to enhance plant growth through siderophore and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) formation, and with the ability to absorb, store, transform, and remediate As. Three As-tolerant plant growth-promoting bacteria were isolated: Bacillus sp. (GIS1) (MG203916), Acinetobacter sp. (GIS3) (MG203917), and Acinetobacter sp. (GIS5) (MG203918). They were confirmed by 16s rDNA sequencing and scanning electron microscopy. The bacteria showed a positive response to plant growth and As absorbing capacity. Especially, strain GIS1 (MG203916) and GIS 3(MG203917) showed a great potential for the bioremediation of As pollution, which might have potential agricultural and microbiological implications.  aThis study was partly supported by the R&D Project of Ministry of Science and Technology MOST), Bangladesh, and Jashore University of Science and Technology (JUST), Bangladesh.

Therefore, there is a need of an objective methodology helping researchers in their decisions during cluster analysis. The objective of this study was to use such a methodology based on stability of clustering solutions to select the most appropriate clustering method and number of clusters for describing dietary patterns in the NESCAV study (Nutrition, Environment and Cardiovascular Health), a large population-based cross-sectional study in the Greater Region (N = 2298). METHODS: Clustering solutions were obtained with K-means, K-medians and Ward’s method and a number of clusters varying from 2 to 6. Their stability was assessed with three indices: adjusted Rand index, Cramer’s V and misclassification rate. RESULTS: The most stable solution was obtained with K-means method and a number of clusters equal to 3. The “Convenient” cluster characterized by the consumption of convenient foods was the most prevalent with 46% of the population having this dietary behaviour. In addition, a “Prudent” and a “Non-Prudent” patterns associated respectively with healthy and non-healthy dietary habits were adopted by 25% and 29% of the population. The “Convenient” and “Non-Prudent” clusters were associated with higher cardiovascular risk whereas the “Prudent” pattern was associated with a decreased cardiovascular risk. Associations with others factors showed that the choice of a specific dietary pattern is part of a wider lifestyle profile. CONCLUSION: This study is of interest for both researchers and public health professionals. From a methodological standpoint, we showed that using stability of clustering solutions could help researchers in their choices. From a public health perspective, this study showed the need of targeted health promotion campaigns describing the benefits of healthy dietary patterns.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acluster analysis 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3afoods 3ahealth promotion 3alifestyle 3anutrition 3arisk1 aSchritz, Anna1 aLeite, Sonia1 aAlkerwi, Ala’a1 aStranges, Saverio1 aZannad, F.q(Faiez),1 aStreel, Sylvie1 aHoge, Axelle1 aDonneau, Anne-Françoise1 aAlbert, Adelin1 aGuillaume, M.

In the present explorative study (questionnaire survey), we evaluate the perception and level of awareness of three stakeholder groups with a good knowledge on CE concept and governance of the transition process, specifically: Researchers, Economists, and Administrators. The three samples contain stakeholders from EU and non-EU countries.We developed primarily a comprehensive literature review on CE perceptions and awareness useful for the design of the questionnaire, the comparison of the results and in overall for creating a wider framework of analysis and interpretation of the current CE transition. The questionnaire has been tested on one of the three samples (Researchers) and then replicated on the other two ones (Economists and Administrators). The results of the survey shows that the three groups perceive CE as a “zero waste economy” (Administrators) and in wider terms as a model for re-design our present state of economy and society in a more regenerative manner (Researchers and Economists). Administrators seem more focused on utilizing CE for economic growth and job creation while Researchers and Economists mainly expect receiving environmental benefits from the CE transition. The three groups share a common vision of CE at its initial stage of the transition process in agree with the relevant literature. In that, a more successful advance of CE depends on the governance of the process by key actors and instruments. Researchers emphasize a more holistic top-down approach while Economists and Administrators expect a bottom-up approach guided by the civil society (companies and citizens/consumers). However, these results complement each other's as all the actors are relevant for fostering CE and a mixed set of instruments is needed. Moreover, given that implementation of CE is costly for consumers and companies, the political intervention has a leading role in this initial phase also in disseminating a positive and sustainable image of CE concept and model. At this regard the support of CE research to such intervention is highly important to develop a CE path in line with all the three principles of sustainable development, the desired outcome of the society and capable of facing the current unprecedent environmental challenges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular economy 3aclimate change 3agovernance 3apolitics 3aquestionnaires 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3azero wastes 0aPerception 0aAwareness 0aTransition 0aQuestionnaire survey 0aInformation1 aVassillo, Chiara1 aGhisellini, Patrizia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4395-13781 aRestaino, Daniela1 aPassaro, Renato1 aUlgiati, Sergio0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Sept. 20, v. 316 p.128166-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1281663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009900164500002200263520144200285592002801727650002101755650001501776650002801791650001201819650001601831650002501847650001001872650001901882650002301901650000901924650001301933650002001946650002101966650003901987653001002026653002302036653002402059653003102083700001402114700001502128700001802143700001702161700001902178700001402197700001602211700001602227700001702243700001702260700001402277700001602291773009702307856008202404852000902486655001202495IND60584095020221122030251.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058409502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.09.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Haojie10aLiver-specific deletion of LASS2 delayed regeneration of mouse liver after partial hepatectomy  aPre-press version  aThe capacity of liver regeneration is critical for patients with liver diseases. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver regeneration are still incompletely defined. Here, we assessed roles of LASS2 in liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy (PHx) in mice. Our results showed that protein level of LASS2 remarkably increased during liver regeneration after PHx in wildtype (WT) mice. Comparing to WT mice, liver regeneration index after PHx was significantly decreased from day 1 to day 5 in liver-specific LASS2 knockout (LASS2-LKO) mice. Interestingly, liver mass of LASS2-LKO mice could sufficiently recover at day 14 after PHx. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analyses revealed that proliferation markers, such as PCNA and Ki67, were potently reduced during liver regeneration in LASS2-LKO mice. In addition, several cell cycle related molecules, such as cyclin A, CDK2 and p-Rb, were decreased in LASS2-LKO mice after PHx. Co-immunoprecipitation assay further revealed a decreased formation of CDK4/cyclin D1 complex after PHx in LASS2-LKO mice. However, phosphorylation of Akt was significantly activated from day 2 after PHx in LASS2-LKO mice when compared with that in WT mice, which may explain the recovery of liver mass at the late stage of liver regeneration in LASS2-LKO mice. Taken together, we conclude that LASS2 plays an important role in efficient liver regeneration in response to PHx.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3acell cycle 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3ahepatectomy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3aliver regeneration 3amice 3apatients 3aphosphorylation 3aprecipitin tests 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 0aLASS2 0aLiver regeneration 0aPartial hepatectomy 0aHepatocellular hypertrophy1 aWang, Cun1 aGu, Dishui1 aZhang, Yurong1 aFan, Shaohua1 aXing, Shunpeng1 aWang, Hui1 aRuan, Haoyu1 aYang, Cheng1 aLv, Yuanyuan1 aFeng, Hugang1 aYao, Ming1 aQin, Wenxin0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.09.1283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03624naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245011600215300001200331520178000343592002802123596002902151650002502180650001802205650002102223650001202244650002102256650000902277650001602286650001602302650001802318650002302336650002902359650001102388650001902399650002002418650001402438650002502452650002802477650001902505650003302524650001102557651001102568700006602579700007302645700007402718700007702792773013302869856008303002852000903085655001203094IND60792822620221118042126.0221001e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079282262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-022-03298-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelarde-Guillén, José1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0801-522610aCharacterisation of landrace ‘criollo’ maize silage from the highlands of Mexico in terms of starch content  ap. 283.  aMaize silage is appreciated for dairy cows due to its high energy content. Mexico is a centre of origin for maize and small-scale dairy farmers use landrace ‘criollo’ maize silages to feed their herds. However, the characteristics of landrace ‘criollo’ maize silages in terms of starch content, which defines their nutritional value in terms of energy, are not known. The objective was to characterise criollo maize silages in terms of starch content. Seventy-seven silage samples from 2011 to 2015 were analysed for contents of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), crude protein (CP), in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), and starch content. A factor analysis using principal component analysis as an extraction method was undertaken, and a hierarchical cluster analysis performed. Five factors affected the starch content of silages and five maize silage clusters identified. There was a positive association between IVDMD and metabolisable energy and between crude protein and acid detergent fibre; moreover, a positive relation was found between dry matter and maize starch contents. Significant differences were found (P < 0.001) for the contents of IVDMD, ME, ashes, OM, DM, and starch. The DM content of group 1 silage did not show any significant differences from other groups, except with group 2 silage, which had the lowest contents of DM and starch. Therefore, group 1 and 5 silage had the highest DM and starch contents, while group 3 silage had the highest IVDMD values and ME contents; finally, group 4 had the highest ash contents. Starch content in criollo maize silages was higher that reports for other maize races and is influenced by climate conditions and dry matter content.  aPublisher supplied data  aPN-2016-1-23-23cCONACYT 3aacid detergent fiber 3aanimal health 3acenter of origin 3aclimate 3acluster analysis 3acorn 3acorn silage 3acorn starch 3acrude protein 3adry matter content 3adry matter digestibility 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3afactor analysis 3alandraces 3ametabolizable energy 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aorganic matter 3aprincipal component analysis 3astarch 3aMexico1 aSainz-Ramírez, Aurora1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8566-86531 aCelis-Álvarez, María Danaee1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8903-82211 aArriaga-Jordán, Carlos Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6140-08471 aMartínez-García, Carlos Galdino1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9924-33760 tTropical animal health and production.g2022 Oct., v. 54, no. 5 p.283-283dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-022-03298-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014200168300001800310520134700328592002801675650001901703650001601722650002401738650001701762650001501779650001701794650001101811650001201822650001401834650001401848650001801862650001701880650001101897650001401908700002001922700002301942700002201965700001901987700002002006700001802026700003002044773011602074856008102190852000902271655001202280IND60120185020221120105206.0150129e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012018502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-014-8331-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWitting, Michael10aDI-ICR-FT-MS-based high-throughput deep metabotyping: a case study of the Caenorhabditis elegans–Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection model  ap. 1059-1073.  aIn metabolomics there is an ever-growing need for faster and more comprehensive analysis methods to cope with the increasing size of biological studies. Direct-infusion ion-cyclotron-resonance Fourier-transform spectrometry (DI-ICR-FT-MS) is used in non-targeted metabolomics to obtain high-resolution snapshots of the metabolic state of a system. We applied this technology to a Caenorhabditis elegans–Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection model and optimized times needed for cultivation and mass-spectrometric analysis. Our results reveal that DI-ICR-FT-MS is a promising tool for high-throughput in-depth non-targeted metabolomics. We performed whole-worm metabolomics and recovered markers of the induced metabolic changes in C. elegans brought about by interaction with pathogens. In this investigation, we reveal complex metabolic phenotypes enabling clustering based upon challenge. Specifically, we observed a marked decrease in amino-acid metabolism with infection by P. aeruginosa and a marked increase in sugar metabolism with infection by Salmonella enterica. We were also able to discriminate between infection with a virulent wild-type Pseudomonas and with an attenuated mutant, making it possible to use this method in larger genetic screens to identify host and pathogen effectors affecting the metabolic phenotype of infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis 3aPseudomonas 3aSalmonella enterica 3acase studies 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3amodels 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3asalmonellosis 3aspectroscopy 3asugars 3avirulence1 aLucio, Marianna1 aTziotis, Dimitrios1 aWägele, Brigitte1 aSuhre, Karsten1 aVoulhoux, Romé1 aGarvis, Steve1 aSchmitt-Kopplin, Philippe0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 Feb., v. 407, no. 4 p.1059-1073dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-8331-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016300167300001200330520168000342592002802022650001302050650001302063650001302076650002702089650002902116650001602145650003002161650002202191650000902213650001402222650001402236650000902250650001402259650001802273650002102291650002102312650002402333650001102357650001002368650001202378650001802390650001702408650001802425650001002443651002102453700002402474700002202498773013402520856008202654852000902736655001202745IND60477928320221119115424.0200701e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047792832DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-015-4986-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYolcubal, Irfan10aAssessment of impact of environmental pollution on groundwater and surface water qualities in a heavily industrialized district of Kocaeli (Dilovası), Turkey  ap. 170.  aThe impact of uncontrolled industrialization and urbanization on surface water and groundwater qualities was assessed in a heavily industrialized district of Kocaeli (Turkey) considering source, types and levels of contaminants. A sampling campaign was conducted on both water bodies in dry (September) and wet (May) sampling periods. Water samples were taken from 6 surface water stations and 24 wells distributed from upstream to downstream along Dil stream to determine the degree of deterioration in water quality from background conditions. Results showed that Dil stream was heavily polluted with regard to many parameters including Al, Fe, Mn, Pb, DO, COD, NH₄, NO₂ and PO₄. While sewage discharges, leachates from closed wild landfill and quarries create sources of contamination for Dil stream at upstream, primarily metal industries (mainly iron and steel manufacturing) at downstream contribute markedly to the metal contamination. Contribution of highly polluted Dil stream to the groundwater contamination is also significant in the alluvium aquifer at both upstream and downstream of Dil stream. Microbial pollution indicating fecal contamination and high nutrient levels exist in the groundwater. In addition, relatively high AOX concentrations over background levels were detected in wells at the downstream part of Dil stream where industrial activities were densely distributed. Deep wells located near the Gulf of İzmit were also affected by seawater intrusion. Results suggest that Dil stream contaminated by industrial discharges, sewages, and leachates from old wild landfill negatively influences the groundwater quality in the alluvial aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvium 3aaluminum 3aaquifers 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenvironmental assessment 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aindustrialization 3airon 3alandfills 3aleachates 3alead 3amanganese 3amanufacturing 3anitrogen dioxide 3anutrient content 3asaltwater intrusion 3asewage 3asteel 3astreams 3asurface water 3aurbanization 3awater quality 3awells 3aTurkey (country)1 aGündüz, Özge Can1 aSönmez, Fatmanur0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Jan., v. 75, no. 2 p.170-170dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4986-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04252naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100002200175245014800197300001600345520210100361592002802462650003902490650001902529650001102548650001902559650001802578650002002596650001002616650002502626650001102651650001802662650002302680650001202703650001202715650001202727650003302739650001202772650004102784650002302825650004202848650004002890650003402930650004102964650001103005650003603016650004903052650003303101650002903134650003203163650005003195650001703245650004103262700002403303700002303327700001403350700001803364700001703382773009003399856009203489852000903581655001203590IND4450087920221118105926.0141111e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445008792DNAL7 a211960292pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArias-Alvarez, M.10aEffect of leptin supplementation during in vitro oocyte maturation and embryo culture on bovine embryo development and gene expression patterns  ap. 887-896.  aLeptin is a metabolic hormone related to body condition and nutritional status that influences fertility in assisted reproductive technologies modulating oocyte and embryo quality. The aim of the present study was to establish the effect of various leptin concentrations (0, 10, 100 ng/mL) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) and in vitro embryo culture (IVC) on bovine embryo development and quality in terms of gene expression. The relative mRNA abundance of the genes encoding solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter) member 1 (SLC2A1), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), placenta-specific 8 (PLAC8), aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B1 (AKR1B1) and leptin receptor (LEPR) were determined on Day 7 blastocysts by qRT-PCR. Cleavage rate (P < 0.005) and blastocyst yield (P = 0.05) was significantly lower when cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured with 100 ng/mL leptin compared to 0 or 10 ng/mL leptin. No significant effect of different concentrations of leptin added during IVC on blastocyst yield was observed. The presence of 100 ng/mL leptin in both IVM and IVC further decreased cleavage rate (P < 0.005) and blastocyst yield compared to the control group without leptin (P = 0.05) and those supplemented with 10 ng/mL leptin or FCS (P < 0.005). There was no evidence of any leptin-induced difference in the relative transcript abundance of SLC2A1, BAX and PLAC8 genes in Day 7 blastocysts. Expression of AKR1B1 was significantly lower in blastocysts from COCs matured with 100 ng/mL leptin compared to those matured with 0 or 10 ng/mL leptin (P < 0.005). LEPR expression was up regulated when leptin concentration was increased from 0 ng/mL during IVM to 10 ng/mL during IVC, but it was down-regulated in the opposite situation (P < 0.005). In conclusion, high leptin concentrations possibly related to obesity seem to be more detrimental rather than the absence of this hormone for preimplantation embryo survival; this effect is independent of LEPR gene expression and it does not influence expression of SLC2A1, BAX and PLAC8 genes in Day 7 blastocysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3abody condition 3acattle 3aembryo culture 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose transporters 3aleptin 3amessenger RNA 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3aoocytes 3asolutes 2aAldehyde Reductasexgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxchemistryxdrug effects. 2aCattlexembryology 2aEmbryo Culture Techniquesxveterinary 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effects 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGlucose Transporter Type 1xgenetics 2aHumans 2aLeptinxadministration & dosage 2aOocytesxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aPregnancy Proteinsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReceptors, Leptinxgenetics 2aRecombinant Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aTime Factors 2abcl-2-Associated X Proteinxgenetics1 aBermejo-Alvarez, P.1 aGutierrez-Adan, A.1 aRizos, D.1 aLorenzo, P.L.1 aLonergan, P.0 tTheriogenology.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 75, no. 5 p.887-896dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01303naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006100137245012700198300001600325520029200341592002800633650001500661650001200676650001100688650001400699650001600713650001300729650001900742651002100761773012600782856007200908852000900980655001200989IND60648565820221119234342.0190706e20190531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064856582DNAL7 a10.1071/SB180122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenter, Stephanus1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5272-017910aPsychotria corrugata (Rubiaceae, Psychotrieae), a new species from the Hindenburg Wall, Western Province, Papua New Guinea  ap. 134-138.  aPsychotria corrugata S.Venter is newly described from the Hindenburg Wall area in the Star Mountains of Papua New Guinea.

The copolymers exhibit reversible sol–gel phase transition behavior in aqueous media. The sol-to-gel transition temperature (Tₛₒₗ–gₑₗ) can be shifted in the range of 20–80 °C, by varying monomer ratio and feeding glycerol content, by adjusting the copolymer concentration in aqueous solution, by tuning the pH of the solution, or by adding various divalent metal ions. Metal ion sensors were designed upon an inverse opal photonic film loaded with aqueous solution of poly(VI-co-MAA), which allows the easy reorganization of various divalent metal ions by combining the diversity of Tₛₒₗ–gₑₗ of the copolymers on different metal ions and flexible reflection spectra of the film. In addition, a fluorescent reversible sol–gel transition system was established by in situ generation of nanocrystals in the copolymer matrix. These extensions may provide the multiresponsive copolymers great flexibility for applications in biomedical, optical, and sensory fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acomposite polymers 3adivalent metals 3afluorescence 3agels 3aglycerol 3ametal ions 3ananocrystals 3apH 3aphase transition 3aphotons 3atemperature1 aWang, Cai-Feng1 aZhang, Jing1 aChen, Su0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Mar. 11, v. 47, no. 5 p.1875-1881dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma402424f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245013000190300001600320520175700336592002802093650002102121650002002142650001902162650001902181650001502200650001202215650001102227650001902238650002002257650001602277650001902293650002702312650002202339650001102361650002002372650002602392650001202418650002302430650001202453650005802465650002102523700002002544700002202564700002302586700002002609700002202629700002202651773010602673856005502779852000902834655001202843IND4468757620221119132336.0120710e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446875762DNAL7 a221503992pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01553.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaul, Nigel D.10aEcological responses to UV radiation: interactions between the biological effects of UV on plants and on associated organisms  ap. 565-581.  aSolar ultraviolet (UV)‐B radiation (280–315 nm) has a wide range of effects on terrestrial ecosystems, yet our understanding of how UV‐B influences the complex interactions of plants with pest, pathogen and related microorganisms remains limited. Here, we report the results of a series of experiments in Lactuca sativa which aimed to characterize not only key plant responses to UV radiation in a field environment but also consequential effects for plant interactions with a sap‐feeding insect, two model plant pathogens and phylloplane microorganism populations. Three spectrally modifying filters with contrasting UV transmissions were used to filter ambient sunlight, and when compared with our UV‐inclusive filter, L. sativa plants grown in a zero UV‐B environment showed significantly increased shoot fresh weight, reduced foliar pigment concentrations and suppressed population growth of green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Plants grown under a filter which allowed partial transmission of UV‐A radiation and negligible UV‐B transmission showed increased density of leaf surface phylloplane microbes compared with the UV‐inclusive treatment. Effects of UV treatment on the severity of two plant pathogens, Bremia lactucae and Botrytis cinerea, were complex as both the UV‐inclusive and zero UV‐B filters reduced the severity of pathogen persistence. These results are discussed with reference to known spectral responses of plants, insects and microorganisms, and contrasted with established fundamental responses of plants and other organisms to solar UV radiation, with particular emphasis on the need for future integration between different experimental approaches when investigating the effects of solar UV radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aBremia lactucae 3aLactuca sativa 3aMyzus persicae 3aecosystems 3afilters 3aleaves 3amicroorganisms 3aplant pathogens 3aplant pests 3aplant response 3aplant-insect relations 3apopulation growth 3ashoots 3asolar radiation 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aEcology 2aLettucexparasitologyxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aMoore, Jason P.1 aMcPherson, Martin1 aLambourne, Cathryn1 aCroft, Patricia1 aHeaton, Joanna C.1 aWargent, Jason J.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2012 Aug., v. 145, no. 4 p.565-581dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2011.01553.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009800167300001600265520151900281592002801800650001201828650001201840650003201852650002601884650000901910650001901919650001701938650001001955650000901965650001201974650001401986650001202000650001202012700002202024700002102046700002102067700002102088700002302109700002202132773012802154856008102282852000902363655001202372IND60662421820221117230634.0190904e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066242182DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674190401042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarzanov, N.

The new diagnostic method to identify the polymorphic gene of the bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP-15) influencing prolificacy in the Romanov sheep has been proposed based on the surveys. The frequencies of occurrence of the normal (wild-type) and mutant alleles and the genotypes present at a locus responsible for prolificacy in sheep are revealed. The quantitative indicators, including the numbers of lambs at birth and at weaning and the barren and culled ewes, were recorded with taking into consideration the genotypes at the BMP-15 locus. The correlation between the frequency of occurrence and the number of the produced posterity and among the barren and culled Romanov ewes were ascertained. It was indicated that the highest percentage of the lamb output at birth and at weaning was typical for the ewes homozygous (MM) for a mutant allele. The animals referred to as heterozygous genotypes (WM) appeared in the second position. The highest percentage of the culled and barren ewes was recorded in the carriers of the WW homozygote. Based on the obtained results, it has been concluded that the genotypes at the BMP15 locus should be taken into consideration when selecting the ewes with regard to their fertility. However, further researches into the determined phenomenon in the Romanov sheep are required to improve this performance, since multifetal pregnancies in some WW-group ewes have been registered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRomanov 3aalleles 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3adiagnostic techniques 3aewes 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3alambs 3aloci 3amutants 3apregnancy 3asurveys 3aweaning1 aMaluchenko, O.

They support a rich collection of endemic flora and fauna. Here, morphological and molecular data are employed to describe a new species, Chloris circumfontinalis Fahey & Fensham, endemic to artesian spring systems in central Queensland. A morphological ordination failed to distinguish this species from other Australian native flora, but the shape of the florets distinguishes it from the species with which it co-occurs. Phylogenies estimated from molecular data showed that the species represents a distinct lineage that may be sister to species of Chloris from outside Australia. Chloris circumfontinalis occurs only in the saline scalds that form around the springs, and population surveys at the two sites where it occurs indicated a threat status of Endangered under the IUCN Red List criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChloris 3adry environmental conditions 3afauna 3aflora 3aflorets 3ahabitats 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aplant taxonomy 3asprings (water) 3asurveys 3aQueensland 0aChloridoideae 0aendangered plants1 aFensham, Roderick J.1 aLaffineur, Boris1 aCook, Lyn G.0 tAustralian systematic botany.g2019, v. 32, no. 3 p.228-242dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl43314x1030-18877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SB180173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04087naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003400135040001800169100002400187245011400211300001200325506007600337520217600413592002802589506003702617650000802654650002402662650002502686650001802711650001502729650001702744650001602761650002002777650001202797650001502809650001302824650003802837650001002875650002002885650003102905650001202936650004102948650001002989650001602999650001703015650002203032650000903054650001703063650001003080700001903090700002403109700003503133700002203168700002303190700002703213773013103240856008103371852000903452655001203461IND60555600920221207125913.0220810e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055560092DNAL7 a229671652pmid7 aPMC34933842pmcid7 a10.1186/1472-6882-12-1522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShuid, Ahmad Nazrun10aEurycoma longifolia upregulates osteoprotegerin gene expression in androgen- deficient osteoporosis rat model  ap. 152.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Eurycoma longifolia (EL) has been shown recently to protect against bone calcium loss in orchidectomised rats, the model for androgen-deficient osteoporosis. The mechanism behind this is unclear but it may be related to its ability to elevate testosterone levels or it may directly affect bone remodeling. The aim of this study is to determine the mechanism involved by investigating the effects of EL extract on serum testosterone levels, bone biomarkers, biomechanical strength and gene expression of Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (MCSF) in orchidectomised rats. METHODS: Thirty-two male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into: Sham-operated group (SHAM); orchidectomised-control group (ORX); orchidectomised and given 15 mg/kg EL extract (ORX + EL) and orchidectomised and given 8 mg/kg testosterone (ORX + T). The rats were treated for 6 weeks. The serum levels of testosterone, osteocalcin and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were measured using the ELISA technique. The femoral bones were subjected to biomechanical testing. The tibial bone gene expressions of RANKL, OPG and MCSF were measured using the branch DNA technique. RESULTS: The post-treatment level of testosterone was found to be significantly reduced by orchiectomy (p < 0.05). Both ORX + EL and ORX + T groups have significantly higher post-treatment testosterone levels compared to their pre-treatment levels (p < 0.05). The bone resorption marker (CTx) was elevated after orchiectomy but was suppressed after treatment in the ORX + EL and ORX + T groups (p < 0.05). There was no significant finding for the femoral biomechanical parameters. The tibial OPG gene expression in the ORX group was significantly lower compared to the SHAM and ORX + EL groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with EL extract elevated the testosterone levels, reduced the bone resorption marker and upregulated OPG gene expression of the orchidectomised rats. These actions may be responsible for the protective effects of EL extract against bone resorption due to androgen deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aEurycoma longifolia 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3abiomechanics 3ablood serum 3abone resorption 3acalcium 3acastration 3acollagen 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afemur 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aligands 3amacrophage colony-stimulating factor 3amales 3aosteocalcin 3aosteoporosis 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atestosterone 3atibia1 aEl-arabi, Eman1 aEffendy, Nadia Mohd1 aRazak, Halimaton Saadiah Abdul1 aMuhammad, Norliza1 aMohamed, Norazlina1 aSoelaiman, Ima Nirwana0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2012 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.152-152dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-12-1523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001200161245007900173300001800252500000900270520171100279592002801990650002102018650001202039650001402051650000702065650001502072650001502087650001402102650001102116650002002127650001802147650002102165651001202186700003802198700002202236700001702258773015102275856009602426852000902522655001202531IND60668457920221119163741.0191125e198409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066845792DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1984.03615995004800050033x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBos, J.10aSpatial Variability for One Type of Phosphate Mine Land in Central Florida  ap. 1120-1125.  aepub  aSoil-plant interaction problems are frequently encountered in the reclaimed phosphate minelands of central Florida. To solve some of these problems, a knowledge of the soil properties and their spatial variability must be acquired. An optimum sampling design for reclaimed mine lands can only be constructed after this information is known. Therefore, selected soil properties of one type of reclaimed phosphate mine land (overburden over sandtailings) in central Florida were investigated. A 6 × 21 sampling grid with 10-m interval sampling points was constructed and soil samples (0–25 cm) were taken in four directions along selected transects. The results indicated that mean values were very high for total P (8.3 g/kg), extractable P (0.9 g/kg), and extractable Ca (2.3 g/kg) by the double acid method. The double acid method of extracting Ca, Mg, K, and Na yielded higher mean contents than the procedure using NH₄OAc at pH 7. Correlation coefficients were highly significant between both extractable Ca and Mg and total extractable bases. Higher r values were obtained using KCl-pH than H₂O-pH in studying the relationships of pH to the other soil properties except for total P. Semivariograms were calculated for the different soil properties studied in the four sampling directions. A composite semivariogram of all four directions was also constructed. Except for CEC and relative elevation, spatial correlation of all properties was encountered at sampling distances < 2.6 to 7.1 m. At a lag distance of six peak values occurred in several sampling directions for many of the soil properties studied. This indicates similar optimum sampling distances for the soil properties of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium acetate 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3apH 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asodium 3asoil properties 3asoil sampling 3atotal phosphorus 3aFlorida1 aCollins, M.

Recurrent sitting down and standing up or continuously sitting down produces a load at the seam line and causes transverse strain at stitch rows. Owing to this strain, displacement (seam slippage) of the stitch could occur, leading to opening in the fabric at the seam line. This study is focused on constructing a system which is based on a non-linear regression mathematical model to predict the seam opening properties of woven fabric within two different seam opening standard test methods. The first is the fixed load test method; the other is dynamic seam fatigue. The physical properties of the fabric and stitch density play important roles in the seam opening of the seat fabric. The number of weft yarns per unit length, yarn linear density and stitch density were selected as influential factors. The prediction equation is based on completely randomized variance analyses model. The coefficients of the curves fitted were computed by means of non-linear regression analysis. Regression coefficient (R ²) values for these curves were observed to be highly reliable at more than 0.9. Also the correlation coefficients (r) between actual and predicted values were very high at more than 0.96.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amathematical models 3aphysical properties 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3atextile fibers 3avariance 3awoven fabrics 3ayarns 0aseam opening 0aseam slippage strength 0aregression-based mathematical model 0adynamic seam fatigue 0afixed load seam opening method0 tTextile research journal.g2010 Mar., v. 80, no. 5 p.472-480dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175093553483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013000166300001400296520076600310592002801076650002401104650002701128650001501155650002301170650002001193650002401213650002101237650001501258650002201273650001301295650002401308650001301332650002101345653001301366653001801379653000801397653003201405653001901437700001801456700001701474700001701491773009401508856008201602852000901684655001201693IND60553397320221119002414.0161021e20141215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055339732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Lingyan10aFunctionalized graphene as sensitive electrochemical label in target-dependent linkage of split aptasensor for dual detection  ap. 52-58.  aA new type of electrochemical aptasensor was reported here for highly sensitive detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity using functionalized graphene as efficient electrochemical label. The specific binding of ATP and its aptamer could link the split aptamers modified graphene and magnetic beads together. After ADA catalysis and magnetic separation, graphene material anchored on electrode surface would efficiently facilitate electron transfer, thus produce detectable electrochemical signals. The detection limits for ATP and ADA activity were 13.6nM and 0.01unit/mL (~1.2nM), respectively.

Access to finance has therefore become central to climate change policy. In this Viewpoint we review likely climate investment needs and ask where the main financing gaps might be. We argue that besides the usual analysis of mitigation and adaptation needs, it is important to also gauge the ability of investors to mobilize the required funds. Some investors, whether public and private, will find it harder than others to raise capital, and so a rough picture is beginning to emerge about the financing gaps in mitigation and adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adeveloping countries 3afunding 3aissues and policy 0aadaptation financing 0aclimate change 0aclimate policy 0aclimate finance1 aSahni, Aditi1 aSavvas, Annie1 aWard, John0 tClimate and Development.g2016 May 26, v. 8, no. 3 p.203-206dTaylor & Francisx1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2015.10648113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245009900179300001600278500000900294520189800303592002802201650001502229650001802244650001502262650001702277650001502294650001102309650003102320650001302351650001902364650001802383650002002401650001702421650001502438650002302453650002302476651001902499700001802518700001902536773014802555856009602703852000902799655001202808IND60668458120221119163633.0191125e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066845812DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1991.03615995005500020032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Es, H.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of initial infiltration on eroded, cultivated Georgeville silt loam (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Hapludult) located in the Piedmont region of North Carolina. Small infiltration rings were used to obtain in situ estimates of sorptivity at 290 locations in a 2.2-ha field on each of three dates. Antecedent soil water content, particle-size distribution, color-development equivalent, and surface curvature were also measured. Sorptivity (initial infiltration) values were lognormally distributed and positively correlated with color-development equivalent and clay content and negatively correlated with silt content. Sorptivity increased with level of erosion severity along guidelines for erosion class determination established by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Sorptivity tended to be higher in convex regions in the field than in concave regions. Spatial-variability analysis of sorptivity measurements revealed stronger spatial dependence under dry than under wet field conditions. Overall, sorptivity measurements were too variable to be used for predictive modeling purposes. A two-dimensional sliding polynomial technique was used to smooth the sorptivity data and develop maps of their spatial distribution. The same spatial-distribution patterns for sorptivity existed for different dates, but the magnitude of the values varied and was lower for wet compared with dry antecedent soil water conditions. Results of this study indicate that lower productivity of eroded sites on Piedmont soil cannot be attributed to a decreased infiltration capacity.

As a kind of flexible integrated electrode without polymer binders, the flexible CC–CoHCF nanocomposites were directly used for nonenzymatic H₂O₂ sensing. Several techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electrochemistry were employed for the characterization of the electrode. It was found that CoHCF nanoparticles (about 100 nm) uniformly deposited on the CC surface. Electrochemical experiments demonstrated that the flexible CC–CoHCF nanocomposite electrode exhibited good electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of H₂O₂. Based on the amperometric experiments, the proposed nonenzymatic sensor showed a linear response to H₂O₂ detection in the range of 0.002–9.04 mM with a detection limit of 0.7 μM, which was superior to most of the previous results. Such a good result renders it a promising candidate for routine testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acobalt 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aZheng, Yaolin1 aYu, Jie1 aZhang, Yayun1 aSong, Yonghai1 aGuo, Qiaohui1 aWang, Li1 aXu, Fugang0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Mar. 17, v. 8, no. 12 p.2666-2672dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay03078a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02121naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011100171300001400282520119900296592002801495650002001523650001301543650003201556650002201588700002201610700002101632773008301653856008601736852000901822655001201831IND60086332420221116211013.0141101e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008633242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodela, Romina13aAn analysis of the methodological underpinnings of social learning research in natural resource management  ap. 16-26.  aThis analysis is focused on research that uses a social learning approach to study natural resource issues. We map out the prevailing epistemological orientation of social learning research through the de-construction of the methodological choices reported in current social learning literature. Based on an analysis of 54 empirical investigations of social learning and natural resources published after peer review, we investigated aspects of research design that include data collection methods, evidence types and the researcher's role. We consider these against different research-orientations (positivist, interpretive, critical, and post-normal). We discuss which research-orientation appears most congruent with the overall commitment and premises of social learning studies. In line with initial expectations this study shows that positivist stances are hardly present, however research that follows a postnormal approach is less frequent than initially assumed. Instead, findings suggest that researchers using a social learning perspective to study resource issues tend to choose methodologies that allow for in-depth descriptions, for meaning making and enquiry as a form of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3alearning 3anatural resource management 3anatural resources1 aCundill, Georgina1 aWals, Arjen E.J.0 tEcological economics.g2012 May, v. 77 p.16-26dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007500173300001600248520203600264592002802300650001402328650001702342650002402359650002302383650001702406650001002423650001102433650001902444650001002463650002202473650001002495650001002505650002002515650001302535650001402548650002502562650001402587650002102601651001002622700001502632700002302647773011602670856008102786852000902867655001202876IND60557986220221120090725.0170721e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055798622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-016-0974-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Juan José,10aVariation in the response to ascochyta blight in common bean germplasm  ap. 977-985.  aAscochyta blights are major diseases of many legumes and an emerging disease in many areas in which common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is grown. Ascochyta blight symptoms in bean can be caused by three fungus species. We investigated the species that caused ascochyta blight symptoms in bean crops from northern Spain using species-specific molecular markers and analysis of their nucleotide sequences. Results suggested that the two local isolates analyzed may correspond to the specie Phoma exigua var. diversispora. The variation in the reaction of common bean germplasm against a local isolate was also investigated in controlled conditions and was scored using a 1–9 severity scale. A total of 200 accessions from a core collection, 89 breeding lines and 11 accessions of Phaseolus coccineus L. were screened to identify potential sources of resistance. Most Phaseolus coccineus accessions showed higher levels of resistance (score < 5) while most Phaseolus vulgaris accessions and breeding lines had low levels (score > 5). However, five breeding lines and 17 accessions exhibited moderate resistance after five resistance tests, with variation in the response of seedlings within accessions. Thus, five lines were obtained by self-pollination from each of the 17 selected accessions. Evaluation of these lines revealed significant variation within lines derived from two accessions and allowed verification of the high level of resistance in lines derived from three accessions. Finally, the lines with higher levels of resistance identified in previous evaluations were tested in three additional tests. The lines UI465, BGE04435–22 and BGE04453–4 revealed resistance levels not significantly different from the best Phaseolus coccineus accession included in this study (score < 3.5). The identified resistance sources could be used in the in the short term to increase the level of resistance to ascochyta blight in specific bean genotypes or for development of new resistant genotypes by pyramiding of genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscochyta 3aDiversispora 3aPhaseolus coccineus 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aPhoma exigua 3abeans 3ablight 3abreeding lines 3acrops 3aemerging diseases 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3anucleotide sequences 3aseedlings 3aself-pollination 3aSpain1 aCampa, Ana1 aPérez-Vega, Elena0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2016 Dec., v. 146, no. 4 p.977-985dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-016-0974-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01516naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245006800168300001800236520045100254592002800705650001300733650001200746650001900758653002000777653000900797653002000806653001500826653002600841700001900867700002200886700001500908700002000923773012200943856008001065852000901145655001201154IND60616775720221117205906.0181020e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061677572DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175093576472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaing, Raechel M.10aStandard Test Methods Adapted to Better Simulate Fabrics in Use  ap. 1138-1150.  aThe objective was to adapt Standard test methods for determining properties of apparel fabrics so these properties are a better reflection of fabrics when used in end-products, while retaining a controlled environment and thus allowing fabric comparisons².

A total of 40-compounds, 7-phenolic, 9-flavonoids, 9-hydroxycinammic acid derivatives, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives and other glucosides specifically, pro-anthocyanidin trimer and procyanidin-B1 (dimer) were indentified in completely colored rice cultivars. Higher DPPH radical scavenging activity of pigmented cultivars was due to higher percentage of phenolics like thymol, quinicquinic-caffeicacid ester and polar dicaffeoylquinic acid; whereas higher lipid peroxidation inhibition was attributed to the presence of polar substances such as p-hydroxybenzoicacid, procyanidin B1 and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. The phosphomolybdenum reduction capacity was attributed to luteolin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, caffeicacid, myrecitin and phloreticacid. Whereas, grater reducing power of pigmented bran was attributed to presence of multiple-OH groups containing phenols, flavonoid and hydracinammicacid depicting potential health and nutritional effects of these rice cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aantioxidant activity 3abran 3acolor 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3aglucosides 3alipid peroxidation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidation 3aprocyanidins 3arice 3athymol 3aultrasonic treatment 0aGAE 0aRUE 0aTFC 0aTPC 0aTBARS 0aDPPH 0aPigmented rice bran 0aSolvents 0aO/R assay 0aPMA, DPPH 0aReducing power 0aLC-MS 0ap-Coumaric acid 0aQuinic acid 0aFerulic acid hexose derivative 0aProsntho-cyanidin trimer 0aEpigallo-catechin-3-O-gallate 0a(epi)-catechin 0aPhloretic acid 0ap-Coumaroyl glucose or galactose 0aHydrocinnamic acid 0aHydroxy benzoic acid 0a(E)-Conifer-aldehyde 0aFerulic acid 0aQuercetin-3-O-(6-acetyl) glucoside. 0aOleanolic acid 0aEllagic acid 0aLuteolin-7-O-glucoside 0aCaffeic acid 0aCyanidin-3-O-galactoside 0aSyringic acid 0aMyrecitin1 aRiar, Charanjit S.0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 237 p.264-274dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.05.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03278naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245006900209500001900278520182800297592002802125650001902153650001002172650001402182650001802196650001302214650002102227650001902248650001102267650001502278650001802293650001702311650002202328650002302350650001702373653002302390653002702413653002202440653001102462700002302473700002202496700002102518700002002539700002102559773010902580856008602689852000902775655001202784IND60684975720221120211615.0200819e20200601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068497572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1093142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGłąb, Tomasz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8910-250X10aEffect of plant growth regulators on visual quality of turfgrass  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPlant growth regulators (PGRs) are used on turfgrass to slow vertical growth and reduce mowing intensity. However, turfgrasses sometimes exhibit some leaf discolouration after PGR applications. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different rates of PGRs on turfgrass quality with a special focus on colour characteristics. Three cultivars of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) were used in an experiment. Six PGRs were used, namely, Trinexapac Ethyl, Paclobutrazol, Flurprimidol, Mefluidide, Ethephon and Gibberellic Acid, at five different rates. A control without the addition of PGRs was also tested simultaneously. The measurement of leaf colour was performed using a portable spectrophotometer and is presented in CIELab colour space. The turfgrass quality was assessed by a visual score.The results showed that the turfgrass quality was significantly different regarding the perennial ryegrass cultivar, treated with different PGRs rates. The changes owing to different PGRs rates appeared in the wavelengths ranging from 540 to 650 nm. PGRs application significantly affected L, b and a colour components. Gibberellic Acid application resulted lighter leaves with higher yellow hue and in a lower score of overall appearance and turf colour assessment. Paclobutrazol and Trinexapac Ethyl, had a beneficial influence on colour characteristics and turf quality. Flurprimidol and Melfuidide had no effect on turfgrass colour and quality after PGR treatment. The changes in colour of turf of perennial ryegrass correlated with PGR rates. Higher rates resulted in increased intensity of discolouration. The results of the spectrophotometric analysis of leaf colour corresponded with visual turf colour assessment. However, visually scored turfgrass did not show differences between PGR rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3acolor 3acultivars 3adiscoloration 3aethephon 3agibberellic acid 3alawns and turf 3aleaves 3amefluidide 3apaclobutrazol 3aplant growth 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrophotometers 3aturf grasses 0aPerennial ryegrass 0aPlant growth regulator 0aTurfgrass quality 0aColour1 aSzewczyk, Wojciech1 aGondek, Krzysztof1 aKnaga, Jarosław1 aTomasik, Marcin1 aKowalik, Klaudia0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 June 01, v. 267 p.109314-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1093143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002000153245009300173300001600266500035400282500001500636520175800651592002802409650002802437650002102465650001502486650001802501650002902519650002902548650001002577650001702587650001102604650002102615650002302636650002402659650002302683650001402706650001902720650001802739650002002757650003002777650001502807650002902822650002202851651001502873653001002888700001602898700001702914773012002931852000903051856009003060655001203150IND4362165020221120053103.0181002e200402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436216502DNAL7 a10.1097/01.ss.0000117788.98510.792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, C.

This paper examines the effect of the presence of the leaf litter layer in an oak woodland on conservative tracer transport measured in situ using time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes. This was done using repeated tracer miscible displacement studies, first with the litter layer intact and then again after removal of the litter layer. Tracer transport, as measured breakthrough curves (BTCs), was characterized using temporal moment analyses. These plot scale studies, performed at a field location in northern California, did not identify consistent changes in tracer transport patterns in the vertical transport plots before and after litter layer removal. In contrast, downslope lateral tracer displacement in the upper 20 cm of the soil did change after litter removal. However, no differences were evident deeper in the soil (30–50 cm) in temporal moments before and after litter removal during lateral tracer transport. This result demonstrates that the litter layer had a localized (near soil surface) influence on lateral transport. This influence may be explained by vertical anisotropy in effective soil hydraulic conductivity on the direction of lateral flow relative to the soil surface in the hillslope plots. It was demonstrated that the litter presence promotes a more vertical direction for the lateral flow in the first 20 cm of the soil. Despite the small changes in the first 20 cm observed in tracer transport after litter removal, the physical presence of the leaf litter layer was not found to be a major influence on tracer transport at the 30- to 50-cm depth in this hillslope soil where most of the lateral flow occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3asoil pore system 3asoil depth 3asoil solution 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aUmbellularia californica 3ahills 3asoil density 3aleaves 3acalcium chloride 3atemporal variation 3alabeling techniques 3asoil water content 3aequations 3awoodland soils 3aforest litter 3aclay loam soils 3atime domain reflectometry 3awater flow 3asoil transport processes 3aQuercus agrifolia 3aCalifornia 0aslope1 aGarrido, F.1 aGhodrati, M.0 tSoil science.g2004 Feb., v. 169, no. 2 p.100-114dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ss.0000117788.98510.793Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02649naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245008500163300001800248520108300266592002801349650001101377650001801388650001301406650002401419650001801443650001101461650003701472650001201509650001001521650001701531650001901548650001901567650001401586650001201600650003301612650001901645650002201664650001901686650002101705650001601726653001601742653001701758653002501775653002301800700001601823700001501839700001401854700001601868773012201884856008002006852000902086655001202095IND60616775820221117205831.0181020e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061677582DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175093576482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShayed, M.A.10aCarbon and Glass Fibers Modified by Polysilazane Based Thermal Resistant Coating  ap. 1118-1128.  aThermal resistant coatings of textile materials are required so that they can fulfill the high security demands in the case of resistance to fire. These coatings also improve the properties of textiles as composite materials. In this research work, a polysilazane based coating was applied on carbon filament (CF) and glass filament (GF) rovings by a padding method. Tensile testing under thermal stress was carried out to assess the thermomechanical properties of both coated and uncoated rovings. Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, contact angle measurements, and surface energy calculations were performed to evaluate the surface properties of coated and uncoated rovings. The amount of coating mass on rovings was also determined using different recipes. Thermo-gravimetric analysis and weight loss after thermal treatment of coated and uncoated CF rovings were carried out to observe the oxidation behavior, as well as the thermal stability. The obtained testing results were assessed to ascertain the coating performances on GF and CF rovings.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon fibers 3acoatings 3acomposite materials 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afabrics 3aglass 3aglass fibers 3aheat tolerance 3aheat treatment 3aoxidation 3arecipes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atextile fibers 3athermal stability 3athermal stress 3athermogravimetry 3aweight loss 0aglass fiber 0acarbon fiber 0apolysilazane coating 0athermal resistance1 aCherif, Ch.1 aHund, R.D.1 aCheng, T.1 aOsterod, F.0 tTextile research journal.g2010 July, v. 80, no. 11 p.1118-1128dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175093576483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245013700179300001800316520110100334592002801435650001001463650001901473650001201492650002501504650001201529650002001541650002001561650001201581700001901593700001801612700002001630773011601650856005501766852000901821655001201830IND4510616720221120160025.0150730e200003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451061672DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01157.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYokota, Shinâichi10aUpregulation of cytosolic chaperonin CCT subunits during recovery from chemical stress that causes accumulation of unfolded proteins  ap. 1658-1664.  aThe chaperonin containing TCPâ1 (CCT) is a molecular chaperone consisting of eight subunit species and assists in the folding of actin, tubulin and some other cytosolic proteins. We examined the stress response of CCT subunit proteins in mammalian cultured cells using chemical stressors that cause accumulation of unfolded proteins. Levels of CCT subunit proteins in HeLa cells were coordinately and transiently upregulated under continuous chemical stress with sodium arsenite. CCT subunit levels in several mammalian cell lines were also upregulated during recovery from chemical stress caused by sodium arsenite or a proline analogue, lâazetidineâ2âcarboxylic acid. Several unidentified proteins that were newly synthesized and associated with CCT were found to increase concomitantly with CCT subunits themselves and known substrates during recovery from the stress. These results suggest that CCT plays important roles in the recovery of cells from protein damage by assisting in the folding of proteins that are actively synthesized and/or renatured during this period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acultured cells 3amammals 3amolecular chaperones 3aproline 3asodium arsenite 3astress response 3atubulin1 aYanagi, Hideki1 aYura, Takashi1 aKubota, Hiroshi0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2000 Mar., v. 267, no. 6 p.1658-1664dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01157.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015300166300002000319520151800339592002801857650001201885650001101897650001201908650001101920650001301931650001101944650001101955650001101966650002501977650001302002650002002015650000902035650001402044650001802058650001202076650001102088650001802099650000902117650001902126650001302145650001102158650000902169700001402178700001602192700001402208700001802222700001502240773014902255856008102404852000902485655001202494IND60537278920221118082311.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053727892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6550-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhenzhou14aThe partitioning behavior of trace element and its distribution in the surrounding soil of a cement plant integrated utilization of hazardous wastes  ap. 13943-13953.  aIn the present study, the trace elements partitioning behavior during cement manufacture process were systemically investigated as well as their distribution behaviors in the soil surrounding a cement plant using hazardous waste as raw materials. In addition to the experimental analysis, the thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were simultaneously conducted. The results demonstrate that in the industrial-scale cement manufacture process, the trace elements can be classified into three groups according to their releasing behaviors. Hg is recognized as a highly volatile element, which almost totally partitions into the vapor phase. Co, Cu, Mn, V, and Cr are considered to be non-volatile elements, which are largely incorporated into the clinker. Meanwhile, Cd, Ba, As, Ni, Pb, and Zn can be classified into semi-volatile elements, as they are trapped into clinker to various degrees. Furthermore, the trace elements emitted into the flue gas can be adsorbed onto the fine particles, transport and deposit in the soil, and it is clarified here that the soil around the cement plant is moderately polluted by Cd, slightly polluted by As, Cr, Ba, Zn, yet rarely influenced by Co, Mn, Ni, Cu, Hg, and V elements. It was also estimated that the addition of wastes can efficiently reduce the consumption of raw materials and energy. The deciphered results can thus provide important insights for estimating the environmental impacts of the cement plant on its surroundings by utilizing wastes as raw materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abarium 3acadmium 3acement 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aflue gas 3ahazardous waste 3alead 3amanganese 3amanufacturing 3amercury 3anickel 3araw materials 3asoil 3athermodynamics 3avanadium 3avapors 3azinc1 aChen, Yan1 aSun, Yongqi1 aLiu, Lili1 aZhang, Zuotai1 aGe, Xinlei0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 July, v. 23, no. 14 p.13943-13953dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6550-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04515naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100001900193245020200212300001800414500002400432520238300456650002302839650001602862650002402878650001402902650001802916650002102934650001302955650001402968650001402982650002302996650002003019650002503039650002503064650001203089650001103101650002803112650003103140650003603171650003703207650002803244650002803272650000903300650003203309650003903341650003503380650003903415650002403454773012403478852000903602856008703611856010803698930003303806945002503839946001303864655001203877IND4383239520221121045205.0060831e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438323952DNAL7 a169376762pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-99.4.12252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aL001 0aL6001 aBuyukguzel, K.10aMalathion-Induced Oxidative Stress in a Parasitoid Wasp: Effect on Adult Emergence, Longevity, Fecundity, and Oxidative and Antioxidative Response of Pimpla turionellae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae)  ap. 1225-1234.  aIncludes references  aEffects of an organophosphorus insecticide, malathion, on survivorship and lipid peroxidation of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (L.), pupae were investigated by rearing the newly hatched larvae on an artificial diet containing 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ppm of the insecticide. As bioindicators of long-term physiological stress responses, the adult emergence rate, longevity, and fecundity associated with lipid peroxidation level and antioxidant enzyme activity in the endoparasitoid Pimpla turionellae (L.) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) were determined by rearing the parasitoid on a factitious host, G. mellonella pupae treated with malathion. At 100 ppm, malathion significantly decreased pupation rate of G. mellonella larvae and the rate of adult emergence of the parasitoid from these pupae. This concentration resulted in a significant increase in the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) in both the host and the parasitoid. Malathion at 1 and 10 ppm significantly increased pupation rate and lipid peroxidation level of G. mellonella pupae. The adult emergence rate of P. turionellae was significantly decreased from 63.7 to 20% by these concentrations, whereas MDA content was increased by two- and three-fold, respectively, compared with the control (45.3 ± 3.2 nmol/g protein). The longevity of adults was significantly extended from 52.5 ± 5.7 to 75.7 ± 6.3 d when the parasitoids emerged from host pupae exposed with 0.1 ppm malathion. At low concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 ppm), malathion significantly increased the number of eggs laid per female per day. However, the lowest concentration (0.01 ppm) had no significant effect on hatchability, whereas 0.1 ppm of the insecticide resulted in significant decrease in egg hatch compared with the control. A significant increase in total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity for low concentrations of malathion (0.01-1 ppm) was found compared with the control. There was a significant positive correlation of SOD activities with adult longevity and fecundity. This study suggested that malathion-induced oxidative stress was causative factor in the deterioration of biological fitness and that increased SOD activities may have resulted in decreased oxidative damage, which retarded the rate of deteriorative physiological changes in P. turionellae in response to sublethal doses of malathion. 3aPimpla turionellae 3aparasitoids 3anontarget organisms 3amalathion 3adose response 3aoxidative stress 3aeclosion 3alongevity 3afecundity 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aantioxidant activity 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFertilityxdrug effects 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aLife Cycle Stagesxdrug effects 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLongevityxdrug effects 2aMalathionxpharmacology 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aMothsxdrug effectsxparasitology. 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexdrug effects 2aWaspsxdrug effects0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2006 Aug., v. 99, no. 4 p.1225-1234dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-99.4.12253Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://puck.esa.catchword.org/vl=4081177/cl=17/nw=1/rpsv/journal/journal3_home.htm3electronic resource  a20061007b20061102c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/10/05  aOther US 7aarticle04377naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013600165300001600301520269400317592002803011650002203039650002503061650002503086650003103111650002303142650002503165650002103190650002803211650002003239650001403259650002003273650002203293650002803315650003303343650002603376650001403402650001903416650001703435650001603452650001703468651001103485700002103496700001903517700002503536700002203561700002503583700002103608773011603629856008103745852000903826655001203835IND60557986420221120090807.0170721e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055798642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-016-0955-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavary, Serge10aAssessing plant health in a network of experiments on hardy winter wheat varieties in France: multivariate and risk factor analyses  ap. 757-778.  aA large network of field experiments has been conducted over several years across France to identify combinations of winter wheat cultivars and management practices in which partial resistances under limited chemical protection would achieve adequate disease management, while leading to satisfactory yield performance, and so achieve the double objective of ecological sustainability and economic viability. Little information is available to document the variation in multiple disease levels, a necessary step towards a chemical extensification process, in wheat networked experiments. This article provides a description of disease intensities in a set of 101 experiments totalling 3525 individual wheat plots over eight successive years (2003–2010). The diseases considered are brown rust (BR, Puccinia triticina), yellow rust (YR, Puccinia striiformis), fusarium head blight (FHB, Fusarium graminearum, F. culmorum, and F. avenaceum), powdery mildew (PM, Blumeria graminis), and septoria tritici blotch (STB, Zymoseptoria tritici). Hierarchical cluster analysis led to the identification of three variety groups associated with (1) moderate-low disease levels in general, except for YR (moderate levels) – 16 varieties; (2) moderate-low BR, YR, and FHB levels, and moderate PM and STB levels – 12 varieties; (3) comparatively higher BR, YR, FHB, and STB levels, and moderate PM levels – 17 varieties. The association of disease levels represented as binary categories (i.e., epidemics vs. non-epidemics) with climatic years corresponded to chi-square values (χ² = 87.0–1402) that were one to two orders of magnitude larger than the values corresponding to the associations of diseases with variety groups (χ² = 6.41–321) or with levels of crop management (χ² = 21.2–82.1). Multivariate non parametric analyses indicated the existence of three disease syndromes, two of which being dominated by BR or STB, and a third associated with diverse diseases and frequent FHB. This suggests that STB and BR might each be considered as key-stone species dominating specific wheat disease syndromes. Multiple correspondence analysis highlighted the linkages between multiple epidemic occurrence and the three characterized variety groups. Risk factors analyses conducted through logistic regressions provided quantitative estimates of the contribution of climatic years, variety groups, and crop management, to the likelihood of epidemic occurrence for each of the five diseases considered. The results indicate that climatic years, wheat varieties, and crop management, in this decreasing order, define disease epidemic risk in the multiple wheat-diseases pathosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlumeria graminis 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3aPuccinia recondita 3aPuccinia striiformis 3acluster analysis 3acorrespondence analysis 3acrop management 3acultivars 3adisease control 3adisease outbreaks 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afield experimentation 3aleaf rust 3apowdery mildew 3arisk factors 3astripe rust 3awinter wheat 3aFrance1 aJouanin, Céline1 aFélix, Irène1 aGourdain, Emmanuelle1 aPiraux, François1 aWillocquet, Laetitia1 aBrun, François,0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2016 Dec., v. 146, no. 4 p.757-778dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-016-0955-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006900155245019600224300001400420520177300434592002802207650001402235650001402249650001402263650001402277650001202291650001202303650001302315650001102328650001902339650001302358650001702371650001402388650001502402650001702417650001902434650002002453653002902473653001302502653001302515653002102528653001902549700002002568700002502588700002602613700001802639700002402657773007502681856008902756852000902845655001202854IND60556759620221121223412.0170105e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055675962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.10.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhansary, Milad Asgarpour1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2370-056313aAn enquiry on appropriate selection of polymers for preparation of polymeric nanosorbents and nanofiltration/ultrafiltration membranes for hormone micropollutants removal from water effluents  ap. 91-99.  aTo analyze polymeric nanosorbents and nanofiltration/ultrafiltration membranes for hormone micropollutants removal from water effluents, here an in-through investigation on the suitability and compatibility of various polymers has been carried out. For this work, estradiol, estrone, testosterone, progesterone, estriol, mestranol, and ethinylestradiol were considered. A total number of 452 polymers were analyzed and initially screened using Hansen solubility parameters. The identified good pairs of hormones and polymers then were examined to obtain the equilibrium capacity of hormones removal from water effluents using a modified Flory–Huggins model. A distribution coefficient was defined as the ratio of hormones in water effluent phase and polymer phase. For removal of mestranol, estradiol and ethinylestradiol, no compatible polymer was identified based on initial screening of collected database. Three compatible polymers were identified for estriol. For progesterone, a wide variety of polymers was identified as good matching of polar, dispersion and hydrogen forces contributions can be observed for these pairs. For estrone, only two polymers can be proposed due to the mismatch observed between polar, dispersion and hydrogen forces contributions of other polymers and this hormone. The phase calculations showed that not all the identified good pairs could be used for practical separation applications. The domain of applicability of each good pair was investigated and potential polymers for practical micropollutants removal together with their removal capacity were represented in terms of phase envelops. The theoretical approach follows fundamental chemical thermodynamic equations and then can be simply applied for any system of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aeffluents 3aequations 3aestradiol 3aestriol 3aestrone 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3ananofiltration 3apolymers 3aprogesterone 3ascreening 3asolubility 3atestosterone 3athermodynamics 3aultrafiltration 0aHormones micropollutants 0aSorption 0aPolymers 0aHansen parameter 0aPhase envelops1 aMellat, Mostafa1 aSaadat, Seyed Hassan1 aFasihi-Ramandi, Mahdi1 aKamali, Mehdi1 aTaheri, Ramezan Ali0 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 168 p.91-99dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.10.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012900175300001800304520092300322592002801245650001101273650001501284650001901299650001001318650000901328650001101337650001901348650001401367650001801381650002301399651001301422653002101435653002901456653002601485653003001511653002301541653001801564700001601582700001601598700002201614700002501636700001601661700001801677773012401695856008401819852000901903655001201912IND60519338720221120082555.0160427e20160425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051933872DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2014.9685722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNdam Ngoupayou, J.R.10aPresent-day sediment dynamics of the Sanaga catchment (Cameroon): from the total suspended sediment (TSS) to erosion balance  ap. 1080-1093.  aTotal suspended sediment (TSS) data for 1960–1970 and from recent investigations (1990–2000) are used to evaluate the variability in sediment yield of the Sanaga catchment (Cameroon) and the equivalent rates of erosion. At the annual and seasonal time scales, total suspended sediment concentrations for the Mbam sub-catchment are three to four times higher than for the Sanaga basin, reflecting the higher sensitivity of the former to erosion. Classical clockwise hysteresis loops are observed in both sub-catchments, despite a significant increase in human-induced catchment changes. At the multi-year time frame (over a 40-year period), it appears that the second half of the 1990s is marked by a downward trend in TSS. This shift is due to the control infrastructures (river impoundments and ponds) installed in certain parts of the whole catchment, combined with a drop in annual rainfall and river discharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3ahysteresis 3ainfrastructure 3aponds 3arain 3arivers 3asediment yield 3asediments 3asubwatersheds 3asuspended sediment 3aCameroon 0aSanaga catchment 0atotal suspended sediment 0amechanical denudation 0ahydroclimatic variability 0ariver impoundments 0adam siltation1 aDzana, J.G.1 aKpoumie, A.1 aGhogomu, R.

In this study, Hg in soil, soilwater, and streamwater were measured across a forested upland subcatchment of the METAALICUS watershed in northwestern Ontario, Canada, where a stable Hg isotope (spike Hg) was applied to distinguish newly deposited Hg from Hg already resident in the watershed (ambient Hg). In total, we were able to account for 45% of the total mass of spike Hg applied to the subcatchment during the entire loading phase of the experiment, with approximately 22% of the total mass applied now residing in the top 15 cm of the mineral soil layer. Decreasing spike Hg/ambient Hg ratios with depth in the soil and soilwater suggest that spike Hg is less mobile than ambient Hg over shorter time scales. However, the transport of spike Hg into the mineral soil layer is enhanced in depressional areas where water table fluctuation is more extreme. While we expect that this pool of Hg is now effectively sequestered in the mineral horizon, future disturbance of the soil profile could remobilize this stored Hg in runoff.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahighlands 3aisotopes 3alandscapes 3amercury 3amineral soils 3arunoff 3asoil profiles 3asubwatersheds 3aupland soils 3awater table 3aOntario1 aHeyes, Andrew1 aBranfireun, Brian A.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Jan. 21, v. 48, no. 2 p.1023-1031dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes404260f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245008900164300001600253520106700269592002801336650002601364650001901390650001101409650001401420650001201434650001301446650001501459650001401474650002101488650001001509650001801519650002001537650001801557651001201575700002101587700002101608700001801629773011501647852000901762856008201771655001201853IND4414009520221120103456.0190314e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441400952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-008-0976-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Nguyen Tu10aVariation in wood properties of six natural acacia hybrid clones in northern Vietnam  ap. 436-442.  aWood properties of six 8-year-old natural acacia hybrid clones between Acacia mangium and Acacia auriculiformis, planted in Bavi, Vietnam, were studied. The hybrid clones possessed obvious heterosis in growth and in some wood properties. The characteristics of growth, air-dry specific gravity, lengths of fibers and vessel elements, S₂ microfibril angle, green moisture content, and shrinkage were examined to clarify the variation among clones. From the results, the differences among the clones in growth and in some wood properties were significant. The pattern of distribution of specific gravity showed that there were low and high specific gravity zones in the stem. Specific gravity at stump height or at 3.0 m was useful for prediction of specific gravity in the whole tree stem. Moreover, clones with high specific gravity can be predicted at a young age. There was no significant correlation between diameter growth and specific gravity. Of the six clones studied, clone BV5 was selected as the best based on its growth ability and specific gravity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia auriculiformis 3aAcacia mangium 3aclones 3aheterosis 3ahybrids 3aplanting 3aprediction 3ashrinkage 3aspecific gravity 3atrees 3awater content 3awood properties 3axylem vessels 3aVietnam1 aOchiishi, Mikiko1 aMatsumura, Junji1 aOda, Kazuyuki0 tJournal of wood science.g2008 Dec., v. 54, no. 6 p.436-442dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-008-0976-23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03021naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006900150245013600219520179700355592002802152650001802180650001102198650001202209650001702221650001502238650001902253650001002272650001302282650002002295650001102315650001102326653003302337653001902370653002602389700002202415773010402437856008502541852000902626655001202635IND60742151720221116190228.0211206e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074215172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1115322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilli Vieira, Carolina L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8763-333114aThe impact of solar activity on ambient ultrafine particle concentrations: An analysis based on 19-year measurements in Boston, USA  aSolar radiation plays a major role in atmospheric photochemistry, contributing to the formation and growth of ultrafine particles (PN). PN affect global Earth's radiation balance, climate system, and human health. However, the impact of solar activity on ambient PN remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the associations between daily ambient PN concentrations [particle number (PN)/cm³] and solar radio flux [solar activity index (F₁₀.₇ in sfu)] as a solar activity parameter, shortwave solar radiation (SWR), daylight time (DL), cosmic ray-induced ionization (CRII), and air pollution [PM₂.₅, black carbon (BC) and SO₂] over a 19-year period in Boston, MA. We used generalized additive models adjusted for local environmental conditions. We found that F₁₀.₇ was the strongest predictor for daily PN concentrations over all time lags (0–28 days of lags) and seasons. The effects were higher in winter and fall. In winter, an interquartile (IQR) of 60 sfu F₁₀.₇ corresponded to an increase of 5770 PN/cm³ in the day of PN collection. In fall, an IQR of 75.5 sfu F₁₀.₇ was associated with an increase of 5429 PN/cm³. The effects of F₁₀.₇ on PN concentrations were slightly greater when the models were adjusted for air pollution. In summer, ambient PN concentrations were statistically significantly associated with F₁₀.₇, SWR, and BC, with the strongest association found for PN and BC in the day of PN collection. Unlike the effects of F₁₀.₇, SWR and local pollutants on PN concentrations, DL and CRII were negatively associated with ambient PN in the analyses. These findings suggest that solar activity may have a significant impact on daily ambient PN concentrations that affect the Earth's climate system and human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3aclimate 3ahuman health 3aionization 3aphotochemistry 3aradio 3aresearch 3asolar radiation 3asummer 3awinter 0aUltrafine particle formation 0aSolar activity 0aAmbient air pollution1 aKoutrakis, Petros0 tEnvironmental research.g2021 Oct., v. 201 p.111532-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1115323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245009300211500001900304520155900323592002801882650001201910650002101922650001501943650001301958650001601971650001201987650001101999650001102010650001802021650001402039650002102053650000902074650001702083653000902100653001002109653001102119653000702130653000902137653000902146653000702155653000902162653000802171653003102179653001802210653002302228653002202251653002802273700002802301700002702329700002002356700001602376773010902392856008602501852000902587655001202596IND60684976020221120054134.0200804e20200727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068497602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1093172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudke, Christoph1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7211-271X10aIodine biofortification of field-grown strawberries – Approaches and their limitations  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe potential of iodine biofortification in strawberry fruits by means of soil and foliar fertilization was investigated in three field experiments and a preliminary phytotoxicity test in the greenhouse. In the main experiment iodine was applied by one-time potassium iodate soil drenches two weeks after planting or, alternatively, by using potassium iodide foliar sprays from the beginning of flowering. Beside the iodine accumulation in fruits, effects on crop yield and quality were determined. The soil fertilization resulted in a relatively low iodine accumulation in strawberry fruits, probably because the concentration of phytoavailable iodine in the soil rapidly decreased after its application. A markedly higher iodine content in fruits was achieved when it was aerially applied, either by a single treatment shortly before harvest or by repeated sprays during the flowering period. Yield, firmness and total acidity concentration of strawberry fruits were not significantly affected by any of the tested iodine applications. However, as a result of repeated foliar sprays the concentration of soluble solids in fruits was slightly diminished. Attemps to substantially increase the iodine content in fruits of strawberry plants cultivated in the second and third year failed, even following frequent sprays. In conclusion the results of this study suggest that only a relatively small proportion of exogenously applied iodine enters the fruits of field-grown strawberries due to its strong retention in soil and low phloem mobility in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abiofortification 3acrop yield 3afirmness 3agreenhouses 3aiodates 3aiodine 3aphloem 3aphytotoxicity 3apotassium 3apotassium iodide 3asoil 3astrawberries 0aBBCH 0aCaCl2 0aICP-MS 0aKI 0aKIO3 0aNmin 0aTA 0aTMAH 0aTSS 0aAgronomic biofortification 0aFoliar sprays 0aSoil fertilization 0aStrawberry fruits 0aIodine dynamics in soil1 athor Straten, Stephanie1 aMühling, Karl Hermann1 aBroll, Gabriele1 aDaum, Diemo0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 July 27, v. 269 p.109317-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1093173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245009700161300002000258520118900278592002801467650001601495650001501511650001601526650002701542650002301569650001001592650001601602650001901618650002101637650003001658650002101688650001001709650000901719650003401728700002001762700001401782700001301796700001401809773014801823856008101971852000902052655001202061IND60575359120221118020753.0170728e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057535912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-8943-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Cheng10aEstrogen receptor beta mediates hepatotoxicity induced by perfluorooctane sulfonate in mouse  ap. 13414-13423.  aPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), an artificial fluorosurfactant and global contaminant, is used widely in various consumer products. In this study, we investigated the function of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) in PFOS-induced bile acid and cholesterol metabolism disorders and gut microbiome using ERβ knockout mice that were exposed to PFOS by gavage. Our results showed that a daily dose of 5 mg PFOS/kg significantly induced hydropic degeneration and vacuolation in hepatic cells, reduced bile acid, and cholesterol levels in liver tissue, and influenced the abundance and composition of gut microbiota. Notably, ERβ deficiency not only ameliorated morphological alterations of hepatocytes but also relieved disorders in bile acids and cholesterol metabolism caused by PFOS. Furthermore, the changes in the gut microbiome by PFOS were also modulated. The relative transcript abundance of key genes involved in bile acid and cholesterol metabolism exhibited similar changes. In HepG2 cells, PFOS increased ERβ expression, which could be blocked by adding PHTPP (a selective antagonist of ERβ). Our study thus provides new evidence that ERβ mediates PFOS-induced hepatotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3abile acids 3acholesterol 3acholesterol metabolism 3aestrogen receptors 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahuman cell lines 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aknockout mutants 3aliver 3amice 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid1 aJiang, Zhao-Yan1 aLiu, Qian1 aLiu, Hui1 aGu, Aihua0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 May, v. 24, no. 15 p.13414-13423dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-8943-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014900168300002000317520132000337592002801657650001201685650002301697650002001720650001201740650001101752650001101763650001101774650000901785650001501794650001701809650001101826650000901837650000901846650001201855650001201867650001101879650000901890650001401899650001301913650000901926651002201935651001201957700001701969773014901986856008102135852000902216655001202225IND60537279020221118090309.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053727902DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6534-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZohra, Ben Salem10aAssessment of heavy metal contamination levels and toxicity in sediments and fishes from the Mediterranean Sea (southern coast of Sfax, Tunisia)  ap. 13954-13963.  aContamination of heavy metals in sediment is regarded as a global crisis with a large share in industrializing cities like Sfax (Tunisia). Seven heavy metals such as Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe), Mercury (Hg), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn), and one metalloid such as Arsenic (As) in sediments and fish (D. annularis, L. aurata, and S. vulgaris) were investigated from the Southern coast of Sfax in Tunisia. The range of metals in sediments were 13.11–36; 4.42–7.92; 8.23–28.56; 50,564–11,956; 2.9–6.8; 9.13–30.51; 65.06–151.50, and 47–546 kg⁻¹ DW for As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The level of studied metals in sediment samples exceeded the limits of the quality assessment guidelines (SQGs). The potential ecological risk index (PERI) proved that the investigated region could pose moderate risk for the aquatic biota. Metal bioaccumulation in the fish muscles varied significantly among species. Indeed, S. vulgaris and D. annularis accumulated higher amount of metal than L. aurata. The target hazard quotients (THQ) of individual heavy metals in fish, except for As and Hg, revealed safe levels for human consumption. Nevertheless, the total THQ indexes exceeded 1 suggesting the combined effects on muscles fish, which may constitute a risk to population’s health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3aat-risk population 3abioaccumulation 3acadmium 3acities 3acoasts 3acopper 3afish 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3airon 3alead 3amercury 3amuscles 3anickel 3arisk 3asediments 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aMediterranean Sea 3aTunisia1 aHabib, Ayadi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 July, v. 23, no. 14 p.13954-13963dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6534-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245010900168300001600277506002800293520169500321592002802016506003702044650001402081650002502095650001602120650001102136650000902147650001402156650001602170650001402186650001002200650001902210650001002229650002602239653001702265653001602282653001102298653001902309700003102328700002002359773011502379856009102494852000902585655001202594IND60775030920221207082726.0191128e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077503092DNAL7 a10.15294/biosaintifika.v10i1.139572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSunarno10aApplication of Snakehead Fish to Increase Liver Function of Rats after Experiencing Physiological Stress  ap. 109-116.  aResource is Open Access  aPhysiological stress due to nutritional deficiency accompanied by excessive activity can cause problems of energy deficiency required by the body. Energy shortage can affect the body weight, as well as the weight and histology of the liver. This study was conducted to examine and analyze the effect of snakehead fish meat supplementation in feed toward body weight, weight and hepatic histology in animals experiencing physiological stress. This study used 20 male Wistar rats consisting of 5 treatments with 4 replications. The treatment in this study consisted of control (P0) and treatment (P1: 5%, P2: 10%, P3: 15%, P4: 20%) groups. This research used Completely Randomized Design (RAL). The variables measured in this study were body weight, hepatic weight, central venous diameter and hepatocytes in the test animals. The data obtained were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) at 5% significance level and continued with Duncan test with 5% significance. The result of data analysis showed that fish snakehead fish supplementation in feed gave a significant effect to body weight, weight and histology of animal liver. Concentrations of snakehead fish supplements can increase the body weight, hepatic weight, and hepatic histology which was indicated by higher central venous and hepatocyte diameter values compared to other controls and treatments. The conclusion of this research is the provision of snakehead fish supplement (Channia striata) can increase the body weight, hepatic weight, central venous and hepatocytes diameter of Wistar rats with the most influential concentration of 20%.

The best biological condition of A. antennatus (gonadosomatic index [GSI]) for mating and spawning occurred at 800–1,300 m in summer, in areas deeper than the fishing grounds distributed between 500 and 800 m. Females moved shallower to feed on the upper slope during periods of water‐mass homogeneity (autumn–winter), increasing their hepatic gland weight (hepatosomatic index [HSI]). Females moved downslope (800–1,100 m) to spawn (high GSI) during periods of water mass stratification (late spring–summer). The HSI of females decreased with depth down the slope in autumn, after the reproductive period. Small juveniles were distributed deeper than 1,000 m, associated with high near‐bottom O₂ levels, low turbidity and high C:N in sediments, implying favorable trophic conditions. This confirms the importance in studying the biology of deep‐sea species over their entire depth range. The progressive warming and increasing salinity of deep Mediterranean waters could provoke a decrease of dissolved O₂ that would affect the life cycle of A. antennatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3afishery resources 3agonadosomatic index 3ahepatosomatic index 3ajuveniles 3aoxygen 3asalinity 3asediments 3ashrimp 3aspawning 3asummer 3aturbidity1 aLópez‐Pérez, C.1 aCarbonell, A.0 tFisheries oceanography.g2018 Mar., v. 27, no. 2 p.114-126dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000070x1054-60067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fog.122373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245010800157520172000265592002801985650001902013650002502032650001802057650001502075650001202090650001502102650001502117650000902132650002002141650001902161650002502180651001202205700003002217700002202247700002002269773011902289856007202408852000902480655001202489IND60648218820221121011238.0190627e20151222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064821882DNAL7 a10.3390/f70100032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavrilut, Ines14aThe Interaction between FSC Certification and the Implementation of the EU Timber Regulation in Romania  aThis explorative study aims to shed light on the ways in which Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification interacts with the implementation of the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) in Romania. To this end, the EUTR implementation process is examined, and the relationship between this implementation and FSC certification is explored. There is a particular focus on the extent to which certification has helped companies to comply with EUTR requirements. The study uses the analytical framework of Transnational Business Governance Interactions (TBGI) and a mixed research approach. It is found that FSC certification has to a large extent helped companies to prepare for and align with the EUTR’s requirements, in particular concerning risk assessment and risk mitigation procedures needed for a due diligence system (DDS), and in the context of a “policy vacuum” period related to EUTR implementation. Moreover, recent changes in the FSC standard make it theoretically in line with EUTR requirements. However, difficulties remain in relation to the lack of information, costs and bureaucracy associated with both EUTR implementation and FSC certification. Notably, in the absence of a monitoring organization, the establishment of a viable DDS is still problematic as many companies remain unprepared for developing their own systems. Finally, the EUTR and its risk management requirements may have partly fueled the increase in uptake of chain of custody (CoC) certification in Romania. However, due to the risk of CoC certificates including illegally sourced timber, this recent uptake in certification does not necessarily indicate improved sustainable forest management (SFM) or full compliance with EUTR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3abusiness enterprises 3acertification 3acompliance 3aforests 3agovernance 3amonitoring 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk reduction 3asustainable forestry 3aRomania1 aHalalisan, Aureliu-Florin1 aGiurca, Alexandru1 aSotirov, Metodi0 tForests.g2015 Dec. 22, v. 7, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70100033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245013800159300002000297520139900317592002801716650000801744650001201752650001301764650001101777650002901788650001701817650000901834650001101843650001501854650000901869650001401878650001501892650001901907650000901926651001001935700001701945700001101962773014901973856008102122852000902203655001202212IND60537279120221118082314.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053727912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6589-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yan10aEnvironmental behaviors and potential ecological risks of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in multimedia in an oilfield in China  ap. 13964-13972.  aThe environmental behaviors of five heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) in a Chinese oilfield were investigated using a steady-state multimedia aquivalence (SMA) model. The modeling results showed good agreement with the actual measured values, with average residual errors of 0.69, 0.83, 0.35, 0.16, and 0.54 logarithmic units for air, water, soil, sediment, and vegetation compartments, respectively. Model results indicated that most heavy metals were buried in sediment, and that transfers between adjacent compartments were mainly deposition from the water to the sediment compartment (48.59 %) and from the air to the soil compartment (47.74 %) via atmospheric dry/wet deposition. Sediment and soil were the dominant sinks, accounting for 68.80 and 25.26 % of all the heavy metals in the multimedia system, respectively. The potential ecological risks from the five heavy metals in the sediment and soil compartments were assessed by the potential ecological risk index (PERI). The assessment results demonstrate that the heavy metals presented low levels of ecological risk in the sediment compartment, and that Cd was the most significant contributor to the integrated potential ecological risk in the oilfield. The SMA model provided useful simulations of the transport and fate of heavy metals and is a useful tool for ecological risk assessment and contaminated site management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3aenvironmental assessment 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amodels 3aoil fields 3arisk 3asediments 3avegetation 3awet deposition 3azinc 3aChina1 aWang, Dazhou1 aLi, Yu0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 July, v. 23, no. 14 p.13964-13972dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6589-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02294naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010300161300001800264520115200282592002801434650001601462650001701478650002601495650001001521650000901531650001301540650001301553650001601566653001201582653002301594653001801617653002801635700001601663700002001679773012701699856007301826852000901899655001201908IND60527471520221122090257.0160715e20130724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052747152DNAL7 a10.1021/am40179732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParween, Shaheena10aNon-natural Amino Acids Containing Peptide-Capped Gold Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery Application  ap. 6484-6493.  aPeptide-based capping agents for gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are possible alternatives for capping and derivatizing GNPs, but suffer from a major disadvantage of sensitivity toward non specific proteases, which may limit their in vivo utility. Using non-natural analogs of natural α-amino acids offer an attractive alternate strategy to circumvent this potential bottleneck in realizing full potential of peptide based capping gents for GNPs for biological applications. Here, we have designed and developed pentapeptides containing non-natural amino acid (α,β-dehydrophenylalanine and α-aminoisobutyric acid) as capping agents for GNPs. All these peptides were able to efficiently cap GNPs and peptide induced aggregation was not observed. Peptide capped GNPs showed minimal cytotoxicity to mammalian cell lines (HeLa and L929) as well as mice spleenocytes. They encapsulated small drug like molecules and peptide capped GNPs entrapping drugs were more efficient in killing HeLa cells compared to the free drug. Therefore, these non-natural amino acid containing peptide-capped GNPs may be further developed as alternate drug delivery vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3acytotoxicity 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3amice 3ananogold 3apeptides 3aproteinases 0apeptide 0agold nanoparticles 0adrug delivery 0anon-natural amino acids1 aAli, Ashraf1 aChauhan, V.

They are rapidly recruited to the site of infection, release antimicrobial peptides and cytokines, and engulf and kill microbes. Neutrophils also accumulate in allergic inflammatory sites. Here we characterized neutrophil accumulation in the nasal mucosa using a mouse model of allergic rhinitis, in which mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged by intranasal administration of OVA or PBS. In the nasal mucosa of both PBS- and OVA-challenged mice, we found a cell subset expressing the eosinophil marker Siglec-F in the Ly-6G⁺ neutrophil population. Morphological analysis of the sorted Ly-6G⁺Siglec-F⁺ cells revealed that they were devoid of eosinophilic granules in the cytosol and were apparently neutrophils, but compared to conventional Ly-6G⁺Siglec-F⁻ neutrophils, they had a more lobulated, “botryoid” nucleus. Siglec-F⁺ neutrophils were barely found in the nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue, cervical lymph nodes, the spleen, or blood. Both Siglec-F⁺ neutrophils and conventional neutrophils showed increased numbers in the nasal mucosa of OVA-challenged mice. Compared to conventional Siglec-F⁻ neutrophils, Siglec-F⁺ neutrophils exhibited an activated phenotype and enhanced effector functions. Taken together, our findings identify Siglec-F⁺ neutrophils as a novel neutrophil subset with an activated phenotype that resides specifically in the nasal mucosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergic rhinitis 3aantimicrobial peptides 3acytokines 3acytosol 3aintranasal administration 3aintraperitoneal injection 3alymph 3amice 3anasal mucosa 3aneutrophils 3aovalbumin 3aphenotype 3aresearch 3aspleen 0aInflammation 0aNeutrophil subset 0aSiglec-F 0aAR 0aCLN 0amAb 0aMFI 0aNALT 0aOVA 0aROS 0aSSC1 aNagakubo, Daisuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1213-12461 aSatooka, Hiroki1 aHirata, Takako1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1740-61680 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 June 04, v. 526, no. 3 p.599-606dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02217naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009500171300001400266500001900280500001100299520122700310592002801537650001401565650001501579650001501594650001201609700006401621773013901685856008201824852000901906655001201915IND60730320020221120064406.0210308e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073032002DNAL7 a10.1007/s12524-020-01277-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiran Kumar, A.

Imaging systems onboard IRS-1C satellite, flown in 1995, made a remarkable impact by providing on a single platform, the ability to simultaneously image in multiple spectral channels, multiple geometric resolutions and multiple revisit times in addition to stereo viewing. This development of three-tier imaging system of IRS-1C had been a giant leap in Indian space imaging systems evolution. It required development of compact high-resolution sensor, medium-resolution multispectral system and wide swath imager. This review article brings out the innovative solutions adopted, some of the major challenges faced and new technologies developed. In addition, it briefly provides the foundational research that was carried out in sensors prior to IRS-1C and the improvements carried out in spacecraft systems to cater to the requirements of imaging. The development of IRS-1C made significant impact on the development of subsequent imaging systems, and these aspects are discussed in terms of growth of three-tier imaging, high-resolution systems, etc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3asatellites 3aspacecraft 3asurveys1 aSamudraiah, D.

Batsch] cultivars allow Florida growers to become competitive by offering fruits earlier than northern states for premium prices. Due to the predominance of sandy soils in Florida, irrigation is required to ensure fruit production in peaches. Available irrigation recommendations and peach crop coefficients (Kc) were determined in Mediterranean and temperate climates, and they can overestimate water demand in humid subtropical climates. Thus, a two-year study was conducted in Citra, FL, aiming to determine the water requirements and Kc values for four-year-old peach trees in humid subtropical conditions. A daily soil water balance and the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was determined using soil volumetric water content recorded every 10 min. Five soil probes, each equipped with soil moisture sensors at 10, 20, 40, and 80 cm of soil depth representing soil depth layers of 0-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-90 cm, respectively placed under the tree canopy. The ratios of daily ETc and Penman-Monteith FAO-56 reference evapotranspiration were used to estimate Kc for phenological stages of adult (≥4-year-old) peach trees. A soil water depletion coefficient (Kₛ) was estimated obtaining a threshold of 25.8 % available soil water depletion before trees undergo water stress. Daily ETc ranged from 0.22 mm d⁻¹ during dormancy to 3.65 mm d⁻¹ during shoot development. Values of Kc for peach trees ranged from 0.30 during dormancy to 0.69 during fruit maturity. The use of peach tree Kc adapted for subtropical humid conditions reduce the estimated crop water requirements by 21 % compared to the Kc values reported in FAO-56 guidelines.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPrunus persica 3aadults 3acanopy 3acultivars 3adormancy 3aevapotranspiration 3afruit maturity 3afruits 3ahumid zones 3airrigation 3apeaches 3aphenology 3aplant available water 3asoil depth 3asoil water balance 3avolumetric water content 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3aFlorida 0aCrop coefficient 0aSoil water depletion 0aStress coefficient 0aWater demand1 aZotarelli, Lincoln1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1087-20431 aMorgan, Kelly T.1 aMigliaccio, Kati W.1 aBeeson, Richard C.1 aChaparro, José X.1 aOlmstead, Mercy A.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 June 01, v. 267 p.109318-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1093183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009700168300001400265520142900279592002801708653002201736653002001758653001901778653002301797700001701820700001801837773010301855856008301958852000902041655001202050IND60554889920221123040024.0161025e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055488992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.msard.2015.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarran, Natali10aQuality of life and coping strategies in Lebanese Multiple Sclerosis patients: A pilot study  ap. 21-27.  aCoping strategies used by Multiple Sclerosis patients play a key role in adjusting to the disease and affect their overall quality of life. This relationship has been investigated in developed countries, but none has been studied in developing ones such as Lebanon. Factors including barriers to health care delivery, economic pressure and political instability influence which coping strategies are used and often increases the use of negative coping mechanisms. The current pilot study explored the association between different coping strategies with quality of life and depression, anxiety, fatigue and social support in 34 Lebanese Multiple Sclerosis patients. Results indicated that Multiple Sclerosis patients using positive coping strategies had significantly higher scores of quality of life (U=46, p=.038) and social support (U=33.5, p=.011), and lower depression (U=44, p=.030) and anxiety levels (U=46.5, p=.038) as compared to those using negative coping strategies. Specifically, escape avoidance coping strategy was associated with poor quality of life scores (r=−.609, p<.0001) and high levels of depression (r=.534, p=.001), anxiety (r=.530, p=.001), and fatigue (r=.401, p=.019).

As a result, a new discussion has arisen for the future configuration of the sugarcane industry: should bagasse be used to generate bioelectricity or produce second generation ethanol? Due to the high volatility of prices, for both electricity and anhydrous ethanol, the decision is complex, and higher volatility of price is associated with greater risk in this decision. This article presents a bi-objective optimization model to decide efficiently the percentage of the available sugarcane bagasse that should be allocated to each of these options in order to maximize the average return and, at the same time, minimize the risk inherent in price level volatilities. The results for four possible scenarios are presented; it is concluded that the scenario that presents a bioelectricity production cost of US$ 50/MWh and a cost of second generation ethanol production of US$ 0.30/liter has a higher return and lower risk to the investor. In this scenario, the allocation of bagasse for second generation ethanol production is 84%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacreage 3abioelectricity 3acost effectiveness 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3amodels 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3arisk 3asugar industry 3asugarcane 3asugarcane bagasse 3aBrazil 0aOptimal allocation 0aSugarcane bagasse 0aCogeneration 0aCellulosic ethanol1 aSimone de Souza, Fábio0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Oct., v. 111 p.771-780dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01445naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014100162300001600303520027600319592002800595650002200623650002300645650002300668650002600691650004400717700002100761700002300782700002200805700002200827700002000849700001700869773011700886856004801003990002301051852000901074655001201083IND4474925020221122092254.0120907e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447492502DNAL7 a10.1134/S10703284120900722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopov, L.

In this Perspective we present an overview of blood clotting with particular emphasis on the dynamics of biopolymers involved during the first stages of the clotting cascade. We cover from single molecule dynamics in multiple types of flows to complete plug assembly. Different interaction models between monomers and between monomers and platelets/colloids are considered. The many-body polymer and colloid dynamics during the assembly of blood-clotting scaffolds is discussed in detail. Throughout this Perspective insights and connections between the natural system and synthetic systems are highlighted. We finalize by presenting a list of emerging areas inspired by the clotting process. These emerging areas not only present new and interesting scientific challenges but also offer the possibility of controlling and tailoring the properties of polymer systems in novel ways.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3ablood coagulation 3ablood platelets 3acolloids 3adrugs 3amodels0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Mar. 11, v. 47, no. 5 p.1503-1513dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma40077683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013600172300001600308520107500324592002801399650005301427650001401480650001301494650001801507650001701525650001501542650002001557650002301577651001801600653002001618653001101638653001401649653001301663700002101676700002501697700002201722700002401744773012001768856005101888852000901939655001201948IND50088614520221119071148.0140414e20130403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008861452DNAL7 a10.1080/19320248.2013.7866642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbertson, Ann M.10aReady-to-Eat Cereal Intake is Associated with an Improved Nutrient Intake Profile among Food Insecure Children in the United States  ap. 200-220.  aFood insecurity affects a significant percentage of US children. Food insecurity affects households through limited intake and by reducing dietary quality. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between consumption of ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal and nutrient intake, the Healthy Eating Index, and adiposity by food secure status in children. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2008 were analyzed to categorize children ages 4 to 12 as either food secure or not food secure and as either those who eat cereal or those who do not eat cereal. Results indicated that cereal consumption was associated with a better nutrient intake profile and Healthy Eating Index for food secure and nonsecure children. Enhanced nutrient intake was greater among the food insecure children who ate cereal relative to food insecure children who did not eat cereal. These results suggest that access to foods rich in nutrition but low in cost, such as RTE cereal, may positively impact the nutritional effects of food insecurity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadiposity 3achildren 3afood security 3ahealthy diet 3ahouseholds 3anutrient intake 3aready-to-eat foods 3aUnited States 0afood insecurity 0acereal 0anutrition 0achildren1 aFranko, Debra L.1 aThompson, Douglas R.1 aTuttle, Charlotte1 aHolschuh, Norton M.0 tJournal of hunger & environmental nutrition.g2013 Apr. 3, v. 8, no. 2 p.200-220dTaylor & Francisx1932-02567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19320248.2013.786664  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010200175300001400277520207700291592002802368650002202396650002002418650001002438650000902448650001802457650001202475650001502487650001302502650001402515650001002529650001602539650001202555650001402567653001402581653002002595653002102615653002102636653001702657773014902674856008602823852000902909655001202918IND60584093520221120150343.0190214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058409352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAldredge, Robert A.10aIncubation onset maintains survival of most embryos and growth and survival of late-hatched young  ap. 35-43.  aHatching asynchrony occurs primarily as a consequence of the timing of embryonic development. Despite over 50 years of study, it is unclear why, ultimately, most birds initiate embryonic development (incubation) before all eggs are laid. One hypothesis focuses on prehatching (embryo) survival and predicts that early incubation maximizes embryo survival by reducing exposure of unincubated eggs (egg viability hypothesis). Another set of hypotheses focuses on posthatching growth and survival and predicts that females time incubation to maximize the number or quality of hatched offspring that fledge (adaptive hatching pattern hypotheses). I experimentally manipulated when females could begin incubation to test how timing of embryonic development influences prehatching survival and posthatching growth and survival in the house sparrow, Passer domesticus. Despite high embryo survival in both naturally asynchronous and experimentally synchronized nests, early incubation appeared to maximize embryo survival in all but the earliest-laid eggs, suggesting that house sparrows begin incubation too late to maximize survival of all embryos. Early incubation had little effect on overall (i.e. mean) patterns of posthatching growth and survival. However, early incubation increased the initial variation in offspring size because last-hatched young were relatively small when all eggs had completed hatching. Nestlings that were small at hatch completion grew slowly and exhibited a reduced probability of survival, suggesting that house sparrows begin incubation too early to maximize growth and survival of hatched offspring. These results suggest that timing of incubation neither maximizes embryo survival nor maximizes posthatching growth and survival. Instead, early incubation appears to be a trade-off between maintaining both embryo survival and growth and survival of late-hatched offspring. Thus, house sparrow females likely time incubation as an adaptive strategy to maximize the number of embryos that survive the incubation and nestling periods to fledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasser domesticus 3aanimal behavior 3abirds 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3afledglings 3ahatching 3anestlings 3anests 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3aviability 0aaltricial 0abrood reduction 0ahatching failure 0aincubation onset 0areproduction0 tAnimal behaviour.g2017 Dec., v. 134 p.35-43dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147242010200167245010700269300001600376520173100392592002802123650001802151650001502169650001502184650002102199650000902220650002602229650001302255650002202268650001302290650002102303650002502324650001802349650001602367650000902383700001902392700001802411700001702429773011702446856008102563852000902644655001202653IND50073225220221116182244.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007322522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-014-0777-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVolkmer, Thomas10aEinfluss der Hitze-Druck-Dämpfung auf mechanische und physikalische Eigenschaften von Stieleiche10aInfluence of heat pressure steaming (HPS) on the mechanical and physical properties of common oak wood  ap. 249-259.  aCommon oak (Quercus robur) was thermally treated applying a heat pressure steaming procedure. Physical and mechanical properties of treated and untreated samples were investigated extensively. Swelling, water absorption, water vapour resistance, porosity and thermal conductivity were tested and the mechanical properties of tensile, bending and compression strength and of Young’s modulus (static and dynamic) as well as Poisson’s ratio and shear modulus were determined. The tests were carried out in the standard climate 20 °C and 65 % relative humidity and also in all three anatomical main directions: longitudinal, radial and tangential. The equilibrium moisture content at 20 °C and 65 % relative humidity for HPS (heat pressure steamed) oak (determined in adsorption test) was 6.7 % and for untreated oak 9.1 %. Swelling in longitudinal direction was not affected: a reduction of 17 and 10 % could be observed in radial and tangential direction, respectively. The porosity of the treated samples was 53.9 % in comparison to the untreated samples with 51.0 %. The thermal conductivity depending on the modification procedure changed only slightly which was related to the different densities of the samples. The water vapour resistance of the modified samples increases compared to the untreated samples. The values are double (dry-cup) respectively three times (wet-cup) higher than those of the reference samples. The elastic properties were not influenced by heat pressure steaming.

Two hundred and fifty-one-day-old male broiler chicks were randomly allotted into five experimental groups (five replicates/group, ten chicks/replicate): 1st group—basal diet with no additives (control group), 2nd group—basal diet complemented with CuSO₄ (300 mg/kg diet), 3rd group—basal diet with CuSO₄ (300 mg/kg diet) + vitamin C (250 mg/kg diet), 4th group—basal diet with CuSO₄ (300 mg/kg diet) + vitamin E (250 mg/kg diet), and 5th group—basal diet with CuSO₄ (300 mg/kg diet) + vitamin C (250 mg/kg diet) + vitamin E (250 mg/kg diet) for a 42 day feeding period. The results showed a significant reduction in red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and hematocrit values as well as total leukocyte counts (WBCs), lymphocyte, heterophil, and monocyte counts in the CuSO₄-intoxicated birds (2.42 × 10⁶/µL, 9.54 g/dL, 26.02%, 15.80 × 10³/µL, 7.86 × 10³/µL, 5.26 × 10³/µL, and 1.18 × 10³/µL, respectively, at the 6th week) compared to (2.79 × 10⁶/µL, 10.98 g/dL, 28.46%, 21.07 × 10³/µL, 10.84 × 10³/µL, 7.12 × 10³/µL, and 1.60 × 10³/µL, respectively) in the control group. Moreover, CuSO₄-intoxicated birds showed hypoglycemia with a rise in serum uric acid and creatinine levels (122.68, 5.18, and 0.78 mg/dL at the 6th week) compared to (159.46, 4.41, and 0.61 mg/dL) in the control group. The CuSO₄ toxicity in birds induced oxidative stress, indicated by a high serum malondialdehyde level (MDA) and diminished activity of the antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) (2.01 nmol/mL, 37.66 U/mL, and 2.91 U/mL, respectively, at the 6th week) compared to (1.34 nmol/mL, 57.00 U/mL, 4.99 U/mL, respectively) in the control group. High doses of Cu exposure caused severe microscopic alterations in kidney architecture. The addition of vitamins C and E, singularly or in combination, displayed a beneficial effect in alleviating these harmful effects of Cu toxicity. These findings showed the possible mitigating impacts of dietary antioxidants on the hematobiochemical alterations, oxidative stress, and kidney damage induced by CuSO₄ toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3ablood serum 3acopper sulfate 3acreatinine 3adiet 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahematocrit 3ahemoglobin 3aheterophils 3ahistopathology 3ahypoglycemia 3akidneys 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amonocytes 3aoxidative stress 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3auric acid 3avitamin E1 aAbd El Hamied, Sahar S.1 aAhmed, Eman M.

Vegetative phase change is an intrinsic component of developmental programs in plants. Juvenile and adult vegetative tissues in grasses differ dramatically in their anatomical and biochemical composition affecting the utility of specific genotypes as animal feed and biofuel feedstock. The molecular network controlling the process of developmental transition is incompletely characterized. In this study, we used scoring for juvenile and adult epicuticular wax as an entry point to discover quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling phenotypic variation for the developmental timing of juvenile to adult transition in maize. We scored the last leaf with juvenile wax on 25 recombinant inbred line families of the B73 reference Nested Association Mapping (NAM) population and the intermated B73×Mo17 (IBM) population across multiple seasons. A total of 13 unique QTL were identified through genome-wide association analysis across the NAM populations, three of which have large effects. A QTL located on chromosome nine had the most significant SNPs within Glossy15, a gene controlling expression of juvenile leaf traits. The second large effect QTL is located on chromosome two. The most significant SNP in this QTL is located adjacent to a homolog of the Arabidopsis transcription factor, enhanced downy mildew-2, which has been shown to promote the transition from juvenile to adult vegetative phase. Overall, these results show that several major QTL and potential candidate genes underlie the extensive natural variation for this developmental trait.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aZea mays 3aadults 3achemical composition 3acorn 3aepicuticular wax 3agenes 3agenotype 3agrasses 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3aloci 3aphase transition 3aphenotypic variation 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atranscription factors1 aBeissinger, Timothy1 ade Leon, Natalia1 aKaeppler, Shawn0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2015 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.529-538dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-014-2451-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245008700173300001400260520181600274592002802090650002002118650001602138650001102154650001502165650001802180650001602198650001202214650001002226650001402236650001602250650001402266650001402280650001702294650001402311650002002325650001402345650002002359653001302379653001802392653001402410653001402424653001702438653001402455700002202469700002802491700001502519700001802534700006502552700002002617700005702637700001902694700002302713773011002736856009002846852000902936655001202945IND60611089020221116150021.0190405e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061108902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLueders, Imke10aProlonged luteal lifespan and pseudopregnancy in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus)  ap. 58-66.  aPseudopregnancy is a physiological occurrence in mammals which have copulation induced ovulation, but is rarely described in spontaneous ovulating species. In this study, three cases of prolonged luteal lifespan are reported in non-pregnant Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). Case 1 was a 25-year-old female that had produced three calves previously; Case 2 was a nulliparous and 32-year-old at the start of the pseudopregnancy episode; and Case 3 occurred in a 49-year-old nulliparous elephant. Serum progesterone metabolite concentrations remained elevated for 10 months in Case 1. Urinary progestagens were high for >16 months in Case 2 and for five months in Case 3. In Case 1, multiple persistent corpora lutea were visualized monthly by ultrasonography. In all three cases, uterine leiomyoma were present and progestagen concentrations decreased spontaneously. In Case 1, the elephant became pregnant 3 years later, whilst with Case 2, the female resumed estrous cycling normally, and for the Case 3 female, there was continuation with another prolonged luteal phase before ovarian function was purposely suppressed. These examples indicate that persistently elevated progestagen concentrations may not always be indicative of pregnancy in elephants. The reasons for prolonged luteal lifespan are not understood, although serum prolactin concentrations quantified in the Case 1 female were elevated compared to values from previous reports and two other herd mates. Furthermore, all three elephants had varying degrees of uterine pathologies. It is believed that the resulting damage to the endometrium may have led to a reaction similar to implantation, which includes prolactin secretion. Prolactin may exert luteotropic properties and is thought to initiate luteal rescue during pregnancy in elephants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElephas maximus 3ablood serum 3acalves 3acopulation 3acorpus luteum 3aendometrium 3afemales 3aherds 3alongevity 3ametabolites 3aovulation 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3aprolactin 3apseudopregnancy 3asecretion 3aultrasonography 0aElephant 0aCorpus luteum 0aPregnancy 0aLeiomyoma 0aProgesterone 0aProlactin1 aNiemuller, Cheryl1 aSteinmetz, Hanspeter W.1 aBouts, Tim1 aGray, Charlie1 aKnauf-Witzens, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7668-01351 aTaya, Kazuyoshi1 aWatanabe, Gen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7611-46781 aYamamoto, Yuki1 aOerke, Ann-Kathrin0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2018 Oct., v. 197 p.58-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01946naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011100211300001600322520067500338592002801013596004001041596006101081650001201142650001401154650001801168650004901186650001401235650002801249650000701277650001301284650001201297700006101309773012201370856008301492852000901575655001201584IND60792821320221118042219.0220924e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079282132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-021-00886-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRussell, Brandon P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1382-994510aChloride facilitates Mn(III) formation during photoassembly of the Photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex  ap. 283-288.  aThe Mn₄Ca oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in Photosystem II (PSII) is assembled in situ from free Mn²⁺, Ca²⁺, and water. In an early light-driven step, Mn²⁺ in a protein high-affinity site is oxidized to Mn³⁺. Using dual-mode electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we observed that Mn³⁺ accumulation increases as chloride concentration increases in spinach PSII membranes depleted of all extrinsic subunits. At physiologically relevant pH values, this effect requires the presence of calcium. When combined with pH studies, we conclude that the first Mn²⁺ oxidation event in OEC assembly requires a deprotonation that is facilitated by chloride.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE-SC0020119cbasic energy sciences  a822-HF17cherman frasch foundation for chemical research 3acalcium 3achlorides 3adeprotonation 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aoxygen evolving complex 3apH 3aresearch 3aspinach1 aVinyard, David J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8058-59980 tPhotosynthesis research.g2022 June, v. 152, no. 3 p.283-288dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-021-00886-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245015200209300001600361520142400377592002801801650001201829650002901841650001201870650002501882650002401907650002301931650001201954650001901966650001401985650002101999650002102020650001202041650000902053653002202062653002602084653002702110653001902137653001902156653002102175653002702196653001902223700006102242700005902303700002202362700002102384700002702405700006502432700002002497773011602517856008502633852000902718655001202727IND60622878020221120172425.0210114e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062287802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2018.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYguel, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6950-728610aBeyond species richness and biomass: Impact of selective logging and silvicultural treatments on the functional composition of a neotropical forest  ap. 528-534.  aTropical forests harbor the greatest terrestrial biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. The increase of human activities on these forests, among which logging, makes the conservation of biodiversity and associated services strongly dependent on the sustainability of these activities. However the indicators commonly used to assess the impact of forest exploitation, namely species richness and biomass, provide a limited understanding of their sustainability.Here, we assessed the sustainability of common forest exploitation in the Guiana Shield studying the recovery of two ecosystem services i.e. carbon storage and wood stock, and an ecosystem function i.e. seed dispersal by animals. Specifically, we compared total and commercial biomass, as well as functional composition in seed size of animal-dispersed species in replicated forest plots before and 27 years after exploitation. Species richness is also studied to allow comparison.While species richness was not affected by forest exploitation, total and commercial biomass as well as seed size of animal-dispersed species decreased 27 years after exploitation, similarly to forests affected by hunting. These results show that ecosystem services and function likely did not recover even at the lowest intensity of forest exploitation studied, questioning the sustainability of the most common rotation-cycle duration applied in the tropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3aecological function 3aecosystem services 3alogging 3aseed dispersal 3aseed size 3aspecies richness 3atropical forests 3atropics 3awood 0aSelective logging 0aHumid tropical forest 0aFunctional composition 0aSeed dispersal 0aCarbon storage 0aCommercial stock 0aAnthropogenic pressure 0aSustainability1 aPiponiot, Camille1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2629-09881 aMirabel, Ariane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3473-19821 aDourdain, Aurelie1 aHérault, Bruno,1 aGourlet-Fleury, Sylvie1 aForget, Pierre-Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7081-99221 aFontaine, Colin0 tForest ecology and management.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 433 p.528-534dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2018.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245019400176300001200370520156100382592002801943596007901971650003802050650001502088650001702103650001602120650001302136650001702149650001702166650001202183650001102195650002302206650001902229650001902248650001602267650000902283650002302292650002002315700001802335700002802353700002702381700002302408700003202431700006902463773013202532856008202664852000902746655001202755IND60662419920221117230517.0190910e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066241992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-019-2956-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordenave, César Daniel10aChlorophyll a fluorescence analysis reveals divergent photosystem II responses to saline, alkaline and saline–alkaline stresses in the two Lotus japonicus model ecotypes MG20 and Gifu-129  ap. 167.  aSaline and alkaline stresses affect more than 10% of the World’s arable land, limiting agricultural production. Salt-induced stress may affect the photosystem II (PSII) function, altering fluorescence emission. Therefore, changes in fluorescence are used to quantify and analyze abiotic stress responses in plants. So far, no study has focused on the response of PSII to saline, alkaline and saline–alkaline stresses in the model legume Lotus japonicus. For the saline, alkaline and saline–alkaline treatments, plants of the L. japonicus ecotypes MG20 and Gifu-129 were cultivated in sand with nutrient solution, added with NaCl and NaHCO₃ in different proportions. Growth, gas exchange, and chlorophyll a fluorescence transient kinetic and OJIP parameters were measured, and chlorophyll a and b were determined. The analysis of the kinetic of chlorophyll a fluorescence showed that NaCl-derived stress sources affect the photochemical events in PSII in both ecotypes, being this effect more evident under higher pH condition, whereas alkalinity per se has a mild or no effect on these events. The saline–alkaline stress induced a more severe effect on Gifu B-129, compared with Miyakojima MG20, whereas NaCl improved primary photochemistry in MG20. Our results allow us to accept the hypothesis that both ecotypes deploy differential responses under the three stressful treatments and that the saline–alkaline stress causes higher damage levels than saline and alkaline stresses alone in relation with structures and sub-processes of the PSII.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT-2007-02034cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aalkalinity 3aarable soils 3achlorophyll 3aecotypes 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3alegumes 3amodels 3anutrient solutions 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3asalt stress 3asand 3asodium bicarbonate 3astress response1 aRocco, Rubén1 aMaiale, Santiago Javier1 aCampestre, Maria Paula1 aRuiz, Oscar Adolfo1 aRodríguez, Andrés Alberto1 aMenéndez, Ana Bernardina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4545-73300 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2019 Sept., v. 41, no. 9 p.167-167dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33879x0137-58817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-019-2956-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015400172520188900326592002802215650001802243650002102261650002702282650001302309650001702322650001902339650001802358650001402376650002102390650001002411650001702421650001502438650001302453653001802466653001102484653001302495653001102508653001402519700002202533700002002555700002202575700005502597700006102652700006402713700002302777700001802800700002102818700002202839700002202861700002402883773010402907856008503011852000903096655001203105IND60707360220221122061923.0220228e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070736022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1099732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomson, Errol M.10aSelf-rated stress, distress, mental health, and health as modifiers of the association between long-term exposure to ambient pollutants and mortality  aIndividual and neighbourhood-scale socioeconomic characteristics modify associations between exposure to air pollution and mortality. The role of stress, which may integrate effects of social and environmental exposures on health, is unknown. We examined whether an individual's perspective on their own well-being, as assessed using self-rated measures of stress and health, modifies the pollutant-mortality relationship. The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-mortality cohort includes respondents from surveys administered between 2001 and 2012 linked to vital statistics and postal codes from 1981 until 2016. Annual fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and ozone (O₃) exposure estimates were attached to a sample of cohort members aged 30–89 years (n = 398,300 respondents/3,848,400 person-years). We examined whether self-rated stress, distress, mental health, and general health modified associations between long-term exposure to each pollutant (three-year moving average with one-year lag) and non-accidental mortality using Cox survival models, adjusted for individual- (i.e. socioeconomic and behavioural) and neighbourhood-scale covariates. In fully-adjusted models, the relationship between exposure to pollutants and mortality was stronger among those with poor self-rated mental health, including a significant difference for NO₂ (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.15, 95% CI 1.06–1.25 per IQR) compared to those with very good/excellent mental health (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.08; Cochran's Q = 4.01; p < 0.05). Poor self-rated health was similarly associated with higher pollutant-associated HRs, but only in unadjusted models. Stress and distress did not modify pollutant-mortality associations. Poor self-rated mental and general health were associated with increased mortality attributed to exposure to ambient pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3achronic exposure 3ademographic statistics 3adistress 3ahazard ratio 3ahealth surveys 3amental health 3amortality 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aresearch 0aAir pollution 0aStress 0aDistress 0aHealth 0aMortality1 aChristidis, Tanya1 aPinault, Lauren1 aTjepkema, Michael1 aColman, Ian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5924-02771 aCrouse, Daniel L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8824-31081 avan Donkelaar, Aaron1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2998-85211 aMartin, Randall V.1 aHystad, Perry1 aRobichaud, Alain1 aMénard, Richard,1 aBrook, Jeffrey R.1 aBurnett, Richard T.0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Dec., v. 191 p.109973-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1099733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03882naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013900187300001600326520200300342592002802345650001502373650001002388650001602398650001202414650002102426650001602447650002202463650001102485650001502496650001702511650001002528650001402538650002302552650003002575650001502605650001602620650002302636650004302659650001202702650001502714650001302729650002502742650001602767650001502783650001502798650001302813650001702826650001502843650002202858653001902880653000802899653001402907653001402921653001602935700002002951700001902971773013902990856008203129852000903211655001203220IND60517519520221117060548.0190728e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051751952DNAL7 a244955272pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651130039112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuohy, Kieran M.10a‘The way to a man's heart is through his gut microbiota’ – dietary pro- and prebiotics for the management of cardiovascular risk  ap. 172-185.  aThe human gut microbiota has been identified as a possible novel CVD risk factor. This review aims to summarise recent insights connecting human gut microbiome activities with CVD and how such activities may be modulated by diet. Aberrant gut microbiota profiles have been associated with obesity, type 1 and type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Transfer of microbiota from obese animals induces metabolic disease and obesity in germ-free animals. Conversely, transfer of pathogen-free microbiota from lean healthy human donors to patients with metabolic disease can increase insulin sensitivity. Not only are aberrant microbiota profiles associated with metabolic disease, but the flux of metabolites derived from gut microbial metabolism of choline, phosphatidylcholine and l-carnitine has been shown to contribute directly to CVD pathology, providing one explanation for increased disease risk of eating too much red meat. Diet, especially high intake of fermentable fibres and plant polyphenols, appears to regulate microbial activities within the gut, supporting regulatory guidelines encouraging increased consumption of whole-plant foods (fruit, vegetables and whole-grain cereals), and providing the scientific rationale for the design of efficacious prebiotics. Similarly, recent human studies with carefully selected probiotic strains show that ingestion of viable microorganisms with the ability to hydrolyse bile salts can lower blood cholesterol, a recognised risk factor in CVD. Taken together such observations raise the intriguing possibility that gut microbiome modulation by whole-plant foods, probiotics and prebiotics may be at the base of healthy eating pyramids advised by regulatory agencies across the globe. In conclusion, dietary strategies which modulate the gut microbiota or their metabolic activities are emerging as efficacious tools for reducing CVD risk and indicate that indeed, the way to a healthy heart may be through a healthy gut microbiota.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile salts 3ablood 3acholesterol 3acholine 3adigestive system 3afatty liver 3agerm-free animals 3agrains 3aguidelines 3ahealthy diet 3aheart 3aingestion 3ainsulin resistance 3aintestinal microorganisms 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amicrobial activity 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aovereating 3apatients 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolyphenols 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3ared meat 3arisk factors 3avegetables 3awhole grain foods 0aGut microbiota 0aCVD 0aProbiotic 0aPrebiotic 0aMetabolites1 aFava, Francesca1 aViola, Roberto0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2014 May, v. 73, no. 2 p.172-185dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651130039113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245008700169300001600256520161200272592002801884650002501912650002501937650001301962650001601975650001501991650001602006650000902022650001402031650001002045650001302055650002302068650001502091650002402106650001302130650001102143651001002154651001302164653001502177653000802192700001702200700001602217700001602233700001502249700002002264700001402284700001102298700001502309700001602324700005602340773011302396856009002509852000902599655001202608IND60611089120221116150049.0200503e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061108912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Kai10aTwo introduced crocodile species had changed reproductive characteristics in China  ap. 150-159.  aThe purpose of this study was to study the reproductive characteristics of the Nile crocodile and Siamese crocodiles after introduction into China since the time this occurred near the end of the last century. The data for the eggs and young crocodiles (recently hatched crocodiles) of two introduced species were collected at a Sanya crocodile breeding farm in Hainan. The characteristic variables of crocodile eggs were statistically analyzed, and the results indicated that: egg mass of the Nile and Siamese crocodile was significantly correlated with the egg length and width. Regression analyses were used to develop the linear equation between the egg length, egg width and egg mass. There was a strong positive correlation between the egg mass and initial weight of young crocodiles. The linear equation for assessing egg mass and initial weight of young crocodile was developed for regression analyses. There was no significant linear relationship between clutch size and egg characteristics. Mating time of the Nile crocodile in Hainan (November-April) and the spawning season (March-May) are significantly earlier than in the Zimbabwe region of origin. The average of clutch size and the mean size of eggs for Nile crocodiles in their native habitat is greater than the introduced region as indicated by analyzing data using a two-sample t-test. The Siamese crocodile spawning time was similar in the Hainan and Zimbabwe regions, but the size of clutches and the mean size of eggs in the introduced region were greater than in their native region as indicated by results using a two-sample t-test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocodylus niloticus 3aCrocodylus siamensis 3abreeding 3aclutch size 3acrocodiles 3aegg quality 3aeggs 3aequations 3afarms 3ahabitats 3aintroduced species 3aprovenance 3aregression analysis 3aspawning 3at-test 3aChina 3aZimbabwe 0aCrocodiles 0aEgg1 aWu, Mengjuan1 aZhang, Ying1 aZhang, Fang1 aWang, Huan1 aLiang, Juanjuan1 aYan, Peng1 aLi, En1 aYao, Liang1 aXu, Jinwang1 aWu, Xiaobing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0118-39080 tAnimal reproduction science.g2018 Sept., v. 196 p.150-159dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245009100179300001800270520136800288592002801656650002601684650001201710650001801722650001801740650001301758650001501771650003701786650001401823650001801837650001101855650006301866650003001929650002301959650002201982650003102004650002402035650001102059650002902070650003202099650006102131650004502192650002502237700002402262700002002286700002002306700002902326700002202355700002702377773013102404856004002535852000902575655001202584IND4468366220221118064508.0120423e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446836622DNAL7 a225172392pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.55222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrevenstuk, Tomás10aInhibitory activity of plumbagin produced by Drosera intermedia on food spoilage fungi  ap. 1638-1642.  aBACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the growth‐inhibiting efficacy of Drosera intermedia extracts (water, methanol and n‐hexane) against four food spoilage yeasts and five filamentous fungi strains responsible for food deterioration and associated with mycotoxin production, in order to identify potential antimycotic agents. RESULTS: The n‐hexane extract showed a broad activity spectrum against all tested microorganisms, followed, in activity, by the methanol and water extracts. The major component of the n‐hexane extract was purified using a solid‐phase extraction column and identified as plumbagin. Results show that high‐purity plumbagin can be produced from D. intermedia cultures following a simple and effective isolation procedure. A sample of purified plumbagin was tested against the same panel of microorganisms and high growth‐inhibiting capacity was observed. Minimum inhibitory concentrations less than 2 µg mL−1 were obtained against the filamentous fungi. In the case of the species Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger and A. flavus, activities comparable to miconazole were obtained. CONCLUSION: The results obtained provided evidence of the antimycotic activity of plumbagin, suggesting that D. intermedia could be the source of an interesting compound for the food industry as an alternative to preservatives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aDrosera 3afood industry 3afood spoilage 3amethanol 3amiconazole 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aplumbagin 3apreservatives 3ayeasts 2aAntifungal Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAspergillusxdrug effects 2aDroseraxchemistry 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFungixdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMiconazolexpharmacology 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aNaphthoquinonesxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aYeastsxdrug effects1 aGonçalves, Sandra,1 aDomingos, Telma1 aQuintas, Célia1 avan der Hooft, Justin JJ1 aVervoort, Jacques1 aRomano, A.q(Anabela),0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2012 June, v. 92, no. 8 p.1638-1642dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.5522  aDNAL 7aarticle01302naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245009900155300001800254520032900272592002800601650002300629650001100652650001800663650001400681700002300695700002300718700001800741700001800759773013000777856007200907852000900979655001200988IND60657538320221120182527.0190816e20040914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065753832DNAL7 a10.1039/b405100a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, J.

The physical factors that involve artificial incubation determine embryonic growth and hatching of broiler chicks, and have important implications for the poultry production chain and chick welfare. This study explored the effects of sound exposure on incubation responses (hatching, embryonic development and chick quality). 2. A 2 × 2 factorial experiment with the factors ‘sound pressure level’ (at 70 and 90 dB) and ‘species-specific vocalisations’ (at 75dB - 85dB) was performed in four experimental incubators (loaded with 90 eggs each) for eight consecutive cycles of incubation, totalling 2880 Cobb-500® broiler breeder eggs. 3. Embryonic growth was not influenced by any experimental factor, but the highest sound pressure level (90 dB) led to earlier hatching, higher hatchability, better chick quality and lower weight at hatching. Additional effects of species-specific vocalisations were found at 70 dB noise, which caused early hatching and better chick quality. 4. It was concluded that the loud noise found in commercial hatcheries (at 90 dB) can be beneficial. Furthermore, the presence of species-specific vocalisations could improve the hatching time and chick quality from experimental incubators (at 70 dB). However, this would not provide additional benefits in commercial hatcheries, due to the machinery noise masking them.  aThis work was supported by the Foundation for Research Support of the State of São Paulo.

We conceptualise healthy ageing within a life-course framework, separating healthy biological ageing (in terms of optimal physical and cognitive functioning, delaying the onset of chronic diseases, and extending length of life for as long as possible) from changes in psychological and social wellbeing. We summarise the findings of a review of healthy ageing indicators, focusing on objective measures of physical capability, such as tests of grip strength, walking speed, chair rises and standing balance, which aim to capture physical functioning at the individual level, assessing the capacity to undertake the physical tasks of daily living. There is robust evidence that higher scores on these measures are associated with lower rates of mortality, and more limited evidence of lower risk of morbidity, and of age-related patterns of change. Drawing on a research collaboration of UK cohort studies, we summarise what is known about the influences on physical capability in terms of lifetime socioeconomic position, body size and lifestyle, and underlying physiology and genetics; the evidence to date supports a broad set of factors already identified as risk factors for chronic diseases. We identify a need for larger longitudinal studies to investigate age-related change and ethnic diversity in these objective measures, the dynamic relationships between them, and how they relate to other component measures of healthy ageing. Robust evidence across cohort studies, using standardised measures within a clear conceptual framework, will benefit policy and practice to promote healthy ageing.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody size 3achronic diseases 3acognition 3acohort studies 3agenetics 3aissues and policy 3alifestyle 3alongitudinal studies 3amorbidity 3amortality 3amulticultural diversity 3arisk factors 3asocioeconomic status 3awalking 3aUnited Kingdom 0aLife course 0aEpidemiology 0aHealthy ageing 0aPhysical capability 0aCohort studies1 aKarunananthan, Sathya1 aBergman, Howard1 aCooper, Rachel0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2014 May, v. 73, no. 2 p.237-248dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651130039233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03545naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002700169245015000196300001600346500001500362520105800377592002801435650001301463650001201476650001701488650001201505650001001517650001901527650001701546650002801563650001701591650001601608650001901624650002201643650001901665650002401684650000901708650001101717650001201728650001001740650001301750650002001763650001701783650000901800650002101809650001701830650001301847650002601860650001701886650001401903650003001917650001601947650006301963650003002026650002602056650001002082650001602092650001402108653001902122653001302141653001902154653000802173653001602181653000802197653002602205653002002231653002102251653000902272653000802281653003202289653000802321653001102329700002602340700002402366700002602390700002102416773012402437856008502561852000902646655001202655IND60113915720221116152048.0190410e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011391572DNAL7 a238319502pmid7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnsari, Mohammad Wahid12aA critical review on fungi mediated plant responses with special emphasis to Piriformospora indica on improved production and protection of crops  ap. 403-410.  a2019-12-04  aThe beneficial fungi are potentially useful in agriculture sector to avail several services to crop plants such as water status, nutrient enrichment, stress tolerance, protection, weed control and bio-control. Natural agro-ecosystem relies on fungi because of it takes part in soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient acquisition, organic matter recycling, nutrient recycling, antagonism against plant pests, and crop management. The crucial role of fungi in normalizing the toxic effects of phenols, HCN and ROS by β-CAS, ACC demainase and antioxidant enzymes in plants is well documented. Fungi also play a part in various physiological processes such as water uptake, stomatal movement, mineral uptake, photosynthesis and biosynthesis of lignan, auxins and ethylene to improve growth and enhance plant fitness to cope heat, cold, salinity, drought and heavy metal stress. Here, we highlighted the ethylene- and cyclophilin A (CypA)-mediated response of Piriformospora indica for sustainable crop production under adverse environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3aphenols 3aheavy metals 3adrought 3afungi 3aplant response 3awater uptake 3asustainable agriculture 3aweed control 3aplant pests 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal movement 3aagroecosystems 3asoil organic matter 3aheat 3aauxins 3alignans 3acrops 3atoxicity 3acrop management 3aantioxidants 3acold 3astress tolerance 3abiosynthesis 3asalinity 3aenvironmental factors 3acyclophilins 3arecycling 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAgriculture 2aCrops, Agriculturalxmetabolismxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aCyclophilin Axmetabolism 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aFungi 2aMycorrhizae 2aSymbiosis 0aorganic matter 0aEthylene 0aCrop tolerance 0aROS 0aCyclophilin 0aACC 0aPiriformospora indica 0aCrop production 0aNutrient cycling 0ahkt1 0aHCN 0aAbiotic and biotic stresses 0aAMF 0aβ-CAS1 aTrivedi, Dipesh Kumar1 aSahoo, Ranjan Kumar1 aGill, Sarvajeet Singh1 aTuteja, Narendra0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2013 Sept., v. 70 p.403-410dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245007500165300001400240520110500254592002801359653001401387653002301401653001601424653001801440700001701458700001501475700001401490700002301504700001701527700002601544700001901570700001301589700001501602700002401617700001901641700001701660700001301677700002001690700001501710700001801725700001701743700001801760700001601778700001501794700001801809700002001827700002601847700001501873700001601888700001901904700001401923700001801937773010301955856008302058852000902141655001202150IND60554890420221120090400.0161025e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055489042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.msard.2016.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojas, J.I.10aDisease onset in familial and sporadic multiple sclerosis in Argentina  ap. 54-56.  aThe present study was carried out to assess if there is an anticipation of age at onset in younger generations of familial multiple sclerosis (FMS) vs. sporadic MS (SMS) in Argentina. Methods: multicenter study that included patients from 14 MS Centers of Argentina. Patients were considered as FMS if they had in their family at least one relative of first or second degree diagnosed with MS; otherwise, patients were considered to have SMS. We compared the age at onset between familial and sporadic cases as well as the age at onset between relatives from different generations in FMS vs. SMS. Results: 1333 patients were included, 97 of them were FMS (7.3%). A lower age at onset in the younger generations of FMS cases was found compared with older generations of FMS as well as. SMS cases (24.1±3.7 years vs. 30.3±5.7 years, and 32.4±9.4 respectively; p<0.001). No differences were observed between older generations of FMS vs. SMS cases (p=0.12). Conclusion: we observed an anticipation of age at onset of MS in younger generations of patients with FMS vs. older generations of FMS and SMS.  aPublisher supplied data 0aArgentina 0aMultiple sclerosis 0aFamilial MS 0aSouth America1 aPatrucco, L.1 aMIguez, J.1 aSinay, V.1 aCassara, F.

Then, each cluster is surrounded by a spherical envelope to take into account modeling and parameter uncertainties. To perform fault prognosis, the geolocation principal is used to predict the Remaining Useful Lifetime, where the Euclidean distance between normal and faulty clusters, the degradation direction and velocity are calculated. The obtained results, using real wind data, are evaluated using the Prognosis Horizon and the Relative Accuracy metrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethodology 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3arenewable energy sources 3awind 3awind turbines 0aWind turbine 0aFault prognosis 0aFault diagnosis 0aClustering 0aBond graph modeling1 aBenmoussa, S.1 aSanchez, R.0 tRenewable energy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0960-14817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008500171520179600256592002802052650001202080650002202092650001602114650002002130650000902150650001402159650005002173650002402223650001302247650001702260650001002277650001302287653001602300653000902316653002402325653001802349653003802367653001602405700006802421700002802489700002402517700002702541700002502568700002602593700002802619700002702647700002402674700002302698700002502721773010402746856008502850852000902935655001202944IND60707360420221122061917.0220228e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070736042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1099992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZykova, Maria V.10aNew artificial network model to estimate biological activity of peat humic acids  aThis article focuses on new method to estimate biological activity of peat humic acids (HAs) using artificial neural network (ANN) to process spectroscopic measurements in infrared and visible ranges. Conventional approaches generally rely on biological models and direct detection of chemical substances related to bioactivity. These methods proved to be accurate and reliable, but at the expense of speed and simplicity. Recently, a conception of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has been introduced and successfully implemented to predict effects of HAs on toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Our research stems from this conception, but employs multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to improve overall performance. The developed MLP model allowed us to estimate biological activity of the complete vertical peat cores collected from oligotrophic peat bog, located in southern taiga zone of West Siberia (north-eastern spurs of the Great Vasyugan Mire, 56°58′ N 82о36’ E). In total, 42 samples taken from the cores were collected. The protocol included spectroscopy (in infrared and visible ranges) and biological model with peritoneal activated macrophages as a reference method to directly measure biological activity of HAs. and discussion. Numerical experiments confirmed consistency of the measured and estimated bioactivity, coefficient of determination R2 = 0.97. These experiments also showed that the MLP model significantly outperforms conventional linear multiple regression models, mainly due to essential nonlinearity of structure-activity relationships. Our research demonstrates that biological activity of HAs extracted from peat samples can be estimated using an artificial neural network model trained on infrared and visible spectra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiberia 3abiological models 3amacrophages 3aneural networks 3apeat 3apeatlands 3aquantitative structure-activity relationships 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3aspectroscopy 3ataiga 3atoxicity 0aHumic acids 0aPeat 0aBiological activity 0aNetwork model 0aVisible and infrared spectroscopy 0aMacrophages1 aBrazovsky, Konstantin S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4779-98201 aVeretennikova, Elena E.1 aDanilets, Marina G.1 aLogvinova, Lyudmila A.1 aRomanenko, Sergey V.1 aTrofimova, Evgenia S.1 aLigacheva, Anastasia A.1 aBratishko, Kristina A.1 aYusubov, Mekhman S.1 aLyapkov, Alexey A.1 aBelousov, Michael V.0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Dec., v. 191 p.109999-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1099993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03103naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011600207300001300323520116700336592002801503650002701531650001801558650001301576650001501589650002101604650001801625650001001643650001401653650001501667650001801682650001601700650001301716653002201729653001501751653002701766653000801793653000801801653000901809653001301818653000701831653000801838653000901846653000701855653000701862653000801869653000701877653000901884653000801893653000701901653000701908653001301915653000801928653000801936700005701944700002702001700001902028700001902047700006002066700002802126700002502154700001802179773010602197856008102303852000902384655001202393IND60584093920221120161308.0171024e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058409392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2017.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrindade, Fábio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3415-204012aA fractionation approach applying chelating magnetic nanoparticles to characterize pericardial fluid's proteome  ap. 1-10.  aOwing to their close proximity, pericardial fluid (PF)’s proteome may mirror the pathophysiological status of the heart. Despite this diagnosis potential, the knowledge of PF's proteome is scarce. Large amounts of albumin hamper the characterization of the least abundant proteins in PF. Aiming to expand PF's proteome and to validate the technique for future applications, we have fractionated and characterized the PF, using N-(trimethoxysilylpropyl)ethylenediamine triacetic acid (EDTA)-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (NPs@EDTA) followed by a GeLC-MS/MS approach. Similarly to an albumin-depletion kit, NPs@EDTA-based fractionation was efficient in removing albumin. Both methods displayed comparable inter-individual variability, but NPs@EDTA outperformed the former with regard to the protein dynamic range as well as to the monitoring of biological processes. Overall, 565 proteins were identified, of which 297 (>50%) have never been assigned to PF. Moreover, owing to this method's good proteome reproducibility, affordability, rapid automation and high binding ability of NP@EDTA, it bears a great potential towards future clinical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aaffordability 3aalbumins 3aautomation 3abinding capacity 3afractionation 3aheart 3amagnetism 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3apericardium 3aproteome 0aPericardial fluid 0aProteomics 0aMagnetic nanoparticles 0aBCA 0aCAD 0aEDTA 0aEDTA-TMS 0aFA 0aFDR 0aFTIR 0aGO 0aID 0aIDA 0aLC 0aMARS 0aMES 0aMS 0aPF 0aSDS-PAGE 0aTEM 0aTOF1 aBastos, Paulo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1195-36111 aLeite-Moreira, Adelino1 aManadas, Bruno1 aFerreira, Rita1 aSoares, Sofia F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3172-54371 aDaniel-da-Silva, Ana L.1 aFalcão-Pires, Inês1 aVitorino, Rui0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 634 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2017.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245007300189300001600262520133400278592002801612650002201640650002101662650002001683650000901703650001001712650001601722650001501738650002101753650001601774650001201790650001901802650002501821650002201846650001701868650001901885651001901904653001901923653000901942653001401951653001401965653001501979653001801994653001402012700003002026700002202056700001502078700001802093700002802111700002102139700002002160700001802180773013902198856008202337852000902419655001202428IND60517519720221117060659.0190728e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051751972DNAL7 a245725022pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651130039352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Jonathan A.14aThe potential for dietary factors to prevent or treat osteoarthritis  ap. 278-288.  aOsteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease for which there are no disease-modifying drugs. It is a leading cause of disability in the UK. Increasing age and obesity are both major risk factors for OA and the health and economic burden of this disease will increase in the future. Focusing on compounds from the habitual diet that may prevent the onset or slow the progression of OA is a strategy that has been under-investigated to date. An approach that relies on dietary modification is clearly attractive in terms of risk/benefit and more likely to be implementable at the population level. However, before undertaking a full clinical trial to examine potential efficacy, detailed molecular studies are required in order to optimise the design. This review focuses on potential dietary factors that may reduce the risk or progression of OA, including micronutrients, fatty acids, flavonoids and other phytochemicals. It therefore ignores data coming from classical inflammatory arthritides and nutraceuticals such as glucosamine and chondroitin. In conclusion, diet offers a route by which the health of the joint can be protected and OA incidence or progression decreased. In a chronic disease, with risk factors increasing in the population and with no pharmaceutical cure, an understanding of this will be crucial.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburden of disease 3achronic diseases 3aclinical trials 3adiet 3adrugs 3afatty acids 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3aglucosamine 3aobesity 3aosteoarthritis 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3apopulation growth 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3aUnited Kingdom 0aOsteoarthritis 0aDiet 0aCartilage 0aBioactive 0aPolyphenol 0aPhytochemical 0aFlavonoid1 aHirst-Jones, Kimberley L.1 aDavidson, Rose K.1 aJupp, Orla1 aBao, Yongping1 aMacGregor, Alexander J.1 aDonell, Simon T.1 aCassidy, Aedín1 aClark, Ian M.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2014 May, v. 73, no. 2 p.278-288dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45480x1475-27197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651130039353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01559naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245010100129300001600230520060000246592002800846650001500874650001400889650001600903650001100919650002300930650001700953650002000970650001000990650001701000650002201017700002001039700001701059700001901076773010501095852000901200655001201209IND60709856820221120064938.0200908e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070985682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, S.

The hydrology characteristics of ecosystems mainly influenced plant ecological processes in water and salinity changes. In this paper, we analyzed the composition and characteristic of natural plant community, divided the plant community classes and discussed the effect of water and salinity gradients on plant species and community classes in Ejina Desert Oasis. The results demonstrated that Populus euphratica, Tamarix chinensis and Phragmites communis were the most important plant species that had the highest important values among forest, shrubs and herbaceous. Six plant community patterns were classified by cluster analysis in Ejina Desert Oasis. Species richness and species diversity were the highest near West River and East River channels of the core oasis area. The distributions of plant community were mainly influenced by the following factors: distance from river channel, groundwater level, soil water content, soil salinity and groundwater salinity. The water and salinity factors, which controlled the distributions of plant, were the main driving forces for ecosystem succession. The plant community succession is becoming toward the type of shrub + herb or low shrub with very drought-tolerant from the type of forest + shrub + herb with tall and high water consumption, when habitat conditions change from good to poor. The water gradients had more significant and more directed effect than salinity gradients on plant species and communities.  aPublisher supplied data  a41101026cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a91025002cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 201389cInternational Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship Program  aNo. 29Y128881cWest Light Foundation of The Chinese Academy of Sciences  aNo. 20110490863cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation 3aPhragmites australis 3aPopulus euphratica 3aTamarix chinensis 3acluster analysis 3acommunity structure 3adrought tolerance 3aecological succession 3aecosystems 3aforest types 3ahabitats 3aoases 3aplant communities 3arivers 3ashrubs 3asoil salinity 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspecies diversity 3awater salinity 3awater table 3aChina1 aFeng, Qi1 aZhang, Lu1 aSi, Jianhua1 aChang, Zongqiang1 aYu, Tengfei1 aGuo, Rui0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Jan., v. 75, no. 2 p.138-138dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4823-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245014000153300001400293520137500307592002801682650002501710650002301735650002401758650004601782650002401828650001601852650001601868650001001884650002301894650001301917650001901930650000801949650001401957650001401971650001001985650002101995653002102016653001902037653002502056653002002081653002502101700001802126700001802144700002302162700001702185773009102202856007102293852000902364655001202373IND60120183720221120105300.0150129s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012018372DNAL7 a10.1071/CP140242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Caiyun10aPhenotypic effects of additional chromosomes on agronomic and photosynthetic traits of common wheat in the background of Chinese Spring  ap. 32-41.  aWheat alien chromosome addition lines possess abundant genetic resources and they are usually used for transferring desired genes or traits into wheat. The screening and characterisation of addition lines for target traits is one of the prerequisites for efficient utilisation of the alien chromosomes. In order to understand the properties and potential utilisation of wheat addition lines, the effects of additional chromosomes on agronomic and photosynthetic traits of common wheat were evaluated using 34 addition lines with the same genetic background of Chinese Spring. The results showed that most of the alien chromosomes decreased plant height (61.8%) and grain number per spike (47.1%), whereas some increased spike length and tiller number. Alien chromosomes of Agropyron intermedium G, Elymus trachycaulus T5HL5HL, El. trachycaulus 5SS and Haynaldia villosa 1V performed well in improving yield components. None of the alien chromosomes studied had negative effects on photosynthetic traits. Higher net photosynthetic rates were observed in Aegilops umbellulata 5U, El. trachycaulus 5H and rye 1R addition lines. Regarding seedling traits, 21 lines (61.8%) showed improvement in different root traits, whereas 26.5% of the chromosomes decreased coleoptile length. Addition lines with better performance for some specific traits were identified and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegilops umbellulata 3aDasypyrum villosum 3aElymus trachycaulus 3aThinopyrum intermedium subsp. intermedium 3achromosome addition 3achromosomes 3acoleoptiles 3agenes 3agenetic background 3apastures 3aphotosynthesis 3arye 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3awheat 3ayield components 0aalien chromosome 0agenetic effect 0agermplasm evaluation 0aseedling traits 0ayield-related traits1 aYang, Zhiyuan1 aChen, Xiaojie1 aTsujimoto, Hisashi1 aHu, Yin-Gang0 tCrop & pasture science.g2015, v. 66, no. 1 p.32-41dCSIRO Publishingx1836-09477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP140243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014100168300001800309520163300327592002801960650005001988650001202038650001602050650001802066650000802084650002202092650002502114650001102139650001102150651001802161700001702179700001602196700001802212773012702230856008202357852000902439655001202448IND60579787120221121224003.0180619e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057978712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-016-3417-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollow, ThomasW.10aHow well can the observed Arctic sea ice summer retreat and winter advance be represented in the NCEP Climate Forecast System version 2?  ap. 1651-1663.  aThe capability of a numerical model to simulate the statistical characteristics of the summer sea ice date of retreat (DOR) and the winter date of advance (DOA) is investigated using sea ice concentration output from the Climate Forecast System Version 2 model (CFSv2). Two model configurations are tested, the operational setting (CFSv2CFSR) which uses initial data from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, and a modified version (CFSv2PIOMp) which ingests sea ice thickness initialization data from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) and includes physics modifications for a more realistic representation of heat fluxes at the sea ice top and bottom. First, a method to define DOR and DOA is presented. Then, DOR and DOA are determined from the model simulations and observational sea ice concentration from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Means, trends, and detrended standard deviations of DOR and DOA are compared, along with DOR/DOA rates in the Arctic Ocean. It is found that the statistics are generally similar between the model and observations, although some regional biases exist. In addition, regions of new ice retreat in recent years are represented well in CFSv2PIOMp over the Arctic Ocean, in terms of both spatial extent and timing. Overall, CFSv2PIOMp shows a reduction in error throughout the Arctic. Based on results, it is concluded that the model produces a reasonable representation of the climatology and variability statistics of DOR and DOA in most regions. This assessment serves as a prerequisite for future predictability experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Aeronautics and Space Administration 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3aheat transfer 3aice 3asimulation models 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3awinter 3aArctic region1 aWang, Wanqiu1 aKumar, Arun1 aZhang, Jinlun0 tClimate dynamics.g2017 Sept., v. 49, no. 5-6 p.1651-1663dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3417-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013100195300001600326500002000342520149900362592002801861650001701889650001101906650001801917650001101935650000901946650002001955650001601975650001301991650002302004700001802027700005602045773013702101856007402238852000902312655001202321IND60772544620221122231341.0220404e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077254462DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.131432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, TW1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1252-059110aWhat can we learn from over a decade of testing bats in New South Wales to exclude infection with Australian bat lyssaviruses?  ap. 172-180.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAustralian Bat lyssaviruses (ABLV) are known to be endemic in bats in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. These viruses pose a public health risk because they cause a fatal disease in humans that is indistinguishable from classical rabies infection. All potentially infectious contact between bats and humans, or between bats and domestic animals, should be investigated to assess the risk of virus transmission by submitting the bat for testing to exclude ABLV infection. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of ABLV infection in bats submitted for testing in NSW and to document any trends or changes in submission and bat details. We examined all submissions of samples for ABLV testing received by the NSW Department of Primary Industries Virology Laboratory for the 13‐year period between 1 May 2008 and 30 April 2021. Fifty‐four (4.9%) ABLV‐infected bats were detected, with some clustering of positive results. This is greater than the prevalence estimated from wild‐caught bats. All bats should be considered a potential source of ABLV. In particular, flying‐foxes with rabies‐like clinical signs, and with known or possible human interaction, pose the highest public health risk because they are more likely to return a positive result for ABLV infection. This review of ABLV cases in NSW will help veterinarians to recognise the clinical presentations of ABLV infection in bats and emphasises the importance of adequate rabies vaccination for veterinarians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPteropodidae 3ahumans 3apublic health 3arabies 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3avaccination 3avirology 3avirus transmission1 aFinlaison, DS1 aKirkland, PD1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8026-41850 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2022 Apr., v. 100, no. 4 p.172-180dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.131433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03420naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006600155245015600221300001600377520177200393592002802165650001002193650002102203650001902224650002302243650001302266650001102279650002302290650002702313650002002340650002002360650002202380650001402402650001002416650001902426650001802445650002302463650001202486650001402498653001802512653002102530700006502551700007102616700002702687773011302714856009002827852000902917655001202926IND60611089320221116145957.0200503e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061108932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Hidalgo, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6787-000610aSupplementation of freezing/thawing media with GSK3 inhibitor alsterpaullone does not bypass the harmful effect of cryopreservation on boar spermatozoa  ap. 176-183.  aFrozen-thawed boar sperm have less motility and fertility capacity in comparison to fresh sperm. Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) contributes to sperm motility in fresh semen. In addition, GSK3 inhibition in boar spermatozoa in fresh semen improves motility variables. The role of GSK3 on boar cryopreserved sperm, however, is still unknown. The hypothesis in the present study was that GSK3 pathway inhibition by alsterpaullone (AST) could result in enhancement of the quality of sperm afer cryopreservation. Two different strategies were evaluated: i) AST supplementation to the freezing medium (AST + Cryo); ii) AST supplementation after sperm thawing (AST + Thaw). Sperm motility was evaluated using the CASA system and different sperm quality variables were evaluated using flow cytometry, as well as amount of GSK3 phosphorylation of thawed spermatozoa after 30 and 90 min incubation at 38.5 °C. Results indicate that AST supplementation had detrimental effects on sperm viability (live spermatozoa) and mitochondrial membrane potential when it was added after thawing (P < 0.05) The AST supplementation after thawing, however, had a protective effect on plasma membrane lipid disorganization (P < 0.05). The percentage of motile spermatozoa was not modified by AST supplementation. Nonetheless, after 30 min post-thawing, STR and LIN variables (related to straightness of the movement) as well as the percentage of rapid lineal spermatozoa were increased with both AST supplementation protocols. The GSK3α phosphorylation was not modified through the incubation time in boar thawed sperm. In summary, results do not support the idea of adding AST to the cryopreservation/thawing medium to improve boar sperm quality after cryopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboars 3acryopreservation 3aflow cytometry 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3afreezing 3alipids 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3aprotective effect 3aprotocols 3asemen 3asperm motility 3asperm quality 3atau-protein kinase 3athawing 3aviability 0aSperm quality 0aCryopreservation1 aBragado, María Julia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7770-07751 aGarcía-Marín, Luis Jesús1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1795-73811 aGil Anaya, María Cruz0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2018 Sept., v. 196 p.176-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2018.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03572naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245014200215300001600357520180900373592002802182650001302210650001202223650001602235650001902251650001602270650001102286650002202297650002802319650001202347650002302359650001702382650002002399650001102419650001502430650001802445650001502463650001302478650001402491650003502505651001102540653002302551653003502574653002302609653001202632653001902644653001002663700002102673700002402694700002402718700002202742700002702764773009702791856008502888852000902973655001202982IND60568682420221118224001.0180831e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056868242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbarelli, Juliana Q.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5856-619210aProduct diversification in the sugarcane biorefinery through algae growth and supercritical CO2 extraction: Thermal and economic analysis  ap. 776-785.  aThe sugarcane sector in Brazil has undergone a major modernization in the last thirty years. Embracing the biorefinery concept, this sector is investigating bioproduct diversification and mostly putting a lot of effort and investment on second generation ethanol production. In this context, the investigation of the integration of a third generation biofuel production using microalgae to the sugarcane biorefinery seems an important starting point. This study evaluates the integration of microalgae growth and processing to a sugarcane biorefinery producing first and second generation ethanol using process simulation tools. Microalgae are cultivated using CO2 produced during fermentation of ethanol and it is processed using supercritical fluid extraction technology in order to obtain lipids rich in high added-value compounds, carotenoids. The results showed that the integration of microalgae biomass processing without previously drying with the sugarcane biorefinery is not attractive from the thermo-economic point. When considering the extraction of dried microalgae the extraction process could be thermal integrated to the sugarcane biorefinery producing ethanol without the need of buying external fuel. The amount of CO2 used as solvent to the supercritical fluid extraction was the main factor that influenced the economic viability of the process. When microalgae pretreatment by cell disruption or co-solvent extraction was considered, it was possible to decrease the amount of CO2 used in the process and an increase in process yields was consequently achieved. The use of a co-solvent in the extraction increased in 1.4 and 2.4 times lipids and carotenoids extraction, respectively, and presented a lower investment when comparing with microalgae extraction without cell disruption.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3acarbon dioxide 3acarotenoids 3adrying 3aeconomic analysis 3aeconomic sustainability 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afuel production 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3amodernization 3apurchasing 3asolvents 3asugarcane 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3aBrazil 0aProcess simulation 0aSupercritical fluid extraction 0aCellulosic ethanol 0aBiofuel 0aPinch analysis 0aAlgae1 aSantos, Diego T.1 aEnsinas, Adriano V.1 aMarechal, François1 aCocero, María J.1 aMeireles, M.

Modeling studies have implicated wind-evaporation-SST (WES) feedback as the primary driver of the AMM’s evolution across the Atlantic basin; however, a robust coupling of the SST and winds has not been shown in observations. This study examines observed AMM growth, propagation, and decay as a result of WES interactions. Investigation of an extended maximum covariance analysis shows that boreal wintertime atmospheric forcing generates positive SST anomalies (SSTA) through a reduction of surface evaporative cooling. When the AMM peaks in magnitude during spring and summer, upward latent heat flux anomalies occur over the warmest SSTs and act to dampen the initial forcing. In contrast, on the southwestern edge of the SSTA, SST-forced cross-equatorial flow reduces the strength of the climatological trade winds and provides an anomalous latent heat flux into the ocean, which causes southwestward propagation of the initial atmosphere-forced SSTA through WES dynamics. Additionally, the lead-lag relationship of the ocean and atmosphere indicates a transition from an atmosphere-forcing-ocean regime in the northern subtropics to a highly coupled regime in the northern tropics that is not observed in the southern hemisphere. CMIP5 models poorly simulate the latitudinal transition from a one-way interaction to a two-way feedback, which may explain why they also struggle to reproduce spatially coherent interactions between tropical Atlantic SST and winds. This analysis provides valuable insight on how meridional modes act as links between extratropical and tropical variability and focuses future research aimed at improving climate model simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of covariance 3abasins 3aclimate models 3acooling 3aheat transfer 3asimulation models 3aspring 3asubtropics 3asummer 3atrade winds 3atropics 3awinter1 aDeFlorio, MichaelJ.1 aMiller, ArthurJ.1 aXie, Shang-Ping0 tClimate dynamics.g2017 Sept., v. 49, no. 5-6 p.1665-1679dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3895934x0930-75757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3411-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245017000161300002000331520168600351592002802037650001102065650002102076650002102097650001702118650002802135650001602163650001702179650001102196650001302207650000902220650001902229650001602248650001302264650001602277650001302293650001102306653001602317653002702333653002802360653001202388653001702400700002002417700001302437700001302450700001902463700001702482700001902499773012902518856007802647852000902725655001202734IND60570017120221119043822.0170627e20170621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057001712DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b019542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiu-Tong10aPhotothermal Conversion Triggered Precisely Targeted Healing of Epoxy Resin Based on Thermoreversible Diels–Alder Network and Amino-Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes  ap. 20797-20807.  aIn the present work, we demonstrated the recyclability and precisely targeted reparability of amino functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes–epoxy resin based on dynamic covalent Diels–Alder (DA) network (NH₂–MWCNTs/DA-epoxy) by exploring the photothermal conversion of CNTs to trigger the reactions of dynamic chemical bonds. The covalent cross-linked networks of NH₂–MWCNTs/DA-epoxy resin change their topology to linear polymer by thermally activated reverse Diels–Alder (r-DA) reactions at high temperatures, which endues the resin with almost 100% recyclability. The self-healing property of the epoxy resin was confirmed by the complete elimination of cracks after the reconstruction of DA network induced by heating or near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. For heat-triggered self-healing process, heat energy may also act on those uninjured parts of the resin and cause the dissociation of the whole DA network. Therefore, redundant r-DA and DA reactions, which have no contribution to self-healing, are also triggered during thermal treatment, resulting in not only a waste of energy but also the deformation of the sample under external force. Meanwhile, for the NIR-triggered self-healing process, the samples can maintain well their original shape without observable deformation after irradiation. The NIR-triggered healing process, which uses MWCNTs as the photothermal convertor, have very good regional controllability by simply tuning the MWCNTs content, the distance from NIR laser source to sample, and the laser power. The injured samples can be locally repaired with high precision and efficiency without an obvious influence on those uninjured parts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical bonding 3acrosslinking 3acycloaddition reactions 3adeformation 3adissociation 3aenergy 3aepoxides 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3airradiation 3apolymers 3atemperature 3atopology 3awastes 0aepoxy resin 0aDiels−Alder reaction 0aphotothermal conversion 0arecycle 0aself-healing1 aJiang, Miao-Jie1 aWu, Gang1 aChen, Li1 aChen, Si-Chong1 aCao, Yu-Xiao1 aWang, Yu-Zhong0 tACS applied materials .g2017 June 21, v. 9, no. 24 p.20797-20807dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b019543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009000170520124800260592002801508650001701536650001601553650002701569650001501596650002001611650000901631650001301640650001301653650002001666653002801686653002201714653002701736700005401763700001901817700002401836773009801860856008701958852000902045655001202054IND60680000320221120230015.0200318e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068000032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1144822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Hailong10aUnique applications and improvements of reverse electrodialysis: A review and outlook  aReverse electrodialysis (RED) is a promising technology for extracting energy from salinity gradients. However, there are still barriers to the realization of its commercial application. Developing flexible methods of RED application is a feasible scheme. In this paper, we review and summarize unique RED applications in recent years. The review summarizes RED applications related to energy conversion, desalination technology, and water treatment and some improvements to standard RED. The electricity generated by RED or combined RED can be converted to hydrogen or other energy forms and stored in a battery for access at any time. RED heat engine expands RED application with conversion of waste heat to electricity. RED can be coupled with one or more desalination technologies to improve the power density of RED and minimize the influence of brine discharge from desalination technology on the environment. RED or combined RED can also be used for water treatment by direct or indirect reactions. The review also summarizes the improvements of electrodes, feed solutions, membranes and operation of membrane cell for RED. With the development of related technologies, RED will play an important role in an increasing number of fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3aelectrodes 3aelectrodialysis 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3asalinity 3awater treatment 0aReverse electrodialysis 0aEnergy conversion 0aWastewater remediation1 aWang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1699-85281 aPei, Yuansheng1 aCrittenden, John C.0 tApplied energy.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 262 p.114482-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1144823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013400162300001800296520139900314592002801713650001501741650002001756650002301776650001701799650001701816650001001833650001501843650001301858650001301871650001901884650002201903650001901925650001401944700001801958700001501976700002401991773010402015856007502119852000902194655001202203IND60578046320221117055300.0170811e20140311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057804632DNAL7 a10.1021/ma402078d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlunden, Bianca
M.10aSuperior Chemotherapeutic Benefits from the Ruthenium-Based Anti-Metastatic Drug NAMI-A through Conjugation to Polymeric Micelles  ap. 1646-1655.  aMacromolecular ruthenium complexes are a promising avenue to better, and more selective, chemotherapeutics. NAMI-A is a ruthenium(III) drug in Phase II clinical trials that has low cytotoxicity and is inactive against primary tumors. However, it displays both antiangiogenic and anti-invasive properties and has been shown to specifically target tumor metastases, preventing both development and growth. To increase the cytotoxicity and cell uptake of this promising drug, we designed a biocompatible amphiphilic block copolymer capable of self-assembling into polymeric micelles. An appropriate method for the synthesis of a macromolecular NAMI-A drug was identifiedthe polymerization of vinyl imidazole and subsequent addition of a ruthenium(III) precursor complex. The cytotoxicity of these polymeric moieties was tested on ovarian cancer A2780 and Ovcar-3 and pancreatic AsPC-1 cancer cell lines. On average, across the tested cell lines, a 1.5 times increase in toxicity was found for the NAMI-A copolymer micelles when compared to the NAMI-A molecule. Furthermore, the antimetastatic potential was assessed by evaluating the inhibitory effects on the migration and invasion of cells against three cell lines characterized by differing degrees of malignancy (MDA-MB-231 > MCF-7 > CHO). The NAMI-A micelles were shown to have an improved antimetastatic potential in comparison to NAMI-A.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3aclinical trials 3acomposite polymers 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3ametastasis 3amicelles 3amoieties 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3apolymerization 3aruthenium1 aRawal, Aditya1 aLu, Hongxu1 aStenzel, Martina H.0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Mar. 11, v. 47, no. 5 p.1646-1655dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma402078d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01311naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245012700133300001600260520039800276592002800674650001400702650001900716650001900735650001000754650002400764653000800788653002500796653002200821700002300843700001700866773010500883852000900988655001200997IND60709857020221120053939.0200908e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070985702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaudhari, S.

The maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) (MW) is a common and important pest of stored maize (Zea mays) worldwide, especially in tropical areas. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the MW have been analyzed previously in an F₂maize population. In this work, new germplasm-based F₆recombinant inbred line (RIL) families, derived from the cross of Population 84 and Kilima, were analyzed using insect bioassays during four seasons. The parameters analyzed for MW resistance were grain weight losses (GWL), adult progeny (AP), and flour production (FP). Composite interval mapping identified a total of 15 QTLs for MW parameters located on six chromosomes, explaining between 14 and 51 % of phenotypic variation (σₚ²) and 27 and 81 % of genotypic variation (σg²). The QTL obtained for GWL was located in bin 2.05, which explained 15 % of σₚ². For AP and FP, the QTLs were located on regions 1.09 and 2.05, explaining 7 and 15 % of σₚ², respectively. Comparative analysis between F₂and F₆families showed similarities in QTL localization; three main regions were co-localized in chromosomes 4.08, 10.04, and 10.07, where no resistance-associated genes have been reported previously. These regions could be used for a marker-assisted selection in breeding programs for MW resistance in tropical maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitophilus zeamais 3aZea mays 3aadults 3abioassays 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3acorn 3aflour 3agenes 3ainbred lines 3amarker-assisted selection 3apest resistance 3aphenotypic variation 3aprogeny 3aquantitative trait loci 3astorage insects 3astored grain 3aweight loss1 aWilliam, Manilal1 aBergvinson, David J.1 aGarcía-Lara, Silverio0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2015 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.411-419dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-014-2440-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01607naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013700168300001400305520061700319592002800936653003700964653002601001653002501027700002901052700001801081700002301099773010301122856008301225852000901308655001201317IND60554890720221120090319.0161025e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055489072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.msard.2016.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMathew, Thomas10aTrigeminal autonomic cephalalgia as a presenting feature of Neuromyelitis Optica: “A rare combination of two uncommon disorders”  ap. 73-74.  aNeuromyelitis Optica (NMO) can have atypical presentations like hiccups, vomiting, etc. which is classically described as the area postrema syndrome.

The polymers emitted fluorescence with quantum yields ranging from 0.2–14.8%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acopper 3afluorescence 3amodels 3amoieties 3aoptical properties 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aspectral analysis1 aSogawa, Hiromitsu1 aShiotsuki, Masashi1 aSanda, Fumio0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Mar. 11, v. 47, no. 5 p.1594-1603dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma402123w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245005500161300001600216520169500232592002801927650001701955650002101972650002001993650002202013650001302035650003702048650001402085650001502099650001402114650001802128650001202146650001202158650001902170650000902189650003502198650001202233700001502245700002202260700003102282700001802313773010802331856008102439852000902520655001202529IND60121338820221122062454.0150225e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012133882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-014-2441-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kai10aHeterotic groups of tropical indica rice germplasm  ap. 421-430.  aKEY MESSAGE : Four heterotic groups were identified for tropical indica rice germplasm to develop hybrid rice in the tropics based on two studies. Heterotic groups are of fundamental importance in hybrid crop breeding. This study investigated hybrid yield, yield heterosis and combining ability within and among groups based on genetic distance derived from single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. The main objectives of the study were to (1) evaluate the magnitude of yield heterosis among marker-based groups, (2) identify possible heterotic groups for tropical indica hybrid rice, and (3) validate heterotic patterns concluded from a previous study. Seventeen rice parents selected from improved indica germplasm from the tropics with high genetic divergence and 136 derived hybrids were evaluated in five environments. The hybrids had more yield than their parents with an average of 24.1 % mid-parent heterosis. Genotype × environment interaction was the major factor affecting variations in yield and yield heterosis, which raised a necessity and a challenge to develop heterotic rice hybrid adapted to different regions and seasons in the tropics. Yield, yield heterosis and combining ability were significantly increased in inter-group than in intra-group hybrids. Four heterotic groups and three promising hybridization patterns, which could be used in tropical hybrid rice breeding, were identified based on marker-based grouping, yield and yield heterosis analyses in the two studies. The study reveals that molecular markers analysis can serve as a basis for assigning germplasm into heterotic groups and to provide guidelines for parental selection in hybrid rice breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agermplasm 3aguidelines 3aheterosis 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aparents 3aplant breeding 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atropics1 aQiu, Fulin1 aLarazo, Wenceslao1 adela Paz, Madonna Angelita1 aXie, Fangming0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2015 Mar., v. 128, no. 3 p.421-430dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-014-2441-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012300174300001600297520131100313592002801624650002001652650001601672650002901688650002501717650001901742653001801761653001501779653003201794653001801826653002901844653002901873700006501902700001601967700001901983700002102002773009702023856008502120852000902205655001202214IND60568682620221118223936.0180831e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056868262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurán Medina, Olmo10aTurbulence analysis and multiscale correlations between synchronized flow velocity and marine turbine power production  ap. 314-327.  aThe correlation between the flow turbulence and the performances of a marine current turbine is studied. First, the incoming flow encountered in the flume tank is characterized in the framework of fully developed turbulent cascades in the inertial range. The Reynolds number, the Kolmogorov dissipation scale and the integral scale, are estimated from flow measurements. The intermittency of the turbulence is characterized in the lognormal multifractal framework, and the influence of the turbulent flow on the turbine power is assessed.The rotor speed control unit characteristics used for the turbine regulation induces non-negligible effects on the turbine behavior under fluctuations loads. Even if the power spectrum does not reveal any scale invariance, a multiscale analysis allows us to show the correlations between the turbulence time series and the power produced. The classical Mean Square Coherency function shows that for scales larger than 10 s, the upstream velocity and power have large correlations. In the framework of the Empirical Mode Decomposition method, such correlations are studied using the time-dependence intrinsic correlation analysis method. This method allows to zoom into time-frequency scales where the flow perturbations induced some modifications in power production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3acorrelation 3arenewable energy sources 3atime series analysis 3aturbulent flow 0aMarine energy 0aTurbulence 0aMultifractal energy cascade 0aIntermittency 0aTurbine power production 0aHigh frequency data rate1 aSchmitt, Francois G.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6733-05981 aCalif, Rudy1 aGermain, Greg,1 aGaurier, Benoît0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Nov., v. 112 p.314-327dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02143naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012300156300002000279520090300299592002801202650002301230650001101253650002101264650001201285650002201297650002501319650001301344650001401357650003301371650003701404700001701441700001601458700001301474700001401487700001801501773014301519856007401662852000901736655001201745IND60641867620221117084212.0190506e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064186762DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta06689e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Cuiping10aPreparation of three-dimensional nanosheet-based molybdenum disulfide nanotubes as anode materials for lithium storage  ap. 17000-17008.  aThree-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanosheet-based MoS₂ nanotubes are synthesized via a self-sacrificial template method. The MoO₃ nanorods as self-sacrificial templates are directly converted into MoS₂ nanotubes through a solvothermal sulfidation reaction. The MoS₂ nanotubes which are in a diameter range of 250–400 nm are systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, etc. The conversion mechanism of MoS₂ nanotubes from MoO₃ nanorods is also demonstrated. The as-prepared MoS₂ hollow nanostructure anodes exhibit a high reversible capacity of 1035 mA h g⁻¹ at 100 mA g⁻¹ over 130 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance suggests that the 3D hierarchical MoS₂ nanotubes can be promising candidate anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananorods 3ananotubes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aGuan, Wenmei1 aCui, Yanwei1 aChen, Yu1 aGao, Lvlv1 aHuang, Jiarui0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Nov. 1, v. 4, no. 43 p.17000-17008dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta06689e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245015500215500001900370520105900389592002801448650002801476650001601504650002301520650001301543650001401556653002201570653001501592653002501607700002201632700001701654700001901671700002001690700002101710773011101731856008501842852000901927655001201936IND60705485420221121004438.0201023e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070548542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1522752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakabatake, Tetsuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7420-194610aDiscovery of orthogonal synthesis using artificial intelligence: Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed one-pot synthesis of benzofuran and bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane scaffolds  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA synthetic route for the common intermediate, methyl 2-formylbenzofuran-7-carboxylate (7a), to efficiently assemble three bioactive benzofurans 4–6 was explored using the artificial intelligence system SYNSUP. Among the routes proposed by SYNSUP, we investigated a three-step synthesis of 7a using methyl 4-ally-3-oxohept-6-enoate (10). A new catalytic reaction was found in which 7a was directly obtained from 10 in a single step with a yield of 24%. It was found that this chemical yield could be increased to 74% when methyl 3-allyl-2-hydroxybenzoate (9a), an intermediate of the above one-pot transformation, was subjected to the catalytic process. In addition, in this catalytic process, 8a (76%) and 11 (77%) were each selectively synthesized from 10 by changing only the solvent. Therefore, we created a novel orthogonal synthesis of methyl 2-methylbenzofuran-7-carboxylate (8a) and methyl 9-oxobicyclo[3.3.1]nona-3,6-diene-1-carboxylate (11). Finally, the total syntheses of bioactive benzofurans 4–6 were completed smoothly using 7a and 8a.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3abenzofurans 3acatalytic activity 3asolvents 3asynthesis 0aPd(OAc)2 catalyst 0aBenzofuran 0aBicyclo[3.3.1]nonane1 aFujiwara, Keisuke1 aOkamoto, Sho1 aKishimoto, Ryo1 aKagawa, Natsuko1 aToyota, Masahiro0 tTetrahedron letters.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 61, no. 36 p.152275-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1522753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245009700158300001800255500000900273520162100282592002801903650001501931650001301946650000901959650001301968650002001981650001402001650000902015650002302024650002802047650002502075650002102100650001702121650001502138650002002153650001602173700002102189700001902210700001602229700002102245773022002266856008002486852000902566655001202575IND60666421120221120173637.0191028e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066642112DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq2014.01.00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jia10aAssessment of Selected Bioretention Blends for Nutrient Retention Using Mesocosm Experiments  ap. 1754-1763.  aepub  aThis study compares the performance of three bioretention media blends for N and P removal from simulated urban runoff in experimental mesocosms. TerraSolve, Biofilter, and “VT Mix” (Virginia Tech) were compared with and without vegetation at varying hydraulic residence times (HRTs). Adsorption isotherm experiments were also conducted. TerraSolve and VT Mix included water treatment residuals (WTRs), Biofilter and VT Mix included yard-waste compost (YWC), and TerraSolve included a mix of coir and peat. TerraSolve removed the highest amount of total P (>95%), which is attributed to the high quantity of WTRs. Results were similar for VT Mix, likely due to WTR content. Adsorption isotherms indicate a substantial difference due to this factor. Vegetative mesocosms were found to be less effective at P removal at an HRT of 6 to 12 h but not at an HRT of 24 h. VT Mix had the highest removal of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), significantly different than the other blends. Interactive effects with vegetation were observed, generally improving TKN removal at all HRTs, with the highest at 24 h. Substantial export of nutrients when using compost was not observed. The addition of YWC appeared to increase N removal, possibly by denitrification. It is recommended that bioretention media contain <10% fines, a source of amorphous Al for P adsorption, at least 3 to 5% total organic C in the form of a low P, relatively stable compost, and a minimum concentration of plant-available nutrients for establishment of vegetation. For systems that use HRT, optimum residence time is influenced by media composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acoir 3acomposts 3adenitrification 3anutrients 3apeat 3asorption isotherms 3atotal Kjeldahl nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3atotal phosphorus 3aurban runoff 3avegetation 3awater treatment 3ayard wastes1 aSample, David J.1 aOwen, James S.1 aLi, Jinling1 aEvanylo, Gregory0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2014 Sept., v. 43, no. 5 p.1754-1763dThe American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2014.01.00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245009700176520120700273592002801480650002301508650005201531650001001583650002301593650001601616650001101632650003001643650003501673650000901708650001301717650002701730650002601757650002201783653001501805653001301820653001501833653002301848700001401871700001501885700001401900700005101914700001801965700005401983773013202037856009002169852000902259655001202268IND60760293520221117225655.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076029352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1064992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuturi, Elishiba10aEffects of simeprevir on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in transgenic hACE2 mice  aIn a bid to contain the current COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, various countermeasures have been applied. To date, however, there is a lack of an effective drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Through molecular modelling studies, simeprevir, a protease inhibitor approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, has been predicted as a potential antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the causative agent of COVID-19. Here we assessed the efficacy of simeprevir against SARS-CoV-2 both in vitro in Vero E6 cells and in vivo in a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse model. The results showed that simeprevir could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC₅₀) of 1.41 ± 0.12 μM. In a transgenic hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, intraperitoneal administration of simeprevir at 10 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days failed to suppress viral replication. These findings collectively imply that simeprevir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and therefore do not support its application as a treatment against COVID-19 at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adrugs 3aetiological agents 3ahepatitis C 3ahumans 3aintraperitoneal injection 3amedian effective concentration 3amice 3apandemic 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aproteinase inhibitors 3avirus replication 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aCOVID-19 0aSimeprevir 0aAntiviral efficacy1 aHong, Wei1 aLi, Junhua1 aYang, Wan1 aHe, Jin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1456-82841 aWei, Hongping1 aYang, Hang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6750-14650 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2022 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.106499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1064993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011600169520143800285592002801723650000801751650001201759650001201771650001601783650001101799650002601810650003101836650002101867650001501888650002201903650001101925650001901936650001901955650001601974650001201990653001102002653003302013653001002046653002202056653001902078700001302097700001402110700001802124700001502142700002002157700001302177700001502190700001302205773010602218856008702324852000902411655001202420IND60752542020221121045941.0220531e20211205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075254202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1275842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Junye10aWalnut shell-derived porous carbon integrated with Ni-MOF/SPANI composites for high-performance supercapacitor  aIn this paper, novel hybrid nanomaterials constituting carbonized biomass materials derived from walnut shells and metal-organic framework (MOF) have been researched as a new class of renewable supercapacitor materials for electrochemical energy storage.

The specific capacitance of the obtained WS@Ni-MOF composite is up to 4 times that of the biochar at the current density of 1 Ag⁻¹. The connection of SPANI also obviously accelerates the transfer of electrolyte ions. The resulting specific capacitance could reach 14 times of the biochar and exhibit high cycle stability (retention rate of 90.4% after 20000 cycles). In addition, the assembled asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) shows a high energy density of 34.79 Whkg⁻¹ at the power density of 824 Wkg⁻¹. This work provides a brilliant renewable candidate for the excellent energy storage device and a promising route design strategy for preparation of high performance and long life electrode materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3aheat treatment 3apolyaniline 3awalnuts 0aNi-MOF 0aWalnut shells derived carbon 0aSPANI 0aPseudocapacitance 0aSupercapacitor1 aGuo, Hao1 aYang, Fan1 aWang, Mingyue1 aZhang, Hao1 aZhang, Tingting1 aSun, Lei1 aYang, Meng1 aYang, Wu0 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 630 p.127584-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1275843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010600172300001600278520085500294592002801149650002301177650001401200650001101214650001501225650001601240650004101256650001501297650001601312650001201328650001501340650002301355650001101378650001101389650001701400650001001417650002201427653002801449653001601477653002001493653004101513653002001554700002501574700002501599700002201624700002601646700002601672700003001698773011001728856008601838852000901924655001201933IND60543143520221119073542.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054314352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVicente, Eduardo10aLevels of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) in selected processed foods from the Brazilian market  ap. 310-314.  aIn the present study, selected commercial processed foods available in the Brazilian market (232 samples) were analyzed for the first time in relation to 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) content using a validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method.

The international spread of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with the ease of global travel, and societal dynamics, immunologic naiveté of the host population, and muted innate immune responses. Based on these factors and the expanding geographic scale of the disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic–the first caused by a coronavirus. In this review, we summarize the current epidemiological status of COVID-19 and consider the virological and immunological lessons, animal models, and tools developed in response to prior SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks that can serve as resources for development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines. In particular, we discuss structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a major determinant of transmissibility, and discuss key molecular aspects that will aid in understanding and fighting this new global threat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aWorld Health Organization 3aanimals 3amicrobiology 3apandemic 3apublic health 3arespiratory tract diseases 3atherapeutics 3atravel 0acoronavirus 0aCOVID-19 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aspike 0ahost immune response1 aLanderas-Bueno, Sara1 aHsieh, Li-En1 aTerada, Yutaka1 aKim, Kenneth1 aLey, Klaus1 aShresta, Sujan1 aSaphire, Erica Ollmann1 aRegla-Nava, Jose Angel0 tTrends in microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.605-618dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2020.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245006100178506010400239506007600343520181200419592002802231506003702259650001602296650001202312650001302324650001902337650001402356653000702370653000902377653000802386653000802394653000802402653001202410653000802422653000902430653000902439653000802448653000802456653000802464653002602472653001902498653001202517653002502529700001902554700005602573773010602629856008702735852000902822655001202831IND60752542120221207131454.0220531e20211205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075254212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1276142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInduchoodan, Govindan10aInfluence of graphene oxide on asphaltene nanoaggregates  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAsphaltenes are a group of exotic hydrocarbons found in bitumen and other forms of heavy crude oil derivatives. These hydrocarbons, with elusive chemistry, give crude oil derivatives (CODs), such as bitumen, its characteristic properties. In bitumen, they form stable aggregates by interacting with other molecules, called asphaltene aggregates. Attempts have been made to enhance bitumen with nanoparticles, like graphene derivatives. Such studies have been successful in displaying the enhanceability of bitumen, but no studies have been directly focused on how the structural stability of asphaltene aggregates present in bitumen is affected by the incorporation of nanoparticles. The phase stability of the asphaltene aggregates is a pertinent question, which is often ignored. In this study, we investigate the physical impact of incorporating graphitic nanoparticles on the structure of bitumen. For this, we utilise graphene oxide (GO). GO is a form of polyaromatic nanoparticle with a similar structure to asphaltenes, such that both have molecular defects induced by heteroatoms. We have experimentally investigated the structural stability of the asphaltenes, using XPS, XRD and SEM-EDX to elucidate the interaction between asphaltenes and GO, and its implications for the stability of bitumen used for e.g., the surface layer of roads. In roads, asphaltene aggregates exist as stable structures, until GO has been introduced. The experimental results show that the introduction of GO initiates destabilisation of the asphaltene aggregates, and we discuss the destabilisation mechanism in this paper. Thereby, we conclude that counter intuitively, the introduction of graphene or GO has a negative impact on the structure of bitumen, thus hindering any functional enhancements to bituminous roads.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aasphaltenes 3abitumen 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3apetroleum 0aGO 0aDBSA 0aSEM 0aEDX 0aXPS 0aTLC-FID 0aXRD 0aFTIR 0aCNAC 0aCCC 0aXPS 0aXRD 0aAsphaltene adsorption 0aGraphene oxide 0aBitumen 0aMaterial enhancement1 aJansson, Helen1 aSwenson, Jan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5640-47660 tColloids and surfaces.g2021 Dec. 05, v. 630 p.127614-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2021.1276143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245012500170300001600295520186100311592002802172650001502200650001502215650002902230650001902259650001702278650001902295650001902314650000902333650001302342650000702355650001302362650001802375650002002393653001602413653003402429653002302463653003502486653002702521653001602548700001502564700001702579773009102596856008902687852000902776655001202785IND60606368320221118050554.0180725e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060636832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yali10aMitigation and degradation of natural organic matters (NOMs) during ferrate(VI) application for drinking water treatment  ap. 145-153.  aFerrate(VI), as an alternative for pre-oxidation in drinking water treatment, has recently captured renewed interest. However, the knowledge in ferrate(VI) chemistry remains largely undeveloped. The information regarding ferrate(VI) reactions with natural organic matters (NOMs), an important water matrix component affecting water treatment, is highly limited. In this study, bench scale tests were performed to study ferrate(VI) decay and reactions with NOMs in a typical surface water matrix. Results showed that ferrate(VI) decay exhibited a pseudo 2nd-order reaction pattern (kobs = 15.2–1.6 mM⁻¹ min⁻¹ and 36.3–4.0 mM⁻¹ min⁻¹ with 1.0–7.0 mg/L Fe(VI) at initial pH 7.8 and 5.8, respectively), suggesting that self-decomposition is principally responsible for ferrate(VI) consumption. Ferrate(VI) tended to attacked electron-rich moieties in NOM molecules, but had limited capability to mineralize NOMs. Consequently, ferrate(VI) effectively reduced UV254 and specific UV absorbance (SUVA254), but poorly removed dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Generally, lower pH and higher ferrate(VI) dose favored the NOM destruction. Fe(VI) (3.0 mg/L) could remove 16% of initial DOC (4.43 mg/L), 56% of initial UV254 (0.063 cm⁻¹), and 48% of initial SUVA254 (0.033 cm⁻¹ (mg/L)⁻¹) at pH 5.80. Further organics analyses indicate that ferrate(VI) readily degraded hydrophobic and transphilic NOM fractions, but scarcely decomposed hydrophilic fraction. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) and fluorescence regional integration (FRI) analyses revealed that ferrate(VI) preferentially reacted with fulvic-like (region III) and humic-like (region V) substances and certain aromatic proteins (region II), difficultly decomposed soluble microbial byproducts (region IV), and rarely oxidized aromatic proteins in region I.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abyproducts 3adissolved organic carbon 3adrinking water 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3airon 3amoieties 3apH 3aproteins 3asurface water 3awater treatment 0aFerrate(VI) 0aNatural organic matters (NOM) 0aChemical oxidation 0aDissolved organic carbon (DOC) 0aUltraviolet absorption 0aCoagulation1 aDeng, Yang1 aJung, Chanil0 tChemosphere.g2016 Mar., v. 146 p.145-153dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245007600198500002000274520135700294592002801651650005201679650001401731650001101745650000901756650002001765650001101785650001101796650001101807651001401818700006101832700006101893773013101954856007502085852000902160655001202169IND60789312020221122035236.0220819e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078931202DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.126052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlipour, Atieh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5058-917310aAssessing flash flood hazard and damages in the southeast United States  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFlash floods are common natural hazards in the southeast United States (SEUS) as a consequence of frequent torrential rainfall caused by tropical storms, thunderstorms, and hurricanes. Understanding flash flood characteristics is essential for mitigating the associated risks and implementing proactive risk management strategies. In this study, flash flood characteristics including frequency, duration, and intensity are assessed in addition to their associated property damages. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Events database as well as hourly precipitation data of the North American Land Data Assimilation System project phase‐2 (NLDAS‐2) are utilised, and more than 14,000 flash flood events during 1996–2017 are analysed. Flash flood hazard is investigated at county, state, and regional levels across the SEUS. Results indicate increasing pattern for the frequency and intensity of flash flooding over the SEUS. The frequency of flash flooding is found to be higher in spring and summer, whereas the duration and intensity of events are higher during winter and fall, respectively. The western parts of the SEUS are prone to more frequent and intense flash flooding compared to the eastern parts. Overall, our analyses suggest that flash flood hazard in Louisiana is higher than other states in the SEUS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3adatabases 3afloods 3arain 3arisk management 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aLouisiana1 aAhmadalipour, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2751-48911 aMoradkhani, Hamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2889-999X0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2020 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.e12605-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:21409x1753-318X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.126053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245008200176300001600258520121700274592002801491650003001519650002801549650002301577650001001600650002201610650003001632650002501662650001401687650003001701650001801731650002201749650002101771650001001792651001201802651001101814651001401825651001101839651001801850700002401868700001601892773013301908856008302041852000902124655001202133IND60087175020221123044202.0141102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008717502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cimid.2012.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulauskas, Algimantas10aMolecular detection and characterization of Anaplasma phagocytophilum strains  ap. 187-195.  aThe zoonotic rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum has a broad geographic distribution and a high degree of biological and clinical diversity. To investigate the genetic diversity of A. phagocytophilum strains in the Baltic region and Norway, three species of Ixodidae ticks were examined for A. phagocytophilum infection, and two genes of the pathogen genome were analyzed. Analysis of partial 16S rRNA and partial major surface protein (msp4) gene sequences was accomplished through nested PCR and sequence analysis. Strains identified in this study were compared with those originating from other European countries and the United States. Seven 16S rRNA gene variants and fifteen msp4 gene variants of A. phagocytophilum were detected. Nine sequences had unique nucleotide polymorphisms and therefore differed from other A. phagocytophilum sequences previously submitted to GenBank. The present study represents the first molecular characterization of A. phagocytophum strains circulating in Lithuania and describes the strains detected in Ixodes persulcatus ticks in Latvia and Estonia. This is also the first report describing A. phagocytophilum strains isolated from Dermacentor reticulatus ticks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aDermacentor reticulatus 3aIxodes persulcatus 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asurface proteins 3aticks 3aEstonia 3aLatvia 3aLithuania 3aNorway 3aUnited States1 aRadzijevskaja, Jana1 aRosef, Olav0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2012 Mar., v. 35, no. 2 p.187-195dElsevier Ltdx0147-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2012.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003100146245014400177300002000321520165600341592002801997650001502025650001402040650002302054650001102077650003002088650002102118650002202139650000902161650001302170650002402183650001302207650002102220700002102241700003102262700006802293773013802361856008002499852000902579655001202588IND60679456620200331000000.0191228e20191120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067945662DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b053792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGálvez-González, Luis E.10aH₂ Adsorption on Cu₄₋ₓMₓ (M = Au, Pt; x = 0–4) Clusters: Similarities and Differences As Predicted by Density Functional Theory  ap. 30768-30780.  aThe active search for alternatives to current fossil fuels via energy conversion mechanisms has bolstered the study of the adsorption of molecules on surfaces and clusters as a fundamental step before moving into complex heterogeneous catalysis scenarios. In this respect, intensive investigations have been thoroughly performed to obtain cheaper and more efficient catalysts, such as in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the electrocatalysis field. In this paper, we present systematic density functional theory simulations of H₂ adsorption on bimetallic Cu₄–ₓMₓ (M = Pt, Au; x = 0–4) neutral clusters. The molecular and dissociative adsorption mechanisms are explored, and the occurrence of one or the other is explained in terms of the reactivity of the host clusters. We begin with a global exploration of the potential energy surface to obtain the ground-state structures. The effects of H₂ adsorption and host cluster composition on the interatomic distances are investigated. A detailed analysis of H₂ adsorption on the Cu₄–ₓPtₓ family shows that dissociative adsorption occurs for x = 1–4, that is, for all clusters containing Pt, while nondissociative molecular adsorption is obtained in Cu₄₋ₓAuₓ clusters with x = 0–3, that is, for all clusters containing Cu. This is consistent with the values of the electronic HOMO–LUMO gap, which are predicted to be small (high reactivity) and large (small reactivity) for bimetallic Cu–Pt and Cu–Au clusters, respectively. The adsorption energy increases with the Pt load in Cu–Pt clusters, while it is almost constant in the case of Cu–Au clusters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3agold 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aplatinum 3apotential energy1 aAlonso, Julio A.1 aPaz Borbón, Lauro Oliver,1 aPosada-Amarillas, Alvaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7533-48200 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 20, v. 123, no. 51 p.30768-30780dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b053793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01306naa a2200217 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245005800128300001600186520066500202592002800867650001100895650002100906650001500927773012500942852000901067655001201076IND60300711620221121030409.0150703e20120713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030071162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Adrian10aHiggs Boson Makes Its Debut After Decades-Long Search  ap. 141-143.  aWhen physicists at the European particle physics laboratory, CERN, reported last week that they had discovered the famed Higgs boson, or something much like it, it marked the first time since 1995 that a new fundamental particle had been unearthed. Particle physicists have apparently confirmed a decades-old prediction of how the universe works and found the last piece in their standard model of fundamental particles and forces, perhaps the most elaborate and precise theory in science. But the advance also leaves particle physics at a curious crossroads. If no new particles or phenomena show up, the discovery of the Higgs could mark the end of the road.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3aparticle physics 3aprediction0 tScience.g2012 July 13, v. 337, no. 6091 p.141-143dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245010100206300002000307520123000327592002801557650002201585650001901607650002301626650001601649650001701665700001901682700001801701700001501719700001601734700005501750700005401805700001801859700001701877700005601894700001701950700001701967773013801984856008002122852000902202655001202211IND60679456720221120095228.0191228e20191129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067945672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b062472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Chuan-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8469-345410aPhotoinduced Ultrafast Electron Transfer and Charge Transport in a PbI₂/C₆₀ Heterojunction  ap. 30791-30798.  aCharge transport and electron transfer in a PbI₂/C₆₀ heterojunction were investigated. The charge carrier mobilities and trap densities of PbI₂ were extracted from current–voltage characteristics of hole- and electron-only devices. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was used to elucidate the photophysical processes occurring in the heterojunction. For a pristine PbI₂ film, trap-limited bimolecular recombination was the dominant mechanism in the case of low pump fluence. We observed photoinduced ultrafast electron transfer from PbI₂ to C₆₀ with a rate constant of 0.45 ps–¹. Semiclassical Marcus electron transfer theory was used to estimate the electronic coupling between the conduction band edge of PbI₂ and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of C₆₀. We also fabricated a solar cell using the PbI₂/C₆₀ heterojunction. Electron transfer and charge extract efficiencies in our cell were also deduced. The performance-limiting factors for solar cells based on PbI₂ were discussed and a strategy to improve the device performance was developed. Our work is useful for ultraviolet-harvesting transparent solar cells and other photophysical and photochemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron transfer 3aphotochemistry 3aphysical chemistry 3asolar cells 3aspectroscopy1 aZhang, Bi-Long1 aSong, Hang-Qi1 aWang, Yuan1 aLi, Wenhui,1 aLiu, Junxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8349-10171 aLeng, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8454-48351 aTian, Wenming1 aZhao, Chunyi1 aJin, Shengye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2001-22121 aLiu, Weifeng1 aCong, Shulin0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 29, v. 123, no. 51 p.30791-30798dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b062473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009200166300001600258520087100274592002801145650002401173650001301197650001601210650001401226650001001240650001001250650001601260650001001276650001101286650000901297650000701306650002001313650001901333653001901352653001801371653001901389653000701408653002001415653001001435700001601445700001901461700001901480773011201499856008201611852000901693655001201702IND60544114020221118230253.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054411402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Fang-Fang10aStudy on colon health benefit of polysaccharide from Cyclocarya paliurus leaves in vivo  ap. 203-209.  aThe effect of polysaccharide from Cyclocarya paliurus leaves on mouse colon was examined.

For example, their application has made valuable contributions to climate change ecology, where they are used to monitor species range shifts; to conservation ecology, where they are used to assess species' Red List status; and to biogeography, where they are used to highlight hotspots of biodiversity. A major benefit of biological records is the large spatial extent of the coverage combined with the fine spatial precision of the data: this combination is essential for any ecologist hoping to address large‐scale questions about biodiversity and environmental change. Because most biological records are collected by a vast pool of volunteer recorders, studies utilizing biological records have the advantage of large‐scale long‐term data that it would otherwise be unfeasibly expensive to collect. We review the application of biological records by focussing on four key areas of biodiversity research: biogeography, trend assessments, climate change ecology, and conservation biology. We showcase the diversity of insights that biological records have delivered, which in turn illustrates the contribution of the voluntary recording community to our understanding of biodiversity science.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3awildlife management1 aIsaac, Nick J.

This burning maintained dynamically stable nutrient cycling processes and a competitive balance in dry and moist eucalypt systems and prevented plant “invasions”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aburning 3aecological invasion 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3afire regime 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ashade 3awoody plants 3aAustralia0 tForests.g2012 Oct. 08, v. 3, no. 4 p.896-902dMolecular Diversity Preservation InternationalwJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f30408963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010700165300002000272520092300292592002801215650001401243650002301257650002501280650002301305650001301328650001701341650001501358700005301373700001901426700002601445700002101471700002701492700006501519773013801584856008001722852000901802655001201811IND60679456820221120095517.0191228e20191022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067945682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b062592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRea, Morgan T.10aInvestigating the Mechanism of Post-Treatment on PEDOT/PSS via Single-Particle Absorption Spectroscopy  ap. 30781-30790.  aThe conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS), widely used in optoelectronic devices, exhibits improved conductivity upon post-treatment, but the mechanism of this improvement is difficult to fully ascertain. The effects of thermal annealing and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) post-treatment on PEDOT/PSS, from the nano- to mesoscale, are studied using single-particle absorption spectroscopy. An average decrease in size and apparent increase in rotational order of individual particles are observed with both treatments, including unexpected correlations between change in rotational order and initial properties. Simulation of these transformations and correlations occurring during the annealing process reveals that the effects of DMSO post-treatment can be explained by oligomer depletion and do not explicitly require conformational changes including oligomer rotation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectronic equipment 3aphysical chemistry 3apolymers 3aspectroscopy 3asulfonates1 aPan, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0262-58431 aHorak, Erik H.1 aKnapper, Kassandra A.1 aNguyen, Hoang L.1 aVollbrecht, Cecilia H.1 aGoldsmith, Randall H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9083-85920 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Oct. 22, v. 123, no. 51 p.30781-30790dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b062593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245011000168300001600278520112200294592002801416650001501444650002101459650001301480650000901493650002201502650001101524650001801535650001301553650001701566653001301583653001101596653002201607653003001629653001101659653002601670700001401696773011101710856008301821852000901904655001201913IND60558607420221122062927.0180831e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055860742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ruizhong10aRecent advances in graphene-based nanomaterials for fabricating electrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensors  ap. 249-268.  aDue to the large specific surface area, extraordinary mechanical flexibility, chemical stability, and superior electrical and thermal conductivities, graphene (G)-based materials have recently opened up an exciting field in the science and technology of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with continuously growing academic and technological impetus. In the past several years, graphene-based materials have been well designed, synthesized, and investigated for sensing applications. In this review, we discuss the synthesis and application of graphene-based 2D nanomaterials for the fabrication of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrochemical sensors. In particular, graphene-based nanomaterials as immobilization matrix of heme proteins for the fabrication of enzymatic H2O2 electrochemical biosensors is first summarized. Then, the application of graphene-based electrocatalysts (metal-free, noble-metals and non-noble metals) in constructing non-enzymatic H2O2 electrochemical sensors is discussed in detail. We hope that this review is helpful to push forward the advancement of this academic issue (189 references).  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3aelectrochemistry 3agraphene 3aheme 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ametals 3ananomaterials 3aproteins 3asurface area 0aGraphene 0aSensor 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aElectrochemical detection 0aEnzyme 0aNon-enzymatic sensing1 aChen, Wei0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 89 p.249-268dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01126naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002000112245005600132300001200188520041000200592002800610650003600638650001900674650001800693650001700711651001000728773012500738852000900863655001200872IND60300711720221121015948.0150703e20120713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030071172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNormile, Dennis10aCommission Spreads Blame for ‘Manmade’ Disaster  ap. 143.  aA powerful commission set up by Japan's parliament last week blamed Tokyo Electric Power Co. and government regulators for what it called the "manmade" disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

For this reason, malodorous emission monitoring and control techniques are in high demand in urban areas and industries. The aim of this work is first to build an electronic nose (e-nose) and a Voltammetric Electronic tongue (VE-tongue) in order to study their ability to discriminate between polluted and clean environmental samples. Secondly, Thermal Desorption-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (TD-GC-MS), and Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) are utilized to explain this discrimination by identifying specific compounds from these samples. Indeed, the e-nose, consisted of metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors, is used for the assessment of the studied odorous air and headspace samples from water and wastewater sites. Moreover, the VE-tongue, based on metal electrodes, is utilized to determine the patterns of the sensor array responses, which serve as fingerprints profiles of the analyzed liquid samples. Chemometric tools, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are operated for the processing of data from the e-nose and the VE-tongue. By using the both systems, the analyses of headspace and liquid samples from the seven sites allow better discrimination. To explain the cause of the obtained discrimination, TD-GC-MS and SPME-GC-MS analyses are well performed to identify compounds related sites. According to these outcomes, the proposed e-nose and VE-tongue are proved to be rapid and valuable tools for analysis of environmental polluted matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3achemometrics 3acluster analysis 3aelectrodes 3aelectronic nose 3aelectronic tongue 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3aindustry 3ainformation processing 3aliquids 3amonitoring 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk factors 3asemiconductors 3asolid phase microextraction 3asupport vector machines 3aurban areas 3avoltammetry 3awastewater 0aWastewater 0aElectronic nose 0aVoltammetric electronic tongue 0aThermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 0aSolid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry1 aHofmann, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7915-56911 aEl Bari, Nezha1 aTiebe, Carlo1 aBartholmai, Matthias1 aBouchikhi, Benachir0 tTalanta.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 221 p.121450-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245008100202300001600283520167100299592002801970650003001998650001802028650001502046650002302061650001502084650002202099650002202121650001902143650001102162650002402173653001202197653002602209653001602235653002802251700005802279700001802337700002302355773009402378856008102472852000902553655001202562IND60724947720221117231115.0210124e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiahi, Mina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2589-099X10aTobacco tax and price in the developed and developing countries in the World  ap. 767-774.  aAn ecologic study was conducted on 177 countries which the information of tobacco tax and price and also Human Development Index (HDI) was available in 2014. In this study, the relationship between HDI and four reported indexes by World Health Organization (WHO) was studied. These four indexes included: Tobacco affordability, Taxes as a percent of price of the most sold brand (total tax), Price of a 20 cigarette pack of the most sold brand international dollars at purchasing power parity (Price_ppp) and Price of a 20 cigarette pack of the most sold brand in US$ at official exchange rates (Price_US$). The data of HDI and tobacco were mined from WHO and United Nations Development Programme sites respectively. To study the correlation between HDI and the variables of this study, Pearson correlation coefficient was used and also Linear Regression Analysis was used to study the relationship between HDI and the variables of the study. According to the findings of the linear regression analysis, there was a significant relationship between HDI and total tax (B = 0.81, CI 95%: 0.63–0.99) and tobacco affordability (B = --0.35, CI 95%: --0.42 _ --0.28). There was also a significant relationship between HDI whit price-ppp (B = 9.44, CI 95%: 7.13–11.75) and price-US$ ;(B = 11.97, CI 95%: 9.71–14.23). According to the findings of this study, less developed countries devote less tax on tobacco. Due to the rising trend of the prevalence and also development of non-communicable diseases such as lung cancer in developing countries, policy makers of these countries are required to design stricter policies toward tobacco production and supply as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aaffordability 3acigarettes 3aecological studies 3aexcise tax 3ahuman development 3aissues and policy 3alung neoplasms 3aprices 3aregression analysis 0aTobacco 0aTobacco affordability 0aTobacco tax 0aHuman Development Index1 aRohani, Hosein1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6721-17911 aRajabi, Naser1 aBidkhori, Mohammad0 tData in Brief.g2018 Oct., v. 20 p.767-774dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02186naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010300170300001600273520099200289592002801281653002701309653001501336653001601351653001701367653001601384653002201400653001501422653002101437653001701458653001601475700001801491700001501509700001601524700001801540700001701558773011801575856008601693852000901779655001201788IND60602548320221119234234.0180711e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060254832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jianghong10aFluid choice and test standardization for magnetic regenerators operating at near room temperature  ap. 135-146.  aNumerical simulations are performed to investigate the performance of an active magnetic regenerator (AMR) operating near room temperature. A two-dimensional porous model is established to analyze the impact different heat transfer fluids (HTFs) have on the performance of the AMR. The internal temperature distribution and cooling capacity of the system are analyzed and the influence of the HTF discussed. The simulation results show that when mercury is substituted in place of water as the HTF, the cooling capacity can be enhanced by nearly 600%. A fluid with high conductivity, high density, and low specific heat is most suitable for use as the HTF. Furthermore, as the environmental conditions have a great impact upon the performance of the AMR, three feasible methods of standardization testing are proposed. These involve: the evaluation index under fixed test environment conditions, a maximum exergy method, and a maximum specific exergy method around the Curie temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMagnetic refrigeration 0aSimulation 0aRegenerator 0aOptimization 0aPerformance 0aFroid magnétique 0aSimulation 0aRégénérateurs 0aOptimisation 0aPerformance1 aLiu, Chaopeng1 aHou, Puxiu1 aHuang, Yihe1 aOuyang, Guang1 aChen, Yungui0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Jan., v. 37 p.135-146dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005100153245008200204520090400286592002801190650001301218650001301231650001901244650002101263650001601284650000901300650001301309650001301322650001301335650001401348650001501362650001501377650002201392650001501414653002201429653001601451653000901467653002401476653001401500653002701514700001601541700005301557773011901610856008801729852000901817655001201826IND60677490820221119135138.0200210e20200301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067749082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1356902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5852-232510aNutrient conversion and recovery from wastewater using electroactive bacteria  aWastewater is widely recognized as a sink of active nitrogen and phosphorus, and the recovery of both nutrients as fertilizers is widely studied in recent years. Electroactive bacteria increasingly attract attentions in this area because they are able to produce an electric field in microbial electrochemical systems to concentrate ammonium and phosphate for recovery. Importantly, these unique bacteria are able to convert nitrate and nitrite directly to ammonium, maximizing the active nitrogen species capable of recovery. Ferric ions produced by electroactive bacteria can be precipitated with phosphate to recover as vivianite in neutral wastewaters. All these processes employed electroactive bacteria as both nitrate and iron reducer and bioelectric field generator. The mechanism as well as technologies are summarized, and the challenges to further improve their performance are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abacteria 3aelectric field 3aelectrochemistry 3afertilizers 3airon 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3awaste utilization 3awastewater 0aNitrogen recovery 0aAmmoniation 0aDNRA 0aPhosphorus recovery 0aVivianite 0aElectroactive bacteria1 aWan, Yuxuan1 aWang, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3522-56270 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Mar. 01, v. 706 p.135690-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1356903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245012100160300001600281520083600297592002801133650001101161650001701172650001901189650002101208650001201229650001301241650001401254650001401268653002601282653002201308653003101330700001601361700001601377700001401393773015001407856007701557852000901634655001201643IND60522228420221119111909.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052222842DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-05102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerbenni, V.14aThe Effect of High Energy Milling on the Solid State Synthesis of MnFe2O4 from Mixtures of MnO-Fe2O3 and Mn3O4-Fe2O3  ap. 415-422.  aA thermal treatment at 900°C (under nitrogen) of a milled mixture MnO-Fe₂O₃ yields MnFe₂O₄ mainly as the product of the reaction between Mn₃O₄ (produced by ball milling) and Fe₂O₃.

The same thermal treatment (900°C under nitrogen) of a milled Mn₃O₄-Fe₂O₃ mixture yields MnFe₂O₄ mainly as the product of the reaction between Mn₃O₄ and Mn₂O₃/MnO₂ (the higher Mn oxides being produced by ball milling) and Fe₂O₃.

The casein/soybean hybrid fibers were synthesized at different weight ratios such as 100/0 (casein), 75/25, 50/50, 25/75, and 0/100 (soy) and characterized. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed the growth of pure and hybrid fibers and shows an increased surface roughness as the soy concentration increases in the hybrid fibers. Infrared spectra did not exhibit any significant changes in the functional groups between pure and hybrid fibers. X-ray diffraction pattern indicates slight increase in the diffraction peak values of hybrid fibers compared with the neat fibers. Thermal analyses show a moderate increase in the thermal stability of hybrid fibers when compared with the pure fibers. These results implicitly indicate that the casein and soy proteins are homogeneous in the hybrid fiber form. It has been demonstrated that the hybrid fiber with ≥50 wt.% casein content exhibits better morphology and increased thermal stability, which has scope for application in technical and medical industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acasein 3ahybrids 3aprotein sources 3asoy protein 3asoybeans 3asurface roughness 3athermal analysis 3athermal stability 2aAnimals 2aBiomimetic Materialsxchemistry 2aCaseinsxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aDietary Fiberxanalysis 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aSoybean Proteinsxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aSpectrophotometry, Infrared 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aThanikaivelan, Palanisamy1 aAshokkumar, Meiyazhagan1 aChandrasekaran, Bangaru0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2011 Jan., v. 163, no. 2 p.247-257dSpringer-Verlagx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-010-9034-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013600162300001600298520125700314592002801571650001401599650001601613650000801629650001801637650001601655650001701671650001201688650001001700650001501710650001901725651001201744651001901756700002101775700001901796700001801815700002101833700002001854773018201874856007302056852000902129655001202138IND60340779420221121025114.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034077942DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.125412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPescott, Oliver L.10aAir pollution and its effects on lichens, bryophytes, and lichen‐feeding Lepidoptera: review and evidence from biological records  ap. 611-635.  aChanging air quality has been one of the most important drivers of change for bryophytes and lichens in Britain and Ireland over the 20th Century, with acidic pollutants such as sulphur dioxide having large effects on the ranges and abundances of many species. At the same time, expert amateur and professional naturalists have put enormous efforts into recording the distributions of species within these groups. These efforts have provided much evidence for declines and recoveries within the bryophytes and lichens, with species distribution data being linked to airborne pollutants in many different ways. We provide a broad overview of some of the changes that have occurred in affected species, using biological records collected by national recording schemes to illustrate the various effects of air pollution; we also review the direct and indirect impacts of air pollutants on these groups. Environmental change affecting one group of species is also likely to cascade to other groups where trophic or other relationships exist between them. Using data from the volunteer‐based National Moth Recording Scheme, we provide the first evidence for an indirect association between reductions in air pollution and increases in lichenivorous moths.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryopsida 3aLepidoptera 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3abiogeography 3alichens 3amoths 3apollutants 3asulfur dioxide 3aIreland 3aUnited Kingdom1 aSimkin, Janet M.1 aAugust, Tom A.1 aRandle, Zoë,1 aDore, Anthony J.1 aBotham, Marc S.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 July, v. 115, no. 3 p.611-635dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.125413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01519naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245005300129300001200182520073400194592002800928650002100956650001400977650001300991650001001004650002301014650001601037651001101053651000901064651001001073773012501083852000901208655001201217IND60300711820221121030125.0150703e20120713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030071182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibbons, Ann10aGenes Suggest Three Groups Peopled the New World  ap. 144.  aWho were the first Americans? Twenty years ago, in a bold synthesis of linguistic, genetic, and dental data, researchers proposed that the first people on this continent arrived from Asia in at least three distinct waves. But the idea of diverse origins slowly fell out of favor, in part because studies found that Native Americans from Alaska to Chile were genetically similar, suggesting a single founding population. Now the most comprehensive genetic study to date concludes that Native Americans do indeed descend from at least three groups of ancestors from Asia. But in contrast to the original three-wave hypothesis, the researchers found that once in the New World, all three source populations intermingled extensively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmerican Indians 3aAmericans 3aancestry 3agenes 3agenetic similarity 3aresearchers 3aAlaska 3aAsia 3aChile0 tScience.g2012 July 13, v. 337, no. 6091 p.144-144dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02150naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012100175300001800296520108200314592002801396650002001424650001201444650001201456651001201468700003001480700002801510700006001538700002201598700001801620773009601638856008101734852000901815655001201824IND60724947920221117231253.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdewale, Bukola Adejoke10aDataset on cost comparative analysis of different walling materials in residential buildings in a developing economy  ap. 1918-1924.  aThe walls which form the envelope of a building are very important, therefore, the choice of materials used for it is very important. The dataset presents a comparative analysis of different walling materials used in residential buildings in a developing economy. The data was presented using descriptive tools of figures and tables. The dataset was obtained within several parts in Lagos State, Nigeria. The dataset showed the awareness and rate of use of selected walling materials by home owners in residential apartments. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the cost implication of using eight (8) different walling materials in a typical two (2)- bedroom residential building was carried out. Using a market survey armed with current prices, a bill of quantities showed the varying cost of different walling materials for residential buildings. The dataset when analyzed can help in understanding the dynamics of providing affordable housing in developing economies. In addition, prospective home owners and building materials’ investors can benefit from the dataset.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amarkets 3asurveys 3aNigeria1 aBabalola, Olatunde Daniel1 aJegede, Foluke Oladunni1 aAfolabi, Adedeji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9065-47661 aOyenuga, Temilola1 aObi, Chukwuma0 tData in Brief.g2018 Aug., v. 19 p.1918-1924dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245014900216500001900365520158800384592002801972650001102000650002602011650002102037650002102058650002202079650001302101650002102114650002502135650001402160650002102174650002202195650001202217651000902229653000802238653002002246653001502266653003202281653003302313653003102346653001002377700006502387700007002452700005802522700007102580700003502651700003702686700002002723700003402743773009902777856008502876852000902961655001202970IND60716101820221121222804.0210415e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071610182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1054222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlanes-Alvarez, Yilian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2062-076010aPrevalence of mild citrus tristeza virus isolates of the T30 genotype in Cuban commercial citrus fields after the dissemination of huanglongbing  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHuanglongbing (HLB) disease detection in Cuba in 2006 led to a turn in citrus management in the country, including the production of certified budwood in protected nurseries, eradication of symptomatic plants and old orchards, and chemical control of the vector Diaphorina citri. This dramatic shift in citrus farming could have affected the incidence and composition of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) populations. This work aimed to determine CTV incidence and characterize viral isolates from the main Cuban citrus-producing areas. A survey throughout the country was carried out which resulted in the collection of 27 CTV isolates. Results showed a decrease of CTV incidence in western and central areas of the country, but an increase in the East, compared to previous reports. Bioindexing showed that most of the isolates induced none or mild symptoms. Serological characterization using seven different CTV specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb) showed heterogeneity among the 27 isolates. Six out of twenty-seven were MCA13-reactive, a MAb associated to the presence of severe CTV isolates. Nevertheless, sequence comparison of the p20, p23 and p25 genes evidenced a high nucleotide sequence identity among isolates, and according to the phylogenetic analyses, all the sequences belonged to the CTV T30 genotype. Thus, our results showed a decrease in the CTV incidence in the surveyed areas and the broad dissemination of mild CTV isolates of the T30 genotype, which could be partially explained by the shift in the management programs implemented for CTV and HLB control in Cuba.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aDiaphorina citri 3achemical control 3adisease detection 3agenotype 3agreening disease 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aplant protection 3asequence analysis 3asurveys 3aCuba 0aCTV 0aClosteroviridae 0aGenotyping 0aBiological characterization 0aSerological characterization 0aMolecular characterization 0aMCA131 aPeña-Bárzaga, Inés1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6004-14941 aBatista-Le Riverend, Lochy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5132-58201 aPacheco, Ronal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1825-70181 aZamora-Rodríguez, Victoria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5208-44401 aBenítez-Galeano, María José1 aRivas Sánchez, Fernando,d1930-1 aBertalmío, Ana1 aHernández-Rodríguez, Lester0 tCrop protection.g2021 Feb., v. 140 p.105422-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.1054223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002500159245012700184520185200311592002802163650001502191650001602206650001502222650002602237650003802263650001302301650004102314650002302355650004402378650001402422650002302436650001402459650001102473650001802484650001602502650002102518653003802539653004102577653002602618653003002644653002702674700002802701700002002729700001902749773011402768856009402882852000902976655001202985IND60677491020221119135457.0200210e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067749102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.1090322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, C. Garrett10aThermoset materials characterization by thermal desorption or pyrolysis based gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods  aThermoset materials characterization is often limited to solid state analytical techniques such as IR, NMR, DSC, TGA and mechanical testing. Alternatively, their off-gassing behavior can also be evaluated using GC based techniques such as TD-GC-MS, allowing this method to be applied to thermoset materials analyses such as identification, aging characterization, and formulation optimization. As an overview, common thermoset materials were evaluated by analyzing their gaseous degradation products via TGA-based pyrolysis and subsequent TD-GC-MS for the identification of representative volatile signatures. It is thereby possible to distinguish different classes of phenolic materials or cured epoxy resins, as well as their amine or anhydride curatives. Additionally, this method enabled quantification of a volatile fragment (bisphenol A, BPA) which is associated with oxidation of epoxy/amine thermoset materials. The amount of evolved BPA increased linearly with aging time and this trend exhibits linear Arrhenius behavior over the temperature range (80–125 °C) studied, in agreement with oxidation sensitivies based on oxygen consumption data. Further, TD-GC-MS was used to explore how off-gassing of residual anhydride curative from an epoxy/anhydride material depends on formulation stoichiometry. Even in formulations that theoretically contained enough epoxy to consume all anhydride (1:1 stoichiometry), an imperfect final cure state resulted in residual anhydride which could evolve from the material. For such materials, a slightly epoxy-rich formulation is required to ensure that the material contains no residual unreacted anhydride. Analysis of volatiles generated by thermal exposure is an attractive characterization approach enabling compositional analysis as well as complementary diagnostics for materials degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanhydrides 3abisphenol A 3adesorption 3adiagnostic techniques 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aepoxides 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amechanical testing 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3aoxygen consumption 3apyrolysis 3aresins 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 0aPolymer analysis/characterization 0aThermal desorption mass spectrometry 0aThermoset composition 0aVolatiles from thermosets 0aDegradation signatures1 aAstorga, Dominik Jordon1 aDuemichen, Erik1 aCelina, Mathew0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2020 Apr., v. 174 p.109032-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.1090323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245017000171300001800341520147300359592002801832596017501860596006902035596008302104650001802187650002902205650002302234650001202257650002202269650001702291650003102308650002202339650003102361650001402392650001402406651001102420700003502431700003802466700002702504700003902531700002402570773013102594856008302725852000902808655001202817IND60701678220221121183300.0210731e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070167822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-020-01843-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulitsch, Fabiane10aParaburkholderia atlantica sp. nov. and Paraburkholderia franconis sp. nov., two new nitrogen-fixing nodulating species isolated from Atlantic forest soils in Brazil  ap. 1369-1380.  aA polyphasic study was conducted with 11 strains trapped by Mimosa pudica and Phaseolus vulgaris grown in soils of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. In the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, one clade of strains (Psp1) showed higher similarity with Paraburkholderia piptadeniae STM7183ᵀ (99.6%), whereas the second (Psp6) was closely related to Paraburkholderia tuberum STM678ᵀ (99%). An MLSA (multilocus sequence analysis) with four (recA, gyrB, trpB and gltB) housekeeping genes placed both Psp1 and Psp6 strains in new clades, and BOX-PCR profiles indicated high intraspecific genetic diversity within each clade. Values of digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) of the whole genome sequences were of 56.9 and 94.4% between the Psp1 strain CNPSo 3157ᵀ and P. piptadeniae; and of 49.7% and 92.7% between the Psp6 strain CNPSo 3155ᵀ and P. tuberum, below the threshold for species delimitation. In the nodC analysis, Psp1 strains clustered together with P. piptadeniae, while Psp6 did not group with any symbiotic Paraburkholderia. Other phenotypic, genotypic and symbiotic properties were evaluated. The polyphasic analysis supports that the strains represent two novel species, for which the names Paraburkholderia franconis sp. nov. with type strain CNPSo 3157ᵀ (= ABIP 241, = LMG 31644) and Paraburkholderia atlantica sp. nov. with type strain CNPSo 3155ᵀ (= ABIP 236, = LMG 31643) are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data  aCNPq 465133/2014-2, Fundação Araucária-STI 043/2019, CAPEScINCT-Plant-Growth Promoting Microorganisms for Agricultural Sustainability and Environmental Responsibility  a02.13.08.001.00.00cEmpresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária  a400468/2016-6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aMimosa pudica 3aParaburkholderia tuberum 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3amicrobiology 3amultilocus sequence typing 3anitrogen fixation 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aBrazil1 aDall’Agnol, Rebeca Fuzinatto1 aDelamuta, Jakeline Renata Marçon1 aRibeiro, Renan Augusto1 ada Silva Batista, Jesiane Stefania1 aHungria, Mariangela0 tArchives of microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 202, no. 6 p.1369-1380dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-01843-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03651naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001800188245011600206300001200322506007600334520136500410592002801775596005501803596011301858596007601971596007602047596006302123506003702186650002502223650001202248650002502260650001202285650001302297650001102310650001402321650002202335650001702357650002602374650001202400650001302412650001402425650001202439650001002451650002002461650002002481650000902501650001302510650001502523650003302538700001302571700001502584700001502599700001302614700001402627700001502641700001302656700002002669700001502689700005302704773010502757856008202862852000902944655001202953IND60643164320221207100543.0210119e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064316432DNAL7 a310681462pmid7 aPMC65072222pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-019-1813-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guodong10aPbrSLAH3 is a nitrate-selective anion channel which is modulated by calcium-dependent protein kinase 32 in pear  ap. 190.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The functional characteristics of SLAC/SLAH family members isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, poplar, barley and rice have been comprehensively investigated. However, there are no reports regarding SLAC/SLAH family genes from Rosaceae plants. RESULTS: In this study, the function of PbrSLAH3, which is predominately expressed in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) root, was investigated. PbrSLAH3 can rescue the ammonium toxicity phenomenon of slah3 mutant plants under high-ammonium/low-nitrate conditions. In addition, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed that PbrSLAH3 interacts with PbrCPK32. Moreover, when PbrSLAH3 was co-expressed with either the Arabidopsis calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) 21 or PbrCPK32 in Xenopus oocytes, yellow fluorescence was emitted from the oocytes and typical anion currents were recorded in the presence of extracellular NO₃⁻. However, when PbrSLAH3 alone was injected, no yellow fluorescence or anion currents were recorded, suggesting that anion channel PbrSLAH3 activity was controlled through phosphorylation. Finally, electrophysiological and transgene results showed that PbrSLAH3 was more permeable to NO₃⁻ than Cl⁻. CONCLUSION: We suggest that PbrSLAH3 crossing-talk with PbrCPK32 probably participate in transporting of nitrate nutrition in pear root.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD0201400cNational Key R &D Program of China  a2014BAD16B03-4cthe National Key Technology R & D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China  aKJQN201926cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aKYTZ201602cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a31801842cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPopulus 3aPyrus bretschneideri 3aXenopus 3aammonium 3abarley 3achlorides 3aelectrophysiology 3afluorescence 3afunctional properties 3amutants 3anitrates 3anutrition 3aoocytes 3apears 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein kinases 3arice 3atoxicity 3atransgenes 3atwo hybrid system techniques1 aWang, Li1 aChen, Qian1 aQi, Kaijie1 aYin, Hao1 aCao, Peng1 aTang, Chao1 aWu, Xiao1 aZhang, Shaoling1 aWang, Peng1 aWu, Juyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7479-151X0 tBMC plant biology.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.190-190dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-019-1813-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01889naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245015500158300001400313520053600327592002800863650002600891650004600917650001800963650002200981650001601003650001001019650002501029650001101054650001301065650002501078650001401103650001201117651001301129700002201142700002001164700002001184700002001204700001501224773013401239856007301373852000901446655001201455IND60132254620221121021155.0150505e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013225462DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.122002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeawcharoen, J10aGenetic characterization of a betanodavirus isolated from a clinical disease outbreak in farm‐raised tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) in Thailand  ap. 49-54.  aBetanodavirus infection was diagnosed in larvae of farm‐raised tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.), in central Thailand.

Pasteurized liquid egg white, yolk and whole egg were hydrolyzed with a food grade aminopeptidase. Before enzyme inactivation, several ingredients were added, such as flavors and colors in liquid or powdered forms (salt, sugars, fruit or vegetal infusions). This yielded novel gels with various textures – from smooth and creamy to rigid – and light foams with a high foaming capacity and ability to re-incorporate air once collapsed, which were characterized by sensory and texture profile analysis. The elaboration process proved simple and fast, allowing an optimum use of the starting material without by-products. It provided the means to improve the techno-functional properties of the egg as an ingredient and to expand its use in new recipes, as well as in the development of new food products, particularly suitable for people with chewing limitations or digestion problems, overweigh, obesity, or sensitive to dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aaminopeptidases 3abyproducts 3acolor 3acuisine 3adairy products 3adigestion 3aegg albumen 3aeggs 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme inactivation 3aflavor 3afoaming capacity 3afoams 3afoods 3afruits 3agastronomy 3agels 3aingredients 3aliquids 3amastication 3aobesity 3apasteurization 3apeople 3aprotein hydrolysates 3arecipes 3asugars 3atexture 0aEgg proteins 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aTextures1 aSandoval, M.1 aMolina, E.1 aLópez-Fandiño, R.1 aMiguel, M.0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2016 Apr., v. 3 p.17-22dElsevier LtdaAZTI-TecnaliawJournal:21450x1878-45187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100006800183245008500251506007600336520122100412592002801633596004501661506003701706650001001743650001501753650001501768650002201783650001001805650001701815650001301832650000901845650000901854650001301863650001801876650000701894650001101901650002101912650002001933650002301953650001701976650001601993700001702009700005602026700006602082700001802148700002002166700002002186700002202206700006002228773012002288856007602408852000902484655001202493IND60647203520221207093658.0190617e20190602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064720352DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/62102402doi7 aPMC65892822pmcid7 a312756922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyẽ̂n, Tá̂n Tài,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7165-404210aAdsorptive Removal of Iron Using SiO2 Nanoparticles Extracted from Rice Husk Ash  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this work, SiO₂ nanoparticles were prepared by the sol-gel method after sodium silicate was extracted from rice husk ash (RHA) under various experimental conditions such as types of acids, NaOH concentration, dissolved time, and temperature and used for removal of Fe²⁺ ions from aqueous solutions. The extracted SiO₂ was morphologically and chemically characterized and showed a surface area of 78 m²/g and uniform pores of 2.71 nm, offering high adsorption capacity for Fe²⁺ ions. The influence of pH, contact time, and amount of adsorbent was studied in order to establish the best conditions for the Fe²⁺ adsorption and removal. Furthermore, the adsorption data were fitted with an exponential shape curve for all the three variable parameters that affect the adsorption process. The best results were obtained for pH 5, 20 min contact time, and 0.5 g adsorbent dose. The loading adsorption capacity was 9 mg of Fe²⁺ ions/g SiO₂ in the concentration range 0.1–1.0 mgL⁻¹. In addition, the synthesized SiO₂ with the size of around 50 nm can be used for specific heavy metal removal and drug delivery, after modification of the SiO₂ surface with various functional groups.  aPublisher supplied data  a181/HĐ.HĐCN-ĐHTVcTra Vinh University0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacids 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3adrugs 3aheavy metals 3ahusk ash 3aions 3airon 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3apH 3asilica 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium silicate 3asol-gel processing 3asurface area 3atemperature1 aMa, Hoa Thai1 aAvti, Pramod1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5603-45231 aBashir, Mohammed J.

JZ28 isolated from the root endosphere of the perennial desert tussock grass Panicum turgidum  ap. 1563-1569.  aCellulosimicrobium sp. JZ28, a root endophytic bacterium from the desert plant Panicum turgidum, was previously identified as a plant growth-promoting bacterium. The genome of JZ28 consists of a 4378,193 bp circular chromosome and contains 3930 CDSs with an average GC content of 74.5%. Whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed that JZ28 was closely related to C. aquatile 3 bp. The genome harbors genes responsible for protection against oxidative, osmotic and salinity stresses, such as the production of osmoprotectants. It also contains genes with a role in the production of volatiles, such as hydrogen sulfide, which promote biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The presence of three copies of chitinase genes indicates a possible role of JZ28 as biocontrol agent against fungal pathogens, while a number of genes for the degradation of plant biopolymers indicates potential application in industrial processes. Genome sequencing and mining of culture-dependent collections of bacterial endophytes from desert plants provide new opportunities for biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aBAS/1/1062-01-01cGlobal Collaborative Research, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology 3aCellulosimicrobium 3aPanicum turgidum 3abiological control agents 3abiopolymers 3achitinase 3achromosomes 3aendophytes 3afungi 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anucleotide sequences 3aosmotolerance 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3asalinity 3astress tolerance 3atussock grasses 3axerophytes1 aBougouffa, Salim1 aAlam, Intikhab1 aSaad, Maged M.1 aHirt, Heribert0 tArchives of microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 202, no. 6 p.1563-1569dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-01859-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006300188245010300251300001200354506007600366520210600442592002802548506003702576650002502613650000902638650002002647650002802667650001802695650001102713650002002724650001102744650001402755650002102769650002802790700002002818700002102838700002202859700001802881700002002899700002202919700002102941773011702962856008203079852000903161655001203170IND60643164520221207100545.0210403e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064316452DNAL7 aPMC65051052pmcid7 a310681812pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-019-1896-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandellone, Alessia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0858-497110aRedox unbalance in the hyperthyroid cat: a comparison with healthy and non-thyroidal diseased cats  ap. 136.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Feline hyperthyroidism, the most common endocrinopathy in older cats, provides a spontaneous model for human thyrotoxicosis. Human thyrotoxicosis is associated with redox unbalance, which may result in organ damage. The redox status of hyperthyroid cats is largely unknown. The aims of the present study were to compare the redox status of cats with hyperthyroidism with that of healthy cats and cats with chronic non-thyroidal illness. RESULTS: Forty cats with untreated hyperthyroidism (group H), 45 chronically ill cats with non-thyroidal illness (group I), and 39 healthy cats (group C) were recruited for this observational cross-sectional study. All cats were screened for redox status markers. Determinable reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) were used as oxidative stress markers. Antioxidant status was determined using the OXY-Adsorbent test to quantify the plasma barrier to oxidation. The Oxidative Stress index (OSi) was calculated as the ratio of d-ROMs and OXY-Adsorbent test values. Data were compared by ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-hoc test. The dROMs of group H (193 ± 47 CarrU) were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than those of the healthy cats (103 ± 17 CarrU). The OXY-Adsorbent test results in group H (265 ± 68 μmol HClO/ml) were significantly lower than those in healthy cats (390 ± 83 μmol HClO/ml; p &lt; 0.01) and chronically ill cats (306 ± 45 μmol HClO/ml, p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the Osi value in group H (0.8 ± 0.2 CarrU/μmol HClO/ml) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) than that of the healthy cats (0.3 ± 0.1 CarrU/μmol HClO/ml). CONCLUSIONS: As described in humans with hyperthyroidism, feline hyperthyroidism is associated with redox unbalance. Free radical production is increased in hyperthyroid cats and their antioxidant depletion seems to be more severe than in cats with non-thyroidal illnesses. Our results support the rationale for a clinical trial investigating the potential positive effects of antioxidant supplementation to cats with hyperthyroidism.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3acats 3aclinical trials 3across-sectional studies 3afree radicals 3ahumans 3ahyperthyroidism 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species1 aGianella, Paola1 aCeccarelli, Lara1 aRaviri, Graziella1 aBadino, Paola1 aRoncone, Silvia1 aKooistra, Hans S.1 aMeineri, Giorgia0 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.136-136dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1896-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01770naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015000167300001800317500001500335520075700350592002801107650001601135650002201151650001901173650001801192650001801210650002901228650001801257653001301275773009901288856004801387852000901435655001201444IND50061439120221120171724.0130319e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006143912DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293121200832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalinina, M.

It was shown that the anthropogenic factor affecting the distributions of the metals in the soil remained predominant. The highest differences compared to the control were observed for P, S, Cl, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb. A second accumulative soil horizon was developed, which was an additional source of contamination with mobile metals for the adjacent environments. Six years after the cessation of the application, the contents of Cu, Zn, and Ni exceeded their PPCs for sandy and loamy sandy soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3asandy soils 3achemical elements 3asoil pollution 3asewage sludge 3asoil horizons 3aanthropogenic activities 3asoil profiles 0aelements0 tEurasian soil science.g2012 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.1120-1128dSpringer-Verlagx1064-22937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1064229312120083  aDNAL 7aarticle01978naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245004400178300001600222520068500238592002800923650001400951650001000965650002500975650002001000650001001020650002401030650002101054650001101075650001301086650001101099650001601110650001301126650002001139653001601159653002001175653002401195653002101219653001801240700003101258700002801289773011201317856008201429852000901511655001201520IND60544114620221118230133.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054411462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Rojas, Berenice10aNutraceutical properties of phycocyanin  ap. 375-392.  aPhycocyanin (PC) is one of the main pigments of the algae Spirulina, which is used as a dietary supplement due to its high protein content.

We review current and emerging technologies that are changing the way we study and record the natural world. From websites to smartphones, data capture is becoming easier, faster and more accessible. Increases in data volume and wider participation raises concerns over data quality, which are being addressed with accurate sensors, automated validation tools, and verification platforms that utilize expert taxonomists and collective intelligence to ensure the highest level of quality possible. Data curation and interoperability have been transformed in the information age. The need to collate data at continental and global scales and across institutions continues to drive the formation of standardized data formats and taxonomies. Once collated these data can be analysed using high‐performance computing, and used to provide valuable feedback in the form of interactive visualizations, computer‐generated text or even game‐like rewards.

It is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV). Determination and comparison of the nucleotide sequences of PRRSV strains provides useful information in support of control initiatives or epidemiological studies on transmission patterns. The alignment of sequences is the first step in analyzing sequence data, with multiple algorithms being available, but little is known on the impact of this methodological choice. Here, a study was conducted to evaluate the impact of different alignment algorithms on the resulting aligned sequence dataset and on practical issues when applied to a large field database of PRRSV open reading frame (ORF) 5 sequences collected in Quebec, Canada, from 2010 to 2014. Five multiple sequence alignment programs were compared: Clustal W, Clustal Omega, Muscle, T-Coffee and MAFFT. RESULTS: The resulting alignments showed very similar results in terms of average pairwise genetic similarity, proportion of pairwise comparisons having ≥97.5% genetic similarity and sum of pairs (SP) score, except for T-Coffee where increased length of aligned datasets as well as limitation to handle large datasets were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on efficiency at minimizing the number of gaps in different dataset sizes with default open gap values as well as the capability to handle a large number of sequences in a timely manner, the use of Clustal Omega might be recommended for the management of PRRSV extensive database for both research and surveillance purposes.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject #1343cSwine Cluster 20 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aepidemiological studies 3agenetic similarity 3amonitoring 3aopen reading frames 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apork industry 3asequence alignment 3aQuebec1 aArsenault, Julie1 aDelisle, Benjamin1 aAudet, Pascal1 aPoljak, Zvonimir1 aD’Allaire, Sylvie0 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.135-135dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1890-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04579naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245012000170520279900290592002803089650002203117650001103139650002003150650001703170650001803187650003303205650001503238650001703253650001303270650001303283650001403296650002403310650002903334650001403363650001503377650001403392650001903406651001003425651001203435651001703447653002003464653002003484653002703504653002503531653003403556653003603590700001703626700001903643700001503662700001803677700001703695700001903712700001603731700001203747773010903759856008803868852000903956655001203965IND60752539720221120102730.0220222e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075253972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.1036692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinchun10aFormation of Late Ordovician marine red beds: A case study of Sandbian deposits in the Tarim Basin, Northwest China  aThe late Ordovician was an important transition interval between the mid-Ordovician biological radiation and end-Ordovician extinction. Marine red beds (MRB) of Late Ordovician are distributed worldwide, including in the Americas, South Africa, England, and China. Among them, the conditions that contributed to the widespread Katian MRB was a combination of terrigenous input, cool-water settings, sediment oxidation, volcanic material input, and seasonal aridity. In contrast, Hirnantian MRB have a more limited distribution, and their occurrence might be related to regional tectonic settings and icehouse conditions. Sandbian MRB are distributed worldwide, but are relatively poorly studied. Even though Sandbian MRB are very similar in some characteristics to the Katian MRB, we don't know which factors were important to their formation and how these were related to marine environmental change and tectonic evolution. The Dawangou section near Kalping in the Tarim Basin of northwest China is an important global reference section for the auxiliary GSSP of the Middle–Late Ordovician boundary and for Sandbian through early Katian biostratigraphy and chronostratigraphy. Diffuse reflection spectroscopy, major and trace element analysis, rare earth element analysis, and sedimentology were employed to study the interval of Sandbian MRB in the Kanling Formation (within the N. gracilis graptolite zone) relative to underlying and overlying deposits. The red-colored strata have elevated total Fe and hematite contents, whereas the grey and grey-green samples have much a lower total Fe and a significant lack of hematite and goethite. The total Fe content for strata within the Sandbian MRB varies with the clay content. The AlFe correlation within the Sandbian MRB is 0.9, whereas it is 0.6 for the non-red sediments. The Th/U ratio is much higher in the red-colored beds (averaging 7.0) relative to the underlying and overlying sediments (averaging 4.4). However, a redox proxy of Ni/Co ratios does not exhibit a significant difference between the underlying and overlying sediments (averages of 2.6 and 2.8) and the reddish Sandbian MRB interval (average of 2.6). The results indicated that the Sandbian marine red beds of the Tarim were formed during conditions of marine oxygenation that helped form and preserve the iron oxide. However, the regional distribution and aspects of the sediment geochemistry imply that another essential process for the formation of these Sandbian MRB was the influx of terrestrial iron-rich sediments from the exposed uplifts into the mixed shelf regions; and that this influx was partly governed by the regional patterns of southward subduction of the South Tianshan ocean and of northward subduction of the Altyn to the margins of the Tarim block.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrdovician period 3abasins 3abiostratigraphy 3acase studies 3aclay fraction 3adry environmental conditions 3aextinction 3ageochemistry 3agoethite 3ahematite 3aoxidation 3arare earth elements 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asediments 3asubduction 3atectonics 3atrace elements 3aChina 3aEngland 3aSouth Africa 0aLate Ordovician 0aMarine red beds 0aElemental geochemistry 0aSouth Tianshan Ocean 0aPaleomarine redox environment 0aDiffuse reflection spectroscopy1 aHou, Mingcai1 aChang, Xiaolin1 aWang, Song1 aOgg, James G.1 aLuo, Hongwei1 aZhang, Hongrui1 aMu, Caineng1 aLiu, Yu0 tGlobal and planetary change.g2021 Dec., v. 207 p.103669-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12406x0921-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.1036693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03259naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006100149245007700210300001600287520185700303592002802160650001202188650001002200650001902210650001702229650003002246650001902276650001102295650001502306650001202321650001002333650001202343650001602355650002002371650002302391650001902414650001802433650001502451650002202466653002202488653001602510653002702526700002302553773010802576856008402684852000902768655001202777IND60615692120221120035140.0210114e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061569212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2018.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScanlan, Craig A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2199-993910aSoil mixing and redistribution by strategic deep tillage in a sandy soil  ap. 139-145.  aStrategic deep tillage (SDT) is proposed as a single or occasional practice to help sustain the long-term productivity of the no-till system. Soil water repellence, herbicide resistant weeds, subsoil acidity and compaction are constraints that can evolve in long-term no-till systems and SDT may provide an effective solution for these. While the effect of SDT on the lateral and vertical movement of soil is understood, soil heterogeneity and mixing caused by SDT is not. Soil mixing may be an important factor for the availability of soil nutrients after SDT or for the effectiveness of soil amendments. Soil mixing and redistribution were quantified using coloured soil tracers and digital image analysis. Trenches of synthetic coloured soil were installed at four depths at a field site and four tillage treatments were applied; offset disc harrow and deep ripping (DHDR), disc plough (DP), mouldboard plough (MP) and rotary spader (RS). Digital images were acquired for soil pit faces at 5 cm intervals to capture the location of the coloured soil after SDT, these images were segmented and the 3-dimensional distribution of the coloured soil tracers was reconstructed. The mixing indices for the tillage treatments were low level (0.04–0.12). The vertical movement of soil differed between treatments; approximately 80, 60, 60 and 10% of soil from 0 to 10 cm was redistributed to deeper soil layers by MP, DP, RS and DHDR respectively. The soil profiles after the SDT treatments were composed of layered, or rotated soil that had been translocated within the working depth of the implement; however, there was some mixing at the interface between layers, or seams of soil that originated from different depths. The impact of a change in the spatial distribution of soil nutrients created by SDT on crop growth is an important knowledge gap.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acolor 3adigital images 3adisc harrows 3aherbicide-resistant weeds 3aimage analysis 3amixing 3ano-tillage 3aplowing 3aplows 3aripping 3asandy soils 3asoil amendments 3asoil heterogeneity 3asoil nutrients 3asoil profiles 3asoil water 3atracer techniques 0aStrategic tillage 0aSoil mixing 0aDigital image analysis1 aDavies, Stephen L.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2019 Jan., v. 185 p.139-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.09.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016300167520103500330592002801365650000801393650001501401650001601416650002001432650002101452650001601473650002501489650001801514650001601532650001901548650001601567650001701583653003201600653001801632653002101650653003301671653002301704700001801727700001501745700001301760700005901773700001801832700001401850700002701864773009201891856008601983852000902069655001202078IND60705483120221121015029.0201125e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070548312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoyan12aA novel electrochemical immunosensor for hepatitis B surface antigen based on Fe3O4 nanoflowers and heterogeneous chain reaction signal amplification strategy  aHerein, a novel sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor was fabricated based on Fe₃O₄ nanoflowers (Fe₃O₄ NFs) and heterogeneous chain reaction (HCR) signal amplification strategy for the sensitive detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The aldehyde-functionalized Fe₃O₄ NFs are used as a supporting matrix to immobilize the hepatitis B surface antibody 1 (HBsAb1). The biotin-modified single-strand DNA (biotin-S0) was connected onto the biotin-HBsAb2 via linkage of streptavidin (SA), followed by addition of methylene blue (MB) modified single strand DNA1 (MB-S1) and DNA2 (MB-S2) for HCR signal amplification. The designed immunosensor exhibited a detection linear range of 0.5 pg mL⁻¹-0.25 ng mL⁻¹ and a low detection limit of 0.16 pg mL⁻¹, with excellent stability, selectivity and reproducibility. Furthermore, HBsAg is detected in the serum samples with a stable and fast response, indicating that the proposed immunosensor has a promising potential application in clinical analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatitis B antigens 3aimmunosensors 3airon oxides 3amethylene blue 3ananoflowers 3astreptavidin 0aHepatitis B surface Antigen 0aSandwich-type 0aFe3O4 nanoflower 0aHeterogeneous chain reaction 0aClinical diagnosis1 aLiu, Tianchen1 aZhang, Yun1 aNi, Xiao1 aHossain, M.

Some studies show fetal and developmental abnormalities as the result of radiofrequency radiation exposure. We aimed to investigate possible teratogenic effects of radiofrequency in 915 MHz on mice fetus and protective role of vitamin C. 21 pregnant mice were divided into 3 groups. Control group was in normal condition without any stressor agent. Exposure group was exposed to 915 MHz RFR (8 h/day for 10 days) and 0.045 µw/cm² power density. The exposure plus vitamin C group received 200 mg/kg vitamin C by gavage and was exposed to 915 MHz RFR (8 h/day for 10 days) and 0.045 µw/cm² power density. The fetus weight, C-R length were measured by digital balance and caliper. Tissues were assessed after staining with H & E. Our results showed significant increase in fetus weight and C-R length and also enlarged liver, tail deformation in mice fetus in exposure group. Although usage of vitamin C caused significant decrease in mentioned parameters. The outcome of this study confirms the effects of radiofrequency radiation on growth parameters such as body weight, length and some tissues in mice fetuses and protective effect of vitamin C. However more studies on non-ionization radiation in different frequencies and severity, during pregnancy are needed to clarify the exact mechanisms of these changes and better protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3abody weight 3adeformation 3afetus 3aliver 3apregnancy 3aprotective effect 3aradio waves 3atail 3ateratogenicity 0aRadiofrequency radiation 0aMice fetus tissues 0aVitamin C 0aFetal and developmental abnormalities1 aAshtarinezhad, Azadeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7923-53871 aAsl, Baharak Mohamadzadeh1 aMasruri, Batol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3472-91961 aMoghadasi, Nargess0 tData in Brief.g2018 Aug., v. 19 p.2189-2194dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02242naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245018500155300001600340520114600356592002801502650002101530650001101551650001301562650001201575650002101587650001001608651002301618700001901641700001801660700001601678773012901694856007201823852000901895655001201904IND60648073420221118015107.0190626e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064807342DNAL7 a10.3390/f30409862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoots, Carla10aDiversity, Vertical Stratification and Co-Occurrence Patterns of the Mycetophilid Community among Eastern Hemlock, Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carri&#232;re, in the Southern Appalachians  ap. 986-996.  aOver 400 species of insects have been found in association with eastern hemlock in the southern Appalachians. Eastern hemlock stands provide an ideal habitat for all life stages of mycetophilids. However, the diversity, distribution and co-occurrence patterns of these species throughout the tree canopy are unknown. This study was initiated to evaluate abundance, species richness and species composition within three designated strata in the canopy of eastern hemlock, assess species for vertical stratification patterns, and determine if co-occurrence patterns of mycetophilid species are random or non-random. During this study, 24 species representing 14 genera were identified and evaluated. Mycetophilid abundance, species richness and composition differed among the lower, middle, and upper strata. Unique assemblages were identified in each stratum, indicating vertical stratification. The upper stratum of the canopy had four exclusive species, the middle had six exclusive species, and the lower stratum had nine exclusive species. The co-occurrence pattern of mycetophilid species in the canopy of eastern hemlock was non-random.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTsuga canadensis 3acanopy 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3aspecies richness 3atrees 3aAppalachian region1 aLambdin, Paris1 aGrant, Jerome1 aRhea, Rusty0 tForests.g2012 Oct. 24, v. 3, no. 4 p.986-996dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f30409863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01073naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245009000158300001600248520019200264592002800456650002300484650001300507700002500520700002100545700002100566773012600587856007300713852000900786655001200795IND60658192920221119132400.0190816e20080129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065819292DNAL7 a10.1039/b716521h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngelin, Marcus10aTandem driven dynamic combinatorial resolution via Henry–iminolactone rearrangement  ap. 768-770.  aAn unexplored type of tandem reaction is used to kinetically resolve a dynamic combinatorial library resulting in quantitative amplification of an interesting 3-substituted isoindolinone.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3alactones1 aVongvilai, Pornrapee1 aFischer, Andreas1 aRamström, Olof,0 tChemical communications.g2008 Jan. 29, , no. 6 p.768-770dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b716521h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010700163300001600270500001900286520199900305592002802304650001902332650001402351650001602365650001102381650002102392650002402413650002602437650001702463650001902480650000902499650001102508650001102519650002902530653002702559653003102586700002402617700002102641700002102662773012702683856008002810852000902890655001202899IND60708428620221118031348.0200825e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070842862DNAL7 a10.21273/HORTSCI14396-192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruying10aSand Size Affects Topdressing Removed by Mowing and Anthracnose on Annual Bluegrass Putting Green Turf  ap. 237-243.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSand size can affect the ability to incorporate topdressing into the turf canopy and thatch on golf course putting greens; unincorporated sand interferes with mowing and play. This 3-year field trial was initiated to determine the effects of sand size on sand incorporation, surface wetness, and anthracnose (caused by Colletotrichum cereale Manns sensu lato Crouch, Clarke, and Hillman) of annual bluegrass [Poa annua L. f. reptans (Hausskn) T. Koyama] maintained as a putting green. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications; treatments included a non-topdressed control and three topdressing sands (medium-coarse, medium, or medium-fine) applied every 2 weeks at 0.15 L·m⁻² during the summer. Topdressing with medium-coarse sand was more difficult to incorporate than the medium and medium-fine sands, resulting in a greater quantity of sand collected with mower clippings. Analyzing the particle distribution of sand removed by mowing confirmed that coarser sand particles were more likely to be removed in mower clippings. Surface wetness measured as volumetric water content (VWC) at the 0- to 38-mm depth zone was greater in non-topdressed plots than topdressed plots on 35% of observations. Few differences in VWC were found among sand size treatments. Turf responses to topdressing were not immediate; however, as sand accumulated in the turf canopy, topdressed plots typically had lower anthracnose severity than non-topdressed turf after the first year. Additionally, topdressing with medium and medium-fine sands produced similar or occasionally lower disease severity than topdressing with medium-coarse sand. The lack of negative effects of medium and medium-fine sands combined with better incorporation after topdressing and less disruption to the putting surface should allow golf course superintendents to apply topdressing at frequencies and/or quantities needed during the summer to maintain high-quality turf and playing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aPoa annua 3aanthracnose 3acanopy 3adisease severity 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3agolf courses 3alawns and turf 3asand 3asummer 3athatch 3avolumetric water content 0aColletotrichum cereale 0aparticle size distribution1 aHempfling, James W.1 aClarke, Bruce B.1 aMurphy, James A.0 tHortScience.g2020 Feb., v. 55, no. 2 p.237-243dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:1941x2327-98347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI14396-193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245011900195500002000314520111000334592002801444596013701472596012501609596004301734650002201777650002401799650000901823650000901832650001901841650001501860700003101875700002701906773013201933856007502065852000902140655001202149IND60789309320221116192246.0220819e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078930932DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.125242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRe, Mariano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5465-325610aHigh‐resolution urban flood model for risk mitigation validated with records collected by the affected community  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Dupuy catchment (Laferrere, Metropolitan Region of Buenos Aires) has suffered numerous floods in recent years. The frequency and magnitude of these events, coupled with the large number of people affected, has led to some community representatives organising themselves to collect flood records, increase awareness of the problem and push for solutions and mitigating actions. That campaign inspired the study of the flooding dynamics of the catchment, with the aim of developing simple tools for risk mitigation. To analyse the water dynamics in the catchment, a high‐resolution urban numerical model was implemented with the EPA‐SWMM software. Due to the lack of systematic observations of flow variables, the model was validated using data collected by the affected community itself. More than 500 simulations of different synthetic storms were run on a high‐performance computational cluster and analysed. These processed results, coupled with the observation of rainfall intensities during an event, may be used by the community and risk managers to reduce exposure and mitigate flood risk.  aPublisher supplied data  aPIDDEF 41 2014‐2017cFloods in urban catchments: understanding the water dynamics for the implementation of nonstructural measures  aUBACyT 2016‐2019cMinistry of Defense.

We attempted to construct a p–i–n structure (p: p-layer; i: interlayer, a mixture of p- and n-materials; n: n-layer) using a solution process. To increase the donor–acceptor interface area, we synthesized covalently linked donor–acceptor compounds, tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP)–fullerene (C₆₀) dyad. To investigate the effect of the covalent connection of the donor and acceptor units on the film morphology and on the OPV performances, the BP and fullerene units were connected by a flexible or rigid linker (f-BP–C₆₀ or r-BP–C₆₀). To synthesize these dyads, new synthetic routes with mono-meso-substituted BPs using [2 + 2] and [2 + 1 + 1] condensation reactions were performed. The intramolecular fluorescence quenching efficiency of BP by the C₆₀ unit of f-BP–C₆₀ was higher than that of r-BP–C₆₀ in CH₂Cl₂ because of the flexibility of the linker and the close location of the C₆₀ unit to the BP unit. The carrier mobility in the r-BP–C₆₀ film measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique was better than that of the f-BP–C₆₀ film, and the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)-type OPV performance of the r-BP–C₆₀ film was better than that of the f-BP–C₆₀ film. In spite of the superior OPV performance of the r-BP–C₆₀ device compared to the f-BP–C₆₀, the short circuit current density (JSC) and FF of the p–i–n device with BP, f-BP–C₆₀, and [6,6]-phenyl-C₆₁-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) for p-, i- and n-layers was better than the device with r-BP–C₆₀ as the i-layer. AFM images of the layers and OPV performances suggested that the flexible f-BP–C₆₀ is suitable for the i-layer on the highly crystalline BP film because the roughness of the BP film is leveled by the f-BP–C₆₀, and the electric properties of the device are improved by the smooth interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acondensation reactions 3aelectrical properties 3afluorescence 3afullerene 3amethylene chloride 3aroughness 3asolar energy1 aKuzuhara, Daiki1 aSuzuki, Mitsuharu1 aHayashi, Hironobu1 aAratani, Naoki1 aYamada, Hiroko0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 4, no. 40 p.15333-15342dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta06599f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245008000164300001600244520159400260592002801854650000801882650001701890650001701907650001401924650001501938650001401953650001201967773016501979856007302144852000902217655001202226IND60340779820221121014118.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034077982DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.125162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLawson Handley, Lori10aHow will the ‘molecular revolution’ contribute to biological recording?  ap. 750-766.  aSoaring throughput, plummeting costs, and increased sensitivity for assaying degraded or low‐concentration DNA are driving a revolution in the way that we monitor biodiversity. Arguably the biggest ‘game‐changer’ is environmental DNA (eDNA), which refers to free‐floating DNA released by organisms into their environment. Rare or elusive species can be detected with greater sensitivity and accuracy using eDNA than by most conventional methods, and we have the capability to screen and describe whole communities, as well as perform targeted monitoring of single species. This paper discusses the basic approaches for molecular monitoring of biodiversity, provides case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques, and considers any challenges and limitations that could impact molecular biological recording. It is argued that eDNA surveys offer exciting new opportunities to engage the public in biological recording and that molecular approaches will complement conventional surveys, enabling unprecedented insights into species distributions. Finally, with the number of eDNA studies increasing at a rapid pace, it is argued that there is a need to rapidly establish ways of managing molecular records. Integrating molecular records into existing biological records databases would enhance our understanding of species distributions and may be something that the Biological Records Centre should be considering to mark its landmark anniversary. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, ●●, ●●–●●.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3adatabases 3amonitoring 3aorganisms 3asurveys0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2015 July, v. 115, no. 3 p.750-766dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.125163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009700168300001600265520229600281592002802577650002102605650001102626650001902637650000902656650001702665650001202682650001502694650001302709650001502722650001502737650001502752650001202767650001202779650002902791700002602820700002202846700001602868773010402884856007902988852000903067655001203076IND60515905120221118061242.0160321e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051590512DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.125112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFronstin, Raime B.10aExperimental reduction of haematocrit affects reproductive performance in European starlings  ap. 398-409.  aGiven the function of haemoglobin and observed increases in haematocrit during periods of increased energetic demands, haematocrit and haemoglobin are assumed to be related to aerobic capacity. Reductions in haematocrit and haemoglobin during reproduction are similar in magnitude to increases associated with aerobically demanding activities, and therefore, we sought to investigate whether these reductions in haematology have consequences for reproductive performance. We analysed associations between natural variation in haematology in free‐living European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and reproductive performance. To test whether transient reductions in haematology during different stages of reproduction (egg production and late incubation/early chick rearing) affected measures of reproductive performance, we also manipulated haematology using phenylhydrazine (PHZ), which lyses red blood cells. To investigate effects of reductions of haematology during egg‐laying, we treated females with PHZ or saline (control) upon completion of their unmanipulated first clutch and removed eggs to induce the production and rearing of a replacement clutch. To investigate effects of reductions of haematology during chick rearing, we treated females during incubation of the unmanipulated first clutch and then monitored the subsequent hatching and rearing of the clutch. Individuals with higher haematocrit and haemoglobin initiated nesting earlier. Furthermore, higher haemoglobin levels during incubation were associated with a greater number of chicks fledged. PHZ treatment prior to egg production resulted in a significant delay in the laying of replacement clutches, but had no effect on provisioning rate or the size or number of chicks fledged. PHZ treatment during incubation and early chick rearing resulted in decreased hatchling mass in all years and a decrease in the size and number of fledglings in one of 2 years. The year that the effect of PHZ was observed appeared to be a particularly difficult year, as hatchling mass, brood size at hatching and at fledging were low among control females compared to other years. Our results suggest that a reduction in haematology during reproduction can be functionally significant, but that these costs are context‐dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSturnus vulgaris 3achicks 3aegg production 3aeggs 3aerythrocytes 3afemales 3afledglings 3ahatching 3ahematocrit 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3anesting 3arearing 3areproductive performance1 aChristians, Julian K.1 aWilliams, Tony D.1 aLewis, Sara0 tFunctional ecology.g2016 Mar., v. 30, no. 3 p.398-409dBritish Ecological Societyx0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.125113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245025000172520147300422592002801895650001301923650003501936650001101971650002001982650001302002650001702015650001602032650001302048650001902061650001702080650001802097650001202115650001302127650002002140650001602160650000702176650001602183650001302199650001402212650001302226650000902239650001802248650001402266650001402280653001702294653003002311653001402341653001302355653001502368653002102383700002502404700002502429773009202454856008602546852000902632655001202641IND60705483220221121015108.0210603e20210115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070548322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLlaver, Mauricio10aSimultaneous and highly sensitive determination of selenium and tellurium species in environmental samples by on-line ionic liquid based in-situ solvent formation microextraction with hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry detection  aA novel on-line preconcentration and speciation analysis method for the simultaneous determination of inorganic Se and Te species is presented in this work. The methodology is based on the on-line formation of a hydrophobic ionic liquid (IL) directly in the liquid sample stream of a flow injection system, thus achieving an efficient and rapid extraction of the analytes complexed with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate into the finely dispersed extractant droplets, that were then retained in a column filled with cotton. A full study of the chemical and hydrodynamical parameters was developed, including the right selection of the IL used as extractant and its concentration, pH, complexing reagent, sample and ion-exchange reagent volumes and column design. Additionally, a miniaturized external hydride generator was adapted to the spectrometer in order to increase the sensitivity of the atomic fluorescence measurements using only 250 μL of 5 mol L⁻¹ HNO₃ in methanol as eluent. The analytical figures of merit obtained for 15 mL of sample included sensitivity enhancement factors of 71, 70, 49 and 40 for Te(IV), Te(VI), Se(IV) and Se(VI), respectively, and limits of detection of 1.8 ng L⁻¹ for both Te species, 2.6 ng L⁻¹ for Se(IV) and 3.2 ng L⁻¹ for Se(VI). After optimization, the method was successfully applied for the analysis of environmental samples: soils and sediments, as well as sea, river, underground and tap water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acotton 3adetection limit 3adroplets 3afluorescence 3agroundwater 3ahydrides 3ahydrophobicity 3aion exchange 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3amethanol 3amicroextraction 3anitric acid 3apH 3ariver water 3aseawater 3asediments 3aselenium 3asoil 3aspectrometers 3atap water 3atellurium 0aIonic liquid 0aIn-situ solvent formation 0aTellurium 0aSelenium 0aSpeciation 0aPreconcentration1 aChapana, Agostina L.1 aWuilloud, Rodolfo G.0 tTalanta.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 222 p.121460-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245004600135300001600181520091500197592002801112650001201140650001201152650001901164650002401183650001501207650001401222650001701236650002201253650002401275650001101299650001101310651002601321773012501347852000901472655001201481IND60300712020221122000942.0150703e20120713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030071202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aService, Robert F.10aRising Acidity Brings an Ocean of Trouble  ap. 146-148.  aThe burning of fossil fuels emits some 35 billion metric tons of CO ₂ into the atmosphere every year. That has already begun to change the fundamental chemistry of the world's oceans, steadily increasing their level of acidity. On page 220 of this week's issue of Science , scientists report projections from a new high-resolution computer model showing that over the next 4 decades, the combination of deep-water upwelling and rising atmospheric CO ₂ is likely to have profound impacts on waters off the West Coast of the United States, home to one of the world's most diverse marine ecosystems and most important commercial fisheries. The new computer model is only one of several recent warning signs. Numerous laboratory and field studies over the past few years underscore rising concerns that ocean acidification could devastate marine ecosystems on which millions of people depend for food and jobs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3acomputer simulation 3aemployment 3afisheries 3afossil fuels 3amarine ecosystems 3aocean acidification 3aoceans 3apeople 3aWestern United States0 tScience.g2012 July 13, v. 337, no. 6091 p.146-148dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245012000160300001600280520171100296592002802007650001402035650002502049650001402074650001402088650001402102650001602116650002102132650001702153650001802170650002002188650002202208650002202230650001902252650002002271650004302291650001702334650001802351650001702369650001302386650001402399650001402413650005202427650002202479650001402501700001402515700001902529700001402548700001602562700001302578700001802591700002002609700001802629773008102647856004802728852000902776655001202785IND50062584720221117222336.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006258472DNAL7 a10.1007/s11745-012-3728-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBin, Qiu14aThe Caspase Pathway of Linoelaidic Acid (9t, 12t-C18:2)-Induced Apoptosis in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells  ap. 115-126.  aTrans fatty acids (TFA) are reported to contribute to inflammation and coronary heart disease. The study aim was to investigate the proapoptotic effects of two double bond TFA (TDTFA) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The HUVEC were grown in media supplied with linoelaidic acid (9t,12t-C18:2) at 50, 100, 200, 400 μmol/l for 24 or 48 h to examine the effects of TDTFA on the viability and apoptosis of these cells. Flow cytometry analysis and confocal scanning were used to measure apoptosis, cell binding of Annexin V and propidium iodide uptake. Colorimetric assay and RT-PCR were used to analyze enzyme activities and mRNA expression of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in HUVEC. Results showed that 9t,12t-C18:2 inhibited the viability of HUVEC in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. The percentages of 9t,12t-C18:2 induced apoptotic and necrotic cells significantly increased compared with that of the control. The activities and mRNA expression of caspase-8, -9 and -3 were significantly increased in 9t,12t-C18:2 treated cells compared to that of the control. Addition of specific inhibitors of caspase-8 (z-IETD-fmk) and caspase-9 (z-LEHD-fmk) to HUVEC was found to completely inhibit 9t,12t-C18:2-induced activation of caspase-3, and z-IETD-fmk inhibited the activation of caspase-9. Meanwhile, it was found that mRNA expression of Bid, Smac/DIABLO and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c were significantly elevated by 9t,12t-C18:2 treatment. These results suggest that 9t,12t-C18:2 may induce apoptosis of HUVEC through activating caspase-8, -9 and -3. Both the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway may be involved in the apoptosis induced by 9t,12t-C18:2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiochemical pathways 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3acolorimetry 3acoronary disease 3acytochrome c 3adose response 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3amitochondria 3anecrosis 3apropidium 3areceptors 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atrans fatty acids 3aviability1 aRao, Huan1 aHu, Jiang-Ning1 aLiu, Rong1 aFan, Ya-Wei1 aLi, Jing1 aDeng, Ze-Yuan1 aZhong, Xianfeng1 aDu, Fang-Ling0 tLipids.g2013 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.115-126dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-012-3728-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03427naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008500161300001600246520208300262592002802345650001302373650001602386650002002402650001502422650001102437650001902448650001502467650001302482650001502495650001802510650001802528650001702546650002602563650001402589651001902603700001802622700002102640700002002661700001902681700002202700773016502722856007302887852000902960655001202969IND60340779920221121024937.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034077992DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.125272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Jeremy A.10aRecent trends in UK insects that inhabit early successional stages of ecosystems  ap. 636-646.  aImproved recording of less popular groups, combined with new statistical approaches that compensate for datasets that were hitherto too patchy for quantitative analysis, now make it possible to compare recent trends in the status of UK invertebrates other than butterflies. Using BRC datasets, we analysed changes in status between 1992 and 2012 for those invertebrates whose young stages exploit early seral stages within woodland, lowland heath and semi‐natural grassland ecosystems, a habitat type that had declined during the 3 decades previous to 1990 alongside a disproportionally high number of Red Data Book species that were dependent on it. Two clear patterns emerged from a meta‐analysis involving 299 classifiable species belonging to ten invertebrate taxa: (i) during the past 2 decades, most early seral species that are living near their northern climatic limits in the UK have increased relative to the more widespread members of these guilds whose distributions were not governed by a need for a warm micro‐climate; and (ii) independent of climatic constraints, species that are restricted to the early stages of woodland regeneration have fared considerably less well than those breeding in the early seral stages of grasslands or, especially, heathland. The first trend is consistent with predicted benefits for northern edge‐of‐range species as a result of climate warming in recent decades. The second is consistent with our new assessment of the availability of early successional stages in these three ecosystems since c. 1990. Whereas the proportion and continuity of early seral patches has greatly increased within most semi‐natural grasslands and lowland heaths, thanks respectively to agri‐environmental schemes and conservation management, the representation of fresh clearings has continued to dwindle within UK woodlands, whose floors are increasingly shaded and ill‐suited for this important guild of invertebrates. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, ●●, ●●–●●.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3abutterflies 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afloors 3aglobal warming 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aheathlands 3ainvertebrates 3ameta-analysis 3amicroclimate 3aquantitative analysis 3awoodlands 3aUnited Kingdom1 aEdwards, Mike1 aSimcox, David J.1 aPowney, Gary D.1 aAugust, Tom A.1 aIsaac, Nick J.

The physical properties of the CSNP were investigated. Rheological properties of the crystalline starch nanofluid (CSNF) were compared with native cassava starch (CS) and commercial polymer xanthan. Interfacial properties of the CSNF at the interface of oil and water (O/W) were investigated at different concentrations and temperatures. Wettability alteration efficiency of CSNF on oil-wet sandstone surface was investigated using the sessile drop method. Core flooding experiment was conducted at reservoir conditions. The methods were effective in producing spherical and polygonal nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 100 nm and increased in crystallinity of 7%. Viscosity increased with increase in surface area and temperature of the CSNF compared to a decrease in viscosity as the temperature increases for xanthan. Interfacial tension (IFT) decreased with increase in concentration of CSNF, electrolyte and temperature. The results show that CSNF can change the wettability of sandstone at low concentration, high salinity and elevated temperature. Pressure drops data shows stability of CSNF at 120 °C.

The livestock transport is a vital component of today’s world agrifood economy that directly impacts on the development of animal production, animal welfare, public policies, labor regulations, food safety, markets and consumers. In this study two aims were established; the first aim was to identify the attitudes and perceptions of commercial hauliers towards animal welfare and their influence on the accident risks. The second aim was to characterize the current practices of the commercial cattle transport in Mexico and to detect the risk factors for animal welfare and hauliers’ wellbeing. The interviews were conducted individually at the hauliers’ rest points, sanitary inspection points localized along the Federal Highway 57 or at the companies’ offices of cattle transportation. We used univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics based on a hierarchical cluster analysis. The results showed that cattle transport in Mexico is characterized for long travel distances because the cattle departed from farms in the southern states of Mexico to the feedlots located in central and northern regions of the country. The journeys of short and middle distances departed from the feedlots to the slaughterhouses. The hauliers’ characteristics were: age from 29 to 48 years-old, elementary or secondary studies completed, 65% of hauliers mentioned six years of experience in cattle transport, they learned about cattle transportation by means of a family member who was already engaged in this activity. The cluster analysis identified four hauliers’ groups: groups 1 and 3 were related to animal welfare and groups 2 and 4 less related to animal welfare. This study showed that empathy towards cattle was a key element in identifying hauliers at risk of road accidents during cattle transportation. Years of experience in cattle transport played an important role in emphasizing closer perceptions towards welfare. Considering current trends towards increased transport times and logistics stops, there is a need to develop systems of welfare assessment and decision-making that provide tools and protocols that can minimize the biological cost to animals and hauliers, which may have been underestimated in the past.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccidents 3aanimal welfare 3aattitudes and opinions 3abeef 3acattle 3acluster analysis 3adecision making 3afarms 3afeedlots 3afood safety 3ainterviews 3alabor 3amarkets 3amultivariate analysis 3apublic policy 3arisk factors 3aslaughterhouses 3asurveys 3atransportation 3awelfare assessment 3aMexico 0aOne-health 0aHauliers 0aCattle transport 0aAnimal welfare 0aAttitudes1 aEstévez-Moreno, L.X.1 aRayas-Amor, A.A.1 aRubio-Lozano, M.S.1 aGalindo, F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7975-45471 aMiranda-de la Lama, G.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6848-10100 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 160 p.76-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002300138245007600161300001600237520134100253592002801594650002001622650002401642650001401666650002501680650001101705650001401716650001201730650001001742650001101752650001101763650002301774650003201797650001501829650001001844650000901854651001501863700001901878700002201897773012901919856007202048961001202120852000902132655001202141IND60648073720221118015132.0190626e20130321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064807372DNAL7 a10.3390/f40101792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRitchie, Martin W.10aAboveground Tree Biomass for Pinus ponderosa in Northeastern California  ap. 179-196.  aForest managers need accurate biomass equations to plan thinning for fuel reduction or energy production. Estimates of carbon sequestration also rely upon such equations. The current allometric equations for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) commonly employed for California forests were developed elsewhere, and are often applied without consideration potential for spatial or temporal variability. Individual-tree aboveground biomass allometric equations are presented from an analysis of 79 felled trees from four separate management units at Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest: one unthinned and three separate thinned units. A simultaneous set of allometric equations for foliage, branch and bole biomass were developed as well as branch-level equations for wood and foliage. Foliage biomass relationships varied substantially between units while branch and bole biomass estimates were more stable across a range of stand conditions. Trees of a given breast height diameter and crown ratio in thinned stands had more foliage biomass, but slightly less branch biomass than those in an unthinned stand. The observed variability in biomass relationships within Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest suggests that users should consider how well the data used to develop a selected model relate to the conditions in any given application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus ponderosa 3aaboveground biomass 3aallometry 3acarbon sequestration 3aenergy 3aequations 3aforests 3afuels 3aleaves 3amodels 3atemporal variation 3atree and stand measurements 3atree trunk 3atrees 3awood 3aCalifornia1 aZhang, Jianwei1 aHamilton, Todd A.0 tForests.g2013 Mar. 21, v. 4, no. 1 p.179-196dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f40101793Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007200147245015600219300001600375500001900391520172500410592002802135650002502163650002402188650001302212650002202225650001602247650002102263650001302284650001502297650001302312650001702325653002202342653001602364653003602380653001402416700003602430700002902466773012502495856008102620852000902701655001202710IND60727396320221121151119.0210211e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072739632DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585200002032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthuthanthirige, Deshika L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2995-857610aEpicotyl morphophysiological dormancy and storage behaviour of seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica, Strychnos potatorum and Strychnos benthamii (Loganiaceae)  ap. 284-292.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe hypothesized that Strychnos nux-vomica and Strychnos potatorum in seasonal tropical ecosystems have dormant desiccation-tolerant seeds, while those of Strychnos benthamii growing in aseasonal wet habitats have non-dormant desiccation-sensitive seeds. Germination, imbibition, the effect of gibberellic acid on germination and changes in the embryo to seed length ratio (E:S) during incubation were determined for the three species. Seed storage behaviour was identified with the hundred seed test. Time taken for epicotyl emergence was recorded. Radicle emergence of S. nux-vomica, S. potatorum and S. benthamii at 25°C under light/dark conditions (12/12 h) was completed within 76, 49 and 11 d, respectively. S. nux-vomica and S. potatorum seeds incubated on GA₃ germinated to a higher percentage than non-treated seeds. E:S of S. nux-vomica, S. potatorum and S. benthamii had increased by 38.2, 34.5 and 25.5%, respectively, at radicle emergence. Shoot emergence of S. nux-vomica, S. potatorum and S. benthamii was observed after 76, 74 and 45 d from radicle emergence, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that the seeds of all three species have epicotyl morphophysiological dormancy. Hundred seed tests revealed that S. nux-vomica and S. potatorum seeds were desiccation-tolerant, while those of S. benthamii were desiccation-sensitive. Our study showed that species from seasonal habitats (S. nux-vomica and S. potatorum) have desiccation-tolerant morphophysiologically dormant seeds, while those from an aseasonal habitat (S. benthamii) have desiccation-sensitive morphophysiologically dormant seeds, revealing that their dormancy and desiccation tolerance behaviour are adaptations to their environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrychnos nux-vomica 3aStrychnos potatorum 3adormancy 3adrought tolerance 3agermination 3agibberellic acid 3ahabitats 3aimbibition 3aresearch 3aseed storage 0aepicotyl dormancy 0aLoganiaceae 0aspatulate underdeveloped embryo 0aStrychnos1 aWijetunga, W.M.G.

Asch. and their acylated derivatives  ap. 486-494.  aThe antioxidant activity and antiproliferative property towards Caco2 cells of water and methanol extracts/fractions of Nitraria retusa were investigated. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts/fractions were determined, and the four major flavonoids were identified as isorhamnetin, isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-robinobioside. The results showed a relationship between the extracts/fractions activities and their flavonoid contents. Moreover, the chloroform extract which was enriched with the aglycone flavonoid isorhamnetin exhibited the highest activities. The activities of N. retusa flavonoids were compared to those of model flavonoids, quercetin, isoquercitrin and rutin. In all cases, the aglycone compounds were more active than their glycosylated derivatives. Isorhamnetin-based flavonoids presented higher antiproliferative activities than quercetin-based ones, while similar antioxidant properties were observed. The enzymatic acylation of isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside with ethyl laurate and ethyl butyrate enhanced its capacity to inhibit xanthine oxidase and its antiproliferative activity but decreased its radical scavenging activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitraria 3aacylation 3aantioxidant activity 3abutyrates 3achloroform 3afree radical scavengers 3aisorhamnetin 3amethanol 3aquercetin 3arutin 3axanthine oxidase1 aChevalot, Isabelle1 aHarscoat-Schiavo, Christelle1 aParis, Cédric1 aFick, Michel1 aHumeau, Catherine0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 124, no. 2 p.486-494dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.06.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010200168300001800270500001100288520121500299592002801514650001901542650001401561650002501575650000901600650001201609650002601621650001301647650001001660650001901670650003001689650001701719650001901736650002201755700002301777700002001800700002001820773013701840856008101977852000902058655001202067IND60614143720221120231042.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061414372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-018-1710-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimlou, Mehran10aAssociation between dietary glycemic index and glycemic load with depression: a systematic review  ap. 2333-2340.  aReview  aBACKGROUND: A combination of genetic and environmental factors is involved in depression etiology. During the last years, the prevalence of depression has increased in both developed and developing countries. Several studies indicated an association between dietary glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) with risk of depression. This systematic review was undertaken to summarize the effect of these diet indicators in depression pathogenesis. METHODS: A comprehensive search strategy was performed in the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases from 1966 to March 2017. Finally, six studies (three prospective cohort studies and three cross-sectional) were ultimately selected for inclusion in the systematic review. RESULTS: 75298 adults and elderly entered the reviewed studies. All of the included studies had high methodological quality. The present study indicated that the intake of foods with higher GI is associated with disease risk. However, the relationship was found to be inverse for GL, though the association was rather weak. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings indicated that a diet with lower dietary glycemic index may be effective to reduce the risk or risk of depression.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohort studies 3adatabases 3adeveloping countries 3adiet 3aelderly 3aenvironmental factors 3aetiology 3afoods 3aglycemic index 3anutrition risk assessment 3apathogenesis 3arisk reduction 3asystematic review1 aMorshedzadeh, Nava1 aKarimi, Soheila1 aJafarirad, Sima0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2018 Oct., v. 57, no. 7 p.2333-2340dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-018-1710-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016000168500001900328520110400347592002801451650002501479650001301504650001101517650001501528650001401543650001601557650001301573653003701586653003301623653001101656653001901667653001501686700001701701700001901718700001301737700001801750700001701768773010701785856008701892852000901979655001201988IND60697102820221121072726.0200628e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069710282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1235922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Liyao10aComparison of catalytic effect on upgrading bio-oil derived from co-pyrolysis of water hyacinth and scrap tire over multilamellar MFI nanosheets and HZSM-5  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCatalytic co-pyrolysis of water hyacinth and scrap tire experiments were performed to evaluate the feasibility of improving the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons production. The production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased from 5.31% (sole pyrolysis of water hyacinth) to 13.11% (co-pyrolysis with scrap tire). With use of zeolites, the highest production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can reach up to 69.18%. Comprehensive comparison on catalytic effects of HZSM-5 and multilamellar MFI nanosheets were provided. With the material to multilamellar MFI nanosheets ratios changes from 2:1 to 1:4, the production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increases significantly from 37.15–69.18%. The average production of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced by using multilamellar MFI nanosheets were 12.07% higher than that using HZSM-5, indicating the better performance of multilamellar MFI nanosheets in producing monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

We investigated the relationship between nut intake and changes in weight over 5 years. METHODS: This study includes 373,293 men and women, 25–70 years old, recruited between 1992 and 2000 from 10 European countries in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Habitual intake of nuts including peanuts, together defined as nut intake, was estimated from country-specific validated dietary questionnaires. Body weight was measured at recruitment and self-reported 5 years later. The association between nut intake and body weight change was estimated using multilevel mixed linear regression models with center/country as random effect and nut intake and relevant confounders as fixed effects. The relative risk (RR) of becoming overweight or obese after 5 years was investigated using multivariate Poisson regressions stratified according to baseline body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: On average, study participants gained 2.1 kg (SD 5.0 kg) over 5 years. Compared to non-consumers, subjects in the highest quartile of nut intake had less weight gain over 5 years (−0.07 kg; 95% CI −0.12 to −0.02) (P trend = 0.025) and had 5% lower risk of becoming overweight (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.92–0.98) or obese (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.90–0.99) (both P trend <0.008).

The strain W255ᵀ grows optimally at a 28 °C, pH 7.5, and 3.0% (w/v) NaCl environment. Its colonies are circular, orange, non-transparent, smooth, and approximately 0.2–0.8 mm in diameter, after being cultured for 72 h on marine agar 2216. Cells of the strain W255ᵀ are 0.3–0.8 µm wide and 1.0–4.0 µm long, catalase-positive and oxidase-positive. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C₁₅:₀, iso-C₁₅:₁ G, and iso-C₁₅:₀ 3-OH. The sole respiratory quinone is MK-6. The major polar lipids include phosphatidylethanolamine, one unidentified amino lipid, one amino glycolipid, and two unidentified lipids (L1 and L2). The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain W255ᵀ has the highest similarities with the type strain of the type species of the genus Seonamhaeicola, S. aphaedonensis KCTC 32578ᵀ (97.2%), and moderate with ‘S. acroporae’ KCTC 62713ᵀ (96.5%), S. algicola Gy8ᵀ (95.4%) and S. marinus B011ᵀ (94.5%). The ANI and dDDH values between strain W255ᵀ and S. aphaedonensis KCTC 32578ᵀ are 86.6% and 31.3%, respectively. The genomic DNA G + C content is 33.5 mol%. On the basis of gene annotation, it was observed that strain W255ᵀ have the abilities of nitrate reduction and utilizing various carbon sources, suggesting that this strain might be an important participant in the nitrogen cycle and carbon cycle in the marine environment. Based on the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, strain W255ᵀ has been considered as a novel species of the genus Seonamhaeicola, for which the name Seonamhaeicola sediminis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is W255ᵀ (= MCCC 1H00377ᵀ = KCTC 72085ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data  a2017FY100300cScience and Technology Basic Resources Investigation Program of China 3aagar 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3achemotaxonomy 3agenes 3aglycolipids 3amarine environment 3amarine sediments 3amicrobiology 3anitrate reduction 3anitrogen cycle 3apH 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aquinones 3aChina1 aZhang, Rui1 aZhong, Yan-Lin1 aXianyu, Dai-Wei1 aDu, Zong-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7886-56670 tArchives of microbiology.g2020 Aug., v. 202, no. 6 p.1295-1300dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-01841-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02521naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245014200199500002000341520138500361592002801746596001701774596001901791650002201810650002001832650001101852650001601863700002401879700002001903700005601923773013201979856007502111852000902186655001202195IND60789309720221116191912.0220819e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078930972DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.125322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiullo, Alessio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9032-316910aAccounting for the uncertain effects of hydraulic interactions in optimising embankments heights: Proof of principle for the IJssel River  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost alluvial plains in the world are protected by flood defences, for example, embankments, whose primary aim is to reduce the probability of flooding of the protected areas. At the same time, however, the presence of embankments at one area influences hydraulic conditions of downstream areas located on the same river. These hydraulic interactions are often neglected in current flood risk management. The aim of this study is to explicitly acknowledge hydraulic interactions and investigate their impact on establishing optimal embankment heights along a stretch of the IJssel River. We find that the current approach leads to a single solution, while taking into account hydraulic interactions substantially expands the number of promising solutions. Furthermore, under a reference scenario, the current approach is in fact suboptimal with respect to both downstream locations and the system as a whole. Under uncertainty, it performs adequately from a system viewpoint, but poorly for individual locations, mostly due to risk overestimation downstream. Overall, the current approach proves to be too short‐sighted, because spatial trade‐offs among locations are neglected and alternative solutions remain hidden. Acknowledging the effect of hydraulic interactions provides policy makers with a broader and more comprehensive spectrum of flood risk management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data  cHorizon 2020  cEuropean Union 3aissues and policy 3arisk management 3arivers 3auncertainty1 ade Bruijn, Karin M.1 aKwakkel, Jan H.1 aKlijn, Frans1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2590-55700 tJournal of flood risk management.g2019 Nov., v. 12, no.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the disease mean prevalence estimates are unknown in most endemic countries. We therefore performed a meta-analysis with the aim of estimating national mean prevalence of bovine trypanosomiasis in endemic countries across sub-Saharan Africa. Relevant articles reporting bovine trypanosomiasis prevalence were retrieved through systematic literature search and scanning of articles reference-lists. Eligibility criteria included that articles reported sample size, prevalence, and diagnostic technique adopted. Overall, data from 180 eligible articles from 19 countries satisfied the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of prevalence data based on the random-effects model resulted in an overall mean prevalence of 15.10% (95% CI: 13.22–17.08). National prevalence estimates were generally high except those of Benin and Senegal where estimates ranked below 10.00%. Significant heterogeneity (I2 = 98.75%. p = <0.0001) was noted between studies, and univariate meta-regression analysis identified choice of diagnostic method being major contributor to observed heterogeneity (R2 = 36.37%); while country of study (R2 = 9.57%) and sample size (R2 = 3.47%) had marginal effect on heterogeneity. In spite of past and ongoing control activities, bovine trypanosomiasis remains highly prevalent in most endemic sub-Saharan African countries. Nevertheless, dearth of epidemiological data in some countries and the use of less sensitive diagnostic tools limit reliable estimation of the disease prevalence. Therefore, there is the need to intensify efforts in aspects of surveillance and increased application of molecular diagnostic tool(s) across endemic locations as this would raise the chances of achieving a near-accurate estimate of the disease prevalence which is the first step to attempting eradication.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine trypanosomiasis 3acattle 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease prevalence 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aregression analysis 3aBenin 3aSenegal 0aCattle 0aTrypanosomiasis 0aPrevalence 0aAfrica1 aIsaac, C.1 aOhiolei, J.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1439-07030 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 160 p.35-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008100170520118200251592002801433650002301461650001501484650002601499653000901525653004201534653002601576700001801602700001901620700001401639700005601653700001701709700002001726773009201746856008601838852000901924655001201933IND60705483520221121015008.0201125e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070548352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Fengtong10aRobust quantitative SERS analysis with Relative Raman scattering intensities  aRobust quantitative analysis methods are very attractive but challenging with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique till now. Quantitative analysis methods using absolute Raman scattering intensities tend to desire very critical reproducibility of SERS substrates and consistency of testing conditions, as batch differences and inhomogeneity of SERS substrates as well as the fluctuation of measuring parameters placed challenging obstacles. Relative Raman scattering intensities, on the other hand, can release the adverse interferences mentioned above and provide effective and robust information as it is independent of the reproducibility of SERS substrates. By establishing external calibration working curves, we achieved accurate molecule composition prediction of molecules in multi-component systems. Further, by choosing or adding a label molecule with known concentration as Raman internal standards, the concentration of target molecules can be easily predicted. This approach proved the effectiveness and robustness of quantitative analysis with the relative Raman scattering intensities, even carried out with a flexible inhomogeneous SERS substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 0aSERS 0aRelative Raman scattering intensities 0aQuantitative analysis1 aWang, Weipeng1 aZhong, Haodong1 aYang, Fei1 aFu, Wangyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3185-04571 aLing, Yunhan1 aZhang, Zhengjun0 tTalanta.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 221 p.121465-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01824naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010600158300002000264520071600284592002801000650001101028650001401039650002401053650003401077650001501111650000901126650001201135700001601147700001701163700001701180700001901197700001901216773014401235856007401379852000901453655001201462IND60641865720221117083949.0190506e20161011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064186572DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta06612g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi-jun10aIn situ confocal microscopic observation on inhibiting the dendrite formation of a-CNₓ/Li electrode  ap. 15597-15604.  aTo prevent the formation of dendritic lithium on the electrodes, nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon (a-CNₓ) films of nanosized thicknesses were deposited onto the surface of a metallic lithium foil by a magnetron sputtering technique.

As a result, the nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon films can enhance the stability of the Li electrode and efficiently suppress the dendrite formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemistry 3aconfocal microscopy 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrodes 3afoil 3alithium1 aBai, Wen-qi1 aWang, Xiu-li1 aXia, Xin-hui1 aGu, Chang-dong1 aTu, Jiang-ping0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Oct. 11, v. 4, no. 40 p.15597-15604dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta06612g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03145naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245010700196520135100303592002801654596009101682596009101773596003801864596007101902596005701973596012102030596009002151650001002241650001202251650002702263650001202290650002302302650001402325650001002339700002002349700001902369700001802388700001302406700001802419700005402437700001602491773009502507856007602602852000902678655001202687IND60647204220221120142822.0190617e20190604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064720422DNAL7 a10.1155/2019/86721822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNan, Lijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2192-754810aImplications of Aging Quality of Oak Shaving on Kyoho Wine Immersed with Residue of Cabernet Sauvignon  aIn order to study effect of oak sawdust on the quality of Kyoho wine immersed by fermented Cabernet Sauvignon residual, Kyoho wine aged without oak sawdust (KWO), including KWO1 and KWO2 according to immersed orders by fermented Cabernet Sauvignon residual, was taken as control to compare the effect of oak sawdust on quality of Kyoho wine (KO), including KO1 and KO2 according to aged orders by oak sawdust. During the 15 days of aging, physical and chemical indicators, such as chroma, tonality, and total phenol in wine were determined simultaneously by using a spectrophotometer, including tannin content by KMnO₄ titration, once every 3 days. The results showed that the chromaticities of Kyoho wine were 3.21, 3.02, 4.46, and 3.71 for KO1, KO2, KWO1, and KWO2, respectively. Similarly, the hues were in turn 0.73, 0.68, 0.97, and 0.72, respectively. Tannin contents were 1601.5 mg/L, 1517.3 mg/L, 337.2 mg/L, and 115.6 mg/L; total phenol contents were 277.67 mg/L, 222.1 mg/L, 64 mg/L, and 79.8 mg/L. Therefore, the contents of tannin and total phenol from KO1 wine were all the highest values. The chroma and tone of the four types of wine showed an upward trend of “S.” The chromaticity and tone were the lowest for the KO2 wine and the highest for the KWO1 wine with the larger difference between KO2 and KWO1.  aPublisher supplied data  cEngineering Technology Research Center of Grape and Wine for Advanced School in Yunnan  c12th Five-Year Degree Authorized Construction Discipline in Biology of Yunnan Province  aXJGG1603cChuxiong Normal College  a2016FD088cYouth Project of Yunnan Applied Basic Research Projects  aZD2015016cYunnan Provincial Department of Education  cResearch and Development of Characteristic Plant Resources in Colleges and Universities in Yunnan Province (IRTSTYN)  cResearch on Key Techniques of Production of Characteristic Ice Wine in Yunnan Plateau 3acolor 3aphenols 3apotassium permanganate 3asawdust 3aspectrophotometers 3atitration 3awines1 aZhang, Xiaofang1 aZhong, Yingxue1 aCui, Changwei1 aNing, Na1 aXu, Chengdong1 aLi, Yashan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2416-673X1 aHuang, Jing0 tJournal of food quality.g2019 June 4, v. 2019dHindawiwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/86721823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245014700196500002000343520124500363592002801608650002201636650000901658650002001667650001101687650001201698651001601710651001601726700002301742700002001765773013201785856007501917852000901992655001202001IND60789309820221116191901.0220819e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078930982DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.125112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlijn, Frans1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2590-557010aRobust river systems: On assessing the sensitivity of embanked rivers to discharge uncertainties, exemplified for the Netherlands' main rivers  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThere is increasing attention for the robustness of systems, in view of more frequent and more extreme weather events. Calls to increase a system's robustness are usually motivated by the resulting reduced sensitivity to extreme events and uncertainties about their probability of occurrence. The concept has been elaborated for flood risk systems, but recently questions have arisen about whether subsystems, such as flood defences or rivers, should and could also be assessed on their robustness. Against the background of a recent debate in the Netherlands about whether to raise the embankments again or to make more room for the rivers in anticipation of increasing extreme river discharges into the future, we propose to define the robustness of embanked alluvial rivers by their sensitivity to uncertainties in flood discharge, expressed by the relationship between discharge and flood water level. We assess the Rhine River branches and Meuse River in the Netherlands and show how their planform, as defined by the location of the embankments and the presence of obstacles in the floodplains, causes remarkable differences in robustness per river and per river stretch. We finally discuss what this might entail for policy planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aissues and policy 3arisk 3arisk management 3arivers 3aweather 3aNetherlands 3aRhine River1 aAsselman, Nathalie1 aMosselman, Erik0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2019 Nov., v. 12, no.

We discuss the findings of recent epidemiological and immunological studies conducted in Ethiopia on host susceptibility differences between native zebu and the exotic Holstein–Friesian cattle that are increasingly part of the Ethiopian National herd, due to the drive to increase milk yields. These findings support the hypothesis that native Zebu cattle are more resistant to bovine tuberculosis. We also summarise the results of experimental infections that support the epidemiological data, and of laboratory experiments that suggest a role for the innate immune response, and in particular interleukin-6, in the outcome of bovine tuberculosis infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHolstein 3abovine tuberculosis 3acattle 3aherds 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-6 3amilk yield 3azebu 3azoonoses 3aEthiopia1 aAmeni, Gobena1 aBerg, Stefan1 aBishop, Richard1 aRobertson, Brian D.1 aAseffa, Abraham1 aHewinson, R.

We evaluated three groundcover systems: (1) bare soil (BS), pre- and post-emergence herbicides; (2) vegetation strip (VS), post-emergence herbicide applied in a 1-m wide strip centred on the tree row plus a groundcover mixture seeded between tree rows; and (3) complete groundcover (GC), covering the entire surface of the plots. Root production was higher in the non-bearing year (2009–10) than in the bearing year (2010–11). Trees in the BS plots had more roots of bigger diameter in the top 30cm of soil and trees in VS and GC plots had more roots in the 30–60cm depth and of smaller diameter. Lifespan of spring-born roots were 61 and 59% greater than those born during autumn and summer, respectively and soil depth and root diameter were positively correlated with root longevity. Lifespan of thinner roots (<0.2mm) in the BS and VS plots were 49 and 33% greater than GC respectively. Avocado trees grown in contrasting condition compared with their native habitat show high morphological root plasticity, in response to resource and non-resource competition when grown in mixed stands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPersea americana 3aautumn 3aavocados 3acorrelation 3ademography 3ahabitats 3aherbicides 3alongevity 3amanagement systems 3amixed stands 3aorchards 3aroot systems 3aroots 3aseed mixtures 3asoil depth 3asummer 3atopsoil 3avegetation 0aavocado 0aminirhizotron 0aplasticity 0aroot production1 aMerwin, Ian A.1 aBrown, Michael G.1 aGardiazabal, Francisco1 aMena, Francisco1 aAdriazola, Cecilia1 aGoebel, Marc1 aBauerle, Taryn0 tFunctional plant biology.g2013, v. 40, no. 5 p.507-515dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP12317  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245012700171300001800298520102500316592002801341650001201369650001501381650002601396650002201422650004401444650002301488650002101511650002201532650001601554653001601570653002301586653000801609653002801617653002201645700002401667700002201691700001701713700001601730700002501746773010401771856008201875852000901957655001201966IND60615963620221119165044.0181025e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061596362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllentoff, Alban J.10aSynthesis of an adenine N-3 substituted CBI adduct by alkylation of adenine with a 1-iodomethylindoline seco-CBI precursor  ap. 6680-6688.  aThe synthesis of a 1,2,9,9a-tetrahydrocyclopropa[c]benz[e]indol-4-one (CBI)-adenine adduct via regioselective N-3 alkylation of adenine with a 1-(iodomethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e]indol-5-ol (I-seco-CBI)-containing precursor is described. Spectroscopic analyses of the unlabeled and adenine-C8 carbon-13 labeled adducts utilizing ROESY NMR techniques allowed structural assignment of the alkylation product as the adenine N-3 substituted regioisomer. A stable-isotopically labeled version of the N-3 adduct incorporating six carbon-13 labels was also prepared by this method for use as an LC-MS internal standard. The cyclized CBI-containing compound was also found to alkylate adenine at elevated temperatures to produce the N-3 adduct albeit at a significantly slower rate than that observed for the I-seco-CBI precursor. Adenine alkylation with an I-seco-CBI precursor offers scalable and facile access to a CBI-adenine adduct facilitating its use as an efficacy marker for the development of duocarmycin-based ADCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenine 3aalkylation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apositional isomers 3aregioselectivity 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 0aDuocarmycin 0aAdenine alkylation 0aCBI 0aAntibody-drug conjugate 0aIsotopic labeling1 aWallace, Michael A.1 aTraeger, Sarah C.1 aZheng, Naiyu1 aZhang, Qian1 aBonacorsi, Samuel J.0 tTetrahedron.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 74, no. 46 p.6680-6688dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245013000202300001800332520108500350592002801435650000901463650001301472650001301485650001501498650001601513650001001529650002001539650002001559650001501579650001701594650000701611650001101618650001701629650001201646650001901658653002101677653002401698653002101722700002101743700001901764773009601783856008101879852000901960655001201969IND60724949120221120060508.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJafari, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8761-632310aSurvey dataset on the performance of combined process of coagulation and ceramic membrane for the removal of reactive black19  ap. 2015-2022.  aThe aim of data article was to evaluate effectiveness of the combined process of coagulation, flocculation and filtration to remove reactive black 19 from solution aqueous. In this data article, alum and ferric chloride were selected as a coagulant for instability of color before ceramic membrane. All experiments were performed in batch conditions. The results showed that more than half of the ceramic membrane is made of silica. The BET surface area of the ceramic membrane was 1.877 m² g⁻¹. The size of RB19, alum, and ferric chloride was 996.2 mm, 1216 mm, and 86.26 mm, respectively. Also, the zeta potential of RB19, alum, and ferric chloride was 20.7 mV, 1.59 mV, and 34.7 mV, respectively. The findings showed that the best pH to remove the RB 19 by alum and ferric chloride was less than 7. With increasing concentrations of alum and chlorine ferric the removal of RB 19 increased. For RB19 concentration of 10 mg l⁻¹, with increasing time from 5 to 15 min, the removal efficiency for alum and ferric were 61–63% and 82–87%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalum 3aceramics 3achlorine 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3acolor 3adata collection 3aferric chloride 3afiltration 3aflocculation 3apH 3asilica 3asurface area 3asurveys 3azeta potential 0aCeramic membrane 0aChemical coagulants 0aReactive black191 aKamarehi, Bahram1 aGhasemi, Akram0 tData in Brief.g2018 Aug., v. 19 p.2015-2022dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012100173300001400294520179700308592002802105650001102133650002202144650002402166650001102190650001002201650001002211650001102221650002502232650001502257650001402272650002602286650001002312650001002322650001302332650001802345651001202363653002702375653002002402653001202422653002002434653001502454700002302469700001302492700001902505700001902524700001502543700001902558700006402577773011602641856008802757852000902845655001202854IND60615692820221120034945.0190318e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061569282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHanks, Jenny E.10aUsing longitudinal syndromic surveillance to describe small ruminant health in village production systems in Myanmar  ap. 47-53.  aA novel syndromic surveillance approach was used to describe small ruminant health in Myanmar, to help overcome limitations in disease diagnosis common in many parts of the world, especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Observations were made from July 2015 to June 2016 of ten clinical syndromes in 12 goat herds and sheep flocks owned by smallholders in the Central Dry Zone. Strengths and weaknesses to using syndromic surveillance in a village setting were identified using a formal surveillance evaluation framework, ‘SERVAL’. Larger reporting teams made disproportionately more reports than smaller ones (86% compared to 14% of all reports, with a reporting rate ratio of 4.3 95% CI 3.5–5.4), which may have affected surveillance sensitivity. The benefits of the syndromic surveillance included its relatively low cost and ability to produce quantitative disease estimates that could be used to prioritise further disease investigation and extension activities. In particular, significant mortality was observed, with monthly mortality of 3.0% (95% CI 2.5–3.7%) and 0.28% (0.15–0.53%) in young and adult animals, respectively, and a population attributable fraction of mortality for young animals of 82% (68–91%). Mortality was associated with ill-thrift in young animals but had not previously been considered an important production-limiting condition in Myanmar. This information contributes to an understanding of the prevalence of excessive mortality in smallholder goat and sheep production systems. It is a practical example of the use of syndromic surveillance in a LMIC livestock production system, the results of which can direct future disease research, treatment and prevention to improve the health and productivity of small ruminants in Myanmar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3adisease diagnosis 3aextension education 3aflocks 3agoats 3aherds 3aincome 3alivestock production 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aproduction technology 3asheep 3ateams 3avillages 3ayoung animals 3aMyanmar 0aSyndromic surveillance 0aSmall ruminants 0aMyanmar 0aEndemic disease 0aProduction1 aGlanville, Elsa J.1 aPhyu, Ei1 aHlaing, Nandar1 aNaing Oo, Lwin1 aAung Aung,1 aNaing Oo, Kyaw1 aCampbell, Angus J.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3907-50480 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 160 p.47-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009600157300001600253500002000269520159500289592002801884596006901912596005801981650001502039650001202054650001902066650001602085650002302101650001502124650001502139650001702154650001402171650001602185700005002201700001602251773013902267856007502406852000902481655001202490IND60788418120221121115750.0220813e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078841812DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.200472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Binbin10aMitigating evaporation and desiccation cracks in soil with the sustainable material biochar  ap. 461-471.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aExamining soil cracking due to evaporation and desiccation is very important as these two factors affect the permeability of soil in agricultural systems and engineering construction projects. In order to investigate the effects of a sustainable material on the evaporation and cracking of soil, biochar produced through pyrolysis with wheat straw was experimentally examined as an air‐dried additive. Soil was mixed with different amounts of biochar to produce the samples (0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20% by weight) which were then tested. The cracking properties were subsequently examined based on variations in water loss. The development of the cracks was quantitatively analyzed by using a digital image processing technique, which provided the optimum biochar content that would mitigate evaporation and the development of desiccation cracks. The results were then plotted, and the rate of evaporation of the water in the soil samples with different biochar contents showed an approximately “step” shaped curve, in which three stages could be observed: rapid, slow and constant rates of evaporation. The rate of evaporation quickly declined with a biochar content of 5%. The fractal dimension of the cracks was also reduced with increases in the biochar content, which meant that biochar could inhibit the degree of soil cracking. The optimum biochar content was therefore 5% by weight in this study, which may effectively prevent soil cracking and reduce evaporation, thus reducing landscape irrigation costs in urban infrastructures or irrigation costs in rural agricultural farming.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant No. 2020ZD013cXuchang University Scientific Research Fund  a192102310480cHenan scientific and technical projects 3aair drying 3abiochar 3adigital images 3aevaporation 3afractal dimensions 3airrigation 3alandscapes 3apermeability 3apyrolysis 3awheat straw1 aXu, Ke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4280-52911 aZhang, Zhuo0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2020 Mar., v. 84, no. 2 p.461-471dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.200473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245010500169300001400274520176700288592002802055650001302083650001602096650001702112650001202129650001402141650002102155650001102176650001802187650001302205653001202218653003202230653001402262653001802276653003402294700001602328700001802344700001402362700001602376700001902392773008902411856008902500852000902589655001202598IND60606366820221120110746.0180725e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060636682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.11.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mei10aFormation and emission of brominated dioxins and furans during secondary aluminum smelting processes  ap. 60-67.  aSecondary aluminum smelting (SAl) processes have previously been found to be important sources of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs). It is crucial that the key factors that influence the formation and emission of PBDD/Fs are identified to allow techniques for decreasing PBDD/F emissions during SAl processes to be developed. In this study, stack gas samples were collected from four typical secondary aluminum smelters that used different raw materials, and the samples were analyzed to allow differences between PBDD/F emissions from different SAl plants to be assessed. The composition of the raw materials was found to be one of the key factors influencing the amounts of PBDD/Fs emitted. The PBDD/F emission factors (per tonne of aluminum produced) for the plants using 100% (Plant1), 80% (Plant2), and 50% (Plant3) dirty aluminum scrap in the raw material feed were 180, 86, and 14 μg t⁻¹, respectively. The amounts of PBDD/Fs emitted at different stages of the smelting process (feeding–fusion, refining, and casting) were compared, and the feeding–fusion stage was found to be the main stage in which PBDD/Fs were formed and emitted. Effective aluminum scrap pretreatments could significantly decrease PBDD/F emissions. Much higher polybrominated dibenzofuran concentrations than polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxin concentrations were found throughout the SAl process. The more-brominated congeners (including octabromodibenzo-p-dioxin, octabromodibenzofuran, heptabromodibenzo-p-dioxins, and heptabromodibenzofurans) were the dominant contributors to the total PBDD/F concentrations. The results could help in the development of techniques and strategies for controlling PBDD/F emissions during metallurgical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abromination 3adibenzofuran 3adioxins 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3afurans 3araw materials 3arefining 0aPBDD/Fs 0aSecondary aluminum smelters 0aStack gas 0aRaw materials 0aPersistent organic pollutants1 aLiu, Guorui1 aJiang, Xiaoxu1 aLi, Sumei1 aLiu, Wenbin1 aZheng, Minghui0 tChemosphere.g2016 Mar., v. 146 p.60-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.11.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011600171500001900287520095900306592002801265650001401293650001201307650001201319650001801331650001501349650001101364650001701375650002201392650001601414650001501430653004301445653001301488700001801501700001301519700001601532773010701548856008701655852000901742655001201751IND60697103220221121054314.0200628e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069710322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1236012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hongdan10aEffects of NaOH-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment and surfactant on the sugar production from sugarcane bagasse  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, NaOH-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment with different loading of NaOH (0–10%) was proposed to disrupt the recalcitrant structure by degrading lignin, reserve the majority of cellulose and hemicellulose, and improve the enzymatic efficiency of sugarcane bagasse. It was found that the higher loading of NaOH during organosolv pretreatment yielded more glucose, and the synergistic performance of NaOH and ethanol on enzymolysis was superior to that pretreated with only NaOH and only ethanol during two-step pretreatment. Furthermore, Tween 80 was added to determine its influence on enzymolysis after NaOH-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment, leading to the highest glucose yield of 95.1% at 24 h, which saved 2/3 hydrolysis time while generating the similar glucose yield comparing with that without Tween 80. However, the increased yields of glucose by adding Tween 80 were decreased as hydrolysis time was prolonged from 6 h to 24 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aethanol 3aglucose 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrolysis 3alignin 3apolysorbates 3asugarcane bagasse 3asurfactants 3atechnology 0aNaOH-catalyzed organosolv pretreatment 0aTween 801 aZhang, Jiajie1 aXie, Jun1 aQin, Yanlin0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Sept., v. 312 p.123601-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1236013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245020200164300001600366520063700382592002801019650004401047650002201091650001101113650002201124650002101146650004601167650002101213650002401234650001401258650001701272653001701289653002401306653001401330700002101344700002301365700001601388700002001404773015001424856007701574852000901651655001201660IND60522229920221119112149.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052222992DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-06032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlaser, Thorsten10aSynthesis, Characterization, Crystal Structure and Magnetic Properties of [(en)CuII(ImH)2](ClO4)2 (en = Ethylenediamine, ImH = Imidazole): A Metalloligand as a Building Block for Heterometal Chains  ap. 505-510.  aThe reaction of Cu(ClO₄)₂·6H₂O, imidazole (ImH), and ethylenediamine (en) in a 1 : 2 : 1 ratio afforded in high yield dark-blue single-crystals of [(en)Cuᴵᴵ(ImH)₂](ClO₄)₂, 1, which can be used after deprotonation as a building block for heterometallic ferrimagnetic chains.

The short time available for minimising risks requires preparedness and active response. In this context of risk management, the flood risk perception of the local population is the first step towards achieving resilience of people and communities. Although flood risk perception has intrinsic spatial variability, few previous studies take this into account. This paper explores the spatial variability of flash flood risk perception in the village of Navaluenga in Central Spain, using nonparametric and multivariate geostatistical tools. How local people perceived the flash flood risk to their homes was assessed interviewing a representative sample. Results show that considering these flash flood risk related spatial variables enhances people's psychological interpretation of risk perception: the perception of flash flood risk in a short time event is congruent with those spatial variables. These findings determine priority areas for future risk communication plans. They could also be extrapolated to other urban areas with a similar hydrographic configuration, when there is a flood hazard from a main river and potentially flooded minor water courses, which are even closer to houses but are not considered dangerous by the local population.  aPublisher supplied data  aPEJ15/AMB/AI‐0218cConsejería de Educación, Juventud y Deporte, Comunidad de Madrid  aCGL2017‐83546‐C3‐RcMinisterio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades  aCGL2013‐42728‐RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad 3afloods 3ageostatistics 3apeople 3arisk perception 3arivers 3avillages 3aSpain1 aDíez‐Herrero, Andrés1 aAmerigo Cuervo‐Arango, María1 aBodoque, Jose María1 aGarcía, Juan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3693-61801 aNaranjo‐Fernández, Nuria1 aAroca‐Jiménez, Estefanía0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2020 Mar., v. 13, no. 1 p.e12590-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:21409x1753-318X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.125903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012900173300001800302520147200320592002801792650001601820650001401836650002301850650002301873650002301896650001101919650001001930650002301940650001401963650001701977650002201994650002402016653002502040653001102065653002302076653001802099653001602117700001902133700003302152700002502185700002102210700001602231700002102247773010402268856008202372852000902454655001202463IND60615963920221119164933.0181120e20181206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061596392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenapara, Tusharkumar10aIsatin N-protected ketimines with nitromethane catalyzed by chiral binol linked monomeric macrocyclic Cu(II)–salen complex  ap. 7000-7008.  aChiral Cu-1B generated in situ was used as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of β-nitroamines in high yield (88%) with excellent enantioselectivity (ee up to 99%) at RT in absence of co-catalyst via asymmetric aza-Henry reaction of various isatin derived N-Boc ketimines with nitromethane. This catalytic system did not work well with other nitroalkanes under the above optimized reaction conditions. To examine this catalytic behaviour, quantum chemical DFT calculations were performed with the nucleophiles (CH2NO2⁻ and CH3CHNO2⁻) for the conversion of 1a to 2a using macrocyclic Cu-1B complex. The DFT calculated results have shown that the reaction with CH2NO2⁻ is more favourable than the corresponding CH3CHNO2⁻. The calculated activation barriers suggest that the reaction with CH2NO2⁻ is ∼8.0 kcal/mol energetically favoured than CH3CHNO2⁻. This catalytic protocol was further used to obtain chiral β-diamines (a building block for pharmaceuticals) at gram scale. In order to elucidate the reaction mechanism of asymmetric aza Henry reaction kinetic experiments were performed with different concentrations of the catalyst Cu-1B, nitromethane and 1g as the representative substrate. The reaction of isatin N-Boc ketimine was first order with respect to the concentration of the catalyst and the nitromethane but did not depend on the initial concentration of the substrate. A possible mechanism for the aza Henry reaction was proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3acopper 3adrugs 3aenantioselectivity 3aketimines 3anitroalkanes 3aquantum mechanics 3areaction mechanisms 0aAsymmetric aza-Henry 0aCu(II) 0aMacrocyclic ligand 0aRecyclability 0a(S)-Diamine1 aTak, Raj kumar1 aCaravaṇan̲, Nallūr Cā.,1 aKureshy, Rukhsana I.1 aKhan, Noor-ul H.1 aGanguly, B.1 aSi, Mrinal Kanti0 tTetrahedron.g2018 Dec. 06, v. 74, no. 49 p.7000-7008dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2018.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002200158245016000180300001800340520139300358592002801751650001801779650001801797650001701815650000901832650001201841650002201853650001201875650002301887650000901910650002301919650001201942650000901954650002601963650001201989650001602001650002902017650001202046650002802058650002102086650003602107650001702143650006302160650002702223650003402250650001902284650002302303650001802326650000902344650004502353650002202398650001502420650001902435650000902454650002502463650001702488650001602505700002202521700002002543700001902563700002202582773013102604856004002735852000902775655001202784IND50069034520221120091850.0130906e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006903452DNAL7 a237124152pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.62402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPranprawit, Araya10aShort‐term and long‐term effects of excessive consumption of saturated fats and/or sucrose on metabolic variables in Sprague Dawley rats: a pilot study  ap. 3191-3197.  aBACKGROUND: Feeding high‐fat and/or high‐sugar diets to rats leads to a change in markers of metabolic syndrome. However, types and amounts of fat and sugar as well as the length of the experiment for establishing diet‐induced metabolic syndrome in the Sprague Dawley (SD) rat model remain uncertain. This study was designed to investigate the effects in SD rats of consuming excess lard, sucrose or a combination of lard and sucrose for a short (4 week) or long (8 week) period of time. RESULTS: Consumption of the high‐fat high‐sugar (HFHS) diet significantly increased weight gain and abdominal fat weights (P < 0.05), and the rats also began to develop signs of impaired glucose tolerance and had increased fasting blood lipids glucose and insulin concentrations. The high‐fat (HF) diet mainly affected weight gain and fat deposition, whereas the high‐sugar (HS) diet induced glucose intolerance but not the obesity‐related parameters. Control rats showed a tendency towards insulin resistance and glucose intolerance when fed for a long‐term period. CONCLUSION: The lard plus sucrose‐based HFHS diet is the most efficient one for inducing signs of metabolic syndrome, and SD rats fed this diet for 8 weeks successfully develop obesity and insulin resistance, which can be used as a model for metabolic syndrome research. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aanimal models 3ablood lipids 3adiet 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alard 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3arats 3asaturated fatty acids 3asucrose 3aweight gain 2aAbdominal Fatxpathology 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Composition 2aDiet, High-Fatxadverse effects 2aDietary Fats 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aGlucose Intolerancexetiology 2aInsulinxblood 2aInsulin Resistance 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexetiologyxpathology. 2aObesityxetiology 2aOrgan Size 2aPilot Projects 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gain1 aWolber, Frances M1 aHeyes, Julian A1 aMolan, Abdul L1 aKruger, Marlena C0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2013 Oct., v. 93, no. 13 p.3191-3197dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.6240  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245019600157300001800353520157500371592002801946650000801974650002801982650001602010650002202026650003602048650001702084650002102101650001502122650001902137650001302156650003702169650003702206700001502243700002002258700001702278773010802295856007502403852000902478655001202487IND60532700320221118233518.0160728e20121008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053270032DNAL7 a10.1021/bm301131k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wanggui10aReinforced Self-Assembly of Donor–Acceptor π-Conjugated Molecules to DNA Templates by Dipole–Dipole Interactions Together with Complementary Hydrogen Bonding Interactions for Biomimetics  ap. 3370-3376.  aOne of the most important criteria for the successful DNA-templated polymerization to generate fully synthetic biomimetic polymers is to design the complementary structural monomers, which assemble to the templates strongly and precisely before carrying polymerization. In this study, water-soluble, laterally thymine-substituted donor–acceptor π-conjugated molecules were designed and synthesized to self-assemble with complementary oligoadenines templates, dA₂₀ and dA₄₀, into stable and tubular assemblies through noncovalent interactions including π–π stacking, dipole–dipole interactions, and the complementary adenine-thymine (A-T) hydrogen-bonding. UV–vis, fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were used to investigate the formation of highly robust nanofibrous structures. Our results have demonstrated for the first time that the dipole–dipole interactions are stronger and useful to reinforce the assembly of donor–acceptor π-conjugated molecules to DNA templates and the formation of the stable and robust supramolecular nanofibrous complexes together with the complementary hydrogen bonding interactions. This provides an initial step toward DNA-templated polymerization to create fully synthetic DNA-mimetic polymers for biotechnological applications. This study also presents an opportunity to precisely position donor–acceptor type molecules in a controlled manner and tailor-make advanced materials for various biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiomimetics 3achemical elements 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananofibers 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aChen, Yali1 aWong, Man Shing1 aLo, Pik Kwan0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Oct. 08, v. 13, no. 10 p.3370-3376dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm301131k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100004000188245014200228300001200370506007600382520082300458592002801281596002901309596002901338596008301367596007101450506003701521650001801558650002501576650002701601650001501628650001101643650002501654650004301679650002201722650001601744651001101760700003701771700003501808700003601843700002301879700002801902700003601930700002001966700003601986700002702022700002602049700003202075700003402107700002502141700003002166700002402196700002402220773011302244856008202357852000902439655001202448IND60643165620221207110443.0211015e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064316562DNAL7 a310682182pmid7 aPMC65052162pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-019-3461-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAyres, Constância Flavia Junqueira10aZika virus detection, isolation and genome sequencing through Culicidae sampling during the epidemic in Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil  ap. 220.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) has been isolated from many mosquito species in nature, but it is believed that the main vectors in urban environments are species of the genus Aedes. Here, we detected and isolated ZIKV in samples from Aedes aegypti, Aedes taeniorhynchus and Culex quinquefasciatus, collected during the Zika epidemic in Vitória, southeast Brazil. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, ZIKV detection was performed in mosquito samples collected from February to April 2016. RESULTS: Overall, six pools of mosquitoes were positive for ZIKV: four of Cx. quinquefasciatus, one of Ae. aegypti and one of Ae. taeniorhynchus. Their genomes were sequenced. CONCLUSIONS: These results support and strengthen the hypothesis that other mosquito species can also be involved in ZIKV transmission.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPQ-0078-2.02/16cFACEPE  aAPQ-0085-2.13/16cFACEPE  a441100/2016-3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aR21AI128931cNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes taeniorhynchus 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aZika virus 3agenome 3anucleotide sequences 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3aurban areas 3aBrazil1 aGuedes, Duschinka Ribeiro Duarte1 aPaiva, Marcelo Henrique Santos1 aMorais-Sobral, Mariana Carolina1 aKrokovsky, Larissa1 aMachado, Laís Ceschini1 aMelo-Santos, Maria Alice Varjal1 aCrespo, Mônica1 aOliveira, Cláudia Maria Fontes1 aRibeiro, Ricardo Silva1 aCardoso, Orlei Amaral1 aMenezes, Ana Lúcia Barbosa1 aLaperrière-Jr, Roberto Costa1 aLuna, Carlos Feitosa1 aOliveira, André Luiz Sá1 aLeal, Walter Soares1 aWallau, Gabriel Luz0 tParasites & vectors.g2019 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.220-220dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-019-3461-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01399naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008900165300001600254520031000270592002800580650001900608650002300627650002200650650001400672650002000686653002500706653001400731653001300745700002600758700002000784700002200804773013700826856007700963852000901040655001201049IND60522230020221123005950.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052223002DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-06042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMargrafa, Günter10aSynthese und Struktur des Ammoniumsesquicarbonat Monohydrates (NH4)4[H2(CO3)3] ·H2O  ap. 511-513.  aThe ammonium sesquicarbonate monohydrate (NH₄)₄[H₂(CO₃)₃] · H₂O is obtained from the reaction of hexamethyldisilazane with carbon dioxide in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of water.

Polymer-drug conjugates can alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the loaded drug after inhaled administration and enable the controlled and sustained exposure of the lungs to drugs when compared to the inhaled or oral administration of the drug alone. However, the major concern with the use of inhalable polymer-drug conjugates is their biocompatibility and long-term safety in the lungs, which is closely linked to lung retention times. A detailed understanding about the pharmacokinetics, lung disposition, clearance and safety of inhaled polymer-drug conjugates with significant translational potential is therefore required. This review therefore provides a comprehensive summary of the latest developments for several types of polymer-drug conjugates that are currently being explored as inhalable drug delivery systems. Finally, the current status and future perspective of the polymer-drug conjugates is also discussed with a focus on current knowledge gaps.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3alungs 3ananomedicine 3aoral administration 3apharmaceutical industry 3apharmacokinetics 3arespiratory tract diseases 3atranslation (genetics) 0aPolymer-drug conjugates 0alung & pulmonary delivery 0aInhalation 0aDrug delivery 0apharmacokinetics1 aHaque, Shadabul1 aKaminskas, Lisa M.0 tCurrent opinion in colloid & interface science.g2017 Sept., v. 31 p.18-29dElsevier LtdwJournal:12032x1359-02947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2017.06.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007900158500002000237520137800257592002801635596001801663596002301681596002301704650001201727650001401739650001101753650000901764650002001773650001801793650001501811651001201826700005901838700002101897700001801918700002901936773013301965856007502098852000902173655001202182IND60789306820221116192829.0220819e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078930682DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.125262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArcher, David10aHistorical flash floods in England: New regional chronologies and database  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThere is increasing interest in past occurrences of flooding from intense rainfall, commonly referred to as “flash flooding,” and the associated socioeconomic consequences. Historical information can help us to place recent events in context and to understand the effect of low frequency climate variability on changing flash flood frequencies. Previous studies have focussed on fluvial flooding to reconstruct the temporal and spatial patterns of past events. Here, we provide an online flood chronology for the north and south‐west of England for flash floods, including both surface water and fluvial flooding, with coverage from ~1700 to ~2013 (http://ceg-fepsys.ncl.ac.uk/fc). The primary source of documentary material is local newspaper reports, which often give detailed descriptions of impacts. This provides a new resource to inform communities and first responders of flood risks, especially those from rapid rise in water level whose severity may be greater than those of accompanying peak flow. Examples are provided of historical flash floods that exemplify how the chronologies can help to place recent floods in the context of the preinstrumental record for: (a) more robust estimates of event return period, (b) identification of catchment or settlement susceptibility to flash flood events, and (c) characterisation of events in ungauged catchments.  aPublisher supplied data  cRoyal Society  cWolfson Foundation  aNE/K00896X/1cNERC 3aclimate 3adatabases 3afloods 3arain 3arisk management 3asurface water 3awatersheds 3aEngland1 aO'Donnell, Greg1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6553-12571 aLamb, R.q(Rob),1 aWarren, Sarah1 aFowler, H.q(Hayley J.),0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2019 Oct., v. 12 Suppl S1 p.e12526-dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:21409x1753-318X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.125263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012000165300001600285520233600301592002802637650002002665650001902685650000902704650001802713650001202731650001302743650001502756650002402771650001902795650001002814700001502824700001602839700003602855700001302891700001502904700001202919773012902931856008103060852000903141655001203150IND60643162220221119131903.0190509e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064316222DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-019-1166-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsuka, Yosuke10aExercise and/or Dietary Varieties and Incidence of Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Women: A 2-Year Cohort Study  ap. 425-430.  aOBJECTIVE: Exercise and dietary habits rich in variety may reduce the risk of frailty incident, but such association remains unexamined. This study aimed to examine the longitudinal associations between exercise and/or dietary varieties and incidence of frailty in older women. DESIGN: A 2-year population-based prospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred and four community-dwelling older Japanese women aged ≥75 years with non-frailty at baseline survey. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was assessed using Fried’s frailty criteria composed of shrinking, weakness, slowness, low activity, and exhaustion at both baseline and follow-up surveys. Frailty incident was defined as the presence of =3 components at the follow-up survey. At baseline, information about exercise and dietary habits were obtained from all participants through a face-to-face interview. Participants were grouped into two categories, high (=2) and low (<2) exercise varieties, assessed by the number of participations in 17 exercise types. By dietary variety, assessed using Dietary Variety Score (range, 0 to 10), participants were grouped into two, high (=4 points) and low (<4 points) dietary varieties. Binary logistic regression analyses were applied to obtain adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs) of the incidence of frailty in the 4 groups (low-exercise and low-dietary varieties [low EV + low DV] as reference; low-exercise and high-dietary varieties [low EV + high DV]; high-exercise and low-dietary varieties [high EV + low DV]; and high-exercise and high-dietary varieties [high EV + high DV]). RESULTS: Frailty incidence rate was 9.3% over the 2-year follow-up period. Incidence rates of frailty in the 4 groups were as follows: 23.7%, 10.1%, 6.5%, and 7.7% in the low EV + low DV, low EV + high DV, high EV + low DV, and high EV + high DV groups, respectively. After adjustment for covariates, only the high EV + high DV group was associated with a significantly lower OR (0.38; 95% CI 0.15–0.92) of frailty incidence compared with the low EV + low DV group. CONCLUSION: Higher variety of exercise and diet was significantly associated with lower incidence of frailty. Thus, the combination of variety-rich exercise and dietary program may be useful in preventing the incidence of frailty in older women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapanese people 3acohort studies 3adiet 3aeating habits 3aelderly 3aexercise 3aodds ratio 3aregression analysis 3arisk reduction 3awomen1 aKojima, N.1 aYoshida, Y.1 aKim, M.

In this study, we focused on the immediate (1 d), short- (13 d) and long-term effects (61 d) of pharmaceutical amendment on microbial communities in seven soils differing in physical chemical properties. Basal respiration was used to indicate microbial activity, while phospholipid fatty acids were used to determine microbial biomass and community structure. We identified four microbial responses to pharmaceutical amendment: stimulation, inhibition, stress and dormancy, which were highly significant in the short-term. The largest stimulatory effect accompanied by shifts in the microbial community structure towards fungi and G- bacteria was detected for sulfamethoxazole. The inhibitory effect was mainly observed for citalopram, irbesartan and pharmaceutical mixture in Cambisol Dystric with minor alterations in microbial community structure compare to a non-amended control. The stress effect was detected for all pharmaceuticals in Arenosol and Cambisol Haplic. While the dormancy effect was mainly observed in Chernozem Siltic for most of the pharmaceuticals. Microbial responses were highly dependent on the soil type, pharmaceutical compound and time, highlighting the importance to consider these parameters including a resilience of soil microbial communities to micropollutants within a long-term agricultural soil management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArenosols 3aCambisols 3aChernozems 3aagricultural soils 3acommunity structure 3adormancy 3ahuman health 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3apollutants 3asoil biology 3asoil management 3asulfamethoxazole 0aEmerging compounds 0aMicropollutants 0aBasal respiration 0aPLFA1 aVystavna, Y.1 aKoubová, A.1 aKotas, P.1 aGrabicová, K.1 aGrabic, R.1 aKodešová, R.1 aChroňáková, A.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2020 Oct., v. 149 p.107924-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.1079243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03030naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245016500171300001800336520152100354592002801875650001401903650001701917650001101934650002301945650002501968650002201993650001102015650002902026650000902055650002102064651001002085653003602095653002202131653003502153653003102188653002802219653002402247700002502271700002002296700003102316700002002347773009902367856008502466852000902551655001202560IND60697100120221121122551.0201230e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069710012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2020.05.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarone, Giovanni10aIncreasing self-consumption of renewable energy through the Building to Vehicle to Building approach applied to multiple users connected in a virtual micro-grid  ap. 1165-1176.  aThis paper focuses on a novel energy management approach, namely Building to Vehicle to Building, in which electric vehicles act as vector devices for renewable energy exchanges among buildings. The main goal behind this concept is to benefit from the potentiality of electric vehicles toward the achievement of the zero-energy target extended to a buildings cluster level, by exploiting renewable generation on- and off-site. To this aim, a dynamic simulation tool is developed to assess the energy and economic performance of the proposed V2B² scheme applied to a cluster of multiple users made of non-residential buildings and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging, used as a back-up power supply for increasing self-consumption of energy produced on-site by PV panels integrated in one of the buildings, to be also exploited off-site by other users. A case study analysis is conducted for a sample cluster of 3 building sand 3 electric vehicles, located in a Mediterranean city (Naples, Italy) with the aim at conducting the proof of concept. Simulation results show that the proposed V2B² scheme enhances the match between the on-site renewable generation and the whole system demand, i.e. buildings and electric vehicles’ needs, by reducing the grid operation and boosting the system economic convenience. The proposed energy management scheme represents an example of novel aggregator energy and business model which will play a crucial role in the next generation of smart cities and communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acase studies 3acities 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic performance 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy 3arenewable energy sources 3asand 3asolar collectors 3aItaly 0aBuilding to vehicle to building 0aElectric vehicles 0aSolar renewable energy sources 0aNearly zero energy cluster 0aAggregator energy model 0aDynamic simulations1 aBuonomano, Annamaria1 aForzano, Cesare1 aGiuzio, Giovanni Francesco1 aPalombo, Adolfo0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Oct., v. 159 p.1165-1176dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2020.05.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001500168245008200183300001600265520196000281592002802241650002202269650000902291650002502300650001002325650001802335650002402353650002502377650002902402650001402431650001202445650001202457650001302469650002002482650001602502650002302518650001202541650000902553650001902562650002102581650001602602650003802618650002502656650001702681650001902698650001802717651001402735651001302749700001802762773010702780856008502887852000902972655001202981IND4473069320221118165229.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447306932DNAL7 a210841462pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.10.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCary, John14aThe limitations of environmental management systems in Australian agriculture  ap. 878-885.  aThe efficacy of government-supported programs to encourage improved management of land and water systems associated with agricultural land in Australia has been mixed. The broad approach of Australian governments is reviewed briefly. Evidence is presented from case assessments of a program to promote adoption of environmental management systems (EMSs) to improve environmental outcomes from agricultural practices. EMSs are systems implemented to manage the environmental impacts and ameliorate environmental risk associated with business activity. Data are presented on reported EMS activity and experience of four selected groups of farmers in Victoria, south-eastern Australia, representing broad-acre cropping, beef and dairy farming. The pro-environmental behaviours of farmers were mediated through voluntary adoption of government and industry sponsored EMSs, often with financial incentives and other support. Findings from the study were that adoption of EMS practices with sufficient public benefits is unlikely to occur at sufficient scale for significant environmental impact. Farmers more readily adopted practices which were financially beneficial than those which had a positive environmental impact. Although the focus on voluntary market-based instrument (MBI) type programs is popular in western countries, enforcing regulation is an important, but usually politically unpopular, component of land use policy. The comparative advantage of EMSs differed for the industries studied, but overall there were insufficient market drivers for widespread EMS adoption in Australia. Environmental outcomes could be more effectively achieved by directly funding land management practices which have highest public net benefits. Having a clear and unambiguous management objective for a particular land management policy is more likely to achieve outcomes than having multiple objectives as occurs in a number of international programs currently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abeef 3abusiness enterprises 3acrops 3adairy farming 3aeconomic incentives 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental management 3aequipment 3afarmers 3afunding 3aindustry 3aland management 3aland policy 3amanagement systems 3amarkets 3arisk 3asocial benefit 3awater management 2aAgriculture 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Policy 2aFocus Groups 2aPrivate Sector 2aPublic Sector 3aAustralia 0aVictoria1 aRoberts, Anna0 tJournal of environmental management.g2011 Mar., v. 92, no. 3 p.878-885dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.10.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245018300160300001600343520083700359592002801196650001901224650002001243650003401263650001301297650001501310650001101325650002801336650003501364700002401399700001301423700001501436700002001451773009201471856007301563852000901636655001201645IND60515903020221118061322.0160321e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051590302DNAL7 a10.1111/age.124062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrischknecht, M.10aGenome‐wide association studies based on sequence‐derived genotypes reveal new QTL associated with conformation and performance traits in the Franches–Montagnes horse breed  ap. 227-229.  aTo identify novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) within horses, we performed genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) based on sequence‐level genotypes for conformation and performance traits in the Franches–Montagnes (FM) horse breed. Sequence‐level genotypes of FM horses were derived by re‐sequencing 30 key founders and imputing 50K data of genotyped horses. In total, we included 1077 FM horses genotyped for ~4 million SNPs and their respective de‐regressed breeding values of the traits in the analysis. Based on this dataset, we identified a total of 14 QTL associated with 18 conformation traits and one performance trait. Therefore, our results suggest that the application of sequence‐derived genotypes increases the power to identify novel QTL which were not identified previously based on 50K SNP chip data.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding value 3adata collection 3agenome-wide association study 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahorses 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aSigner‐Hasler, H.1 aLeeb, T.1 aRieder, S.1 aNeuditschko, M.0 tAnimal genetics.g2016 Apr., v. 47, no. 2 p.227-229dBlackwell Sciencex0268-91467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.124063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
