The three-dimensional geometries of these compounds were determined by X-ray crystallography. A near-orthogonal alignment of the naphthalene pillaring motif to the dimethoxybenzene redox center, or the phenylene spacer, imposes cofacial alignment of these units in a juxtaposed manner with sub-van der Waals interplanar distances. Cyclic and differential pulse voltammograms reveal that the ΔE values between two sequential oxidation potentials are 0.30, 0.11, and 0.10 V for 1, 2, and 3, respectively. MVSs derived from these compounds are recognized as class II according to the Robin and Day classification. The decay parameter β, which describes the distance dependence of the squared electronic coupling in the three mixed-valence systems, was experimentally determined via Mulliken–Hush analysis of the intervalence charge transfer band (β = 0.37 Å–¹) and theoretically assessed from charge-resonance contributions derived from DFT computations (β = 0.37 Å–¹). These values are extraordinarily mild, indicating that the electronic interaction between redox centers in the longitudinal direction may be comparable to that in the transverse direction, if the MVS system is appropriately designed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aelectron transfer 3ageometry 3anaphthalene 3aoxidation 3aphysical chemistry1 aYoon, Sung Ewn1 aCarroll, Patrick J.1 aGau, Michael R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4790-69801 aTherien, Michael J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4876-00361 aKang, Youn K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0415-13110 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 13, v. 124, no. 6 p.1033-1048dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.9b095783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245020800170520176200378592002802140650001802168650002002186650002202206650002402228650001702252650001902269650001702288650002102305650000902326650001102335650001502346650002002361650001502381650001802396653002802414653001602442653002902458653003202487653001002519653004102529700002002570700001902590700001802609700001802627700001702645700005702662700001602719773011302735856008502848852000902933655001202942IND60680597420221117223938.0200503e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068059742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4608502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chun-xia10aHighly selective monitoring of in-source fragmentation sapogenin product ions in positive mode enabling group-target ginsenosides profiling and simultaneous identification of seven Panax herbal medicines  aIn-source fragmentation of ginsenosides in the positive ESI mode (pISF-G) frequently occurs, which results in little fragment information useful for the structural elucidation. We are aimed to unveil the genesic mechanism and explore its potential significance in quality control of Ginseng and the related compound formulae. By applying six high-resolution mass spectrometers from Agilent, Waters, and Thermo Fisher, we could primarily demonstrate the susceptibility of pISF-G. The ion clusters in the positive full-scan MS¹ spectra were generated from the protonated sapogenins by successive elimination of H₂O, and showed specificity for ginsenoside classification. Selective ion monitoring (SIM) of the sapogenin product ions could delineate group-target ginsenoside profiles from Ginseng. A high-selectivity characteristic chromatogram (CC) was elaborated for Ginseng, on the Vion™ IMS-QTOF mass spectrometer by IM (ion mobility) separation and quadrupole filtering of four sapogenin fragments (m/z 407.37/CCS 206.24 Å²; m/z 423.36/CCS 211.26 Å²; m/z 439.36/CCS 209.60 Å²; m/z 457.37/CCS 217.81 Å²). Chemometric analysis, based on the CC data of seven Ginseng drugs (P. ginseng, P. quinquefolius, P. notoginseng, Red ginseng, leaf of P. ginseng, P. japonicus, and P. japonicus var. major), disclosed 35 marker compounds. We could readily discriminate among P. ginseng, P. quinquefolius, and P. notoginseng, in 15 different compound formulae by identifying these marker compounds on both the Vion IMS-QTOF and QTrap 4500 mass spectrometers. Conclusively, SIM of the pISF-G sapogenin product ions renders a new concept of CC enabling the group-target profiling of ginsenosides and authentication of Ginseng and the related compound formulae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax ginseng 3aPanax japonicus 3aPanax notoginseng 3aPanax quinquefolius 3achemometrics 3achromatography 3aginsenosides 3aherbal medicines 3aions 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3aquality control 3asapogenins 3aspectrometers 0aIn-source fragmentation 0aGinsenoside 0aSelective ion monitoring 0aCharacteristic chromatogram 0aPanax 0aTraditional Chinese medicine formula1 aWang, Xiao-Yan,1 aLin, Zhao-zhou1 aWang, Hong-da1 aQian, Yue-xin1 aLi, Wei-Wei,1 aYang, Wen-zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2780-48531 aGuo, De'an,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 May 10, v. 1618 p.460850-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4608503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04472naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002200191245013000213300001600343520151500359592002801874650001801902650001801920650001501938650001801953650002301971650004001994650001702034650004302051650002702094650000902121650001902130650003302149650001202182650004702194650003002241650007302271650003002344650004202374650008202416650005102498650003602549650003702585650005402622650002702676650002802703650006702731650001902798650004902817650001802866650000902884650004702893650005502940650007402995650003003069650002903099650000903128650002503137650006203162650002803224650003303252650004903285650003103334700002403365700001703389700001603406700001903422773010903441856008403550990002303634852000903657655001203666IND60097817120221121115727.0141104e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009781712DNAL7 a218161382pmid7 aPMC31851592pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavidson, Eric P.10aEffect of treatment of high fat fed/low dose streptozotocin-diabetic rats with Ilepatril on vascular and neural complications  ap. 497-506.  aWe have previously shown that treating streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, an animal model of type 1 diabetes, with Ilepatril (an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)) improves vascular and neural functions. In this study we sought to determine the effect of Ilepatril treatment of high fat fed/low dose streptozotocin-diabetic rats, a model for type 2 diabetes, on vascular and neural complications. Following 8weeks on a high fat diet rats were treated with 30mg/kg streptozotocin (i.p.) and after 4 additional weeks a group of these rats was treated for 12weeks with Ilepatril followed by analysis of neural and vascular functions. Included in these studies were age-matched control rats and rats fed a high fat diet and treated with or without Ilepatril. Diabetic and diet induced obese rats have characteristics of insulin resistance, slowing of nerve conduction velocity, thermal hypoalgesia, reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the hindpaw and impairment in vascular relaxation to acetylcholine and calcitonin gene-related peptide in epineurial arterioles of the sciatic nerve. Treatment with Ilepatril was efficacious in improving all of these endpoints although improvement of insulin resistance in diabetic rats was minimal. These studies suggest that dual inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase activity of type 2 diabetic rats is an effective approach for treatment of diabetic neural and vascular complications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aanimal models 3acalcitonin 3ahigh fat diet 3ainsulin resistance 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anerve tissue 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arats 3astreptozotocin 2aAdipose Tissuexdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aArteriolesxdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBlood Vesselsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxdrug effects 2aDiabetes Complicationsxdrug therapyxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxcomplications 2aDiet, High-Fatxadverse effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aHeterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ringxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aInsulinxblood 2aLens, Crystallinexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLeptinxblood 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aNerve Fibersxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aNervous Systemxdrug effectsxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aNociceptionxdrug effects 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSciatic Nervexdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 2aThiobarbituratesxmetabolism 2aTyrosinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aVasodilationxdrug effects1 aCoppey, Lawrence J.1 aHolmes, Amey1 aDake, Brian1 aYorek, Mark A.0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 668, no. 3 p.497-506dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245009700181300001800278500000900296520123800305592002801543650001401571650001301585650002301598650002401621650001401645650001401659650001401673650001801687650001801705650001501723650001201738650001201750651003101762700002001793700001801813773015001831856009601981852000902077655001202086IND60668323420221120095907.0191125e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066832342DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300040010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahlgren, R.

A mechanical vacuum extractor was employed to draw solutions through soil columns at solution/soil residence times between 0.3 and 100 h. Equilibrium was approached from conditions of both undersaturation and oversaturation to determine if a particular soil mineral controlled Al³⁺ activity. Column leachates were analyzed for major solutes followed by chemical speciation and calculation of mineral saturation indices. Our results showed that apparent equilibrium with respect to Al(OH)₃ solubility was readily obtained from both conditions of undersaturation and oversaturation within 0.3 h. Computed saturation indices, for an Al(OH)₃ mineral with log K₂₅C = 8.1, were identical at all examined residence times. Aquo Al (Al³⁺) within soil solutions may be regulated by the hydroxy-Al interlayer of expansible 2:1 layer silicates. Soil solutions from Bear Brook also reached apparent equilibrium with imogolite at residence times in excess of 10 h. The laboratory results compared favorably with saturation indices calculated from stream and soil solutions at these sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodosols 3aaluminum 3aaluminum hydroxide 3achemical speciation 3aimogolite 3aleachates 3asilicates 3asoil minerals 3asoil solution 3asolubility 3asolutes 3astreams 3aNortheastern United States1 aDriscoll, C.

It is of interest to determine whether ugonin K has beneficial effect on osteoblast maturation. In this study, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were treated with ugonin K. Cell differentiation and mineralization were identified by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Alizarin red S staining, respectively. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to analyze osteoblast-associated gene expression and signaling pathways. Our results showed that ugonin K significantly induced the increase of ALP activity, expressions of bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin (OCN), and mineralization. The mRNA expressions of the transcription factors Runx2 and osterix were also up-regulated by ugonin K. Ugonin K increased the phosphorylated level of p38 and ERK, respectively. In the presence of SB203580, ugonin K induced expressions of Runx2 and osterix, ALP activity, BSP level and bone nodule formation were all completely inhibited, but ugonin K induced OCN expression was not affected. On the other hand, ugonin K-induced ALP activity and mineralization were mildly attenuated by PD98059, but the over-expressed Runx2, osterix, BSP and OCN also were significantly repressed by PD98059. These suggested that both p38 and ERK participate in regulating ugonin K evoked osteogenesis but p38 seemed to play a more important role. Take together, the potential anabolic effect of ugonin K on bone might act through activations of p38- and ERK-mediated Runx2 and osterix expressions to induce the synthesis of osteoids and formation of bone nodule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelminthostachys 3aWestern blotting 3aalizarin 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abone density 3abone formation 3acell differentiation 3aflavonoids 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3amineralization 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3apharmacology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aroots 3asignal transduction 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription factors 2a3T3 Cells 2aAnimals 2aBone Matrixxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCalcification, Physiologicxdrug effects 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCore Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunitxgenetics 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aFlavonoidsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aMAP Kinase Signaling Systemxdrug effects 2aMice 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1xmetabolism 2aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3xmetabolism 2aOsteoblastsxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorylationxdrug effects 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism1 aHuang, Yuling,1 aLiao, Jyh-Fei1 aChiou, Wen-Fei0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 668, no. 3 p.383-389dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.06.0593Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245011100165300001600276520146800292592002801760650002501788650001301813650000901826650001501835650001701850650002801867650003501895650001401930700001701944700001601961700001301977700001601990700001402006700001802020700001802038700001902056773012102075856005502196852000902251655001202260IND4477835320221120112220.0120426e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447783532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2012.01106.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Yi10aZmcrtRB3 Encodes a Carotenoid Hydroxylase that Affects the Accumulation of α‐carotene in Maize KernelF   ap. 260-269.  aα‐carotene is one of the important components of pro‐vitamin A, which is able to be converted into vitamin A in the human body. One maize (Zea mays L.) ortholog of carotenoid hydroxylases in Arabidopsis thaliana, ZmcrtRB3, was cloned and its role in carotenoid hydrolyzations was addressed. ZmcrtRB3 was mapped in a quantitative trait locus (QTL) cluster for carotenoid‐related traits on chromosome 2 (bin 2.03) in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from By804 and B73. Candidate‐gene association analysis identified 18 polymorphic sites in ZmcrtRB3 significantly associated with one or more carotenoid‐related traits in 126 diverse yellow maize inbred lines. These results indicate that the enzyme ZmcrtRB3 plays a role in hydrolyzing both α‐ and β‐carotenes, while polymorphisms in ZmcrtRB3 contributed more variation in α‐carotene than that in β‐carotene. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SNP1343 in 5′untranslated region and SNP2172 in the second intron, consistently had effects on α‐carotene content and composition with explained phenotypic variations ranging from 8.7% to 34.8%. There was 1.7‐ to 3.7‐fold change between the inferior and superior haplotype for α‐carotene content and composition. Thus, SNP1343 and SNP2172 are potential polymorphic sites to develop functional markers for applying marker‐assisted selection in the improvement of pro‐vitamin A carotenoids in maize kernels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aZea mays 3acorn 3ahaplotypes 3ainbred lines 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3avitamin A1 aHan, Yingjia1 aLi, Zhigang1 aFu, Yang1 aFu, Zhiyuan1 aXu, Shutu1 aLi, Jiansheng1 aYan, Jianbing1 aYang, Xiaohong0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2012 Apr., v. 54, no. 4 p.260-269dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2012.01106.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009600170300001600266500001900282520097400301536006201275592002801337596006801365650001801433650001801451650001001469650002001479650001601499650001401515650001401529650001601543650002001559653001401579653001301593653001201606653001301618653001001631653001401641773010201655856008501757852000901842655001201851IND60695545820221119163732.0200517e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069554582DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2017.14013902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Nhu H.10aLongevity of light- and dark-colored basidiospores from saprotrophic mushroom-forming fungi  ap. 131-135.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFungi can produce resistant propagules that may last for decades. Basidiospores from ectomycorrhizal fungi had been experimentally shown to last for at least 6 yr, but there are few reports on the longevity of saprotrophic members of mushroom-forming fungi. Here, the author shows evidence of spore longevity of these fungi by collecting, drying, storing, and germinating these spores over time. Results showed that dark-colored spores have a much-extended longevity as compared to light-colored spores. Dark-colored spores of some species are viable to at least 2.8 yr, whereas light-colored spores are generally viable for a much shorter period of time. The author proposes that mushroom-forming basidiomycete fungi employ two different ecological strategies: one with extended longevity that allows for long-distance dispersal, and the other takes advantage of optimal conditions that support both mushroom formation, basidiospore dispersal, and germination locally.  aThis work was supported in part by the NSF-GRFP to N.H.N.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001 3aBasidiomycota 3abasidiospores 3acolor 3aectomycorrhizae 3agermination 3alongevity 3amushrooms 3asaprotrophs 3aspore dispersal 0aDispersal 0adormancy 0amelanin 0amushroom 0aspore 0aviability0 tMycologia.g2018 Jan. 2, v. 110, no. 1 p.131-135dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2017.14013903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03989naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245013500188300001600323520148300339592002801822650001501850650001201865650001001877650001601887650002301903650001901926650002201945650002401967650001701991650002602008650001802034650002002052650000902072650001402081650001102095650002202106650003202128650001202160650002902172650002902201650003702230650001102267650003202278650005802310650006302368650003602431650005802467650000902525650007302534650002902607650004702636650003202683650002902715650000902744650001702753650001002770650003102780650003702811650001702848650003802865650003102903700002102934700001602955700002302971773010902994856008403103990002303187852000903210655001203219IND60097817520221121180815.0141104e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009781752DNAL7 a218547672pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Tomoka10aMechanisms underlying impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation by fetal bovine serum in organ-cultured rat mesenteric artery  ap. 401-406.  aOrgan culture of blood vessels provides a useful technique to investigate long-term effects of drugs because tissue architecture and function are well preserved. Various growth factors are responsible for structural and functional changes during vascular diseases. We investigated long-term effects of fetal bovine serum (FBS) which contains such factors on endothelium-dependent relaxation using organ-culture method. Rat isolated mesenteric arteries with endothelium were cultured for 3days without or with 10% FBS (FBS). Acetylcholine- and bradykinin-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations were significantly impaired in FBS, whereas sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation of endothelium-removed artery was unchanged. Morphological examination revealed that endothelium was intact in FBS. Acetylcholine-induced nitric oxide (NO) release as detected by 4, 5-diaminofluorescein significantly decreased in FBS, whereas endothelial NO synthase expression was unchanged. A Ca²⁺ ionophore, A23187-induced relaxation was unchanged in FBS. A phospholipase C activator, m-3M3FBS-induced relaxation of FBS was unchanged in either Ca²⁺-containing or -free solution. Total expressions of transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPCs: TRPC-1, -4, -5) were similar in FBS. These data suggest that FBS impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation by inhibiting events upstream of phospholipase C activation including phospholipase C, G-protein, and receptors in endothelium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-proteins 3acalcium 3adrugs 3aendothelium 3afetal bovine serum 3agrowth factors 3along term effects 3amesenteric arteries 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aorgan culture 3aphospholipase C 3arats 3areceptors 3asodium 3avascular diseases 2aAcetylcholinexpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBradykininxpharmacology 2aCalcimycinxpharmacology 2aCalcium Ionophoresxpharmacology 2aCattle 2aCulture Mediaxpharmacology 2aEndothelial Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxsecretion. 2aEndothelium, Vascularxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMesenteric Arteriesxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aNitric Oxidexsecretion. 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIIxmetabolism 2aNitroprussidexpharmacology 2aOrgan Culture Techniques 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSerum 2aSulfonamidesxpharmacology 2aTRPC Cation Channelsxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 2aType C Phospholipasesxmetabolism 2aVasodilationxdrug effects1 aOkada, Muneyoshi1 aHara, Yukio1 aYamawaki, Hideyuki0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 668, no. 3 p.401-406dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245010000165300001800265520107000283592002801353650001301381650001401394650002401408650001701432650001801449650002201467650001501489650001201504650001801516650002001534650001001554650001401564650001401578653001301592653002201605653001401627653001101641653000901652700002401661700002601685700002201711700002101733700001601754700002401770773012401794856008001918852000901998655001202007IND60528267320221122151402.0160716e20150429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052826732DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b002872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlberts, Erik M.10aStructural and Compositional Characterization of the Adhesive Produced by Reef Building Oysters  ap. 8533-8538.  aOysters have an impressive ability to overcome difficulties of life within the stressful intertidal zone. These shellfish produce an adhesive for attaching to each other and building protective reef communities. With their reefs often exceeding kilometers in length, oysters play a major role in balancing the health of coastal marine ecosystems. Few details are available to describe oyster adhesive composition or structure. Here several characterization methods were applied to describe the nature of this material. Microscopy studies indicated that the glue is comprised of organic fiber-like and sheet-like structures surrounded by an inorganic matrix. Phospholipids, cross-linking chemistry, and conjugated organics were found to differentiate this adhesive from the shell. Symbiosis in material synthesis could also be present, with oysters incorporating bacterial polysaccharides into their adhesive. Oyster glue shows that an organic–inorganic composite material can provide adhesion, a property especially important when constructing a marine ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aadhesives 3acomposite materials 3acrosslinking 3alittoral zone 3amarine ecosystems 3amicroscopy 3aoysters 3aphospholipids 3apolysaccharides 3areefs 3ashellfish 3asymbiosis 0aadhesive 0abiomineralization 0ainterface 0aoyster 0areef1 aTaylor, Stephen D.,1 aEdwards, Stephanie L.1 aSherman, Debra M.1 aHuang, Chia-Ping1 aKenny, Paul1 aWilker, Jonathan J.0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Apr. 29, v. 7, no. 16 p.8533-8538dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b002873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011100173300001600284520173600300592002802036650001402064650001202078650001102090650001602101650002202117650002402139650001702163650001602180650001402196650001402210650000902224650001102233650001102244650000902255650001502264651001102279653002402290653001102314653003402325653001902359653002002378653001502398700002502413773010502438856008602543852000902629655001202638IND60539811420221118060913.0190318e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053981142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.08.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrick, Kegan K.10aFlowpaths, source water contributions and water residence times in a Mexican tropical dry forest catchment  ap. 854-865.  aRunoff in forested tropical catchments has been frequently described in the literature as dominated by the rapid translation of rainfall to runoff through surface and shallow subsurface pathways. However, studies examining runoff generation in tropical catchments with highly permeable soils have received little attention, particularly in tropical dry forests. We present a study focused on identifying the dominant flowpaths, water sources and stream water residence times in a tropical dry forest catchment near the Pacific coast of central Mexico. During the wet season, pre-event water contributions to stormflow ranged from 72% to 97%, with the concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium closely coupling the geochemistry of baseflow and groundwater from the narrow riparian/near-stream zone. Baseflow from the intermittent stream showed a strongly damped isotopic signature and a mean baseflow residence time of 52–110days was estimated. These findings all suggest that instead of the surface and near-surface subsurface lateral pathways observed over many tropical catchments, runoff is generated through vertical flow processes and the displacement and discharge of stored water from the saturated zone. As the wet season progressed, contributions from the saturated zone persisted; however, the stormflow and baseflow geochemistry suggests that the contributing area of the catchment increased. Our results show that during the early part of the wet season, runoff originated primarily from the headwater portion of the catchment. As the wet season progressed and catchment wetness increased, connectivity among sub-basin was improved, resulting in runoff contributions from across the entire catchment.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3acalcium 3acoasts 3adry forests 3aephemeral streams 3aforested watersheds 3ageochemistry 3agroundwater 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3arain 3arunoff 3asodium 3asoil 3awet season 3aMexico 0aTropical dry forest 0aRunoff 0aIsotope hydrograph separation 0aHydrochemistry 0aResidence times 0aStreamflow1 aBranfireun, Brian A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2015 Oct., v. 529 p.854-865dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.08.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013200170300001600302520145700318592002801775650001601803650002201819650001401841650003001855650001501885650001801900650000901918650001701927650001301944650001401957650002001971650001601991650001602007650002002023653001702043653002602060653002702086653002602113653000802139653000702147653000802154653000802162700005802170700002002228700006302248700005702311700002102368700002502389700002702414773014002441856008302581852000902664655001202673IND60680598520221117223903.0200210e20200307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068059852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2019.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJha, Nilesh Kumar10aPore scale investigation of low salinity surfactant nanofluid injection into oil saturated sandstone via X-ray micro-tomography  ap. 370-380.  aLow salinity surfactant nanofluids have recently shown promising characteristics in wettability alteration of the silicate-based rock representative substrate and interfacial tension reduction of oil/aqueous phase interface. Pore level understanding of the physical processes entailed in this new class of low salinity injection fluids in oil-phase saturated real rock porous media is required, which has not been conceived yet.Thus, we investigate the oil recovery performance and possible mechanisms of oil recovery by the injection of low salinity surfactant (SDBS, 1.435 mM) aqueous solutions (with 0%, 0.01% and 0.1% (by weight) ZrO₂ nanoparticles) into the oil phase saturated Doddington sandstone miniature core plugs. The designed experiment involves core flooding with X-ray transparent core-holder developed in-house and analysis/processing of the acquired image data.The injection of low salinity surfactant nanofluids with 0.01% ZrO₂ nanoparticles leads to maximum oil phase recovery. The results suggest that the dominating mechanisms for oil recovery are wettability alteration, inherent interfacial tension reduction, and the effect of significant amount of microemulsions formation is rather trivial. Low salinity effect, even in combination with surfactant, caused fines migrations (not reported earlier), is found to be significantly mitigated using nanoparticles. This new class of fluids may significantly enhance oil recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaqueous solutions 3aemulsions 3amicro-computed tomography 3ananofluids 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3aporous media 3asalinity 3asandstone 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3awettability 3azirconium oxide 0aLow salinity 0aEnhanced oil recovery 0aWettability alteration 0aMicro-CT coreflooding 0aEOR 0aCT 0aLSS 0aZNP1 aLebedev, Maxim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1369-58441 aIglauer, Stefan1 aʻAlī, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2446-30721 aRoshan, Hamid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1432-93011 aBarifcani, Ahmed1 aSangwai, Jitendra S.1 aSarmadivaleh, Mohammad0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2020 Mar. 07, v. 562 p.370-380dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2019.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010500171300001600276500000900292520098600301592002801287650001601315650002801331650001001359650001301369650001801382650001101400650001801411650001501429650002501444650003901469650001801508700002001526700001901546773013701565856008201702852000901784655001201793IND60668324220221120075443.0191228e200003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066832422DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2000.642527x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeerts, Albrecht H.10aModeling the Gas Diffusion Coefficient in Analogy to Electrical Conductivity Using a Capillary Model  ap. 527-532.  aepub  aA conceptual model that accounts for the influence of pore geometry is presented to model gas diffusion coefficients in soils as a function of water content. To model the diffusion coefficient of the gas phase, we rewrote the Mualem and Friedman bulk electrical conductivity model. The model was calibrated using measured soil water retention curves and gas diffusion coefficients of seven mineral soil horizons. The model with only one free parameter fitted the data of five horizons. The model failed to describe the data of two clayey surface horizons. Estimated gas tortuosity parameters were tested on measured hydraulic conductivity data of three of the soils studied. The use of the gas tortuosity parameter led to overestimation of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at low water contents. This systematic deviation suggests that the gas (non-wetting) tortuosity parameter is not equal to the hydraulic (wetting) tortuosity parameter, although a relationship is likely.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiffusivity 3aelectrical conductivity 3agases 3ageometry 3amineral soils 3amodels 3asoil horizons 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity 3awater content1 aFreijer, Jan I.1 aBouten, Willem0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2000 Mar., v. 64, no. 2 p.527-532dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2000.642527x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245008900207300001800296520096200314592002801276650001501304650001101319650001401330650002801344650001101372650001301383650001501396650001101411650001301422773013501435856008001570852000901650655001201659IND60683908320221122031200.0200213e20200130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068390832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c000892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohammadi, Mahnaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0679-423810aPerformance of a Novel 3D Graphene–WS₂ Hybrid Structure for Sodium-Ion Batteries  ap. 3536-3541.  aThree dimensional (3D) heterostructure materials display proper energy storage performance and high electric conductivity. In this work, the application of 3D graphene sheets and zigzag WS₂ nanoribbon (3DGW) hybrid structures as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries is studied on the basis of first-principle calculations. Compared with related single-layer nanosheets and nanoribbon hybrid components, 3DGW heterostructures show an enhanced Na adsorption interaction and good electrical conductivity, which competes with popular electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries. The activation barrier for Na diffusion in 3DGW hybrid structures is lower than in two dimensional hybrid components, which can expect higher cycling rates. Our results present the performance of a new 3D material for next-generation sodium-ion electrode materials and provide proper insight into exploring high-capacity 3D heterostructure materials for battery applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3abatteries 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ananosheets 3asodium 3asulfides0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 30, v. 124, no. 6 p.3536-3541dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c000893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04190naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245007000184300001600254500001500270520228000285592002802565650001002593650002602603650002102629650001002650650001902660650001802679650001102697650002002708650002402728650002602752650001002778650002502788650002002813650001102833650001102844650001602855650001302871650002402884650001502908650001402923650000902937650001102946650001302957650001902970650002302989650002303012650002303035650003403058650001203092650001603104650002603120650001703146650002203163650003803185651001003223651001003233653002003243700002703263773011203290856008103402852000903483655001203492IND50063394520221120024427.0141111e20130327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006339452DNAL7 a233762812pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2013.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Rajesh10aNew claims in folk veterinary medicines from Uttar Pradesh, India  ap. 581-593.  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: In remote areas, folk medicines play a significant role in livestock health care management. The aims of this study were to document folk veterinary medicines of the Uttar Pradesh region and identify promising species for pharmacological studies. METHODS: Fieldwork was conducted over a period of two years in Uttar Pradesh, utilizing the “transect walk” method of participatory rural appraisal (PRA). The data were analyzed through the following techniques: use-value, relative frequency of citation and informant consensus factor (Fic). RESULTS: This research details the use of 83 medicinal plants used to treat 36 livestock ailments. A total of 91 new medicinal claims were discovered. The ailments are categorized into 11 ailment categories based on certain group of ailments (symptoms/similarities, etc). The Fic values indicate that there was a high degree of consensus among informants regarding how to treat burns, coughs, colds and fevers. The most useful medicinal species, ranked according to their perceived usefulness were: Linum usitatissimum, Saccharum officinarum, Brassica napus, Acacia nilotica, Alocasia macrorrhizos, and Calotropis gigantea. For certain medicinal uses, Ferula asafoetida, Linum usitatissimum, Pandanus tectorius, Brassica juncea, Brassica napus, Madhuca longifolia, Alocasia macrorrhizos and Tagetes erecta were also frequently cited for cures with a Fic value of over 3.00. In remedy preparations, the leaves were the most frequently used plant part (22 instances) and most of the preparations were in the form of crushed plant parts, leaves or otherwise. Herbs were the most frequently used source of medicine (43), followed by trees (21) and shrubs (17%). CONCLUSIONS: Those plants which received high relative frequency citation (Fic) values may prove useful for pharmacological studies in new drug development projects, especially Ferula asafoetida (used for flatulence), Linum usitatissimum (a galactagogue), Pandanus tectorius (used for estrus regulation/preparation for breeding), Brassica juncea (to cure infections of the tail), Brassica napus (also to cure infections of the tail), Madhuca longifolia (to cure maggots in the hoof), Alocasia macrorrhizos (for estrus regulation) and Tagetes erecta (for otitis).  aPublisher supplied data 3aherbs 3aAlocasia macrorrhizos 3amedicinal plants 3atrees 3aBrassica napus 3ainsect larvae 3aFerula 3ahealth services 3aCalotropis gigantea 3aSaccharum officinarum 3adrugs 3adevelopment projects 3aBrassica juncea 3ahooves 3aleaves 3acommon cold 3amedicine 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aflatulence 3alivestock 3atail 3ashrubs 3abreeding 3aTagetes erecta 3aPandanus tectorius 3aVachellia nilotica 3aMadhuca longifolia 2aAnimal Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aAnimals 2aEthnobotany 2aMedicine, Traditional 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aVeterinary Drugsxtherapeutic use 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aAcacia nilotica1 aBharati, Kumar Avinash0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2013 Mar. 27, v. 146, no. 2 p.581-593dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2013.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015400168300001600322520094000338592002801278650001301306650001501319650000901334650001301343650000901356650001801365650001401383650001301397650001501410650001501425650001401440653002101454653002001475653002901495653002301524653001501547700001501562700002001577700001301597700001701610773009901627856008501726852000901811655001201820IND60722034120221120054950.0210226e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072203412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2020.12.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Mengyao10aNumerical investigation of flow stratification behavior of binary particle mixture for high-temperature flue gas filtration on an inclined moving bed  ap. 339-350.  aAlthough the filtration efficiency can be increased because of the use of small-sized particles in granular beds, the bed pressure drop may be increased.

The particle discrete element method is used to simulate the flow process of binary particles, which is verified by experiments. An index to measure the effect of stratification and the separation degree (SD) are proposed. Results show that SD increases as the particle size ratio and the mass fraction of coarse particles increases. The thickness of the coarse particle layer increases as the mass fraction increases.

In an initiative proposed by the Landscape Architecture Foundation (LAF), leading landscape architecture firms and academic institutions have been collaborating on studies that quantitatively assess environmental, economic and social benefits of high-profile landscape design projects. This study describes the components and processes of LAF landscape performance research and specifically evaluates the status of social benefits assessment, a critical though under-investigated aspect of landscape design sustainability. Using 58 published LAF case studies, the study examines to what extent social benefits are quantified compared with stated design goals, the benefits across the LAF case portfolio (e.g. per benefit category and project type), and methods and data options available to perform the analyses. Finally, the study provides suggestions on improving landscape performance research, particularly social benefits, in the enterprise of achieving evidence-based designs that are anchored in quantitative performance measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aeducational institutions 3alandscapes 3alandscaping 3asocial benefit 3asocioeconomic status 0aSocial sustainability 0apost-occupancy evaluation 0amultifunctional landscapes1 aLi, Shujuan1 aBinder, Chris0 tLandscape research.g2016 Apr. 2, v. 41, no. 3 p.314-329dRoutledgex1469-97107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2015.10779443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245010200171300001800273520114600291592002801437650002301465650001501488650000901503650002101512650001501533650001701548650001401565650001101579650001301590650001101603650000701614650001901621650002801640650001301668650001401681650001701695650002101712700005501733700002801788700002401816700006201840700007101902700006201973773013502035856008002170852000902250655001202259IND60683908720221122031150.0200213e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068390872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c004932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, Christopher L.10aOligomeric Ruthenium Polypyridyl Dye for Improved Stability of Aqueous Photoelectrochemical Cells  ap. 3542-3550.  aWater-splitting dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells rely on molecular sensitizers to harvest light energy and drive the catalytic reactions necessary to generate hydrogen and oxygen from water. The desorption of sensitizer molecules from the semiconductor–aqueous electrolyte interface is a significant barrier to the practical implementation of these cells. To address this problem, we synthesized an oligomeric ruthenium dye ([RuP]ₙ) that has dramatically improved stability as a photosensitizer for TiO₂ electrodes over the pH range of interest (4–7.8) for DSPECs. Additionally, the efficiency of photoelectrochemical charge separation is known to depend on the rate of cross-surface hole diffusion between dye molecules. The oligomeric dye ([RuP]ₙ) shows an order of magnitude faster cross-surface hole diffusion than the commonly used monomeric [Ru(bpy)₂(4,4-PO₃H₂)₂bpy]²⁺ (RuP) sensitizer. The enhanced stability of the polymeric dye also enables the use of intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy to measure the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes as a function of electrolyte pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3adesorption 3adyes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosensitizing agents 3apolymers 3aruthenium 3aspectroscopy 3atitanium dioxide1 aXu, Pengtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4470-446X1 aRothenberger, August J.1 aKoehler, Stephen J.1 aElacqua, Elizabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1239-95601 aMilosavljevic, Bratoljub H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6375-19821 aMallouk, Thomas E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4599-42080 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 124, no. 6 p.3542-3550dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c004933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009100163300001600254520158300270592002801853650002501881650001701906650001201923650001001935650001201945650002001957650002401977650001602001650001002017650001602027650002002043650001602063650003302079650001602112700001702128700001902145700002102164773016002185856008102345852000902426655001202435IND60575298220221117015905.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057529822DNAL7 a10.1007/s40011-015-0586-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMridula, D.10aGroundnut Meal and Carrot Fortified Pasta: Optimization of Ingredients Level Using RSM  ap. 277-288.  aThe present study was undertaken to optimize the level of groundnut meal, carrot juice and refined wheat flour for the development of pasta using response surface methodology. Different experimental combinations were designed using box-benken design of experiments considering 10–20 g groundnut meal, 14–30 mL carrot juice and 80–90 g refined wheat flour. Pasta samples with higher level of groundnut meal and carrot juice showed higher antioxidant activity and overall sensory acceptability. The samples with higher groundnut meal resulted in higher protein content. Pasta samples with higher amount of carrot juice showed higher rehydration ratio and lesser cooking time with low solid loss in cooking water. The food materials were optimized to obtain the best experimental combination for development of groundnut meal and carrot fortified pasta. Different levels of groundnut meal, carrot juice and wheat flour significantly affected the colour as well as cooking quality of pasta. The protein and antioxidant activity of pasta were increased with increasing level of groundnut meal and carrot juice in the sample. Optimized groundnut meal and carrot fortified pasta consisted of 17.64 % groundnut meal and 82.36 % wheat flour with 27.45 mL per 100 g formulation of carrot juice showing overall desirability as 0.849. This pasta sample required 3.49 min to cook with 4.71 % solid loss and rehydration ratio as 4.15 having 17.32 % protein content, 10.63 % antioxidant activity, 301.32 mg/100 g total phenols and overall sensory acceptability score as 8.7.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acarrot juice 3acarrots 3acolor 3acooking 3acooking quality 3aexperimental design 3aingredients 3apasta 3apeanut meal 3aprotein content 3arehydration 3aresponse surface methodology 3awheat flour1 aGupta, R.

A database with matching satellite and drifting buoy observations is used to test the performance of each channel configuration using both retrieval algorithms to identify the most optimal channel selection for accurate SST retrievals. The evaluation against in situ observations allows identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the two retrieval algorithms, and demonstrates the importance of using in situ observations to evaluate existing theoretical retrieval uncertainty studies. Overall, the performance increases as expected when more channels are included in the retrieval. In particular, more channels allow a better performance for the range of different observing conditions (e.g. cold waters). The two retrieval algorithms agree that for a three-channel configuration, the 6, 10, 18 GHz (V and H polarization) is better than the 6, 10, 23 GHz configuration (V and H polarization). This is demonstrated for different geographical regions and throughout all seasons. Of the different combinations tested here, it is evident that withholding observations from the 23 and 36 GHz channels from the retrieval has the least impact on the SST performance. Overall, this analysis shows that the CIMR like channel configuration performs very well when compared to an AMSR-E like constellation using both retrieval algorithms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aclimate change 3acold 3adatabases 3aenvironment 3amicrowave radiometers 3asatellites 3asurface water temperature 3auncertainty 0aRemote sensing 0aPassive microwaves 0aChannel selection 0aCopernicus imaging microwave radiometer (CIMR) 0aAMSR-E 0aSea surface temperature (SST) 0aOptimal estimation (OE)1 aHøyer, Jacob L.1 aAlerskans, Emy1 aPedersen, Leif Toudal1 aDonlon, Craig0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 254 p.112252-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1122523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245005800178300001600236500000900252520186600261592002802127650002502155650001302180650001902193650002202212650000902234650001302243650001502256650001902271650001402290650001302304650002202317650001102339700002102350700001802371700001702389773014702406856009602553852000902649655001202658IND60668325020221121222733.0191125e199205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066832502DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1992.03615995005600030011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, S. C.10aEffect of Sorption on the Biodegradation of Quinoline  ap. 737-746.  aepub  aQuinoline is an N-containing heterocyclic contaminant associated with creosote wastes and may be biologically degraded under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Quinoline-degrading bacteria were utilized to investigate the rate of quinoline desorption from smectite clay at low surface concentrations and its subsequent mineralization. Fluorescence spectroscopy and ¹⁴C-quinoline mineralization techniques were used to compare the observed desorption rates to mineralization rates. Microbial utilization was desorption-rate limiting. Desorption and microbial utilization may be modeled as pseudo-first-order reactions whose first-order rate constant (kₒbₛ) is independent of surface concentration. The difference between quinoline disappearance from solution and from the clay surface as observed by fluorescence spectroscopy was comparable to the difference between microbial utilization of the solution and the surface-bound species. The utilization of quinoline from solution was about 30 times more rapid than surface-bound quinoline. The surface-bound species appeared to be protected from microbial attack and, hence, desorption was required prior to utilization. The desorption process is suggested to be a chemical-reaction-controlled process rather than film diffusion controlled, as is typically suggested for an exchange process. The biotransformation of quinoline to 2-hydroxyquinoline, observed in solution by fluorescence spectroscopy, was about five to eight times faster than the subsequent disappearance of 2-hydroxyquinoline. When quinoline was sorbed, however, no 2-hydroxyquinoline was observed in solution or on the surface of the clay. It is suggested that quinoline may be transformed to 2-hydroxyquinoline at the cell surface and that 2-hydroxyquinoline is the species that is transported into the cell prior to further degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3aclay 3acreosote 3adesorption 3amineralization 3aquinoline 3asmectite 3aspectral analysis 3awastes1 aAinsworth, C.

The literature contains a wide range of proposed minimal pore sizes that may contribute to preferential flow. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between h (and corresponding pore sizes) and preferential solute transport in a naturally structured soil. Tracer (³H₂O and pentafluorobenzoic acid, [PFBA]) miscible displacement experiments were performed at several h values in intact soil cores (15-cm diameter, 30-cm length) using an apparatus especially suited to maintain constant h while collecting large effluent volumes. To test for the occurrence of preferential flow, observed breakthrough curves (BTCs) were evaluated for physical nonequilibrium (PNE) using a comparison between fitted local equilibrium (LE) and PNE models. Fitting results of the observed BTCs indicated absence of PNE in all solute transport experiments at h ≤ −10 cm. Experiments at h ≥ −5 cm consistently exhibited PNE conditions, indicating the presence of preferential flow. These results suggest that soil pores with effective radii of 150 μm and smaller (water-filled at h = −10 cm) do not contribute to preferential flow. Observed pore water velocities were not indicative of the presence or absence of preferential flow conditions. Continuous measurements of soil water content (θ) using time domain reflectometry (TDR) revealed that at h = −10 cm, <2% of the soil volume (1–5% of θ at saturation) had drained.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzoic acids 3amiscible displacement 3amodels 3apreferential flow 3asoil matric potential 3asoil pore system 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asolutes 3atime domain reflectometry1 aGaber, H.M.1 aWraith, J.

However, precise covalent modification of nanotubes can be difficult. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to show that adsorption of polar molecules on the outside surface of carbon nanotubes provides an alternative means to control the rate and selectivity of transport in the pores. Specifically, adsorbing molecules with highly localized charges can significantly influence flow rates and generate selective ion transport. Strategic or patterned adsorption of charged polymers on the outside of carbon nanotubes may provide an avenue to precisely control flow through the nanotube interior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3agases 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymers 3asimulation models 3asolutes 3awater flow1 aCorry, Ben1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6324-442X0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 21, v. 124, no. 6 p.3820-3826dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b084853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245006800191300001800259520079800277592002801075650001901103650001601122650002401138650002701162650001801189650002301207650002101230650002101251650001701272650001201289650001901301650004001320650001101360650007801371650002701449650003501476650001501511700002601526700002701552700001701579700002501596773010401621856008401725990002301809852000901832655001201841IND60097819020221122002924.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009781902DNAL7 a218104182pmid7 a10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRijnierse, Anneke10aFood-derived oligosaccharides exhibit pharmaceutical properties  ap.

Human milk consists of a unique combination of nutritional components each with different characteristics. Oligosaccharides or non-digestible carbohydrates as one of these components, are generally accepted to have a beneficial effect by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species. Recently more evidence is rising for direct effects of oligosaccharides on the immune system. Oligosaccharides often used as dietary supplements for their beneficial effects on the host and its immune system, are derived from nutritional sources. In this review we aim to summarize the pharmaceutical properties of these food-borne oligosaccharides early in life.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3adietary supplements 3agrowth and development 3aimmune system 3ainfant development 3anutrient content 3aoligosaccharides 3apharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBreast Feeding 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aImmune System Diseasesxdiet therapyxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aOligosaccharidesxpharmacology 2aSynbiotics1 aJeurink, Prescilla V.1 avan Esch, Betty C.A.M.1 aGarssen, J.,1 aKnippels, Léon M.J.0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 Sept., v. 668S1 p.S117-S123dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001700161245006300178300001600241500000900257520208800266592002802354650002202382650002202404650002102426650001102447650002002458650002702478650002602505650001302531650001902544650002102563650001302584650002502597650000902622650001102631650002002642650001902662650001702681700001802698700001702716700001902733773014902752856009602901852000902997655001203006IND60668325220221121234414.0191125e197909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066832522DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1979.03615995004300050032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, R. V.10aFate of Tagged Fertilizer Nitrogen Applied to Winter Wheat  ap. 973-975.  aepub  aA field experiment using ammonium sulfate tagged with 7.65 A% ¹⁵N was conducted to assess how rates and times fertilizer is applied influence the fate of N applied to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Bottomless metal boxes were pressed 142 cm into the soil to confine the tagged fertilizer. Treatments, replicated four times, consisted of two rates (50 and 100 kg N/ha) and two application times (fall and spring). Fertilizer N used by the crop and that remaining in the upper 180-cm of the soil after harvest were measured. Amounts of ammonium-N and nitrate-N from the fertilizer in the 0 to 10-cm layer also were determined. The N balance indicated 9.7 – 10.3 kg N/ha were unaccounted for at the 50-kg N rate and 19.7 · 23.4 kg, at the 100-kg rate. Losses did not differ significantly between application times. With 100 kg/ha the crop removed significantly more fertilizer N, and significantly less remained in the soil with spring than with fall applications. The crop used similar amounts of total N in each case, but with the spring applications more fertilizer N but less soil N was taken up. Fertilizer applications caused no priming effect on mineralization of indigenous soil N. Most of the fertilizer remaining in the soil was in the 0 to 10-cm layer, with no evidence of N moving deeper than 50 cm, so losses were from gaseous loss rather than leaching. Most of the fertilizer N in the 0 to 10-cm layer of soil after harvest was immobilized, with only 9.6 – 11.5% remaining in inorganic forms. Immobilization was the principal reason for differences in spring and fall applications and for limited leaching. The percentages of NH₄⁺-N and NO₃⁻-N, which originated from the fertilizer were 4 – 8 times the percentages of total N from the fertilizer, so more fertilizer N was in inorganic forms than was the case with indigenous soil N. Since there was a direct relationship between amounts of NO₃⁻-N in the surface soil from fertilizer and amounts of N unaccounted for, it was concluded that gaseous losses resulted from denitrification processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aammonium nitrogen 3aammonium sulfate 3aautumn 3adenitrification 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aleaching 3amineralization 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3asoil 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3atotal nitrogen 3awinter wheat1 aMurphy, L.

The cell architecture explored in this report is similar to that of a dye-sensitized solar cell but with delivery of electrons to a mesoporous layer of TiO₂ by natural pigment-protein complexes rather than an artificial dye. Rba. sphaeroides RCs were bound to the deposited TiO₂ via an engineered extramembrane peptide tag. Using TMPD (N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine) as an electrolyte, these biohybrid photoactive electrodes produced an output that was the net product of cathodic and anodic photocurrents. To explain the observed photocurrents, a kinetic model is proposed that includes (1) an anodic current attributed to injection of electrons from the triplet state of the RC primary electron donor (Pᵀ) to the TiO₂ conduction band, (2) a cathodic current attributed to reduction of the photooxidized RC primary electron donor (P⁺) by surface states of the TiO₂ and (3) transient cathodic and anodic current spikes due to oxidation/reduction of TMPD/TMPD⁺ at the conductive glass (FTO) substrate. This model explains the origin of the photocurrent spikes that appear in this system after turning illumination on or off, the reason for the appearance of net positive or negative stable photocurrents depending on experimental conditions, and the overall efficiency of the constructed cell. The model may be a used as a guide for improvement of the photocurrent efficiency of the presented system as well as, after appropriate adjustments, other biohybrid photoelectrodes.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB/I022570/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  a2012/07/B/NZ1/02639cNarodowe Centrum Nauki0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3aautotrophs 3abacteria 3adyes 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrons 3aglass 3akinetics 3alighting 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3atitanium dioxide1 aSwainsbury, David J.

We tested the hypothesis that interactions between main factors associated with climate change (elevated CO₂, elevated temperature, and water deficit) decouple sugars and anthocyanins, and explored the possible involvement of vegetative area, photosynthesis, and grape C uploading on the decoupling. Tempranillo grapevine fruit-bearing cuttings were exposed to CO₂ (700 vs. 400 ppm), temperature (ambient vs. + 4 °C), and irrigation levels (partial vs. full) in temperature-gradient greenhouses. In a search for mechanistic insights into the underlying processes, experiments 1 and 2 were designed to maximize photosynthesis and enlarge leaf area range among treatments, whereas plant growth was manipulated in order to deliberately down-regulate photosynthesis and control vegetative area in experiments 3 and 4. Towards this aim, treatments were applied either from fruit set to maturity with free vegetation and fully irrigated or at 5–8% of pot capacity (experiments 1 and 2), or from veraison to maturity with controlled vegetation and fully irrigated or at 40% of pot capacity (experiments 3 and 4). Modification of air ¹³C isotopic composition under elevated CO₂ enabled the further characterization of whole C fixation period and C partitioning to grapes. Increases of the grape sugars-to-anthocyanins ratio were highly and positively correlated with photosynthesis and grape ¹³C labeling, but not with vegetative area. Evidence is presented for photosynthesis, from fruit set to veraison, and grape C uploading, from veraison to maturity, as key processes involved in the establishment and development, respectively, of the grape sugars to anthocyanins decoupling.  aPublisher supplied data  aBFU2008-01405/BFIcScience and Innovation Spanish Ministry  aAGL2014-56075-C2-1-RcMinisterio de Economía y Competitividad  aA03 groupcAragón Government  aIT-932-16cBasque Government 3aVitis 3aair 3aanthocyanins 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afruit set 3agrapes 3agreenhouses 3airrigation rates 3aisotope labeling 3aleaf area 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3astable isotopes 3asugars 3atemperature 3avegetation1 aAranjuelo, Iker1 aPascual, Inmaculada1 aAguirreolea, Jone1 aSánchez Díaz, Manuel,1 aIrigoyen, Juan José1 aAraus, José Luis,1 aMorales, Fermín0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2018 Oct., v. 138, no. 1 p.115-128dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl32702x0166-85957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-018-0552-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011100169300001600280520108700296592002801383650003001411650002001441650001201461650001901473650001801492650001501510650001901525650001001544650002201554650002301576650001201599650001001611650002401621650001901645653002901664653002201693653002301715653002101738653001001759700001901769700002001788700002401808700002201832700002001854773012101874856008501995852000902080655001202089IND60515672320221118163947.0160807e20160511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051567232DNAL7 a10.1080/10934529.2015.11287112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOguri, Tomoko10aUrinary inorganic arsenic concentrations and semen quality of male partners of subfertile couples in Tokyo  ap. 463-466.  aInorganic arsenic (iAs) has been known as a testicular toxicant in experimental rodents.

Semen parameters were measured according to WHO guideline at the clinic, and urinary iAs and methylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-hydride generation-ICP mass spectrometry. Biological attributes, dietary habits, and exposure levels to other chemicals with known effects on semen parameters were taken into consideration as covariates. Multiple regression analyses and logistic regression analyses did not find iAs exposure as significant contributor to semen parameters. Lower exposure level of subjects (estimated to be 0.5 μg kg ⁻¹ day ⁻¹) was considered a reason of the absence of adverse effects on semen parameters, which were seen in rodents dosed with 4–7.5 mg kg ⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadverse effects 3aarsenic 3acacodylic acid 3aeating habits 3aguidelines 3alogit analysis 3amales 3amass spectrometry 3amethylarsonic acid 3arodents 3asemen 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 0aInfertility consultation 0ainorganic arsenic 0amethylarsonic acid 0asemen parameters 0aurine1 aYoshinaga, Jun1 aToshima, Hiroki1 aMizumoto, Yoshifumi1 aHatakeyama, Shota1 aTokuoka, Susumu0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2016 May 11, v. 51, no. 6 p.463-466dTaylor & Francisx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2015.11287113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04449naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011200164300001600276520305500292592002803347650001803375650002903393650001303422650001203435650001403447650002503461650002003486650001503506650003303521650000903554650001103563650001403574650001803588650001303606650001403619650001003633651000903643651001803652651001603670700002003686700002303706700002903729773011903758856008103877852000903958655001203967IND60575298920221117015304.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057529892DNAL7 a10.1007/s13127-016-0317-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yingkui10aExtensive cryptic diversity in the cosmopolitan sludge worm Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (Clitellata, Naididae)  ap. 477-495.  aLimnodrilus hoffmeisteri Claparède, 1862 is a common freshwater worm, often regarded as an indicator of organic pollution. The taxonomic status of this species is controversial due to great variation in morphological features. Numerous morphological forms of L. hoffmeisteri are recorded in the literature, especially from Europe and North America. Today, DNA-based species delimitation assumes that species boundaries can be more objectively and effectively estimated using genetic data rather than with morphological data alone. To investigate if L. hoffmeisteri is a single species, 295 worms identified as either L. hoffmeisteri or other similar (congeneric) morphospecies, using currently accepted morphological criteria, were collected from 82 locations in the northern hemisphere. The number of primary species hypotheses (PSHs) was first explored with cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), the proposed DNA barcode for animal species, and with data for all specimens. Both automatic barcoding gap discovery (ABGD) and the Bayesian general mixed Yule coalescent (bGMYC) model revealed the existence of ≥25 distinct PSHs (COI lineages) in our dataset. Then, smaller samples of individuals representing major COI lineages were used for exploration of a nuclear locus, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. In the ITS gene tree (81 sequences), generated by BEAST, 16 well-supported terminal groups were found, but not all of these groups were congruent with the PSHs found in the COI tree. As results across these different analyses were inconsistent, we resorted to analyzing reciprocal monophyly between gene trees and used a minimum consensus of all evidence, suggesting that there are 13 separately evolving lineages (=13 species) within our sample. The smallest uncorrected COI p-distance between these species is 12.1%, and the largest intraspecific p-distance is 16.4%, illustrating the problem of species delimitation with a DNA-barcoding gap as the sole criterion. Ten of these species are morphologically identified as “L. hoffmeisteri,” the remaining three can be attributed to morphologically distinct congeneric species. An individual from the type locality in Switzerland was designated as a neotype of L. hoffmeisteri sensu stricto. This worm belongs to one of the ten species, and this lineage is widely distributed in Europe, Asia, and North America. The remaining nine species show a mixed distribution pattern; some appear to be endemic to a restricted area, others are Holarctic. Our results provide clues to the future revalidation of some of the nominal species today placed in synonymy with L. hoffmeisteri. A BEAST analysis, based on previously published and newly generated 16S data, suggested that this complex contains also other species than those studied by us. By integrating additional genetic data, it will be possible to identify these and additional specimens in future studies of Limnodrilus, and the neotype provides a baseline for further revisions of the taxonomy of the L. hoffmeisteri complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aLimnodrilus hoffmeisteri 3aNaididae 3aanimals 3abarcoding 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3adata collection 3afreshwater 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aloci 3amodels 3amonophyly 3amorphospecies 3aneotypes 3apollution 3atrees 3aAsia 3aNorth America 3aSwitzerland1 aFend, Steven V.1 aMartinsson, Svante1 aErséus, C.q(Christer),0 tOrganisms, diversity, & evolution.g2017 June, v. 17, no. 2 p.477-495dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1439-60927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13127-016-0317-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010800164300001300272520158000285592002801865650002201893650002001915650003401935650002401969650000901993650002002002650001702022650001202039650002302051650001202074650003002086650002502116650002602141650001302167650002402180653001902204653001602223653002302239653001302262653004302275700001502318700001502333700001802348700001602366700001402382700001302396700001802409700001802427773011102445856008302556852000902639655001202648IND60722035220221120065850.0211213e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072203522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.12.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Peng10aFermented traditional Chinese medicine alters the intestinal microbiota composition of broiler chickens  ap. 8-14.  aFor a long time, phytogenic resources have been widely used as substitutes for antibiotics in livestock production. However, few studies have examined the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and fermented herbal medicines. Here, 252 Arbor Acres broiler plus broiler chickens were randomly assigned to a control group, which was fed a basal diet; an unfermented healthy chicken powder group (JJS) fed a basal diet containing 20 g/kg JJS; or one of 5 fermented JJS groups, which were fed a basal diet containing 20 g/kg JJS, fermented with by 5 different bacterial strains for 42 days. The growth performances of the different groups were measured and the changes in the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. The body weight gain in the Bacillus subtilis group (Bs) was the highest among the 6 groups, while the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was best with Z. rouxii fermentation. The result indicated that products of JJS fermentation products of JJS by B. subtilis and Z. rouxii had important effects on chicken growth performance. The foregut and hindgut microbial communities of Bs, Zr, the control group and the JJS group, were collected for 16S rDNA sequencing. The results showed that JJS and its fermentation products mainly acted on the foregut and had little effect on the hindgut, and Z. rouxii fermentation products can increased the diversity in the foregut microbial community. In addition, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in the foregut of the Z. rouxii group was significantly increased, which may be an important factor in promoting growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBifidobacterium 3aOriental traditional medicine 3abody weight changes 3adiet 3afeed conversion 3afermentation 3aforegut 3agrowth performance 3ahindgut 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alivestock production 3amicrobial communities 3aresearch 3aveterinary medicine 0aGut microbiota 0aComposition 0aGrowth performance 0aBroilers 0aFermented traditional Chinese medicine1 aWang, Peng1 aXu, Jiaxin1 aSun, Mengshan1 aLiu, Xiubin1 aLin, Qian1 aLiu, Wei1 aQing, Zhixing1 aZeng, Jianguo0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2021 Mar., v. 135 p.8-14dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2020.12.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03744naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004600111040001800157100001300175245013700188300001600325520188800341592002802229650002102257650001502278650001002293650003802303650002402341650003002365650003402395650000902429650001902438650001002457650001402467650001602481650002302497650001202520650006302532650004702595650001102642650005002653650005902703650000902762650001602771650006402787650002002851650001902871700001602890700002602906700001302932700001602945700001402961773009002975856009203065852000903157655001203166IND4450088320221120024259.0141111e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445008832DNAL7 a211960272pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNapp, S.10aQuantitative assessment of the probability of bluetongue virus transmission by bovine semen and effectiveness of preventive measures  ap. 920-932.  aGiven that bluetongue (BT) may potentially be transmitted by semen, that the disease has significantly expanded in recent years, and that millions of doses of cattle semen are annually traded throughout the world, the transmission of bluetongue virus (BTV) by semen could have severe consequences in the cattle industry. The hypothesis that infected bulls could excrete BTV in their semen led to restrictions on international trade of ruminant semen and the establishment of measures to prevent BTV transmission by semen. However, neither the risk of BTV transmission by semen nor the effectiveness of these measures was estimated quantitatively. The objective of the study was to assess, in case of introduction of BTV into a bovine semen collection centre (SCC), both the risk of BTV transmission by bovine semen and the risk reduction achieved by some of the preventive measures, by means of a stochastic risk assessment model. The model was applied to different scenarios, depending on for example the type of diagnostic test and the interval between the controls (testing) of donor bulls, or the rate of BTV spread within the SCC. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) controls of donor bulls every 60 days seemed to be an ineffective method for reducing the risk of BTV transmission in contrast to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests every 28 days. An increase in the rate of spread within the SCC resulted in a reduced risk of BTV transmission by semen. The storage of semen for 30 days prior to dispatch seemed to be an efficient way of reducing the risk of transmission by semen. The sensitivity analysis identified the probability of BTV shedding in semen as a crucial parameter in the probability of BTV transmission by semen. However, there is a great degree of uncertainty associated with this parameter, with significant differences depending on the BTV serotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBluetongue virus 3abluetongue 3abulls 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ainternational trade 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprobabilistic risk assessment 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asemen 3aserotypes 3auncertainty 3avirus transmission 2aAnimals 2aBluetonguexdiagnosisxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aBluetongue virusxisolation & purification 2aCattle 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aInsemination, Artificialxadverse effectsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aProbability 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSemenxvirology 2aVirus Shedding1 aAllepuz, A.1 aGarcía-Bocanegra, I.1 aAlba, A.1 aVilar, M.J.1 aCasal, J.0 tTheriogenology.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 75, no. 5 p.920-932dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245011100179300001800290500000900308520169400317592002802011650001302039650001602052650002202068650000902090650001802099650001702117650001602134650001002150650001902160650001802179650001802197650001202215650000902227651001102236700001502247773015002262856009602412852000902508655001202517IND60668325720221120223359.0191125e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066832572DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1992.03615995005600040015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchnitzer, M.10aInteractions between Organic and Inorganic Components in Particle-Size Fractions Separated from Four Soils  ap. 1099-1105.  aepub  aLittle information is available in the literature on the mechanism(s) of interaction of organic matter (OM) and inorganic crystalline and noncrystalline components in particle-size fractions. To obtain a better understanding of this subject, five particle-size fractions, ranging from coarse silts to fine clays, were separated from two soils from eastern Canada (Armadale and Bainsville) and from two prairie soils (Melfort and Regina). Each size fraction was characterized by chemical and mineralogical methods. Humic acids (HAs), fulvic acids (FAs), and humins were found to accumulate in size fractions ranging from medium silts to coarse clays, while aliphatics were concentrated in fractions from medium silts to fine clays. Amino acids tended to be enriched in clay fractions of the two prairie soils, but accumulated in the silt fractions separated from the two soils from eastern Canada. Except for one soil, NH₃-N accumulated in the fine silt and finer fractions, which were rich in expandable phyllosilicates. In general, amounts of OM, aliphatics, and NH₃-N tended to accumulate in fractions rich in noncrystalline inorganics. Noncrystalline inorganics separated from the two prairie soils were rich in Si, which appeared to contribute to the preferential accumulation of humin, HA, and neutral amino acids. On the other hand, noncrystalline components from the two soils from eastern Canada were rich in Al, which may have been associated with the accumulation of NH₃-N and acidic amino acids in these soils. The pH-dependent charges of noncrystalline inorganics may also have contributed to the accumulation of OM.

Our study focuses, in particular, on the interaction of a widely used p-type organic semiconductor (OS) like the [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (BTBT) polycyclic molecule with a gold electrode, bare or functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of aromatic thiol used as a surface modifier. A similar investigation involved an S,S’-tetraoxide derivative of BTBT indicated as BTBTOx₂, showing promising characteristics as an n-type semiconductor, whose original synthetic protocol is also discussed. First, our simulations, including the ab initio calculation of dispersion forces that permits an accurate description of noncovalent interactions, show that minimal changes in local interactions can induce a different arrangement of the same molecules in contact with metal electrodes. In particular, we report a stronger adhesion of BTBT and BTBTOx₂ on bare gold, with the molecules lying flat on the surface, and a stronger cohesion of the same organic adlayers on gold surfaces functionalized with an SAM, with the molecules that prefer to form stacks parallel to the surface, more similar to those observed in the corresponding molecular crystals. Moreover, the functionalization of the same gold surface with self-assembled molecular modifiers having different polarities induces changes in the electronic properties of the Au/BTBT and Au/BTBTOx₂ interfaces, transforming the Schottky junctions formed when the molecules are in direct contact with the bare gold surface in more favorable Au/SAM/OS junctions characterized by a significant reduction of the injection barrier or even a nearly Ohmic contact when the SAM is applied, in both the p-type and n-type investigated cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acohesion 3acrystals 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrodes 3agold 3aphysical chemistry 3asemiconductors 3athiols1 aMattiello, Sara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2907-09641 aSassi, Mauro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5529-64491 aBeverina, Luca0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 124, no. 6 p.3601-3609dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b096543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008500172300001400257520108400271592002801355650002701383650001801410650002501428650002101453650001801474650003501492650001401527650002601541650001201567650002401579650001101603650001301614650002601627650001301653650002201666653000801688653000801696653001501704653000801719653000801727653000701735653000901742653002701751653002101778653001801799653001501817653001801832653002601850700002401876700002601900700002901926700002001955700002701975700002102002700002102023773008702044856008702131852000902218655001202227IND60561140520221122232444.0181012e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056114052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2017.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnofre, Janette10aIdentification of Aminopeptidase-N2 as a Cry2Ab binding protein in Manduca sexta  ap. 93-98.  aBacillus thuringiensis Cry2Ab toxin has been used in combination with Cry1Ac for resistance management on the Bt-cotton that is widely planted worldwide. However, little is known regarding Cry2Ab mode of action. Particularly, there is a gap of knowledge on the identification of insect midgut proteins that bind Cry2Ab and mediate toxicity. In the case of Cry1Ab toxin, a transmembrane cadherin protein and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins like aminopeptidase-N1 (APN1) or alkaline-phosphatase (ALP) from Manduca sexta, have been shown to be important for oligomer formation and insertion into the membrane. Binding competition experiments showed that Cry2Ab toxin does not share binding sites with Cry1Ab toxin in M. sexta brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV). Also, that Cry2Ab shows reduced binding to the Cry1Ab binding molecules cadherin, APN1 or ALP. Finally, ligand blot experiments and protein sequence by LC–MS/MS identified APN2 isoform as a Cry2Ab binding protein. Cloning and expression of APN2 confirmed that APN2 is a Cry2Ab binding protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aManduca sexta 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abinding proteins 3abinding sites 3abrush border membrane vesicles 3acadherins 3ainsect identification 3aligands 3amechanism of action 3amidgut 3aplanting 3aresistance management 3atoxicity 3atransgenic plants 0aAPN 0aALP 0aLC–MS/MS 0aGPI 0akDa 0aBt 0aBBMV 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0aTransgenic crops 0aGene stacking 0aCry toxins 0aCry-receptors 0aGPI-anchored proteins1 aGaytán, Meztlli O.1 aPeña-Cardeña, Arlen1 aGarcía-Gomez, Blanca I.1 aPacheco, Sabino1 aGómez Muñoz, Isabel,1 aBravo, Alejandra1 aSoberón, Mario,0 tPeptides.g2017 Dec., v. 98 p.93-98dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2017.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245003600170500002200206520136000228592002801588650002201616650002601638650001301664650001001677650002001687650002201707650003401729650000901763650001301772650001301785650001501798650001401813650001701827653002401844653001701868653002401885653000901909653001601918653001601934653002301950653001501973773010601988856008102094852000902175655001202184IND60682370220221122180252.0200128e20191017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068237022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcp.2019.1014712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLill, Christina M.10aGenetics of Parkinson's disease  aPre-press version  aAlmost two decades after the identification of SNCA as the first causative gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the subsequent understanding that genetic factors play a substantial role in PD development, our knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying this disease has vastly improved. Approximately 5–10% of patients suffer from a monogenic form of PD where autosomal dominant mutations in SNCA, LRRK2, and VPS35 and autosomal recessive mutations in PINK1, DJ-1, and Parkin cause the disease with high penetrance. Furthermore, recent whole-exome sequencing have described autosomal recessive DNAJC6 mutations in predominately atypical, but also cases with typical PD. In addition, several other genes have been linked to atypical Parkinsonian phenotypes. However, the vast majority of PD is genetically complex, i.e. it is caused by the combined action of common genetic variants in concert with environmental factors. By the application of genome-wide association studies, 26 PD risk loci have been established to date. Similar to other genetically complex diseases, these show only moderate effects on PD risk. Increasing this etiologic complexity, many of the involved genetic and environmental risk factors likely interact in an intricate fashion. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current knowledge in PD genetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParkinson disease 3aenvironmental factors 3aetiology 3agenes 3agenetic factors 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3aloci 3amutation 3apatients 3apenetrance 3aphenotype 3arisk factors 0aParkinson's disease 0aEpidemiology 0aGenetic association 0aGWAS 0aEnvironment 0aInteraction 0aGenetic risk score 0aPrediction0 tMolecular and cellular probes.g2019 Oct. 17,  p.101471-dElsevier LtdwJournal:3743x0890-85087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2019.1014713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245016100214300001400375506007600389520167900465592002802144506003702172650002202209650001202231650001602243650002602259650002602285650002002311650001302331650001502344650001102359650001802370650001602388650001302404650000902417650002702426650002002453650002802473650001102501650001702512700002002529700002102549700003002570700002302600700002202623700001702645773011102662856008102773852000902854655001202863IND60574094720221207060414.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057409472DNAL7 a10.1007/s13353-016-0362-52doi7 aPMC52438932pmcid7 a275029402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrystkowiak, Karolina10aInteractions between Glu-1 and Glu-3 loci and associations of selected molecular markers with quality traits in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)

The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci controlling technological quality traits and their stability across environments, and to assess the impact of interaction between alleles at loci Glu-1 and Glu-3 on grain quality. DH lines were evaluated in field experiments over a period of 4 years, and genotyped using simple sequence repeat markers. Lines were analysed for grain yield (GY), thousand grain weight (TGW), protein content (PC), starch content (SC), wet gluten content (WG), Zeleny sedimentation value (ZS), alveograph parameter W (APW), hectolitre weight (HW), and grain hardness (GH). A number of QTLs for these traits were identified in all chromosome groups. The Glu-D1 locus influenced TGW, PC, SC, WG, ZS, APW, GH, while locus Glu-B1 affected only PC, ZS, and WG. Most important marker-trait associations were found on chromosomes 1D and 5D. Significant effects of interaction between Glu-1 and Glu-3 loci on technological properties were recorded, and in all types of this interaction positive effects of Glu-D1 locus on grain quality were observed, whereas effects of Glu-B1 locus depended on alleles at Glu-3 loci. Effects of Glu-A3 and Glu-D3 loci per se were not significant, while their interaction with alleles present at other loci encoding HMW and LMW were important. These results indicate that selection of wheat genotypes with predicted good bread-making properties should be based on the allelic composition both in Glu-1 and Glu-3 loci, and confirm the predominant effect of Glu-D1d allele on technological properties of wheat grains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalleles 3abreadmaking 3aenvironmental factors 3afield experimentation 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3agluten 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3ahardness 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aprotein content 3aquantitative trait loci 3astarch 3awinter wheat1 aLangner, Monika1 aAdamski, Tadeusz1 aSalmanowicz, Bolesław P.1 aKaczmarek, Zygmunt1 aKrajewski, Paweł1 aSurma, Maria0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2017 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.37-48dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-016-0362-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013200168520117400300592002801474650002301502650002801525650002901553650002501582650001201607650001801619650001601637650002001653650002701673650001901700650001701719650002601736650001501762650001501777650002101792650002401813650002201837650002201859650002101881650001001902650002501912653002801937653002201965653001501987653002202002653002502024700002202049700001902071700001702090700001802107700002502125700002602150773011402176856008602290852000902376655001202385IND60763992920221121021112.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076399292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1145912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Mahak10aBioprocess development for production of xylooligosaccharides prebiotics from sugarcane bagasse with high bioactivity potential  aThe xylooligosaccharides (XOS, prebiotics) production from xylan extracted from sugarcane bagasse (SB) biomass was accomplished using an in-house produced xylosidase-free endoxylanase from an isolate Aspergillus flavus MG-7. Delignification of SB by sodium hypochlorite, and xylan extraction by coupled sodium hydroxide and thermal treatment were optimized for various process variables based on Design of Experiments (DoE) to achieve enhanced xylan yield (96.11%, w/w).

Xylan hydrolysate obtained by endoxylanase was quantified for xylobiose (69.57%, w/w), xylotriose (13.17%) and xylotetrose (8.377%), and XOS were examined by ¹H NMR. Growth-promoting potential of XOS was established for a probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum M-13 isolated from kalarei. XOS exhibited excellent bioactivity potential in terms of high positive prebiotic activity score, significant antioxidant activity and antibacterial activity. Efficient XOS production promises value-addition for biorefining of SB biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass 3abioprocessing 3abiorefining 3adelignification 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aheat treatment 3ahydrolysates 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3asodium hydroxide 3asodium hypochlorite 3asugarcane bagasse 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3axylan 3axylooligosaccharides 0aAspergillus flavus MG-7 0aL. plantarum M-13 0aPrebiotics 0aSugarcane bagasse 0aXylooligosaccharides1 aBangotra, Ridhika1 aSharma, Surbhi1 aVaid, Surbhi1 aKapoor, Nisha1 aDutt, Harish Chander1 aBajaj, Bijender Kumar0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Apr., v. 178 p.114591-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1145913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245011700205520182500322592002802147650002202175650001302197650002002210650001202230650000802242650002302250650001502273650001202288650001002300651002902310651002602339653001002365653002302375653002402398653001002422653001402432700001802446700006002464700002302524700002102547700003102568700002402599700002402623700002502647773009202672856008202764852000902846655001202855IND60682370720221123041455.0200405e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068237072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJésus, Pierre1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1495-365710aPredictive formulas for estimation of height in sub-Saharan African older people: A new formula (EPIDEMCA study)  aChumlea's formulas are a way of predicting height from knee height (KHt), including among individuals >60 y of age who cannot stand upright. However, the formulas were developed with white and African American people and have not yet been validated in native Africans >60 y of age. The aims of the study were to assess Chumlea's formulas in older people in central Africa and to propose a new validated formula for the same population.Height (MHt) and KHt were measured in a population of individuals >65 y of age from the Republic of Congo and the central African Republic. Predicted height (PHt) was calculated using Chumlea's formulas for the American black population (CBP) and for whites (CC). The percentages of accurate predictions (±5 cm) were compared between MHt and PHt. A new formula was estimated after randomization in a derivation sample (n = 877) and assessed for accuracy in a validation sample (n = 877).The study included 1754 individuals. Prediction was accurate (±5 cm) in 66.8% and 63.2% of CBP and CC, respectively. Overestimation was as high as 24.1% and 29%, respectively. Because an overestimation is unacceptable in clinical practice and population surveys, a new formula was proposed:height (cm) = 72.75 + (1.86 × KHt [cm]) – (0.13 × age [y]) + 3.41 × sex (0: women; 1: men).This new formula significantly increases accuracy (71.3%) and decreases overestimation (14.7%). The nutritional status based on body mass index did not differ with the MHt and the PHt by the new formula.Chumlea's formulas provided a poor estimate of height in this population sample. The proposed formula more accurately estimates height in older native Africans. This formula should be tested in other sub-Saharan African countries to extend its use in clinical practice and in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican Americans 3aAfricans 3abody mass index 3aelderly 3amen 3anutritional status 3aprediction 3asurveys 3awomen 3aCentral African Republic 3aRepublic of the Congo 0aNorms 0aReference equation 0aAnthropometric data 0aAging 0aEthnicity1 aMarin, Benoit1 aPilleron, Sophie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7146-47401 aGuerchet, Maëlenn1 aMbelesso, Pascal1 aNdamba-Bandzouzi, Bébène1 aPreux, Pierre-Marie1 aFayemendy, Philippe1 aDesport, Jean-Claude0 tNutrition.g2020 May, v. 73 p.110725-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245019600166520198800362592002802350650002002378650001202398650001402410650001202424650001702436650000902453650001902462650001902481650001602500650002102516650001302537653000702550653000802557653002002565653001702585653002102602653001602623653002102639653002302660700001602683700001602699700001402715773011402729856008602843852000902929655001202938IND60763993020221120102222.0220523e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076399302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1145922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Vos, B.10aIndustrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) in a phytoattenuation strategy: Remediation potential of a Cd, Pb and Zn contaminated soil and valorization potential of the fibers for textile production  aIn past studies, industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) has been shown to tolerate stress from heavy metals and to accumulate the metals in its tissues. Nonetheless, up to now, it remained unclear whether hemp grown on contaminated soil could be safely used in the textile industry and integrate a phytoattenuation strategy. A growth experiment was set up to screen 6 hemp cultivars for their ability to take up heavy metals in the different plant parts when grown on soil contaminated with Cd, Pb, and Zn. The potential safe use of the produced biomass in comparison to industrial quality guidelines, especially the fibers, was analyzed. Plant tissues show different patterns of Cd, Pb, and Zn uptake and it could not be stated that one plant part accumulates a higher amount of all elements compared to the others. While Pb and Zn concentrations followed the trend leaves>shives>fibers, Cd was mostly concentrated in the fibers. The lowest concentrations in fibers were found in the early cultivars USO 31 and Bialobrezskie respectively for Cd (0.59 ± 0.15 mg/kg) and Pb (1.6 ± 0.7 mg/kg), and in the semi-late cultivar Dacia Secuieni for Zn (7.2 ± 1.4 mg/kg). The late cultivar Carmagnola Selected displayed the highest concentrations for Cd (1.7 ± 0.5 mg/kg) and Zn (13 ± 2 mg/kg), as the early cultivar USO 31 did for Pb (11 ± 1 mg/kg). Nevertheless, both Cd and Pb concentrations in the fibers were far below the heavy metal thresholds for textile product safety in all cultivars, while Zn is not considered toxic in textile production. In addition, low Pb, Cd, and Zn concentrations in the shives suggest the potential safe use of this residual fraction of hemp fiber production as well. These results are promising in terms of safe use of the produced hemp fibers in the textile industry and thus of the potential valorization of contaminated land through hemp cultivation and the development of non-food value chains within a phytoattenuation strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCannabis sativa 3abiomass 3acultivars 3afabrics 3aheavy metals 3ahemp 3apolluted soils 3aproduct safety 3aremediation 3atextile industry 3atoxicity 0aHM 0aHMs 0aIndustrial hemp 0aHeavy metals 0aPhytoattenuation 0aHemp fibers 0aPhytoremediation 0aTextile production1 aSouza, M.F.1 aMichels, E.1 aMeers, E.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Apr., v. 178 p.114592-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1145923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147242013900164245005100303300001600354520134500370592002801715650002501743650003001768650001601798650001901814650000901833650002601842650002301868650001001891650001301901650002301914650002801937650002401965650001601989650000902005650000902014650001802023650001502041700001502056700001802071773009102089856008102180852000902261655001202270IND60439269120221117170804.0151024e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6043926912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10343-005-0077-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiewnick, S.10aRisikoabschätzung von biologischen Pflanzenschutzmitteln : Persistenz von Paecilomyces lilacinus Stamm 251 unter Freilandbedingungen10aRisk assessment of biological control products  ap. 163-166.  aThe egg pathogenic fungus Paecilomyces lilacinus strain 251 (PL251) can be used in an integrated approach to control the sugar beet cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii. To evaluate the potential of PL251 to establish and persist in the environment after broadcast application, a field experiment was conducted using a commercial water dispersible granule formulation (BIOACT® WG). The fungal antagonist was applied at a rate of 4 kg product per ha and incorporated into the soil prior to planting sugar beets. At day zero, 50 and 90 past application and at harvest, soil samples were collected to determine the population density of PL251. It was found that the spatial distribution after application was quite heterogeneous and that the density of the fungal antagonist directly after application was much lower than expected. Within the first 90 days past application the density of PL251 decreased more than 90%. At harvest, the antagonist could no longer be isolated from the rhizosphere soil. It could be demonstrated that the decline in the population density of PL251 was independent from the spatial distribution and the population dynamic of H. schachtii. Due to the fact that the fungal antagonist was not able to persist long under field conditions, the potential for PL251 to pose a risk to the environment is likely to be low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterodera schachtii 3aPurpureocillium lilacinum 3aantagonists 3acyst nematodes 3aeggs 3afield experimentation 3afungal antagonists 3afungi 3aplanting 3apopulation density 3apopulation distribution 3apopulation dynamics 3arhizosphere 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3asugar beet1 aRumbos, C.1 aSikora, R.

Patients usually harbor a 1.5 to 3 Mb hemizygous deletion at chromosome 22q11.2, resulting in pathognomic TBX1, CRKL and/or MAPK1 haploinsufficiency. However, there are some individuals with clinical features resembling the syndrome who are eventually diagnosed with genomic disorders affecting other chromosomal regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the additive value of high-resolution array-CGH testing in the cohort of 41 patients with clinical features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and negative results of standard cytogenetic diagnostic testing (karyotype and FISH for 22q11.2 locus). Array-CGH analysis revealed no aberrations at chromosomes 22 or 10 allegedly related to the syndrome. Five (12.2 %) patients were found to have other genomic imbalances, namely 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome (MIM#610443), 1p36 deletion syndrome (MIM#607872), NF1 microduplication syndrome (MIM#613675), chromosome 6pter-p24 deletion syndrome (MIM#612582) and a novel interstitial deletion at 3q26.31 of 0.65 Mb encompassing a dosage-dependent gene NAALADL2. Our study demonstrates that the implementation of array-CGH into the panel of classic diagnostic procedures adds significantly to their efficacy. It allows for detection of constitutional genomic imbalances in 12 % of subjects with negative result of karyotype and FISH targeted for 22q11.2 region. Moreover, if used as first-tier genetic test, the method would provide immediate diagnosis in ∼40 % phenotypic 22q11.2 deletion subjects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3ahumans 3akaryotyping 3aloci 3apatients 3aphenotype1 aWierzba, Jolanta1 aŚmigiel, Robert1 aSąsiadek, Maria1 aCabała, Magdalena1 aŚlężak, Ryszard1 aIliszko, Mariola1 aKardaś, Iwona1 aLimon, Janusz1 aLipska-Ziętkiewicz, Beata S.0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2017 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.93-98dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-016-0366-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02044naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012800172500002200300520093600322592002801258653002501286653002101311653002101332653003701353653003001390700005801420773018601478856008101664852000901745655001201754IND60561141520221120152753.0170124s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056114152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbe.2016.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWołczowski, Andrzej10aElectromyography and mechanomyography signal recognition: Experimental analysis using multi-way array decomposition methods  aPre-press version  aIn this study, we considered the problem of controlling a prosthetic hand with noisy electromyography (EMG) and mechanomyography (MMG) signals. Several dimensionality reduction methods were analyzed to assess their efficiency at classifying these signals, which were registered during the performance of grasping movements with various objects. Using the cross-validation technique, we compared various dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal components analysis, nonnegative matrix factorization, and some tensor decomposition models. The experimental results demonstrated that the highest classification accuracy (exceeding 95% for all subjects when classifying 11 grasping movements) and lowest computational complexity were obtained when higher-order singular value decomposition was applied to a multi-way array of multi-channel spectrograms, where the temporal EMG/MMG signals from all channels were concatenated.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBiosignal processing 0aElectromyography 0aMechanomyography 0aMulti-array decomposition method 0aSupervised classification1 aZdunek, Rafał1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3323-67170 tBiocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aNałęcz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciencesx0208-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbe.2016.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006500170520171000235592002801945650002201973650002401995650002402019650001502043650001402058650001402072650001202086650002502098651001302123651001602136651001402152651001302166653001002179653001902189653002402208653001602232653001302248700005702261700005602318700002502374700006002399700001902459773009302478856008202571852000902653655001202662IND60682371020221123024601.0201025e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068237102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTripathi, Chandani10aNutraceutical regulations: An opportunity in ASEAN countries  aIn today's era of increased standards of lifestyle and life expectancy, there has been a constant demand for supplements by consumers. Nutraceuticals are among the supplements in demand. Although there is a big opportunity for the nutraceutical business, there are no uniform regulatory requirements in different regions. Nations are looking to the nutraceutical sector to help keep their populations healthy and safe by introducing certain rules and regulations. Generally, developed countries have regulations in place, but there are some countries, such as those in the Asia Pacific regions or in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, that have not yet fine-tuned their regulations for nutraceutical products. The ASEAN countries involve highly commercialized markets such as Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The overall nutraceutical market of ASEAN countries is growing at a compound annual growth rate of ∼8.4%. About 40% of the ASEAN population consumes nutraceuticals on a daily basis. ASEAN countries are forming harmonized regulations for dietary supplements. This could be a big opportunity for manufacturers to introduce their products into the ASEAN market. A special unit of the Traditional Medicine and Health Supplements Product Working Group (TMHA PWG) helps manufacturers understand the regulatory procedures of these countries. Despite countries’ own special requirements, manufacturers can follow the standards and harmonized guidelines put forth by TMHA PWG. The aim of this review is to introduce the regulatory procedure and requirements for international business developers to launch any new nutraceutical products into the ASEAN market.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommercialization 3adeveloped countries 3adietary supplements 3aguidelines 3alifestyle 3alongevity 3amarkets 3atraditional medicine 3aMalaysia 3aPhilippines 3aSingapore 3aThailand 0aASEAN 0aNutraceuticals 0aDietary Supplements 0aRegulations 0aTMHA PWG1 aPatel, Ravish1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8442-03491 aGirme, Aboli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1536-16561 aChampaneri, Shivangi1 aPatel, Ravish J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8442-03491 aHingorani, Lal0 tNutrition.g2020 June, v. 74 p.110729-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl56132x0899-90077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2020.1107293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01784naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245005300208300001600261500001100277506007600288520064600364592002801010506003701038650000801075650003201083650003001115650001601145700002001161700002201181700001601203773011301219856008101332852000901413655001201422IND60574095220221207060457.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057409522DNAL7 a10.1007/s13353-016-0371-42doi7 aPMC52439132pmcid7 a277969432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚpibida, Marta10aModified DNA polymerases for PCR troubleshooting  ap. 133-142.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPCR has become an essential tool in biological science. However, researchers often encounter problems with difficult targets, inhibitors accompanying the samples, or PCR trouble related to DNA polymerase. Therefore, PCR optimization is necessary to obtain better results. One solution is using modified DNA polymerases with desirable properties for the experiments. In this article, PCR troubleshooting, depending on the DNA polymerase used, is shown. In addition, the reasons that might justify the need for modification of DNA polymerases, type of modifications, and links between modified DNA polymerases and PCR efficiency are described.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aresearchers1 aKrawczyk, Beata1 aOlszewski, Marcin1 aKur, Józef0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2017 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.133-142dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-016-0371-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05063naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012900165300002000294520267200314592002802986650002503014650002103039650002203060650004403082650002803126650002203154650001503176650002003191650002403211650002803235650001403263650002003277650001103297650001703308650003703325650001303362650002303375650002803398650001803426650002003444650001203464650002103476650003203497650003003529650001603559650002103575650002403596650001303620650001603633650001803649650001903667650001403686650004403700650003303744650002203777650001803799650001603817650002003833650001303853650001103866650003703877650002103914700003003935700002903965700002603994700002704020700002704047773012404074856007404198852000904272655001204281IND60667432520221120234859.0190919e20150318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066743252DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra03134f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVignesh, Venkatasamy10aFormulation of iron oxide nanoparticles using exopolysaccharide: evaluation of their antibacterial and anticancer activities  ap. 27794-27804.  aIn the present study, we report the formulation, characterization, and in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxicity effects of exopolysaccharide (EPS) stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs) against the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (A431). EPS is extracted from a spore-forming strain of Bacillus subtilis, VT03, isolated from the gut microbiome of the freshwater fish Oreochromis mossambicus (Tilapia). FTIR, ¹H NMR and ¹³C NMR spectroscopic studies show the presence of sugar moieties, confirming that EPS might be a glucan. Later, EPS is used as an eco-friendly reducing and stabilizing agent for the formulation of iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs). Initially, the generation of nanoscale FeO was confirmed through the formation of a black-coloured precipitate with an absorbance maxima at 250–300 nm in a UV-visible spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) planes clearly confirm that the synthesized FeONPs are in the cubic spinel phase. The morphometric features of the synthesized FeONPs are exclusively studied using electron microscopy (FESEM and HRTEM) which shows spherical FeONPs in sizes ranging between 75–120 nm; the mean size was found to be 106 ± 12 nm. Additionally, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), selected area emission diffraction (SAED) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) confirms the purity and homogeneity of the synthesized FeONPs. The vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) technique reveals the presence of both ferro- and antiferromagnetic phases in the EPS-stabilized FeONPs. Further, the inhibitory activity of EPS-stabilized FeONPs against human and fish pathogenic strains such as Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 49140), Aeromonas hydrophila (MTCC 1739), Aeromonas sobria (MTCC 3613) and Aeromonas hydrophila (obtained from OIE Reference Laboratory, C. Abdul Hakeem College, Melvisharam) was assessed. The in vitro cytotoxicity effects of free EPS and EPS-stabilized FeONPs were probed in the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431. The IC₅₀ values of EPS and EPS-stabilized FeONPs were found to be 350.18 and 62.946 μg ml⁻¹ respectively. Further, acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) staining of A431 cells at different time intervals clearly distinguishes the live cells and the cells that have undergone apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, our research paves the way for a facile and greener route to synthesize FeONPs at room temperature. On the other hand, this study also proves that the formulated multifunctional hybrid FeONPs have remarkable qualities such as enhanced bioavailability and magnetic properties. This can be developed into a successful theragnostic platform for cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aAeromonas sobria 3aBacillus subtilis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorbance 3aacridine orange 3aambient temperature 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3abioavailability 3acarbon 3acytotoxicity 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aethidium 3aexopolysaccharides 3aferrimagnetic materials 3aferrous oxide 3afreshwater fish 3aglucans 3ahuman cell lines 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aintestinal microorganisms 3airon oxides 3alight scattering 3amagnetic properties 3amoieties 3amorphometry 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectral analysis 3aspectrometers 3astabilizers 3astable isotopes 3astaining 3asugars 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avirulent strains1 aSathiyanarayanan, Ganesan1 aSathishkumar, Gnanasekar1 aParthiban, Karuppaiah1 aSathish-Kumar, Kamaraj1 aThirumurugan, Ramasamy0 tRSC advances.g2015 Mar. 18, v. 5, no. 35 p.27794-27804dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra03134f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02020naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011300165500002200278520100000300592002801300653002101328653002801349653003101377653002001408653000901428700001701437773018601454856008101640852000901721655001201730IND60561141820221123021339.0170124s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056114182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbe.2016.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHori, Junichi10aClassification of tactile event-related potential elicited by Braille display for brain–computer interface  aPre-press version  aTo construct brain–computer interface (BCI), an event-related potential (ERP) induced by a tactile stimulus is investigated in this paper. For ERP-based BCI, visual or auditory information is frequently used as the stimulus. In the present study, we focus on tactile sensations to reserve their visual and auditory senses for other activities. Several patterns of mechanical tactile stimulation were applied to the index fingers of both hands using two piezo actuators that were used as a braille display. Human experiments based on the oddball paradigm were carried out. Subjects were instructed to pay attention to unusual target stimuli while avoiding other frequent non-target stimuli. The extracted features were classified by applying stepwise linear discriminant analysis. As a result, an accuracy of 85% and 60% were obtained for 2- and 4-class classification, respectively. The accuracy was improved by increasing the number of electrodes even when short stimulus intervals were used.  aPublisher supplied data 0aTactile stimulus 0aEvent-related potential 0aBrain–computer interface 0aBraille display 0aP3001 aOkada, Naoto0 tBiocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aNałęcz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciencesx0208-52167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbe.2016.10.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147242005900168245004800227300001300275520114700288592002801435650002501463650001301488650001301501650001101514650001201525650000901537650001601546650001901562650001201581650001101593650001001604650001101614650001201625650001001637700001901647700002501666700001801691773008801709856008101797852000901878655001201887IND60439269620221120155550.0151024e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6043926962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10343-007-0139-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapst, Christine10aFusarium – Problematik bei Körnermais (Zea Mays L.)10aFusarium – ear rot in maize (zea mays l.)  ap. 7-16.  aIn the last few years in maize stalk and ear rots caused by fusarium spp. was increasing, often causing contamination with mycotoxins. Most prevalent was fusarium graminearum, mainly producing Deoxynivalenol (DON) in kernels and stalk. DON is suspected to cause several diseases in humans and livestock. In our study, injection of conidial suspension in the silk channel was the most successful method for artificial inoculation. Due to significant differences between several hybrids, it could be concluded that resistance against the fungus is genetically controlled. Intensity of resistance is varying extremely, depending on environment. The mycotoxin concentration of the kernels was positively correlated with percentage of visible infected kernels, obtaining levels up to 95 ppm. Susceptible hybrids even showed in the rest plant extremely high levels of DON (up to 60 ppm). Naturally infected plants showed high mycotoxin concentrations above and below the main ear, exceeding the recommended level of forage for cattle. High mycotoxin levels in kernels and rest plants show the importance of resistance breeding against fusarium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aZea mays 3abreeding 3acattle 3aconidia 3acorn 3acorrelation 3adeoxynivalenol 3aear rot 3aforage 3afungi 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3aseeds1 aZellner, Josef1 aVenkataratnam, Sadhu1 aEder, Joachim0 tGesunde Pflanzen.g2007 Mar., v. 59, no. 1 p.7-16dSpringer-Verlagx0367-42237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-007-0139-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009800176300001800274520147300292536025301765592002802018650001602046650001102062650002002073650001902093650002802112650002902140651001302169653001902182653001502201653001002216653002202226653002002248700002502268700003002293773012002323856008602443852000902529655001202538IND60793517720221116184205.0220917e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079351772DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2021.19580662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohd.

To investigate impact of distortion on the coral reef information, UAV surveys were deployed using multispectral sensor over two reefs in Bidong Island (Malaysia). Band-specific analysis of distortion revealed five different types of distorted images from the acquisition. This study optimized screening distorted images by comparing the seven distortion correction approaches and validated coral classification maps based on machine learning algorithms [support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN)]. Results indicate that the screening the green band (b2) alone or the blue band (b1) combined with b2 of UAV data and SVM capable of generating the best coral classification maps, with an overall accuracy of 7–17% improved compared to that of orthomosaic without distortion correction. The proposed distortion correction method can be applied to similar coral environments.HighlightsFive different types of artefacts and distortions found in UAV data. A optimized screening approach suggested to minimized image distortion. Distortion corrected data and SVM algorithm performed the best in coral habitat mapping. An overall accuracy of 7–17% improved compared to that of distortion uncorrected maps.

For this purpose, a multi-input deep CNN (MIDCNN) architecture is designed using 11 parallel CNNs; 10 deep CNNs to extract the features from all possible triple combinations of spectral bands as well as one deep CNN dedicated to the normalized DSM data. The proposed method is compared with the traditional single-input (SI) and double-input (DI) deep CNN designations and random forest (RF) classifier, and evaluated using two independent test datasets. The results indicate that increasing the CNN layers parallelly augmented the classifier’s generalization and reduced overfitting risk. The overall accuracy and kappa value of the proposed method are 95% and 0.93, respectively, for the first test dataset, and 96% and 0.94, respectively, for the second test data set.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3amultispectral imagery 3aneural networks 3arisk 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 0aUAV 0anDSM 0aDeep CNN1 aSamadzadegan, Farhad1 aDadrass Javan, Farzaneh0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Dec. 2, v. 37, no. 23 p.6695-6712dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.19596553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015400160300002000314520098600334592002801320650002201348650002301370650002401393650001101417650003001428650002001458650002201478650001701500650001601517650001201533650001501545650001301560650001701573650001801590700001601608700002001624700002101644700002001665773012301685856007401808852000901882655001201891IND60667432920221122073519.0190919e20150520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066743292DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra03146j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagh, Yogesh B.10aHighly selective fluorimetric sensor for Cu²⁺ and Hg²⁺ using a benzothiazole-based receptor in semi-aqueous media and molecular docking studies  ap. 45528-45534.  aA new chemosensor (Z)-ethyl 2-((Z)-2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-ylimino)-4-oxo-3-phenylthiazolidin-5-ylidene)acetate (receptor 1) was designed and synthesized under catalyst-free conditions. Receptor 1 was characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and its structure was solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Receptor 1 was shown to be based on an internal charge transfer mechanism with the benzothiazole unit. These results were complemented by density functional theory calculations. The fluorescent emission of receptor 1 in CH₃OH/H₂O (50 : 50 v/v) was significantly quenched in the presence of Cu²⁺ and Hg²⁺, but not in the presence of other tested metal ions. Receptor 1 formed complexes in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry with Cu²⁺ and Hg²⁺ and the detection limits were 0.36 and 2.49 μM, respectively. In addition to the sensing study, the nature of the interactions of 1 with aldose reductase inhibitor was investigated using molecular docking studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaldehyde reductase 3acomputer simulation 3acopper 3adensity functional theory 3adetection limit 3aenzyme inhibitors 3afluorescence 3afluorometry 3amercury 3ametal ions 3amethanol 3aspectroscopy 3astoichiometry1 aKuwar, Anil1 aSahoo, Suban K.1 aGallucci, Judith1 aDalal, Dipak S.0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 20, v. 5, no. 56 p.45528-45534dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra03146j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003200188245009100220300001200311506007600323520144300399592002801842506003701870650001901907650001901926650001701945650001601962650001701978650001101995650002602006650001202032650001002044650001502054650002102069650001702090650001002107650000802117650002602125650003502151700002002186700002202206700002102228700001902249700002302268773010902291856008102400852000902481655001202490IND60574095820221207085311.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057409582DNAL7 a10.1007/s13353-016-0356-32doi7 aPMC52439122pmcid7 a274656922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRakoczy-Trojanowska, Monika10aScBx gene based association analysis of hydroxamate content in rye (Secale cereale L.)  ap. 1-9.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHydroxamates (HX) are major secondary metabolites synthesized by rye and are responsible for some of the unique properties of this cereal, including good tolerance of biotic and abiotic stresses and allelopathy. Recently, five genes encoding enzymes taking part in HX biosynthesis have been sequenced and characterized, which was the starting point to undertake the present study. Association analysis of the content of six HX–HBOA (2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), GDIBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one glucoside), DIBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one), GDIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one glucoside), DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one) and MBOA (6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one) in the above-ground parts of plants and roots was performed on a population consisting of 102 and 121 diverse inbred lines, in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Altogether, 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found to be associated with the content of at least one HX: 20 SNPs were associated with HX synthesized in the above-ground parts of rye plants (AG-SNP), and 28 were associated with HX synthesized in the roots (R-SNP). The highest number of SNPs was present in genes ScBx1 (9) and ScBx5 (11). The majority of SNPs were affected by environmental factors, except for two: ScBx4_1702 associated with GDIBOA and MBOA contents, and ScBx5_1105 associated with HBOA content in roots.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSecale cereale 3aabiotic stress 3aaerial parts 3aallelopathy 3abiosynthesis 3adimboa 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzymes 3agenes 3aglucosides 3ahydroxamic acids 3ainbred lines 3aroots 3arye 3asecondary metabolites 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aOrczyk, Wacław1 aKrajewski, Paweł1 aBocianowski, Jan1 aStochmal, Anna1 aKowalczyk, Mariusz0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2017 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.1-9dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-016-0356-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015400167300001400321520140600335592002801741650001501769650002201784650002401806650001401830650003901844650001501883650001801898650002701916650001801943650001001961700001801971700002101989700002602010700002202036773011102058856008102169852000902250655001202259IND60574095920221116160201.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057409592DNAL7 a10.1007/s13353-016-0361-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMegyeri, Mária10aCytomolecular discrimination of the Am chromosomes of Triticum monococcum and the A chromosomes of Triticum aestivum using microsatellite DNA repeats  ap. 67-70.  aThe cytomolecular discrimination of the Aᵐ- and A-genome chromosomes facilitates the selection of wheat-Triticum monococcum introgression lines. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with the commonly used DNA probes Afa family, 18S rDNA and pSc119.2 showed that the more complex hybridisation pattern obtained in T. monococcum relative to bread wheat made it possible to differentiate the Aᵐ and A chromosomes within homoeologous groups 1, 4 and 5. In order to provide additional chromosomal landmarks to discriminate the Aᵐ and A chromosomes, the microsatellite repeats (GAA)ₙ, (CAG)ₙ, (CAC)ₙ, (AAC)ₙ, (AGG)ₙ and (ACT)ₙ were tested as FISH probes. These showed that T. monococcum chromosomes have fewer, generally weaker, simple sequence repeat (SSR) signals than the A-genome chromosomes of hexaploid wheat. A differential hybridisation pattern was observed on 6Aᵐ and 6A chromosomes with all the SSR probes tested except for the (ACT)ₙ probe. The 2Aᵐ and 2A chromosomes were differentiated by the signals given by the (GAA)ₙ, (CAG)ₙ and (AAC)ₙ repeats, while only (GAA)ₙ discriminated the chromosomes 3Aᵐ and 3A. Chromosomes 7Aᵐ and 7A could be differentiated by the lack of (GAA)ₙ and (AGG)ₙ signals on 7A. As potential landmarks for identifying the Aᵐ chromosomes, SSR repeats will facilitate the introgression of T. monococcum chromatin into wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA probes 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum monococcum 3achromatin 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3ahexaploidy 3aintrogression 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aribosomal DNA 3awheat1 aMikó, Péter1 aFarkas, András,1 aMolnár-Láng, Márta1 aMolnár, István,0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2017 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.67-70dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-016-0361-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147242011200168245008600280300001400366520124200380592002801622650002901650650001701679650001201696650002201708650002301730650002201753650002101775650001901796650001101815651001201826700003601838700002601874700002401900773010001924856008102024852000902105655001202114IND60439270020221121011026.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6043927002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10343-015-0338-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLapin, Katharina10aWelchen Einfluss haben invasive Pflanzenarten auf die Phytodiversität von renaturierten Flusslandschaften?10aAre Invasive Plant Species Disturbing Plant Diversity of Restored Riparian Areas?  ap. 75-82.  aIn the past decades, many river restoration projects aiming to improve the ecological situation have been undertaken in central Europe. But the influence of invasive alien plants was insufficiently discussed in this context. The aim of the Life+ Traisen project is to restore the river Traisen in Lower Austria. The vegetation development was examined in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 on 142 plots. Analysises show a significant loss of diversity and an increase in the abundance of invasive plants in the herb layer. The average number of species decreased with the rise in abundance of invasive plants. Already before the start of construction work on the new river course, various anthropogenic disturbances like large-scale forest clearance, earth movement and increased use of forest roads facilitates the spread of invasive plants, which in turn have an impact on the development of plant diversity in restored riparian areas. Since river restoration projects are accompanied by many man-made disturbances, invasive plant species should be taken into consideration from the very beginning of these projects.

The following carcass and meat traits were analysed: subcutaneous fat thickness (BF), shear force (SF) and total intramuscular fat (IMF). The fatty acid (FA) profile of the Longissimus thoracis samples was determined. Twenty-five FAs (18 individuals and seven groups of FAs) were selected due to their importance for human health. The animals were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip and, after quality control for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), only 470,007 SNPs from 1556 samples remained. The model included the random genetic additive direct effect, the fixed effect of the contemporary group and the animal’s slaughter age as a covariable. The (co)variances and genetic parameters were estimated using the REML method, considering an animal model (single-step GBLUP). A total of 25 multi-trait analyses, with four traits, were performed considering SF, BF and IMF plus each individual FA. The heritability estimates for individual saturated fatty acids (SFA) varied from 0.06 to 0.65, for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) it varied from 0.02 to 0.14 and for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) it ranged from 0.05 to 0.68. The heritability estimates for Omega 3, Omega 6, SFA, MUFA and PUFA sum were low to moderate, varying from 0.09 to 0.20. The carcass and meat traits, SF (0.06) and IMF (0.07), had low heritability estimates, while BF (0.17) was moderate. The genetic correlation estimates between SFA sum, MUFA sum and PUFA sum with BF were 0.04, 0.64 and −0.41, respectively. The genetic correlation estimates between SFA sum, MUFA sum and PUFA sum with SF were 0.29, −0.06 and −0.04, respectively. The genetic correlation estimates between SFA sum, MUFA sum and PUFA sum with IMF were 0.24, 0.90 and −0.67, respectively. The selection to improve meat tenderness in Nellore cattle should not change the fatty acid composition in beef, so it is possible to improve this attribute without affecting the nutritional beef quality in zebu breeds. However, selection for increased deposition of subcutaneous fat thickness and especially the percentage of intramuscular fat should lead to changes in the fat composition, highlighting a genetic antagonism between meat nutritional value and acceptability by the consumer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNellore 3aage at slaughter 3aanimal models 3aantagonism 3abeef 3abeef quality 3abulls 3acarcass characteristics 3afat thickness 3afatty acid composition 3afeedlots 3agenetic correlation 3agenotyping 3aheritability 3ahuman health 3aintramuscular fat 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat tenderness 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anutritive value 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aquality control 3asaturated fatty acids 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asubcutaneous fat 3azebu breeds1 aOlivieri, Bianca Ferreira1 aAboujaoude, Carolyn1 aPereira, Angélica Simone Cravo1 ade Lemos, Marcos Vinicius Antunes1 aChiaia, Hermenegildo Lucas Justino1 aBerton, Mariana Piatto1 aPeripolli, Elisa1 aFerrinho, Adrielle Matias1 aMueller, Lenise Freitas1 aMazalli, Mônica Roberta1 ade Albuquerque, Lucia Galvão1 aOliveira, Henrique Nunes de,1 aTonhati, Humberto1 aEspigolan, Rafael1 aTonussi, Rafael Lara1 ade Oliveira Silva, Rafael Medeiros1 aGordo, Daniel Gustavo Mansan1 aMagalhães, Ana Fabrícia Braga1 aAguilar, Ignacio1 aBaldi, Fernando0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2017 Feb., v. 58, no. 1 p.123-132dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-016-0360-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014400172300001300316520119300329592002801522653004001550653003301590653001701623653001501640653001601655653003401671653002901705653002501734653001501759700002601774700003201800700003001832773012401862856008201986852000902068655001202077IND60561142520221123021321.0170124e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056114252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gine.2015.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVentura-Morales, B.10aEstrategia educativa breve para mantenimiento del conocimiento sobre el virus del papiloma humano y prevención del cáncer en adolescentes  ap. 8-15.  aAdolescents have a low level of knowledge on human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV vaccination, as well as on sexually-transmitted diseases and their consequences.The aim of this survey was to explore the impact of a brief, HPV-focused educational intervention programme on adolescents.We conducted a study in female seventh-eighth grade students (secondary school) to investigate knowledge of HIV and cervical cancer prevention in adolescents by using a probabilistic sampling by mono-stage conglomerates. At school adolescents completed a self-administered questionnaire.A questionnaire was administered in the school. Very few students identified HPV as a risk factor for cancer. The initial sample showed little knowledge of prevention of cervical cancer. However, awareness of cervical cancer and perception of HPV vaccination significantly increased after the educational intervention, and this increase was maintained over time.Participants in this study showed little knowledge of HPV as a cause of cervical cancer. A brief HPV-focused session is effective in increasing knowledge in adolescent girls, and this knowledge is sustained if followed by an annual reinforcement.  aPublisher supplied data 0aEnfermedades de transmisión sexual 0aInfección por papilomavirus 0aConocimiento 0aEducación 0aAdolescente 0aSexually-transmitted diseases 0aPapillomavirus infection 0aKnowledge, Education 0aAdolescent1 aCastellanos-Rojas, M.1 aChávez Montes de Oca, V.G.1 aSánchez-Valdivieso, E.A.0 tClinica e Investigacion en Ginecologia y Obstetricia.g2017 Jan.,  Mar., v. 44 p.8-15dElsevier Espanax0210-573X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gine.2015.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245013000177300001600307520132900323592002801652650001701680650001301697650001301710650002001723651001001743651001901753700002001772700001501792700002001807773009501827856008901922852000902011655001202020IND60525707620221117094012.0190401e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052570762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Lawrence W.C.10aInformal land registration under unclear property rights: witnessing contracts, redevelopment, and conferring property rights  ap. 229-238.  aThe significance of informal land registration in property transactions and development has been discussed at length, but there are few examples of in-depth case studies of how this information accessing and collection institution relates to them and how it may create property rights. This paper examines the nature and operation of non-governmental and voluntary land transaction registration practices in Kowloon Walled City, an ideal example of a privately-planned and developed habitat under unclear property rights due to jurisdictional disputes between China and Britain and no state protection of property rights or intervention in building control existed. Based on documentary evidence interpreted from a Coasian and Hayekian stance, it advances the proposition that the contracts the Kowloon Walled City Kaifong Welfare Promotion Association (hereafter the Kaifong Association) sought to represent as a witness built up its political credibility as a representative body. Such a role not only reduced transaction costs of contract enforcement and, hence, facilitated redevelopment, but also became that of a quasi-government land registrar due to the popularity of its witnessing service, which, under specific circumstances, served as the basis for the assignment of de jure private property rights by the state.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3ahabitats 3apolitics 3aproperty rights 3aChina 3aUnited Kingdom1 aLorne, Frank T.1 aChau, K.W.1 aChing, Ken S.T.0 tLand use policy.g2016 Jan., v. 50 p.229-238dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245010600155300001800261520163800279592002801917650001301945650001401958650002301972650001001995650001302005650000902018650001602027650002202043650001502065650001002080650002502090650002702115650001302142650004302155650002902198653001402227653001002241653001802251700001402269700001302283700001702296700002202313700002302335700001502358773011302373856007102486852000902557655001202566IND60536780120221121191812.0160806s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053678012DNAL7 a10.1071/RD142452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenriques, S.10aOestrous cycle-dependent expression of Fas and Bcl2 family gene products in normal canine endometrium  ap. 1307-1317.  aDuring the oestrous cycle canine endometrium undergoes cyclical cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. To study the regulation of endometrial apoptosis and proliferation events the expression of apoptosis-related genes was analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and cellular expression of their proteins was identified through immunohistochemistry. Cellular apoptosis and proliferation events were detected by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) and proliferation marker Ki67 immunostaining, respectively. The highest proliferative index was observed in the follicular phase (all endometrial cellular components) and at early dioestrus (basal glands). This was associated with a low apoptotic index and a strong expression of anti- (Bcl2) and pro-apoptotic proteins (Fas, FasL, Bax). Subsequently (Days 11–45 of dioestrus), basal glandular epithelium experienced the highest apoptotic index, coincidental with a decrease of Bcl2 expression and a low ratio of Bcl2/Bax transcription. An increase in the apoptotic index of crypts, stromal and endothelial cells was observed at late dioestrus and the beginning of anoestrus. These results indicate that pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins regulate the balance between cell proliferation and death in the canine endometrium during the oestrous cycle. High Bcl2 expression in both the follicular and early dioestrous phases stimulate glandular proliferation and prevent apoptosis but, in the non-pregnant uterus, a decrease in Bcl2 expression together with an increase in pro-apoptotic proteins induces apoptosis of basal glandular epithelium cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanestrus 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3adeath 3adiestrus 3adogs 3aendometrium 3aendothelial cells 3aepithelium 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 0aapoptosis 0abitch 0aproliferation1 aSilva, E.1 aCruz, S.1 aSilva, M.

Regional and temporal modelling using logistic regression  ap. 7220-7246.  aThe paper investigates built-up areas expansion after the 1990 in one of the highly urbanized regions of Romania - Romanian Plain, in order to explore the urban sprawl phenomena and its temporal and regional disparities in relation to some of the main distance driving factors. The research uses Landsat 4/5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery to derive built-up areas and quantify their expansion over time in relation to fourteen distance explanatory factors: i.e. previous built-up areas, main road infrastructure, Bucharest city’s boundary, location of the urban centres classified according to demographic size and main economic function, forest land and water bodies. To estimate the influence of the predictors, the binary logistic regression was applied. Furthermore, to estimate the effectiveness of the predictor set in the variation of built-up areas expansion, the pseudo R² was calculated and discussed. Moreover, to understand the future potential trend of urban sprawl and its spatial pattern, the probability maps were generated by integrating the regression coefficients of the statistically significant predictors into the spatial modeling. For the results performance assessment, the statistic Receiver Operating Characteristic and the pixel-based comparison between the real and predicted data were used. To assess possible differences at spatial and temporal scale, the analysis was carried out at regional level, for two periods: 1990–2002 and 2002–2018. In general, our findings show inverse relationship between the distance driving factors and built-up areas expansion, but the estimated predictive power suggests important disparities within the study area over the analysed periods. Overall, the statistical analysis indicate that the distance to previous build-up areas, distance to road infrastructure, distance to Bucharest and other large urban centres, and distance to urban centres with dominant industrial and service functions were more influential to urban sprawl after 1990. Furthermore, the predicted spatial data shows the highest potential of urban sprawl in the future around Bucharest, in the proximity of existing built-up areas and road infrastructure. Because of its predictive character, the present study is to be a useful tool for land managers and policy makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aforest land 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aprobability 3aregression analysis 3aspatial data 3atemporal variation 3athematic maps 3aurbanization 3aRomania 0aUrban sprawl 0adistance driving factors 0aregional and temporal analysis 0alogistic regression 0aRomanian Plain1 aKucsicsa, Gheorghe1 aMitrică, Bianca1 aMocanu, Irena1 aDumitrașcu, Monica0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 37, no. 24 p.7220-7246dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.19674653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147242014400175245013500319300001600454520140900470592002801879650002701907650001401934650001501948650003101963650002501994650002602019650001502045650001602060650001602076650001502092650002902107700002102136773010302157856008102260852000902341655001202350IND60439270420221121010642.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043927042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10343-015-0343-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaiser, Yasmin Isabelle10aAbbau und Metabolismus von Fenoxaprop und Mesosulfuron + Iodosulfuron in Ackerfuchsschwanz (Alopecurus myosuroides) mit multipler Resistenz10aDegradation and Metabolism of Fenoxaprop and Mesosulfuron + Iodosulfuron in Multiple Resistant Blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides)  ap. 109-117.  aWhole-plant glasshouse experiments were conducted to examine herbicide resistance in selected populations of blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides HUDS.). Three populations with either non-target-site resistance (NTSR) or target-site resistance (TSR) showed reduced sensitivity to the herbicides fenoxaprop and mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron. Degradation and metabolism of these herbicides were investigated using a liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry. Fenoxaprop degraded in sensitive and resistant populations within 144 h after treatment without significant differences among populations. Fenoxaprop-P, the acid metabolite of fenoxaprop, was found in all populations. The dynamics of fenoxaprop-P differed significantly with an enhanced degradation of the substance in NTSR populations. The metabolite 6-chlorobenzoxazol-2(3H)-one could be detected in all populations 2 h after treatment and degraded almost completely within 144 h.The degradation of mesosulfuron + iodosulfuron lasted over 21 days. It was significantly faster in the NTSR than in the sensitive and the TSR populations. The metabolite metsulfuron was found 7 days after treatment in sensitive and resistant populations, without significant differences in the dynamics. The results clearly demonstrate that herbicide metabolism plays an important role in the evolution of herbicide resistant blackgrass populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlopecurus myosuroides 3aevolution 3afenoxaprop 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aherbicide resistance 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3ametsulfuron 3apopulation 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aGerhards, Roland0 tGesunde Pflanzen.g2015 Sept., v. 67, no. 3 p.109-117dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0367-42237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-015-0343-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245010100153300001800254520158900272592002801861650001401889650002301903650001801926650001901944650001601963650002101979650002302000650001602023650001202039650002002051650001002071650001602081650003002097650001702127650002102144650000902165650002202174650001102196650001702207653001602224653001602240653001002256700001802266700001802284700001802302700001502320700001802335700001302353700001402366700001502380773011302395856007102508852000902579655001202588IND60536780320221117233447.0160806s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053678032DNAL7 a10.1071/RD142922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Yanjie10aEpigenetic pattern changes in prenatal female Sprague-Dawley rats following exposure to androgen  ap. 1414-1423.  aAndrogen excess is generally considered to be one of the major characteristics of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Evidence from both clinical research and animal studies has revealed that this syndrome may have fetal origins, with epigenetics being proposed as the underlying mechanism. Our PCOS rat model induced by prenatal administration of 3mg testosterone from Embryonic Day (E) 16 to E19 showed polycystic ovaries, irregular oestrous cycles and endocrine disorders in adulthood. The methylation status of 16, 8 and 4 cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites in the promoter regions of the androgen receptor (Ar), cytochrome P450 family 11, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (Cyp11a1) and cytochrome P450, family 17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (Cyp17a1) genes, respectively, were measured by pyrosequencing. We identified three hypomethylated sites (CpG +58, +65 and +150) in Ar and one hypomethylated site (CpG +1016) in Cyp11a1 in peripheral blood cells of prenatally androgenised (PNA) rats. In ovarian tissue, five CpG sites of Ar (CpG +87, +91, +93, +98, +150) and one single CpG site in Cyp11a1 (CpG +953) were significantly hypomethylated in PNA rats, but the modified methylation of these two genes may not be sufficient to significantly alter levels of gene expression. Furthermore, tissue-specific methylation analysis revealed that both Ar and Cyp11a1 exhibited significant hypomethylation in testis in contrast with ovary and blood. PNA may lead to methylation pattern changes and the development of PCOS, but further studies are required to reveal causal relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3aandrogen receptors 3aanimal models 3aanimal ovaries 3ablood cells 3acytochrome P-450 3aendocrine diseases 3aepigenetics 3afemales 3agene expression 3agenes 3amethylation 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3apolypeptides 3apromoter regions 3arats 3asequence analysis 3atestes 3atestosterone 0ainfertility 0amethylation 0aovary1 aShen, Shanmei1 aZhang, Xinlin1 aDeng, Zhantao1 aXiang, Zou1 aWang, Hongwei1 aYi, Long1 aGao, Qian1 aWang, Yong0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2016, v. 28, no. 9 p.1414-1423dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD142923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245010900160300001600269500001500285520134300300592002801643650002601671650001401697650001801711650001401729650001801743650002201761650003001783650003001813650000901843650001001852650001001862650002401872650001801896650002101914650002101935653001301956653003001969700001101999700001602010700001802026700001902044700001702063773009702080856008102177852000902258655001202267IND4472480820221119144130.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447248082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2011.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Tao12aA maize viviparous 1 gene increases seed dormancy and preharvest sprouting tolerance in transgenic wheat  ap. 166-173.  a2019-12-06  aThe viviparous-1 (Vp1) gene from maize encodes a transcription factor involved in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling that is associated with seed dormancy and preharvest sprouting (PHS). Mis-splicing of wheat homologous Vp1 transcripts has been considered the main factor causing PHS sensitivity in wheat. A maize Vp1 gene including its promoter and coding sequence was used for Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation of an elite wheat cultivar, Zheng9023. Plants expressing the Vp1 gene displayed a genetically stable, significantly enhanced seed dormancy and PHS tolerance. A significant reduction of α-amylase activity of mature grains was detected in all the transgenic wheat plants. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions revealed that more transcripts for the genes involved in VP1/ABA signaling, such as the genes coding for wheat ABA-insensitivity, malate oxidoreductase, peroxiredoxin, and late embryogenesis abundant proteins, were concomitantly accumulated during seed development in the transgenic wheat plants compared with the non-transgenic Zheng9023. These results indicated a highly functional compensation of the Vp1 gene in wheat by an alien homolog from maize, providing a promising approach to breed wheat cultivars with improved tolerance for PHS through a genetic engineering process.  aPublisher supplied data 3atranscription factors 3acultivars 3aseed dormancy 3asprouting 3aperoxiredoxin 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acorn 3awheat 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3aabscisic acid 3apromoter regions 3aseed development 0aproteins 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aQu, Bo1 aLi, He-Ping1 aZuo, Dong-Yun1 aZhao, Zheng-Xi1 aLiao, Yu-Cai0 tJournal of cereal science.g2012 Mar., v. 55, no. 2 p.166-173dElsevier Ltdx0733-52107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147242019100169245018100360300001600541520184600557592002802403650001602431650001502447650001702462650002502479650001302504650002102517650001502538650002302553650002102576650001502597650002302612650001502635650002302650650001902673650001502692650001102707650001202718650001502730650001302745650001602758650001902774650001302793650001902806650001202825650001502837650001302852650001102865650002502876650002802901650002002929700002502949773010302974856008103077852000903158655001203167IND60439270520221121010644.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043927052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10343-015-0344-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadak, Mervat Sh.10aEinfluss der Anwendung einer Aminosäurenmischung auf einige biochemische Aspekte, antioxidative Enzyme und endogene Polyamine der Pflanze Vicia faba bei Stress durch Salz aus Meerwasser10aInfluence of Amino Acids Mixture Application on Some Biochemical Aspects, Antioxidant Enzymes and Endogenous Polyamines of Vicia faba Plant Grown under Seawater Salinity Stress  ap. 119-129.  aIrrigation with diluted seawater can act as an alternate water resource and thus plays an important role in saving fresh water resources as well as promoting agriculture. Two pot experiments were conducted to elucidate the effect of foliar application with amino acid mixture (0, 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/L as AA0, AA1, AA2 and AA3, respectively) on faba bean plants irrigated with different seawater levels (0.23, 3.13 and 6.25 dS/m as S0, S1 and S2, respectively) regarding some physiological and biochemical aspects, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes and endogenous polyamines of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) plants. Irrigation of faba bean plants with different levels of seawater caused significant increases in osmotic solutes (total soluble sugars, free amino acids and proline), phenol content, lipid peroxidation, some antioxidant enzymes (IAA-oxidase, polyphenol oxidase; PPO, peroxidase; POX, super oxide dismutase; SOD, Catalase; CAT, ascorbate peroxidase; APX) and endogenous spermidine and spermine compared with control plants. At the same time, indole acetic acid (IAA), putrescine and total endogenous polyamine contents were decreased in response to different seawater levels. Under salt stress, foliar application with different concentrations stimulated the salt tolerance of faba bean plants via improving osmotic solutes (total soluble sugars, free amino acids and proline), phenolic content, IAA and endogenous polyamines, whereas lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes (PPO, POX, SOD, CAT and APX) were significantly decreased. These results emphasize the potential of application of amino acids mixture in sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid regions. In addition, it opens up new research lines aimed at obtaining maximum benefit from the amino acids under salinity or other osmotic stress conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIAA oxidase 3aVicia faba 3aantioxidants 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3acatechol oxidase 3afaba beans 3afoliar application 3afree amino acids 3afreshwater 3aindole acetic acid 3airrigation 3alipid peroxidation 3aosmotic stress 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3aproline 3aputrescine 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseawater 3asemiarid zones 3asolutes 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3asugars 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asustainable agriculture 3awater resources1 aAbdelhamid, Magdi T.0 tGesunde Pflanzen.g2015 Sept., v. 67, no. 3 p.119-129dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0367-42237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-015-0344-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245012600186300001600312500001500328520189300343592002802236650000902264650001402273650001102287650002702298650001202325650002502337650001502362650002202377650001602399650000802415650001202423650001602435650001102451650001002462650003002472650001202502650002402514650002902538650001102567650000902578650001102587650002202598650001502620650001102635650002602646650003202672650002002704650001202724651001302736653001002749700002302759700002702782700001902809700002302828700001802851700002302869700003502892700001902927773010502946856008703051852000903138655001203147IND4465604820221120130516.0141112e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446560482DNAL7 a220009152pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordy, Paul10aMercury contamination from artisanal gold mining in Antioquia, Colombia: The world's highest per capita mercury pollution  ap. 154-160.  a2019-12-06  aThe artisanal gold mining sector in Colombia has 200,000 miners officially producing 30tonnes Au/a. In the Northeast of the Department of Antioquia, there are 17 mining towns and between 15,000 and 30,000 artisanal gold miners. Guerrillas and paramilitary activities in the rural areas of Antioquia pushed miners to bring their gold ores to the towns to be processed in Processing Centers or entables. These Centers operate in the urban areas amalgamating the whole ore, i.e. without previous concentration, and later burn gold amalgam without any filtering/condensing system. Based on mercury mass balance in 15 entables, 50% of the mercury added to small ball mills (cocos) is lost: 46% with tailings and 4% when amalgam is burned. In just 5 cities of Antioquia, with a total of 150,000 inhabitants: Segovia, Remedios, Zaragoza, El Bagre, and Nechí, there are 323 entables producing 10–20tonnes Au/a. Considering the average levels of mercury consumption estimated by mass balance and interviews of entables owners, the mercury consumed (and lost) in these 5 municipalities must be around 93tonnes/a. Urban air mercury levels range from 300ng Hg/m³ (background) to 1million ng Hg/m³ (inside gold shops) with 10,000ng Hg/m³ being common in residential areas. The WHO limit for public exposure is 1000ng/m³. The total mercury release/emissions to the Colombian environment can be as high as 150tonnes/a giving this country the shameful first position as the world's largest mercury polluter per capita from artisanal gold mining. One necessary government intervention is to cut the supply of mercury to the entables. In 2009, eleven companies in Colombia legally imported 130tonnes of metallic mercury, much of it flowing to artisanal gold mines. Entables must be removed from urban centers and technical assistance is badly needed to improve their technology and reduce emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3aemissions 3amining 3atraditional technology 3amercury 3abusiness enterprises 3ainterviews 3aresidential areas 3aurban areas 3aair 3aburning 3arural areas 3acities 3atowns 3aWorld Health Organization 3afilters 3adeveloped countries 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aCities 2aGold 2aHumans 2aMercuryxanalysis 2aMetallurgy 2aMining 2aOccupational Exposure 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Assessment 2aSeasons 3aColombia 0aCocos1 aVeiga, Marcello M.1 aṢāliḥ, Ibrāhīm,1 aAl-Saadi, Sari1 aConsole, Stephanie1 aGarcia, Oseas1 aMesa, Luis Alberto1 aVelásquez-López, Patricio C.1 aRoeser, Monika0 tScience of the total environment.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 410-411 p.154-160dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245007700156300001800233520140600251592002801657650000901685650003101694650001001725650003001735650002601765650001201791650001401803650002801817650002901845650005201874650002001926653001601946653001101962653001401973653002001987653001802007700002802025700002102053700003302074700002202107700002002129700002202149700001802171700002302189700002002212700002102232700002502253773011302278856007102391852000902462655001202471IND60536780520221117233556.0160806s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053678052DNAL7 a10.1071/RD143532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngulo, Leslie13aAn integrated approach to bovine oocyte quality: from phenotype to genes  ap. 1276-1287.  aIn cattle, early embryonic failure plays a major role in the limitation of reproductive performance and is influenced by genetic effects. Suboptimal oocyte quality, including an inadequate store of maternal factors, is suspected to contribute to this phenomenon. In the present study, 13 Montbeliarde cows were phenotyped on oocyte quality, based on their ability to produce viable embryos after in vitro maturation, fertilisation and culture for 7 days. This discriminated two groups of animals, exhibiting developmental rates below 18.8% or above 40.9% (relative to cleaved embryos). Using microarrays, transcriptomic profiles were compared between oocytes collected in vivo from these two groups of animals. The difference in oocyte development potential was associated with changes in transcripts from 60 genes in immature oocytes and 135 genes in mature oocytes (following Bonferroni 5% correction). Of these, 16 and 32 genes were located in previously identified fertility quantitative trait loci. A subset of differential genes was investigated on distinct samples by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction. For SLC25A16, PPP1R14C, ROBO1, AMDHD1 and MEAF6 transcripts, differential expression was confirmed between high and low oocyte potential animals. Further sequencing and searches for polymorphisms will pave the way for implementing their use in genomic selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3acows 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicroarray technology 3aoocytes 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3areproductive performance 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscriptomics 0adevelopment 0aembryo 0afertility 0agene expression 0atranscriptome1 aGuyader-Joly, Catherine1 aAuclair, Sylvain1 aHennequet-Antier, Christelle1 aPapillier, Pascal1 aBoussaha, Mekki1 aFritz, Sébastien1 aHugot, Karine1 aMoreews, François1 aPonsart, Claire1 aHumblot, Patrice1 aDalbies-Tran, Rozenn0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2016, v. 28, no. 9 p.1276-1287dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD143533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03597naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147242016500169245013200334300001600466520203100482592002802513650002702541650001402568650001302582650001802595650001802613650001202631650002602643650001502669650001602684650002502700650001602725650002602741650002602767650000902793650002102802650001402823650001002837650001202847650001702859651002802876700001802904773010302922856008103025852000903106655001203115IND60439270720221121011036.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043927072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10343-015-0346-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenhauer, Maria10aEntwicklung eines Biotest zur Prüfung von Herbizidresistenzen gegenüber Vorauflauf Herbizide bei Ackerfuchsschwanz (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.)

Populations  ap. 141-150.  aHerbicide-resistant Alopecurus myosuroides (Huds.) is an increasing problem in winter wheat in Western Europe. An increasing number of farmers need sequential herbicide applications to control biotypes with non-target-site resistance. Pre-emergence herbicides play an important and increasing role in resistance management. However, cases of pre-emergence herbicide resistance due to non-target-site mechanisms occur. This paper presents the results of bioassays to determine a reliable standard protocol for the diagnosis of resistance to pre-emergence herbicides in A. myosuroides. Testing was conducted to determine the influence on herbicide efficacy of two different soil types and three kinds of seed coverage, as well as analyses of the optimal assessment date. Additionally, dose-response experiments in soil-based pot bioassays under two growth conditions with pre-germinated seeds and a confirmatory field trial were carried out. Four different herbicides belonging to the HRAC-groups N, K₃, and C₂ were analysed (prosulfocarb, flufenacet, chlorotoluron, and metazachlor). The data showed no statistical influence of sandy loam or a mixture of sandy loam with sand as soil to the differentiation between susceptible and resistant biotypes. The seed coverage influenced the herbicide efficacy. Reliable results for all herbicides within the soil-based pot bioassay under greenhouse conditions at specific assessment dates were obtained. Suggested discriminating rates are 2000 g a.i. ha⁻¹ for prosulfocarb (dat 14), 75 g a.i. ha⁻¹ for metazachlor (dat 14), 2100 g a.i. ha⁻¹ for chlorotoluron (dat 28), and 125 g a.i. ha⁻¹ for flufenacet (dat 14). The pot assay was shown to be an appropriate procedure for the identification of pre-emergence herbicide resistance to prosulfocarb, metazachlor, chlorotoluron, and flufenacet in A. myosuroides. Consequently, a reliable, quick, and easy to handle bioassay which is required for high throughput screening was detected in the present study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlopecurus myosuroides 3abioassays 3abiotypes 3achlorotoluron 3adose response 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3aflufenacet 3agreenhouses 3aherbicide resistance 3ametazachlor 3apesticide application 3aresistance management 3asand 3asandy loam soils 3ascreening 3aseeds 3atesting 3awinter wheat 3aWestern European region1 aPetersen, Jan0 tGesunde Pflanzen.g2015 Sept., v. 67, no. 3 p.141-150dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0367-42237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10343-015-0346-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245009600177520202300273592002802296650002302324650002202347650001902369650001302388650001502401650001402416650001502430650001902445650001102464650001602475650003702491650003702528650001502565653000802580653002402588653001002612653000902622700002002631700001202651700002002663700002102683700002002704700002702724773010602751856008702857852000902944655001202953IND60763994920221121041517.0220517e20220420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076399492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1283362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVemuri, Suresh Kumar10aFabrication of silver nanodome embedded zinc oxide nanorods for enhanced Raman spectroscopy  aHerein, we demonstrate a facile and versatile method to decorate various sizes of silver nanodomes (ZnONR@AgND) along the length of zinc oxide nanorods (AgND) grown over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The silver nanodomes (AgND) embedded along the edges of hexagonal zinc oxide nanorods/FTO (ZnONR) substrate were fabricated by using a combination of size selective ZnONR growth and thermal reconstruction. The prepared heterostructure's structural, morphological, and optical behaviors were analyzed by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The results confirm the formation of ZnONR@AgND heterostructure with close-packing and construction of the crystalline AgND, adhering to the different faces of the 1D semiconducting ZnONR rods. The AgND size and separation was controlled by the initial sputter thickness and the thermal budget employed during annealing. Insight into the enhanced mechanism for surface-enhanced raman scattering (SERS) activity of ZnONR@AgND was ascertained by probing the hot-spot localization and the enhancement in the electric field by COMSOL simulations and experimentally verified by using rhodamine 6 G (R6G) probe molecules at various concentration 10⁻³ − 10⁻¹² M. The prepared ZnONR@AgND demonstrated a superior SERS signal (~10 times) due to localization of the hot spots at the AgNDs compared to pure Ag nanoparticles substrate (for 10⁻⁶ M). The improved SERS performance of the ZnONR@AgND is attributed to an effective charge transport within the plasmonic AgND, semiconducting ZnO, and the R6G molecule facilitated by the ability of the heterostructure to accommodate multiple hot-spots in a limited volume. This work demonstrates that the SERS activity of semiconductor-based hybrid Raman substrate can be significantly improved by effectively tuning the metal nanoparticle size and density along the length of such hybrid nanowires.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aelectric field 3ananorods 3ananosilver 3ananowires 3arhodamines 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3atin dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3azinc oxide 0aZnO 0aMetal nanoparticles 0aFESEM 0aSERS1 aKhanna, Sakshum1 aUtsav, 1 aPaneliya, Sagar1 aTakhar, Vishakha1 aBanerjee, Rupak1 aMukhopadhyay, Indrajit0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Apr. 20, v. 639 p.128336-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1283363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01075naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520018000280592002800460650001400488650001000502650001600512650002800528650002300556651002300579773009300602856008100695852000900776655001200785IND60574096720221116160440.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057409672DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-016-0447-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrichanov, I Y12aA New Species of Chrysotus Meigen, 1824 (Diptera: Dolichopodidae) from the Dominican Republic  ap. 133-135.  aA new long-legged fly species Chrysotus runyoni sp. nov. from the Dominican Republic is described and illustrated.

In Experiment 1, the effect of storage temperature (5, 15, 22, 32°C and fluctuations (Flux) between these temperatures) on progressive motility, viability, acrosomal status, DNA fragmentation and osmotic resistance was assessed. In Experiment 2, the field fertility of liquid semen at 5, 4 and 3×106 spermatozoa per dose, up to Day 2 after collection, was assessed in comparison to frozen–thawed semen at 20×106 spermatozoa per dose (n=35328 inseminations). In Experiment 1, storage at 15°C resulted in the highest progressive motility (P<0.01). The osmotic resistance of spermatozoa declined with duration of storage; however, after Day 3 this decline was reduced in the 5°C and Flux 15°C treatments (P<0.01). In Experiment 2, the non-return rate of liquid semen stored at 4 and 3×106 spermatozoa per dose on Day 2 of storage was reduced in comparison to frozen–thawed semen (P<0.01). In conclusion, liquid semen is versatile between storage temperatures of 5 and 22°C, but demonstrates reduced fertility on Day 2 of storage at lower sperm numbers in comparison to frozen–thawed semen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3aambient temperature 3asemen 3aspermatozoa 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3aviability 3aIreland 0abull 0adairy 0aliquid semen 0amembrane integrity 0amotility 0aspermatozoa1 aHolden, Shauna A.1 aMurphy, Edel M.1 aCromie, Andrew R.1 aLonergan, Patrick1 aFair, Sean0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2016, v. 28, no. 9 p.1349-1359dCSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD143693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245016900162300001400331520159100345592002801936650001801964650001301982650001601995650001302011650001602024650001902040650001402059650001202073650001302085650001202098650001102110650001802121650001702139650001802156650001002174650001502184650002002199650001802219650001702237650001002254650001402264700001302278700002102291700002502312773009102337856008102428852000902509655001202518IND60574096820221116160553.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057409682DNAL7 a10.1007/s13744-016-0438-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMollaei, M10aPhysiology of Hibernating Larvae of the Pistachio Twig Borer, Kermania pistaciella Amsel (Lepidoptera: Tineidae), Collected from Akbari Cultivar of Pistacia vera L.  ap. 58-65.  aThe pistachio twig borer, Kermania pistaciella Amsel (Lepidoptera: Tineidae), a key pest of pistachio trees, is a monovoltine pest living inside the feeding tunnel of pistachio twigs for almost 10 months in a year and overwinters there as last instar larvae. In this study, we measured some physiological parameters of overwintering field collected larvae of the pest. There were no changes in trehalose, glucose, and myo-inositol contents, but there were differences in the levels of total simple sugar and glycogen during overwintering. Total sugar content at the beginning of overwintering (October) was at the lowest level (24.13 mg/g body weight) and reached to the highest level (55.22 mg/g fresh body weight) in November whereas glycogen content was at the highest level (44.05 mg/g fresh body weight) in October and decreased to 18.42 mg/g fresh body weight in November. Decrease in lipid content during the overwintering period was not significant. The highest and lowest levels of protein content were recorded in January and February, respectively. Supercooling points (SCP) of the overwintering larvae were stable and low (ranged between −17.80 and −25.10°C) throughout the cold season and no larva survived after SCP determination. The lowest cold hardiness (60 and 0.0% survival following exposure to −10 and −20°C/24 h, respectively) was observed for in November-collected larvae. Overwintering larvae of the pistachio twig borer rely mostly on maintaining the high supercooling capacity throughout the overwintering to avoid freezing of their body fluid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPistacia vera 3aTineidae 3abody weight 3abranches 3acold season 3acold tolerance 3acultivars 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alipid content 3amyo-inositol 3aoverwintering 3apests 3apistachios 3aprotein content 3asugar content 3asupercooling 3atrees 3atrehalose1 aIzadi, H1 aMoharramipour, S1 aBehroozi Moghadam, E0 tNeotropical entomology.g2017 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.58-65dSpringer USx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-016-0438-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012900165300001600294520148400310592002801794650003401822650001201856650001401868650001701882650001401899650003201913650002601945650002201971650002101993650002302014650002302037650001302060650002202073653001202095653001502107653001002122653001402132653002802146653001402174700001402188700001502202773012202217856008302339852000902422655001202431IND60561143420221122232342.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056114342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2017.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qun-Ying10aCytotoxicity of methanolic extract of Swertia petiolata against gastric cancer cell line SNU-5 is via induction of apoptosis  ap. 196-202.  aSwertia petiolata is an important medicinal herb and has been shown to possess tremendous pharmacological potential. It belongs to family Gentianaceae consisting of about 1600 species. The objective of the present was to evaluate cytotoxic effect of methanolic extract of S. petiolata against a panel of different cancer cell lines. Our results revealed that the extract exhibited strong cytotoxic activity against gastric cancer cell line SNU-5 with an IC50 value of 64μg/ml. Our results showed that the extract decreased the viable SNU-5 cells and also reduced the clonogenic potential in a concentration dependent manner. The extract induced cell death through apoptosis as was evident from Annexin V/PI and DAPI staining. S. petiolata methanolic extract also promoted the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased the levels of mitochondria membrane potential providing a strong biochemical evidence for apoptosis. To gain insights about the composition of the extract, LC–MS analysis was carried and the major constituents were identified. The results indicated the major constituents were mostly phenolics and flavonoids. The characteristic compounds (swerchirin and genistein) of genus Swertia and family Gentianaceae were also tentatively identified and may be one of the reasons for the cytotoxic activity of the extract. We therefore propose that the cytotoxic activity of S. petiolata extract is due to induction of apoptosis through generation of ROS.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 3aSwertia 3aapoptosis 3acytotoxicity 3agenistein 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amedicinal plants 3amembrane potential 3aphenolic compounds 3astaining 3astomach neoplasms 0aSwertia 0aAnticancer 0aSNU-5 0aApoptosis 0aReactive oxygen species 0aGenistein1 aWang, Rui1 aSun, X-Cai0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2017 Mar., v. 109 p.196-202dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2017.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015700171300001800328520098100346592002801327650001201355650001201367650001101379651001201390653001501402653001401417653001601431653002101447653002601468700001901494700002101513700001901534773012001553856008601673852000901759655001201768IND60793519220221116184203.0220917e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079351922DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2021.19801182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchour, Hammadi10aEvaluation and comparison of Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat 8 OLI, and EFFIS data for forest fires mapping. Illustrations from the summer 2017 fires in Tunisia  ap. 7021-7040.  aThis study aims to assess the performance of the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 sensors to map forest fires. We choose two fire events, the Haddad fire and the Sidi Ferdjani fire, in northwestern Tunisia in 2017. Several spectral indices were derived from each sensor and the performance of each spectral index was assessed. A validation exercise was undertaken for each fire to compare the spatial matching between the burned area retrieved from each spectral index and its homologue obtained from the Emergency Management Service (EMS). Our results indicate that ΔNBR and its relativized version RBR derived from both sensors exhibit the highest discrimination power (M-statistic values >2.5). The Sentinel sensor is slightly more efficient than the Landsat 8 in mapping burned scars, but both sensors produce acceptable results. We conclude that both sensors could be a good alternative to EFFIS data, particularly when there is a need to detect details inside the burned areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aforests 3asummer 3aTunisia 0aSentinel 2 0aLandsat 8 0aForest fire 0aspectral indices 0aseparability analysis1 aToujani, Ahmed1 aTrabelsi, Hichem1 aJaouadi, Wahbi0 tGeocarto international.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 37, no. 24 p.7021-7040dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.19801183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245004900207300001800256500001500274506007600289520099400365592002801359506003701387650002301424650001901447650002201466650001101488650001001499650001301509650001301522650002001535650001401555650001201569650001501581650005201596650001101648650002801659650002301687651002001710651002001730653001601750700001901766700002001785700002401805773009901829856004801928852000901976655001201985IND4473633120221207132628.0121003e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447363312DNAL7 a226693172pmid7 aPMC34321432pmcid7 a10.1007/s00705-012-1352-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrescott, Joseph14aThe immune response to Nipah virus infection  ap. 1635-1641.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNipah virus has recently emerged as a zoonotic agent that is highly pathogenic in humans. Outbreaks have occurred regularly over the last two decades in South and Southeast Asia, where mortality rates reach as high as 100 %. The natural reservoir of Nipah virus has been identified as bats from the Pteropus family, where infection is largely asymptomatic. Human disease is characterized by both respiratory and encephalitic components, and thus far, no effective vaccine or intervention strategies are available. Little is know about how the immune response of either the reservoir host or incidental hosts responds to infection, and how this immune response is either inadequate or might contribute to disease in the dead-end host. Experimental vaccines strategies have given us some insight into the immunological requirements for protection. This review summarizes our current understanding of the immune response to Nipah virus infection and emphasizes the need for further research.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adisease reservoirs 3ahuman diseases 3aNipah henipavirus 3ahumans 3ahosts 3avaccines 3aPteropus 3aimmune response 3amortality 2aAnimals 2aChiroptera 2aHenipavirus Infectionsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aHumans 2aNipah Virusximmunology 2aZoonosesxvirology 3aSouth East Asia 0aSoutheast Asia. 0aNipah virus1 aDe Wit, Emmie,1 aFeldmann, Heinz1 aMunster, Vincent J.0 tArchives of virology.g2012 Sept., v. 157, no. 9 p.1635-1641dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1352-5  aDNAL 7aarticle03537naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245015300172300001600325520213800341592002802479650002202507650002302529650001302552650001302565650001502578650001002593650001102603650001802614650002102632651002102653651001002674653002402684653001502708653002202723653001702745653002002762700001902782700002202801700002002823700002202843773012202865856008302987852000903070655001203079IND60561143520221123003558.0190318e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056114352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2017.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukla, Jitendra K.10aEx-situ cultivation at lower altitude and evaluation of Swertia chirayita, a critically endangered medicinal plant of Sikkim Himalayan region, India  ap. 138-145.  aSwertia chirayita (family Gentianaceae) is internationally renounced and one among the 32 prioritized medicinal plants by National Medicinal Plants Board, New Delhi, Government of India. S. chirayita is a critically endangered plant of temperate Himalayas. Deplete population of S. chirayita from wild has necessitated its conservation through ex-situ cultivation. The study is therefore taken up for the ex-situ cultivation of S. chirayita in lower altitude (tropical hills) of Sikkim Himalayan region. The produce of the plants cultivated ex-situ and in niche environment was compared and evaluated as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) norms and for swertiamarin content. As per API norms the total ash and acid insoluble ash was below the permissible limits of 6% and 1%, respectively. Leaves harvested from the ex-situ cultivated plant showed lower 0.68% acid insoluble ash compared to 0.78% in leaves of mature plants harvested from niche environment. The alcohol-soluble extractive, water soluble extractive and total bitter content were higher (16.84%, 22.44%, and 4.57%, respectively) in leaves of the ex-situ cultivated plant compared to the leaves harvested from plants cultivated in niche environment (15.28%, 15.96%, and 3.95%, respectively). Besides the API norms, swertiamarin content was higher (0.27%) in leaves of the ex-situ cultivated plant compared to leaves harvested from plants cultivated in niche environment (0.22%). The stem harvested from plants cultivated in niche environment failed as per API specifications due to lower alcohol and water soluble extractives and very low swertiamarin content. The study shows successful harvesting of leaves with high swertiamarin content up to one year of the growth period from the ex-situ cultivated plants at lower altitude. Two additional harvestings are suggested from the plant cultivated in niche environment while maintaining the plant for further growth before final yield. Seeds harvested from mature plants cultivated at higher altitude are suggested for utilization for the ex-situ cultivation of crop at lower altitude in Sikkim Himalayan region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSwertia chirayita 3aacid insoluble ash 3aalcohols 3aaltitude 3aharvesting 3ahills 3aleaves 3amature plants 3amedicinal plants 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aEx-situ cultivation 0aEvaluation 0aSwertia chirayita 0aSwertiamarin 0aSikkim Himalaya1 aDhakal, Preeti1 aUniyal, Ramesh C.1 aPaul, Nirankush1 aSahoo, Dinabandhu0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2017 Mar., v. 109 p.138-145dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2017.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010000156300002000256520201400276592002802290650004402318650002202362650001502384650001502399650002002414650003502434650001402469650002202483650001502505650000902520650000902529650001302538650000902551650001802560650001402578650001502592650001202607650001702619650003702636650001102673651001702684700002402701700001402725700002102739773012302760856007402883852000902957655001202966IND60667434620221122053657.0190919e20150513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066743462DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra03191e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArshadi, M.10aPhosphate removal by a nano-biosorbent from the synthetic and real (Persian Gulf) water samples  ap. 43290-43302.  aThe performance of ostrich bone waste-supported nanoscale zero valent iron (OBW-HNO₃-NZVI) adsorbent for phosphate removal from the synthetic and real water samples has been evaluated, and the materials were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area measurements (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), chemical analysis (CHN), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and point of zero (pHPZC) techniques. Iran is the world's third largest breeder and producer of ostrich meat, after South Africa and China. The combination of ZVI particles on the surface of modified ostrich bone waste can help to overcome the disadvantage of ultra-fine powders, which may have strong tendency to agglomerate into larger particles, resulting in an adverse effect on both effective surface area and catalyst performance. Good dispersion of NZVI particles (ca. 5–45 nm) on the bone waste was observed. The contact time to attain equilibrium for maximum adsorption of phosphate (99%) was found to be 5 min. The adsorption kinetics of phosphate (P) has been evaluated in terms of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the Freundlich, Langmuir and Langmuir–Freundlich isotherm models have also been used to obtain the equilibrium adsorption results. The adsorption process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature and was followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. XRD analysis showed the appearance of Fe₃(PO₄)₂·8H₂O (vivianite) on the OBW-HNO₃-NZVI surface after the adsorption of P from aqueous media. The immobilized NZVI indicated high reusability because of its high removal capacity after the 12th adsorption–desorption cycles. The developed adsorbent could also be used to remove the P ions from the real samples (Persian Gulf water). The high removal capacity of P ions from real water and the high levels of reusability confirmed the versatility of this nanobiomaterial supported on ostrich bone waste.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aadverse effects 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acatalysts 3achemical analysis 3aendothermy 3aions 3airon 3akinetics 3ameat 3ananomaterials 3aostriches 3aphosphates 3apowders 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastes 3aPersian Gulf1 aGholtash, J.

As resistance indices, the development, survivorship, and reproduction of this aphid were evaluated on 10 rose cultivars, including Bella Vita, Cool Water, Dolce Vita, Maroussia, Orange Juice, Pinkpromise, Roulette, Tea, Valentine, and Persian Yellow in laboratory at 25 ± 1°C, 65 ± 5% relative humidity, and photoperiod of 16:8 (L/D) h. Rose aphid successfully survived on all 10 rose cultivars, although mortality rate was higher on Tea and Bella Vita. The number of offspring per female differed significantly among the tested rose cultivars, and ranged from 9.2 on Tea to 38.7 nymphs on Orange Juice. Population growth parameters were significantly affected by rose cultivars. The longest mean generation time (T) was observed on Bella Vita (14.8 days) and Tea (14.7 days) and the shortest on Orange Juice (10.0 days). The net reproductive rate (R ₀) ranged from 6.9 on Tea to 33.2 nymphs on Orange Juice cultivar. Correspondingly, the highest value of intrinsic rate of increase (r ₘ) was observed on Orange Juice (0.348 day⁻¹) and lower values on Tea (0.131 day⁻¹) followed by Bella Vita (0.154 day⁻¹). Cluster analysis of all the measured parameters of rose aphid on different rose cultivars revealed that Tea and Bella Vita were relatively resistant to M. rosae. These findings could be useful in developing an integrated pest management (IPM) program for this aphid in urbanized areas and commercial rose potting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrosiphum rosae 3aRosa 3acluster analysis 3acultivars 3afemales 3aintegrated pest management 3anymphs 3apests 3aphotoperiod 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3arelative humidity 3areproduction 3asurvival rate 3atea 3aurban areas1 aJafari-Behi, V1 aRazmjou, J1 aNaseri, B1 aHassanpour, M0 tNeotropical entomology.g2017 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.100-106dSpringer USx1519-566X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-016-0428-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001900135245010400154300001500258520160900273592002801882650001001910650002501920650001301945650001201958650001301970650001101983700002001994700001802014700002402032700001702056700001702073700002002090700001902110700001702129773015302146856007002299856010302369852000902472655001202481IND60793519620221116183928.0220917e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079351962DNAL7 a10.3791/635722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Masato10aC-arm-free simultaneous olif51 and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation in a single lateral position  ap. e63572.  aOblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) is an established technique for the indirect decompression of lumbar canal stenosis. However, OLIF at the L5-S1 level (OLIF51) is technically difficult because of the anatomical structures. We present a novel simultaneous technique of OLIF51 with percutaneous pedicle screw fixation without fluoroscopy. The patient is placed in a right lateral decubitus position. A percutaneous reference pin is inserted into the right sacroiliac joint. An O-arm scan is performed, and 3D reconstructed images are transmitted to the spinal navigation system. A 4 cm oblique skin incision is made under navigation guidance along the pelvis. The internal/external and transverse abdominal muscles are divided along the muscle fibers, protecting the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves. Using a retroperitoneal approach, the left common iliac vessels are identified. Special muscle retractors with illumination are used to expose the L5-S1 intervertebral disc. After disc preparation with navigated instruments, the disc space is distracted with navigated trials. Autogenous bone and demineralized bone material are then inserted into the cage hole. The OLIF51 cage is inserted into the disc space with the help of a mallet. Simultaneously, percutaneous pedicle screws are inserted by another surgeon without changing the lateral decubitus position of the patient. In conclusion, C-arm-free OLIF51 and simultaneous percutaneous pedicle screw fixation are performed in a lateral position under navigation guidance. This novel technique reduces surgical time and radiation hazards.  aPublisher supplied data 3acages 3aintervertebral disks 3alighting 3amuscles 3apatients 3apelvis1 aRuparel, Sameer1 aOda, Yoshiaki1 aFujiwara, Yoshihiro1 aShama, Sneha1 aUotani, Koji1 aArataki, Shinya1 aYamauchi, Taro1 aSake, Naveen0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 Sept. 16, , no. 187 p.e63572-e63572dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/635723Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63572/c-arm-free-simultaneous-olif51-percutaneous-pedicle-screw-fixation  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009300167300001600260520155100276592002801827650001201855650001201867650001101879650001601890650001601906650002801922650001201950650001401962650001401976650001101990650001402001650001002015650001102025700002302036700001902059700002002078700001802098700002402116773008902140856004802229852000902277655001202286IND4474890520221119144224.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447489052DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-011-9977-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera-Solís, G.10aMechanisms and traits associated with compensation for defoliation in Ruellia nudiflora   ap. 303-314.  aA full understanding of the ecology and evolution of plant tolerance to damage requires the measurement of a diversity of traits (including multiple fitness-correlates) and underlying mechanisms. Here, we address the compensatory response to defoliation in the perennial herb Ruellia nudiflora, measure biomass allocation patterns and relate them to compensation, and address multiple mechanisms and traits that determine compensatory ability. We used maternal full-sib lines of R. nudiflora and conducted a defoliation experiment in which half the plants of each line were subjected to removal of 40% of leaf area (the other half remained undamaged). Fitness-correlated traits, physiological traits, and leaf longevity were measured during a 2-month period after defoliation. Using another set of plants, we conducted a second defoliation experiment and measured the concentration of non-structural carbohydrates to test for root-to-shoot carbon mobilization as a compensatory mechanism. R. nudiflora showed full compensation in terms of fruit output, and compensatory ability was positively correlated with investment in root biomass in the absence of damage. In addition, defoliated plants produced shorter-lived leaves and had a greater concentration of starch in roots, suggesting that reduced leaf longevity and accumulation of below-ground carbon reserves act as compensatory mechanisms. By measuring multiple fitness-correlates and induced traits, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of R. nudiflora compensatory responses to herbivory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuellia 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acorrelation 3adefoliation 3adry matter partitioning 3aecology 3aevolution 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3alongevity 3aroots 3astarch1 aAbdala-Roberts, L.1 aCervera, J.

Blastocysts were biopsied using a Piezo drill and methods for whole-genome amplification (WGA) investigated. Results for 33 genetic loci were then compared between biopsy samples from in vitro-produced (IVP) and in vivo-recovered (VIV) blastocysts. Under the experimental conditions described, WGA using the Qiagen Repli-g Midi kit was more accurate than that using the Illustra Genomiphi V2 kit (98.2% vs 25.8%, respectively). Using WGA with the Qiagen kit, three biopsy samples were evaluated from each of eight IVP and 19 VIV blastocysts, some produced using semen from stallions carrying the genetic mutations associated with the diseases hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA), hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) or polysaccharide storage myopathy 1 (PSSM1). Three of 81 biopsy samples (3.7%) returned <50% accuracy. In the remaining 78 samples, overall accuracy was 99.3% (2556/2574 loci interrogated). Accuracy did not differ significantly between samples from IVP and VIV blastocysts. Allele drop-out in heterozygous loci was 1.6% (17/1035). Accuracy for sex determination was 100%; accuracy for heterozygosity for disease-causing mutations was 97.7% (43/44). In conclusion, Piezo-driven embryo biopsy with WGA has >95% overall accuracy in IVP and VIV embryos, and this technique is suitable for use in a clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3abiopsy 3ablastocyst 3agenetic disorders 3aheterozygosity 3aloci 3amuscular diseases 3amutation 3aparalysis 3apolysaccharides 3asemen 3asex determination 3astallions 0aembryo biopsy 0agenetic screening 0aHERDA 0aHYPP 0apolymerase chain reaction (PCR) 0aPSSM 0awhole genome amplification1 aPenedo, M.

Thompson seedless  ap. 463-475.  aPostharvest life of table grapes is usually shortened by berry softening, berry drop, stem browning, fungal decay. Salicylic acid reduces fruit respiration and ethylene biosynthesis, during storage of fruits. Similarly, application of oxalic acid is a secure and hopeful postharvest handling technology for keeping quality and prolonging storage life of fruit. To study the effect of Salicylic acid and oxalic acid in enhancing the quality and extending the shelf life of grape, the present investigation was conducted. The grape berries were treated with Oxalic acid (OA) (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mM) and Salicylic acid (SA) (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 mM). The treatments were compared within 16th days at an interval of 4 days. Among the treatments, SA (2 mM) showed superiority in different quality attributing characters like physiological loss in weight (PLW), berry firmness, rachis browning, berry appearance, fungal decay, berry shattering, TSS, ascorbic acid, titratable acidity, total sugars, reducing sugars, TSS: acid ratio, taste, overall acceptability and shelf life. Hence, SA (2 mM) can be used as an effective strategy for maintaining quality of table grapes.  aFUNDING The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author(s) received financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article from Mizoram University, Aizawl, Mizoram, India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aascorbic acid 3acell respiration 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3afood science 3afruits 3afungi 3agrapes 3aoxalic acid 3asalicylic acid 3ashelf life 3ataste 3atechnology 3atitratable acidity 0aquality1 aMarak, Tangkasil0 tFood science and technology international.g2022 Sept., v. 28, no. 6 p.463-475dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1532-17387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/108201322110206123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02278naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245009700168300001600265520098500281592002801266650001101294650002001305650001501325650001601340650002001356650001801376650001601394650001901410650002001429650002601449650001201475650001601487651001001503653003301513653002101546653001901567653001801586653001601604700001901620773009501639856008901734852000901823655001201832IND60525709320221117093708.0190401e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052570932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yong10aLand arrangements for rural–urban migrant workers in China: Findings from Jiangsu Province  ap. 262-267.  aA massive amount of rural labor in China has migrated to urban areas and transferred to non-agricultural employment. This has resulted in issues regarding how to effectively arrange land that was contracted to them under the household contract responsibility system. Using survey data collected in Jiangsu Province and a multinomial logit model, this article discusses three methods of land arrangement utilized by rural–urban migrant workers (family farming, land transfer and abandonment) and examines the correlates of land arrangement methods. We find that there is a significantly positive relation between family size and the family farming option. The improvements in human capital, higher wages, greater job stability, and a longer commute time between migrants’ cities of employment and their hometown are significantly correlated with land transfer or abandonment. These findings can elucidate China’s land policy in the context of massive rural–urban migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adata collection 3aemployment 3afamily size 3afarming systems 3ahuman capital 3aland policy 3alogit analysis 3amigrant workers 3arural urban migration 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aChina 0aRural–urban migrant worker 0aLand arrangement 0aFamily farming 0aLand transfer 0aAbandonment1 aJiang, Quanbao0 tLand use policy.g2016 Jan., v. 50 p.262-267dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008900168300001800257520158100275592002801856650002201884650001801906650002301924650002301947650001601970650001601986650002202002650001502024650001902039650001302058650001202071650001402083650001402097700001402111700001402125700001902139700001502158700001602173773012702189856008102316852000902397655001202406IND60574097820221116160448.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057409782DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-016-7790-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chengcheng10aDirected evolution of mandelate racemase by a novel high-throughput screening method  ap. 1063-1072.  aOptically pure methyl (R)-o-chloromandelate and (R)-acetyl-o-mandelic acid are key intermediates for the synthesis of (S)-clopidogrel, which could be prepared with 100 % theoretical yield by sequential hydrolysis and racemization. At the moment, efficient sequential hydrolysis and racemization are hindered by the low catalytic activity of mandelate racemase (MR) toward (S)-o-chloromandelic acid ((S)-2-CMA). In the present work, we proposed to improve the catalytic performance of MR toward (S)-2-CMA by directed evolution and developed an enantioselective oxidation system for high-throughput screening (HTS) of MR libraries. Based on this HTS method, a triple mutant V22I/V29I/Y54F (MRDE1) with 3.5-fold greater relative activity as compared to the native MR was obtained. Kinetic analysis indicated that the enhanced catalytic efficiency mainly arose from the elevated k cₐₜ. Further insight into the source of improved catalytic activity was gained by molecular simulations, finding that substrate binding and product release were possibly made easier by decreased steric bulk and increased hydrophobicity of substrate binding sites. In addition, the substrate (S)-2-CMA in the enzyme-substrate complex of MRDE1 seemed to have a lower binding free energy comparing with the complex of wild-type MR. The HTS method developed in this work and the successful directed evolution of MR based on this method provide an example for racemase engineering and may inspire directed evolution of other racemases toward enhanced catalytic performance on non-natural substrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abinding sites 3acatalytic activity 3adirected evolution 3aenantiomers 3aengineering 3aenzyme substrates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3akinetics 3amutants 3aoxidation 3ascreening1 aYe, Lidan1 aGu, Jiali1 aYang, Xiaohong1 aLi, Aipeng1 aYu, Hongwei0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2017 Feb., v. 101, no. 3 p.1063-1072dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7790-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245007200181300001600253500001900269520122500288592002801513650001301541650001001554650001201564650001101576650001001587650003101597650001401628650000901642651001401651651001201665651000901677651001201686653002001698653001301718700001901731700002001750773010201770856008501872852000901957655001201966IND60695541520221119163702.0200517e20170304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069554152DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2017.13000872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpirin, Vi︠a︡cheslav,10aStudies in the Antrodia serialis group (Polyporales, Basidiomycota)  ap. 217-230.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTaxonomy and phylogeny of the Antrodia serialis group are revised with morphological, ecological, and geographic data, partial translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1) gene sequences, and nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-28S sequences. The group contains 13 species found in boreal and temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. The species are limited to certain geographic areas within Eurasia and North America. The traditional morphology-based concept of A. serialis covers at least four closely related species: A. serialis s. str. in Eurasia, A. angusta, sp. nov., in East Asia, A. serrata, sp. nov., in the American Northeast, and A. calcitrosa, sp. nov., in the American Northwest. They all are associated mostly with Picea spp. and show small, but stable morphological differences from each other. In addition, A. morganii, comb. nov., inhabiting wood of Populus spp., occurs in North America, and Antrodia alaskana, comb. nov., a large-pored species, macroscopically similar to A. variiformis, is distributed along the Pacific coast of North America. The pine-dwelling A. flavimontis, sp. nov., similar to A. primaeva from Eurasia, is so far known only from the eastern part of the Rocky Mountains (Utah and Wyoming).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntrodia 3aPicea 3aPopulus 3acoasts 3agenes 3apeptide elongation factors 3aphylogeny 3awood 3aEast Asia 3aEurasia 3aUtah 3aWyoming 0aBrown-rot fungi 0ataxonomy1 aVlasák, Josef1 aMiettinen, Otto0 tMycologia.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 109, no. 2 p.217-230dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2017.13000873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011700161300001800278520126200296592002801558650001401586650002101600650002201621650001201643650001901655650001701674650001001691650001101701653002001712653002201732653001801754653002001772653001401792700001801806773012401824856008001948852000902028655001202037IND60528263620221120171643.0160716e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052826362DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b011412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCopic, Davor10aCorrugated Paraffin Nanocomposite Films as Large Stroke Thermal Actuators and Self-Activating Thermal Interfaces  ap. 8218-8224.  aHigh performance active materials are of rapidly growing interest for applications including soft robotics, microfluidic systems, and morphing composites. In particular, paraffin wax has been used to actuate miniature pumps, solenoid valves, and composite fibers, yet its deployment is typically limited by the need for external volume constraint. We demonstrate that compact, high-performance paraffin actuators can be made by confining paraffin within vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) films. This large-stroke vertical actuation is enabled by strong capillary interaction between paraffin and CNTs and by engineering the CNT morphology by mechanical compression before capillary-driven infiltration of the molten paraffin. The maximum actuation strain of the corrugated CNT-paraffin films (∼0.02−0.2) is comparable to natural muscle, yet the maximum stress is limited to ∼10 kPa by collapse of the CNT network. We also show how a CNT–paraffin film can serve as a self-activating thermal interface that closes a gap when it is heated. These new CNT–paraffin film actuators could be produced by large-area CNT growth, infiltration, and lamination methods, and are attractive for use in miniature systems due to their self-contained design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3acarbon nanotubes 3afilms (materials) 3amuscles 3ananocomposites 3aparaffin wax 3apumps 3arobots 0aactive material 0athermal interface 0ananocomposite 0acarbon nanotube 0amechanics1 aHart, A.

Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) antagonists stimulate endogenous PTH secretion through CaSR on the surface of parathyroid cells and thereby may be anabolic agents for osteoporosis. JTT-305 is a potent oral short-acting CaSR antagonist and transiently stimulates endogenous PTH secretion. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of JTT-305 on PTH secretion and bone in ovariectomized rats. Female rats, immediately after ovariectomy (OVX), were orally administered vehicle or JTT-305 (0.3, 1, or 3mg/kg) for 12weeks. The serum PTH concentrations were transiently elevated with increasing doses of JTT-305. In the proximal tibia, JTT-305 prevented OVX-induced decreases in both the cancellous and total bone mineral density (BMD) except for the 0.3mg/kg dose. At the 3mg/kg dose, JTT-305 increased the mineralizing surface and bone formation rate in histomorphometry. The efficacy of JTT-305 at the 3mg/kg dose on the BMD corresponded to that of exogenous rat PTH1–84 injection at doses between 3 and 10μg/kg. In conclusion, JTT-305 stimulated endogenous transient PTH secretion and bone formation, and consequently prevented bone loss in OVX rats. These results suggest that JTT-305 is orally active and has the potential to be an anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantagonists 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone formation 3abone resorption 3ahumans 3amineralization 3aoral administration 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3aparathyroid hormone 3apharmacology 3arats 3asecretion 3atibia 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aBenzoatesxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aCOS Cells 2aChlorocebus aethiops. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aOsteogenesisxdrug effects 2aOvariectomy 2aParathyroid Hormonexsecretion. 2aPropanolaminesxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Calcium-Sensingxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxpharmacology1 aNakagawa, Takashi1 aMatsuo, Yushi1 aIshida, Yuji1 aOkamoto, Yoshihisa1 aHayashi, Mikio0 tEuropean journal of pharmacology.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 668, no. 1-2 p.331-336dElsevier B.V.x0014-29997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02517naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245016900199300001800368520095800386592002801344650002201372650002201394650001201416650002901428650002301457650000701480650001101487653000901498653002101507653001901528653002401547700005501571700001401626700001801640700002101658700002601679700001501705700005901720700005601779773014701835856008001982852000902062655001202071IND60683903720221118053315.0200213e20200119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068390372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.0c002002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Junhe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7321-020710aInteraction of (−)-Epigallocatechin Gallate and Deoxyosones Blocking the Subsequent Maillard Reaction and Improving the Yield of N-(1-Deoxy-d-xylulos-1-yl)alanine  ap. 1714-1724.  a(−)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) had a significant effect on Maillard reaction intermediate formation in the xylose/alanine model system. A trapping effect of EGCG on the reactive deoxyosones was observed to change the reaction pathways. The rate constant of Amadori rearrangement product (ARP) conversion to deoxyosones was decreased with EGCG addition, indicating an inhibition of ARP degradation. Dehydration improved the ARP formation during the thermal reaction and synergistically improved the yield of ARP with the EGCG trapping effect on the deoxyosones. Additionally, EGCG decreased the activation energy for the conversion of xylose/alanine to ARP (from 77.8 to 62.8 kJ/mol) and in turn accelerated the ARP formation. The effect of EGCG was further facilitated at the optimal conditions of 90 °C, at pH 7.5, and a molar ratio of xylose to alanine of 2:1, which improved the yield of ARP (N-(1-deoxy-d-xylulos-1-yl)alanine) from 2 to 95%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aactivation energy 3aalanine 3aepigallocatechin gallate 3amodel food systems 3apH 3axylose 0aEGCG 0aAmadori compound 0adeoxypentosone 0abrowning inhibition1 aCui, Heping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0183-00951 aTang, Wei1 aHayat, Khizar1 aHussain, Shahzad1 aTahir, Muhammad Usman1 aGao, Yahui1 aZhang, Xiaoming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1673-60261 aHo, Chi-Tang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8273-20850 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Jan. 19, v. 68, no. 6 p.1714-1724dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c002003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010000172300001600272500001900288520094000307592002801247596002501275596009601300596002401396650002001420650001501440650001101455650003301466650001601499650001401515650002501529651001301554653001801567653001701585653001301602700002201615700002601637700002701663773010201690856008501792852000901877655001201886IND60695541820221119163626.0200517e20170304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069554182DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2017.13022552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzevedo, Egídia10aLulworthia atlantica: a new species supported by molecular phylogeny and morphological analysis  ap. 287-295.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study presents morphological and molecular evidence for the establishment of a new species of Lulworthia based on the evaluation of 11 isolates of Lulworthiales collected in two marinas on the west coast of Portugal initially classified as Lulworthia sp.

The isolates consistently grouped together in a distinct and highly supported clade; all other Lulworthiales analyzed, including the available sequences of Lulworthia spp., segregated separately. These results were supported by common and distinctive morphological characters and enabled recognition and description of the new species Lulworthia atlantica.

The accumulation of red ink was introduced as damage determination, the vines and mesophyll cells of the plants treated with high concentration of FA were acutely stained to a deep red colour, and the quantity of red ink in the shoots and roots was significantly increased. The leaf plasma membrane H⁺-ATPase was significantly inhibited after treatment with FA. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy and electrolyte leakage experiments revealed severe FA-induced injury to leaf cell membranes. The membrane injury and wilt in the leaves of FA-treated plants disturbed the water status, and the leaf water potential was significantly decreased. The present results suggested that FA inhibits the leaf plasma membrane H⁺-ATPase and reduce the cell membrane integrity of cucumber seedlings, thus leading to leaf wilting and a reduction of the leaf water potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3acucumbers 3afusaric acid 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3aplasma membrane 3aroots 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avines 3awilting1 aLing, Ning1 aDong, Xian1 aLiu, Xiaokang1 aShen, Qirong1 aGuo, Shiwei0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2014 Jan., v. 138, no. 1 p.103-112dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-013-0306-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03283naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005900146245025000205300001800455520131700473592002801790650002201818650001301840650002201853650001501875650003601890650001401926650003401940650004601974650002202020650004302042650001302085650003202098650001102130650004402141650001902185650001602204650001402220650001002234650001302244650001402257653001002271653003902281653002502320700001902345700001502364700001902379700001602398700001902414700001802433700001802451773014702469856008002616852000902696655001202705IND60683903920221118053417.0200213e20200127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068390392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b048712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Zheng-Hong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6136-299410aPreparative Isolation of Piceatannol Derivatives from Passion Fruit (Passiflora edulis) Seeds by High-Speed Countercurrent Chromatography Combined with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography and Screening for α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities  ap. 1555-1562.  aPassiflora edulis Sims (passion fruit) seeds are often discarded as byproducts during juice processing. In fact, the seeds are of considerable commercial value in the food and cosmetics industry because of their rich polyphenols, especially piceatannol. In this study, high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) was applied for the separation of stilbene polyphenols from passion fruit seeds. The n-hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (1:2:1:2.8, v/v) was found to be the optimum two-phase solvent for the preparation of two major stilbenes, scirpusin B (8) and piceatannol (9) with purities of 90.2% and 94.8%, respectively. In addition, a continuous semipreparative HPLC was applied to further purify the HSCCC fractions containing minor stilbenes and obtain four new piceatannol derivatives (1–4) along with three known ones (5–7). The structures of these new compounds were determined using spectroscopic methods, including NMR, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), and circular dichroism (CD). The isolated compounds were evaluated for α-glucosidase inhibitory activities in vitro. The result suggested that all of them exhibited more significant activity than acarbose, and passiflorinol B (2) had the strongest activity, with a IC₅₀ value of 1.7 μM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPassiflora edulis 3aacarbose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3abyproducts 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acosmetics 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aenzyme inhibition 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ajuices 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apassion fruits 3apolyphenols 3ascreening 3aseeds 3asolvents 3astilbenes 0aHSCCC 0aα-glucosidase inhibitory activity 0apassiflorinols A−D1 aNing, De-Sheng1 aFu, Yu-Xia1 aLi, Dian-peng,1 aZou, Zhi-Qi1 aXie, Yun-Chang1 aYu, Lingling,1 aLi, Lian-Chun0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Jan. 27, v. 68, no. 6 p.1555-1562dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b048713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008800168300001800256520187400274592002802148650001602176650001202192650001002204650001902214650001402233650000902247650001302256650001702269650002402286650003902310650003002349650002202379650001602401650004002417650001002457700001302467700001202480700002002492700001402512700001302526700001702539700001702556700001802573700001502591700001502606700001202621700001702633700001702650700002102667700002002688773012102708856008102829852000902910655001202919IND60575294020221117015823.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057529402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-017-2878-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ling-Ling10aTransposon insertion resulted in the silencing of Wx-B1n in Chinese wheat landraces  ap. 1321-1330.  aKEY MESSAGE: A novel Wx-B1 allele was characterized; a transposon insertion resulted in the loss of its function, which is different from the previously reported gene silencing mechanisms at the Wx-B1 locus. The waxy protein composition of 53 Chinese wheat landraces was analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; of these, 10 did not show the expression of Wx-A1 (four accession) or Wx-B1 (six accessions) protein. The results of molecular marker detection revealed that the Wx-B1 allele (Wx-B1n) showed normal expression, inconsistent with the findings of SDS-PAGE for the Xiaobaipi accession. Further cloning of the 9160-bp region covering the Wx-B1 coding region and 3′-downstream region revealed that a 2178-bp transposon fragment had been inserted at 2462 bp within the tenth exon of Wx-B1n ORF, leading to the absence of Wx-B1 protein. Sequence analysis indicated that the insertion possessed the structural features of invert repeat and target repeat elements, we deduced that it was a transposon. Further PCR analysis revealed that this fragment had moved, but not copied itself, from 3B chromosome to the current location in Wx-B1n. Therefore, the reason for the inactivation of Wx-B1n was considerably different from those for the inactivation of Wx-B1b, Wx-B1k, and Wx-B1m; to our knowledge, this kind of structural mutation has never been reported in Wx-B1 alleles. This novel allele is interesting, because it was not associated with the deletion of other quality-related genes included in the 67 kb region lost with the common null allele Wx-B1b. The null Wx-B1n might be useful for investigating gene inactivation and expression as well as for enriching the genetic resource pool for the modification of the amylose/amylopectin ratio, thereby improving wheat quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3aexons 3agene silencing 3alandraces 3aloci 3amutation 3anull alleles 3aopen reading frames 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atransposons 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 3awheat1 aChen, Hu1 aLuo, Mi1 aZhang, Xiao-Wei1 aDeng, Mei1 aMa, Jian1 aQi, Peng-Fei1 aWang, Ji-Rui1 aChen, Guo-Yue1 aLiu, Ya-Xi1 aPu, Zhi-En1 aLi, Wei1 aLan, Xiu-Jin1 aWei, Yuming,1 aZheng, You-Liang1 aJiang, Qian-Tao0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2017 June, v. 130, no. 6 p.1321-1330dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-017-2878-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010200172520170700274592002801981650001702009650003002026650003502056650003702091650001302128650003102141650001702172650003602189653003102225653001802256653002102274653002202295653002502317700001902342700002002361700001902381700002002400700002002420700001702440700001902457700001802476700001902494700002102513773009802534856008202632852000902714655001202723IND60722029020221120142217.0220830e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072202902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1189522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYusuf, Issa Olakunle10aFGF9 induces neurite outgrowth upon ERK signaling in knock-in striatal Huntington's disease cells  aHuntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes deficits in neurite outgrowth, which suggests that enhancement of neurite outgrowth is a potential direction by which to improve HD. Our previous publications showed that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) provides anti-apoptosis and anti-oxidative functions in striatal cell models of HD through the extracellular signal–regulated kinases (ERK) pathway, and FGF9 also stimulates cytoskeletons to enhance neurite outgrowth via nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling. In this study, we further demonstrate the importance of the ERK pathway for the neurite outgrowth induced by FGF9 in HD striatal models. FGF9 was treated with ERK (U0126) or NF-kB (BAY11-7082) inhibitors in STHdhQ⁷/Q⁷ and STHdhQ¹¹¹/Q¹¹¹ striatal knock-in cell lines to examine neurite outgrowth, cytoskeletal markers, and synaptic proteins via immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. NF-kB activity was analyzed by NF-kB promoter reporter assay. Here, we show that suppression of ERK signaling significantly inhibits FGF9-induced neurite outgrowth, cytoskeletal markers, and synaptic proteins in HD striatal cells. In addition, we also show suppression of ERK signaling significantly decreases FGF9-induced NF-kB activation, whereas suppression of NF-kB does not decrease FGF9-induced ERK signaling. These results suggest that FGF9 activates ERK signaling first, stimulates NF-kB upregulation, and then enhances neurite outgrowth in HD striatal cells. We elucidate the more detailed mechanisms of neurite outgrowth enhanced by FGF9 in these HD striatal cells. This study may provide insights into targeting neurite outgrowth for HD therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytoskeleton 3afibroblast growth factors 3afluorescent antibody technique 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneurites 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aFibroblast growth factor 9 0aERK signaling 0aNF-κB signaling 0aNeurite outgrowth 0aHuntington's disease1 aChen, Hsiu-Mei1 aCheng, Pei-Hsun1 aChang, Chih-Yi1 aTsai, Shaw-Jenq1 aChuang, Jih-Ing1 aWu, Jiajing,1 aHuang, Bu-Miin1 aSun, H.

Previously, only a few samples of Fomitiporella were studied on the basis of morphological and nuc 28S rDNA (28S)-based phylogenetic analyses. In this study, we made a comprehensive study on Fomitiporella on the basis of collections from Central America, USA, Europe, and China. The phylogenetic analysis, including 28 nuc 28S rDNA and 29 nuc rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer [ITS]) sequences newly generated, discovered 14 new lineages. Combined with morphological evidence, 4 new lineages are described and illustrated as new species, viz., Fomitiporella americana, F. micropora, F. sinica, and F. subinermis; 10 other new lineages, each with a single collection, are still treated as unidentified taxa; three new combinations, viz., Fomitiporella tenuissima, F. chinensis, and F. resupinata, are proposed. In addition, F. inermis is redescribed. A key to the 12 known species of Fomitiporella is provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHymenochaetales 3abasidiomata 3abasidiospores 3ahyphae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aCentral America 3aChina 3aEurope 0aHymenochaetaceae 0ataxonomy 0awood rotting fungi1 aVlasák, Josef1 aZhou, Li-Wei1 aWu, Fang1 aDai, Yu-Cheng0 tMycologia.g2017 Mar. 4, v. 109, no. 2 p.308-322dTaylor & FranciswJournal:1951x1557-25367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2017.13059433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03347naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245011100177300001600288500001900304520150700323536024501830592002802075596008702103650002002190650003202210650001602242650000902258650001502267650001402282650002002296650001502316650001002331650001002341650003302351650001002384650001802394650002602412650001402438650002502452653001502477653002802492653001702520653002302537700002102560700001802581700002202599773010202621856008502723852000902808655001202817IND60695542220221119163321.0200517e20170304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069554222DNAL7 a10.1080/00275514.2017.13070052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLazarus, Katherine L.10aPhylogenetic systematics of Syncephalis (Zoopagales, Zoopagomycotina), a genus of ubiquitous mycoparasites  ap. 333-349.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe examined phylogenetic relationships among species of the mycoparasite genus Syncephalis using sequences from three nuclear ribsosomal DNA genes (18S, 5.8S, and 28S nuc rDNA) and a gene encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1). Our data set included 88 Syncephalis isolates comprising 23 named species and several unnamed taxa. We also revived a culturing technique using beef liver and cellophane to grow several Syncephalis isolates without their host fungi to obtain pure parasite DNA. Most isolates, however, were grown in co-cultures with their host fungi, so we designed Syncephalis-specific primers to obtain sequence data. Individual and combined data sets were analyzed by maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. We recovered 20 well-supported lineages and 38 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Most major clades contained isolates from distant localities on multiple continents. There were taxonomic and nomenclature issues within several clades, probably due to high phenotypic plasticity or species dimorphism. We also conducted an analysis of Syncephalis nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences for 31 phylogenetically diverse isolates, and we determined that most Syncephalis species have long ITS sequences relative to other fungi. Although commonly employed eukaryotic and fungal primers are compatible with diverse Syncephalis species, the ITS sequences of Syncepahlis are nonetheless rarely recovered in environmental molecular diversity surveys.  aFunding was provided by NSF as part of the ZygoLife project (DEB-1441677 to M.

Layer-by-layer technique was employed to introduce poly(phenylenevinylene) (PPV) precursor, diazoresin (DAR), and polyanion, including poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and poly(sodium-p-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), onto the substrate polystyrene-divinylbenzene microspheres with sulfonic groups on the surface (SPSDVB). The conversion of PPV precursor into fluorescent PPV as well as the cross-linking reaction between DAR and polyanion, were accomplished simultaneously in the following thermal treatment. After optimizing the DAR concentration, the selection of polyelectrolytes and the coating sequence, the cross-linked multilayer coated PPV microspheres, SPSDVB-(PPV/PSS/DAR/PAA) spheres, were prepared. These spheres were found to have uniform size with a clear core–shell structure and display even and strong fluorescence, based on the characterization by flow cytometry, microscopy, and photophysics. They were found to be stable and highly resistant to common solvents and even “dissociation agent”, as well as possess good thermal stability and photostability. The feasibility of conjugating biomolecules on the surface of spheres was also demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3amicroscopy 3apolyacrylic acid 3athermal stability 3afluorescence 3abiochemical compounds 3aacrylic acid 3aflow cytometry 3adissociation 3aanions 3achemical bonding 3aphotostability 3asolvents 3aheat treatment 0across-linking 0afluorescent microsphere 0aelectrolytes 0abioconjugation 0alayer-by-layer1 aChen, Yun1 aSong, Jing1 aFan, Li-Juan0 tACS applied materials .g2015 Apr. 22, v. 7, no. 15 p.8260-8267dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b014343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245010400157300001800261520127000279650001301549650001301562650001601575650001201591650001101603650001901614650001701633650001501650650001101665650001601676650001001692650001401702650001301716650001001729650001101739650001401750700002401764700001801788700002001806700002201826700002101848773016101869856004002030852000902070655001202079IND4535133220221118163840.0160318e20150225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453513322DNAL7 a10.1021/jf505963c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatich, Adam J.10aDistribution of Selenoglucosinolates and Their Metabolites in Brassica Treated with Sodium Selenate  ap. 1896-1905.  aIn Brassica species, hydrolysis of (methylthio)glucosinolates produces sulfur-containing aglycons which have demonstrated anticancer benefits. Selenized Brassicaceae contain (methylseleno)glucosinolates and their selenium-containing aglycons. As a prelude to biological testing, broccoli, cauliflower, and forage rape plants were treated with sodium selenate and their tap roots, stems, leaves, and florets analyzed for selenoglucosinolates and their Se aglycons. Two new selenoglucosinolates were identified: glucoselenoraphanin in broccoli florets and glucoselenonasturtiin in forage rape roots. A new aglycon, selenoberteroin nitrile, was identified in forage rape. The major selenoglucosinolates were glucoselenoerucin in broccoli, glucoselenoiberverin in cauliflower, and glucoselenoerucin and glucoselenoberteroin in forage rape roots. In broccoli florets, the concentrations of selenglucosinolates exceeded those of their sulfur analogues. Fertilization with selenium slightly reduced (methylthio)glucosinolates and aglycons in the roots, but increased them in the florets, the leaves, and sometimes the stems. These discoveries provide a new avenue for investigating how consumption of Brassica vegetables and their organoselenides may promote human health. 3aBrassica 3abroccoli 3acauliflower 3aflorets 3aforage 3aglucosinolates 3ahuman health 3ahydrolysis 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3aroots 3aselenates 3aselenium 3astems 3asulfur 3atap roots1 aMcKenzie, Marian J.1 aLill, Ross E.1 aMcGhie, Tony K.1 aChen, Ronan K.

The growth of C. reinhardtii decreased with increasing TCF concentration, and the maximum inhibition ratio was 51.3% at 200 mg L–¹ TCF compared to the control. Analyses of pigment content, chlorophyll fluorescence, and antioxidant enzymes indicated that C. reinhardtii can produce resistance and acclimatize to the presence of TCF. The variations in pH during cultivation suggested that photosynthetic microalgae have innate advantages over bacteria and fungi in remediating TCF. A 100% biodegradation rate was achieved at a maximum concentration of 100 mg L–¹ TCF. Ten metabolites were identified by GC–MS, and the degradation pathways of TCF by the algae were proposed. This research demonstrated that C. reinhardtii is highly tolerant to and can efficiently degrade TCF. Thus, C. reinhardtii can be used to remove traces of TCF from natural water environments and to treat TCF-contaminated wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3achlorophyll 3afreshwater 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3amicroalgae 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3atoxicity 3atrichlorfon 3awastewater 0ametabolic fate1 aWu, Yixiao1 aDing, Huijun1 aZhang, Weihao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5453-97710 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 68, no. 6 p.1645-1653dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b057653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014700163520142100310592002801731650002001759650001501779650001101794650001801805650000901823650001701832650001901849653002301868653002001891653001601911653001001927653001701937700001601954700001801970700001701988700001102005700001902016700001402035700001702049773009802066856008202164852000902246655001202255IND60722029520221121224028.0220830e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072202952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1189582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuai10aHUCMSCs transplantation combined with ultrashort wave therapy attenuates neuroinflammation in spinal cord injury through NUR77/ NF-κB pathway  aSpinal cord injury (SCI) is a major cause of long-term physical impairment. Currently, treatment for SCI is limited to supportive measures, which can lead to permanent disability, representing a serious social burden. The present study aimed to evaluate the inflammatory microenvironment effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs)+ Ultrashort Wave (USW) therapy on SCI and reveal possible mechanisms. Low-dose USW was treated one day after SCI, and HUCMSCs suspension was transferred to the lesion using a micro-syringe 7 days after SCI. The functional effects of HUCMSCs and USW, separately and combinedly, were measured, together with the infiltration of CD3⁺ cells, formation of A1 astrocytes and activation of NUR77/ NF-κB pathway. Our results showed that HUCMSCs+USW therapy improved motor function of SCI rat, together with decreased infiltration of CD3⁺ T cells, and decreased induction of microglia and A1 astrocytes. And also USW treatment played a very important role on decreasing the infiltration of CD3⁺ T cells and IBA-1⁺ cells. Reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 was also observed in rats receiving HUCMSCs+USW therapy, medicated by NUR77/NF-κB pathway. These findings indicated that HUCMSCs+USW therapy could attenuate inflammatory microenvironment through NUR77/NF-κB signaling pathway, which might contribute to its better outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal injuries 3aastrocytes 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3arats 3atherapeutics 3aumbilical cord 0aSpinal cord injury 0aHUCMSCs therapy 0aUSW therapy 0aNUR77 0aInflammation1 aJia, Yiying1 aCao, Xiangyan1 aFeng, Sining1 aNa, Li1 aDong, Hongxuan1 aGao, Jian1 aZhang, Lixin0 tLife sciences.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 267 p.118958-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.1189583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001600284520173100300592002802031650001102059650002102070650001202091650002102103650001202124650001802136650002102154650001002175650001402185650001102199650001002210651002102220700002602241773016002267856008102427852000902508655001202517IND60575294620221117015900.0170728e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057529462DNAL7 a10.1007/s40011-015-0591-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaqoob, Ubaid10aConservation and Cultivation of Ferula jaeschkeana Vatke: A Species with Deep Complex Morphophysiological Dormancy  ap. 315-325.  aFerula jaeschkeana Vatke, an important medicinal plant of the Himalayan region, being threatened needs immediate conservation strategies. Keeping this in view studies on the germination of seeds and sprouting of vegetative propagules has been undertaken for the first time. At the time of dispersal, F. jaeschkeana seeds are dormant and have under-developed embryos. The aims of the present work were to determine the requirements for germination and overcoming dormancy and to characterize the type of seed dormancy. The seeds of F. jaeschkeana have deep complex morpho-physiological dormancy. Present study revealed that final germination percentage, mean daily germination, seed vigour index, germination index, germination rate and germination value were highest (53.3 %, 0.88, 3.67, 0.13, 0.88 and 1.02, respectively) when 200 ppm kinetin and dry stratification (60 days) were applied together. The decline in MGT up to 36.18 days and highest percentage survival (87.9 ± 7.08) were also observed in the same treatment. This treatment is thus recommended for promoting the germination process of F. jaeschkeana seeds. Maximum seed germination (62.0 ± 11.54 %) at 1 in. depth was found in seeds presoaked in kinetin (100 ppm) for 24 h in media of sand:soil (2:1). In case of root tuber cuttings, 500 ppm gibberellic acid showed significantly high sprouting (89.70 ± 0.78 and 69.14 ± 0.82 %, respectively) and rooting percentage (78.78 ± 1.13 and 55.56 ± 0.95 %, respectively) in case of both perennial and biennial plants. Likewise minimum time taken for sprouting was also observed in the same treatment in case of both perennial (10.0 ± 1 days) and biennial plants (11.33 ± 2.3 days).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFerula 3agibberellic acid 3akinetin 3amedicinal plants 3arooting 3aseed dormancy 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asprouting 3atubers 3avigor 3aHimalayan region1 aNawchoo, Irshad Ahmad0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Section B: biological sciences.g2017 June, v. 87, no. 2 p.315-325dSpringer Indiax0369-82117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-015-0591-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002200138245013000160300001400290520099300304650002101297650002401318650002601342650002201368650001301390650001101403700001401414700001301428700002001441700001501461700001501476700001701491700002001508700001701528773013401545852000901679856007801688930003301766946001301799655001201812IND4429701220221121125904.0091207e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442970122DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.218472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Inderpreet14aThe effect of length of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) on electrical properties of conducting polymer-SWNT composites  ap. 89-95.  aDC conductivity of conjugated polymer-single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) composite films has been measured for different SWNT concentrations. The composite was prepared by dispersing SWNTs in the poly (3-octylthiophene), P3OT matrix already dissolved in xylene. The conductivity of the composite films showed a rapid increase as the SWNT concentration increases beyond a certain value. This behavior is explained in terms of percolating paths provided by the SWNTs in the volume of polymer matrix. To investigate the effect of length of nanotubes on the percolation conductivity, different SWNT samples were employed with similar diameter but varying tube lengths. It was found that the conductivity of the composite films is strongly dominated by the length of the nanotubes. Lower percolation limit and high conductivity value of composite films is observed for longer nanotubes. Furthermore, the conductivity is observed to be dependent on the size of the host polymer molecule also. 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomposite materials 3aelectrical properties 3afilms (materials) 3apolymers 3axylene1 aVerma, A.1 aKaur, I.1 aBharadwaj, L.M.1 aBhatia, V.1 aJain, V.K.1 aBhatia, C.S.1 aBhatnagar, P.K.1 aMathur, P.C.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.89-95dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.218473Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02082naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012200128300001600250500007200266500001500338520060300353650002200956650001200978650001000990650002501000650001101025650003401036650001001070650002001080650001401100650001501114650001101129651001501140653003801155653001601193653001101209653001201220653001201232653002201244653001501266653002301281653002501304653001601329653001501345653001501360700001901375700001801394773007301412852000901485939003301494946001301527655001201540IND8905814120221121102854.0891025e198412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890581412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScanlan, T.K.10aSocial psychological aspects of competition for male youth sport participants.

WAXS and DSC measurements were used to detect the presence of crystalline domains of polyethylene-oxide (PEO) blocks at room temperature as a function of the copolymer chemical composition. Furthermore, DSC experiments allowed the determination of the melting temperatures of the crystalline part of the PEO blocks. SAXS measurements, performed above and below the melting temperature of the PEO blocks, revealed the formation of periodic structures, but the absence or the weakness of high order reflections peaks did not allow a clear assessment of the morphological structure of the copolymers. This information was inferred by combining the results obtained by SAXS and ¹H NMR spin diffusion experiments, which also provided an estimation of the size of the dispersed phases of the nanostructured copolymers. 3aX-radiation 3aambient temperature 3achemical composition 3acomposite polymers 3amelting 3amelting point 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aCaldarelli, Stefano1 aPhan, Trang1 aBertin, Denis1 aDeazevedo, Eduardo R.1 aMantovani, Gerson Luiz1 aBonagamba, Tito J.1 aPlivelic, Tomás S.1 aTorriani, Iris L.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.55-64dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.218433Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02108naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002100138245009300159300001600252520092300268650001701191650001901208650002301227650002201250650002101272650004401293650001901337650001501356700002301371700002401394700002201418700002201440773013901462852000901601856007801610930003301688946001301721655001201734IND4429697720221121080054.0091207e20100101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442969772DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.237662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiretto, Vanessa10aCopolymerization of vinylidene fluoride and acrylic acid in supercritical carbon dioxide  ap. 109-121.  aThe free-radical copolymerization of vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and acrylic acid (AA) was carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide using both precipitation and dispersion techniques in the presence of an ammonium carboxylate perfluoropolyether compound. Formation of a copolymer was confirmed by variable contact time CP MAS NMR spectroscopy. Macromolecular matrices were significantly enriched in AA with respect to the initial feed composition and we found that the nonfluorinated monomer has a much higher reactivity ratio with respect to VDF. The cumulative concentration, crystallinity, and water affinity of the synthesized copolymers could be modified changing the initial feed composition, the density of the polymerization mixture, the specific interfacial area of the polymer phase, and the polymerization time. The solubility of the macromolecular product in water was greatly affected by its composition. 3aacrylic acid 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposite polymers 3acrystal structure 3afeed composition 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymerization 3asolubility1 aScialdone, Onofrio1 aSilvestri, Giuseppe1 aSpinella, Alberto1 aGalia, Alessandro0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Jan. 01, v. 48, no. 1 p.109-121dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.237663Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02467naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245013000173300001800303520095700321650002501278650002501303650002101328650001501349650002901364650002601393650001801419650004301437650005001480650002801530650003001558650003301588650005701621650003601678653001801714700001201732700001801744773010201762852000901864856007701873930003301950945001301983946001301996655001202009IND2202422520221121060615.0000208e199903  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220242252DNAL7 a105524092pmid7 a10.1021/jf980798u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, J.Z.Q.10aRapid extraction and high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of parthenolide in feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium)  ap. 1018-1022.  aA rapid and sensitive method for quantifying parthenolide in feverfew herb (Tanacetum parthenium) was developed that is significantly faster than those reported in the literature. The extraction system consisted of acetonitrile/water (90:10, v/v) in a bottle with stirring for 30 min. Both Soxhlet and bottle-stirring extractions were studied. Samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with a Cosmosil C18-AR column (150 x 4.6 mm, 5 micrometer, 120 angstrom). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/water (55:45, v/v) with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and UV detection at 210 nm. Analysis time was 6 min, with a detection limit of 0.10 ng on column. The calibration curve was linear over a range of 0.160-850 microgram/mL parthenolide with R(2) = 0.9999. Replicate tests indicated good reproducibility of the method with an RSD% = 0.88 (n = 10).

The multiblock copolymers consist of fully disulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) and partially fluorinated poly(arylene ether ketone) as hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments, respectively. Synthesis of the multiblock copolymers was achieved by a condensation coupling reaction between controlled molecular weight hydrophilic and hydrophobic oligomers. The coupling reaction could be conducted at relatively low temperatures (e.g., 105 °C) by utilizing highly reactive hexafluorobenzene (HFB) as a linkage group. The low coupling reaction temperature could prevent a possible trans-etherification, which can randomize the hydrophilic-hydrophobic sequences. Tough ductile membranes were prepared by solution casting and their membrane properties were evaluated. With similar ion exchange capacities (IECs), proton conductivity and water uptake were strongly influenced by the hydrophilic and hydrophobic block sequence lengths. Conductivity and water uptake increased with increasing block length by developing nanophase separated morphologies. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments revealed that the connectivity of the hydrophilic segments was enhanced by increasing the block length. The systematic synthesis and characterization of the copolymers are reported. 3aatomic force microscopy 3acomposite polymers 3afuel cells 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aion exchange 3amolecular weight 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRoy, Abhishek1 aLane, Ozma1 aLee, Myoungbae1 aMcGrath, James E.0 tJournal of polymer science.g2010 Jan. 01, v. 48, no. 1 p.214-222dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-624X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pola.237803Available from publisher's Web site  a20091207b20100101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03150naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245018100175300001800356500001500374520119300389650001501582650001001597650001001607650001501617650001401632650001701646650001001663650001201673650000901685650002401694650002301718650001601741650002501757650001201782650001701794650002501811650001101836650003301847650002301880650002201903650000901925650005701934650002401991650006102015650003602076650000902112650002502121653001902146653001402165700001402179700001502193700001802208700001502226773010202241852000902343856007702352930003302429945001302462946001302475655001202488IND2202422620221121060610.0000208e199906  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220242262DNAL7 a107946472pmid7 a10.1021/jf981007r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomigahara, Y.10aMetabolism of 7-fluoro-6-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimido)-4-(2-propynyl)-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (S-53482, flumioxazin) in the rat.

The predominant excretion route was via the feces. The major fecal and urinary metabolites involved reduction or sulfonic acid addition reactions at the 1,2-double bond of the 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimide moiety and hydroxylation of the cyclohexene or cyclohexane ring. One urinary and four fecal metabolites were identified using chromatographic techniques and spectroanalyses (NMR and MS). Three of five identified metabolites were unique forms, reduced at the 1,2-double bond of the 3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimide moiety. On the basis of the metabolites identified in this study, the metabolic pathways of S-53482 in rats are proposed. To specify tissues forming reduced metabolites, an in vitro study was conducted. Reduction was found to take place in red blood cells. 3ametabolism 3aliver 3aurine 3aherbicides 3aexcretion 3aerythrocytes 3afeces 3akidneys 3arats 3aoral administration 3achemical structure 3ametabolites 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aBenzoxazines 2aCarbon Radioisotopes 2aFemale 2aHerbicidesxpharmacokinetics 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aOxazinesxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhthalimidesxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aRadioisotope Dilution Technique 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0aidentification 0areduction1 aOnogi, M.1 aKaneko, H.1 aNakatsuka, I.1 aYamane, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1999 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.2429-2438x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf981007r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03023naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100003700161245012600198300001600324520164300340650002301983650001202006650002002018650001302038650001702051650002502068650001502093650002002108650002302128650002002151650002702171653002602198653002502224700001602249700001602265700002002281700002302301700001402324700001902338773010402357852000902461930003302470945002502503946001302528655001202541IND4366893520221121043828.0050201e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436689352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In addition, field cage data are presented on the mating competitiveness of strains carrying this mutation, including a genetic sexing strain (GSS). The incorporation of a phenotypic marker, such as Sr2, in a Mediterranean fruit fly GSS would complement, and could replace, the use of fluorescent dye for monitoring sterile insect technique programs and increase program efficiency by improving sterile and wild fly identification procedures. The mutation is homozygous lethal, and it is located on chromosome 5 at position 78B and 60D on the salivary and trichogen polytene maps, respectively. The development of the Sr2 GSS is described here, together with data on fitness and penetrance of the mutation. The field-cage results demonstrated 1) random mating between males and females of laboratory strains carrying or lacking Sr2, 2) comparable sexual compatibility of Sr2 and non-Sr2 GSS with two wild populations, and 3) comparable mating competitiveness of males from Sr2 and non-Sr2 GSS with wild males. From these results, no significant effects of the mutation on the sexual competitiveness of strains carrying Sr2 were detectable. The findings of this study point to a satisfactory overall genetic as well as mating behavior profile of Mediterranean fruit fly strains carrying the Sr2 mutation and clearly warrant further evaluation of this mutation in Mediterranean fruit fly GSS. 3aCeratitis capitata 3astrains 3agenetic markers 3amutation 3alethal genes 3adominance (genetics) 3apenetrance 3ainsect genetics 3achromosome mapping 3amating behavior 3amating competitiveness 0agenetic sexing strain 0amating compatibility1 aCaceres, C.1 aDelprat, A.1 aWornoayporn, V.1 aRamirez Santos, E.1 aFranz, G.1 aRobinson, A.S.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2005 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.119-125x0013-87467nnas  aDNAL  a20050810b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/02/04  aOther US 7aarticle01371naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099072001700117100001800134245004800152300001400200500001500214520066600229650001700895653001400912773014100926852000901067930003301076945000801109655001201117991614514280742620221121043930.0780301e197007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7899121562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The RS1 contents in unheated rice and soybeans were found to be high at 5.3 and 4.9%, respectively. After heating, the RS1 levels of the rice and soybeans were significantly reduced to 0.4 and 2.4%, respectively. The total nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP) content was not significantly different according to heat treatment, but the heat treatments affected the amounts of water insoluble nonstarch polysaccharides (WISNSP) and water soluble nonstarch polysaccharides (WSNSP). The level of WISNSP in the unheated samples was higher than the WSNSP of both samples; however, the WISNSP level showed a reducing trend after heating. Also, total pentosan and water soluble pentosan contents showed similar trends with total NSP and WSNSP. The hydrolysis indices (HI) of the unheated rice and soybeans were low (36.2 and 40.3%), while the heated group had high levels (89.5 and 45.0%). Among the cooking methods, the highest kinetic constants (0.284 and 0.199) were found with autoclaving for both rice and soybeans, followed by electric cooker (0.282 and 0.170), microwave oven (0.256 and 0.155), and stone pot (0.238 and 0.167). Particularly, all soybean samples appeared to have lower starch hydrolysis kinetics than the rice samples. The RS contents of the rice and soybeans were highest in the samples that were cooked in the stone pot, at 1.2 and 3.8%, respectively. 3acookers 3acooking 3aheat treatment 3ahydrolysis 3amicrowave ovens 3arice 3asoybeans 3astarch1 aLee, Seog-Won1 aRhee, Chul0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2008 Sept., v. 227, no. 5 p.1315-1321dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-008-0846-6 7aarticle03205naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245005200172300001800224500001500242520114600257650002101403650002201424650001701446650001301463650003001476650002001506650001501526650001201541650001301553650002801566650001501594650001201609650001301621650001901634650003901653650004101692650001701733650002501750650001801775650004101793650002901834650003101863650002201894650003001916650001601946650002301962650002301985650002302008650002302031650002902054653001802083653003102101653001602132700001602148700001602164700001802180700001702198700001802215773010502233852000902338856007702347930003302424945001302457946001302470655001202483IND2330752520221121043931.0030211e20021106dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233075252DNAL7 a124057782pmid7 a10.1021/jf01090172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolonen, M.10aPlant-derived biomolecules in fermented cabbage  ap. 6798-6803.  a2019-12-04  aThe formation of plant-derived biomolecules during sauerkraut fermentation was studied. Cabbage was fermented with a starter culture, and the results were compared to the results of spontaneous fermentation. The concentration of flavonoids and glucosinolates was analyzed by HPLC, and that of the glucosinolate breakdown products, by GC-MS. Of the 20 different flavonoids tested, only kaempferol was found (0.9 mg/kg FW, fresh weight). The content of kaempferol remained constant in the cabbage fiber matrix over the fermentation process. The nitrite concentration was below the detection limit in both fermentations. The total glucosinolate content in the raw material was 3.71 micromol/g DW, dry weight. Glucosinolates were totally decomposed in both fermentations during two weeks, and different types of breakdown products were formed. Isothiocyanates, indole-3-carbinol, goitrin, allyl cyanide, and nitriles were determined in the fermented cabbage. Isothiocyanates and allyl cyanide were the predominant breakdown products in both fermentations. Sulforaphane nitrile and goitrin were found only in small quantities in the end products. 3astarter cultures 3aindole-3-methanol 3afermentation 3anitriles 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3aisothiocyanates 3asauerkraut 3acabbage 3anitrates 3aPediococcus dextrinicus 3aflavonoids 3agoitrin 3anitrites 3aglucosinolates 2aBrassicaxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFermentation 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aFood Handling 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGlucosinolatesxanalysis 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIndolesxanalysis 2aIsothiocyanatesxanalysis 2aKaempferols 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitrilesxanalysis 2aNitritesxanalysis 2aOxazolesxanalysis 2aOxazolidinonesxanalysis 0aallyl cyanide 0aorganic nitrogen compounds 0aPediococcus1 aTaipale, M.1 aViander, B.1 aPihlava, J.M.1 aKorhonen, H.1 aRyhanen, E.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Nov. 6, v. 50, no. 23 p.6798-6803x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01090173Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03738naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245017400172300001800346520168200364650001602046650001202062650001102074650001302085650001302098650002602111650002602137650002502163650002502188650001602213650002302229650002502252650006202277650002202339650002402361650007102385650002002456650005902476650003602535650003002571650002302601653001902624653001602643653001702659653001702676653002202693700001502715700001502730700001602745700001902761700001502780700001702795700002602812773010502838852000902943856007702952930003303029945001303062946001303075655001203088IND2330752120221121033527.0030211e20021106dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233075212DNAL7 a124057772pmid7 a10.1021/jf020542v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchirra, M.10aComplexation of imazalil with beta-cyclodextrin, residue uptake, persistence, and activity against penicillium decay in citrus fruit following postharvest dip treatments  ap. 6790-6797.  aA method for the inclusion of imazalil (IMZ) in the beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD), structural characterization of the inclusion complex and its antifungal activity against Penicillium digitatum and P. italicum assessed by in vitro and in vivo tests are reported. According to the starting stoichiometry of betaCD with respect to IMZ, an equimolar ratio beta-cyclodextrin-IMZ (betaCD-IMZ) was detected by 1H NMR. In vitro assays showed that the freshly prepared betaCD-IMZ was as effective as IMZ, although 1- and 4-day-old betaCD-IMZ mixtures were more effective. Studies on Star Ruby grapefruit showed no significant differences in residue uptake between treatments with an IMZ commercially available fungicide (Deccozil) or betaCD-IMZ when equal active ingredient (a.i.) concentrations (250 mg/L) and dip temperatures (20 or 50 degrees C) were used. By contrast, treatments of Tarocco oranges and Di Massa lemons with 250 mg/L betaCD-IMZ at 50 degrees C produced significant differences in residue uptake in comparison with 250 mg/L Deccozil treatments at 50 degrees C. The a.i. degradation rate in grapefruit during postquarantine and simulated marketing period (SMP) at 20 degrees C was not affected by the type of formulation used, whether at 20 or 50 degrees C. Conversely, IMZ in oranges and lemons had greater persistence when applied at 50 degrees C. All fungicide treatments showed a comparable efficacy against decay in grapefruit and oranges, whereas treatment in lemons at 250 mg/L a.i. of heated fungicides had higher suppressive effects against decay than unheated chemicals having equal a.i. concentrations and comparable activity at 1200 mg/L IMZ at 20 degrees C. 3agrapefruits 3aoranges 3alemons 3adextrins 3aimazalil 3aantifungal properties 3aPenicillium digitatum 3aPenicillium italicum 3apostharvest diseases 3atemperature 3afungicide residues 2aCitrusxmicrobiology 2aCyclodextrinsxchemistryxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aFood Preservation 2aFruitxmicrobiology 2aFungicides, Industrialxchemistryxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aHot Temperature 2aImidazolesxchemistryxpharmacokineticsxpharmacology. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aPenicilliumxdrug effects 2abeta-Cyclodextrins 0afungus control 0apersistence 0astorage dips 0ainteractions 0ainclusion complex1 aDelogu, G.1 aCabras, P.1 aAngioni, A.1 aD'hallewin, G.1 aVeyrat, A.1 aMarcos, J.F.1 aGonzalez Candelas, L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Nov. 6, v. 50, no. 23 p.6790-6797x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf020542v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03374naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245010900195300001800304520170800322650001102030650001102041650001702052650001902069650001102088650001402099650001602113650004902129650001402178650002302192650001802215650002602233650001702259650001602276653002602292653002602318653003702344653002002381653002002401653002402421653003002445653003902475700002202514700001902536700002402555773010602579852000902685856009202694930003302786946001302819655001202832IND4399302320221121033438.0071223e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439930232DNAL7 a181734702pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00832.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcBRIDE, MARISSA F.10aIncorporating the Effects of Socioeconomic Uncertainty into Priority Setting for Conservation Investment  ap. 1463-1474.  aUncertainty in the implementation and outcomes of conservation actions that is not accounted for leaves conservation plans vulnerable to potential changes in future conditions. We used a decision-theoretic approach to investigate the effects of two types of investment uncertainty on the optimal allocation of global conservation resources for land acquisition in the Mediterranean Basin. We considered uncertainty about (1) whether investment will continue and (2) whether the acquired biodiversity assets are secure, which we termed transaction uncertainty and performance uncertainty, respectively. We also developed and tested the robustness of different rules of thumb for guiding the allocation of conservation resources when these sources of uncertainty exist. In the presence of uncertainty in future investment ability (transaction uncertainty), the optimal strategy was opportunistic, meaning the investment priority should be to act where uncertainty is highest while investment remains possible. When there was a probability that investments would fail (performance uncertainty), the optimal solution became a complex trade-off between the immediate biodiversity benefits of acting in a region and the perceived longevity of the investment. In general, regions were prioritized for investment when they had the greatest performance certainty, even if an alternative region was highly threatened or had higher biodiversity value. The improved performance of rules of thumb when accounting for uncertainty highlights the importance of explicitly incorporating sources of investment uncertainty and evaluating potential conservation investments in the context of their likely long-term success. 3aassets 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3aland resources 3aleaves 3alongevity 3auncertainty 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxeconomics 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aPublic Policy 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aTime Factors 2aUncertainty 0abiodiversity hotspots 0aconservation planning 0aconservation resource allocation 0adecision theory 0ainvestment risk 0aMediterranean Basin 0asocioeconomic uncertainty 0asystematic conservation assessment1 aWilson, Kerrie A.1 aBode, Michael.1 aPOSSINGHAM, HUGH P.0 tConservation biology.g2007 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1463-1474dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00832.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle00926naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004200097040001800139100001800157245002500175300001600200520016500216650002200381650000900403773009300412852000900505856009200514939003300606945000800639946001300647655001200660991614512270742620221120145312.0830126e198109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830008152DNAL7 a10.1097/00004397-198102130-000152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTessler, H.H.10aOcular toxoplasmosis  ap. 185-199.  aToxoplasma gondii, human ocular infections, clinical review (clinical appearance, life cycle, immunology, laboratory diagnosis, differential diagnosis, therapy) 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aeyes0 tInternational Ophthalmology Clinics.g1981 Fall, v. 21, no. 3 p.185-199x0020-81677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00004397-198102130-000153Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19830126c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02146naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001700186245006200203300001600265500002400281506007600305520072900381506003701110650001501147650001301162650001901175650002501194650002101219650002501240650001501265650001101280650003301291650003601324650001901360650001801379650002101397650004001418651001001458651001001468700001801478700001201496773009901508852000901607856004801616655001201664IND4405231620221207134156.0080502e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440523162DNAL7 a182567802pmid7 aPMC23598332pmcid7 a10.1007/s00267-008-9070-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Lijin10aPublic-Private Partnerships in China's Urban Water Sector  ap. 863-877.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring the past decades, the traditional state monopoly in urban water management has been debated heavily, resulting in different forms and degrees of private sector involvement across the globe. Since the 1990s, China has also started experiments with new modes of urban water service management and governance in which the private sector is involved. It is premature to conclude whether the various forms of private sector involvement will successfully overcome the major problems (capital shortage, inefficient operation, and service quality) in China's water sector. But at the same time, private sector involvement in water provisioning and waste water treatments seems to have become mainstream in transitional China.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agovernance 3amonopoly 3aprivate sector 3awastewater treatment 3awater management 2aDeveloping Countries 2aGovernment 2aHumans 2aInterinstitutional Relations 2aOrganization and Administration 2aPrivate Sector 2aPublic Sector 2aUrban Population 2aWater Supplyxeconomicsxstandards. 3aChina 0aChina1 aMol, A.

We examined whether this was the case for U.S. counties. We collated the number of species of vascular plants, human population size, and the area of U.S. counties. Controlling for spatial autocorrelation and county area, plant species richness increased with human population size and density in counties with and without universities and/or botanical gardens, with no significant differences in the relation between the two subsets. This is consistent with previous findings and further evidence of a broad-scale positive correlation between species richness and human population presence, which has important consequences for the experience of nature by inhabitants of densely populated regions. Combined with the many reports of a negative correlation between the two variables at a local scale, the positive relation between plant species richness in U.S. counties and human population presence stresses the need for the conservation of seminatural areas in urbanized ecosystems and for the containment of urban and suburban sprawl. 3aautocorrelation 3abotanical gardens 3abotanists 3aecosystems 3ahuman population 3apopulation size 3aspecies diversity 3auniversities 3aurban areas 3avascular plants 2aBiodiversity 2aBotany 2aHumans 2aPlants 2aPopulation Density 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0adensity-area relationship 0ahabitat heterogeneity 0amacroecology 0anative and exotic plants 0aNorth American flora 0asampling effort 0aspecies-area relationship 0aspecies-energy relationship 0aurban ecology1 aMcKinney, Michael L.0 tConservation biology.g2007 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.1333-1340dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00760.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070923b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03885naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012800168300001400296500002400310520260700334650002602941650001602967650001402983650001602997650001303013650001203026650002203038650001703060650001303077650001103090650001903101650001603120650000903136650001603145650001803161650002003179650001703199650001603216700001603232700002903248773009303277852000903370856004803379655001203427IND4458887820221120134910.0110610e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445888782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11099-011-0013-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBączek-Kwinta, R.10aAre the fluorescence parameters of German chamomile leaves the first indicators of the anthodia yield in drought conditions  ap. 87-97.  aIncludes references  a7-day soil drought followed by 7-day rehydration was applied to potted German chamomile (Chamomilla recutita) plants at the beginning of their generative stage. Plants of a wild type (WT), plus two diploid (2n) and two tetraploid (4n) genotypes were studied, in order to examine the alterations in chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoids (Car) contents, and chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) parameters during water shortage and rehydration. The fresh mass of the anthodia after the recovery was also studied. WT plants adjust better to water stress than modern breeding genotypes, because drought resulted in the low fall in leaf water content of WT, the lowest decrease in the fresh mass of its anthodia (a 41% decrease from the control), and the most elastic response of the photosynthetic apparatus. 4n C11/2 strain plants suffered from the highest reduction in anthodia yield (87%), and had the lowest constitutive pigment contents. It was also the only genotype which revealed nontypical alterations in various CF parameters obtained on a dark- and light-adapted leaf. During drought, a big increase was noticed in minimal, maximal, and variable fluorescence of PSII reaction centres in the dark- adapted (F₀, Fm and Fv, respectively), and in the light-adapted state (F₀′, Fm′ and Fv′). It was accompanied by the biggest decline in linear electron transport rate (ETR), quantum efficiency of PSII electron transport (ΦPSII) and photochemical quenching coefficient (qP). These alterations were prolonged to the stage when the normal leaf water content was retained. On the contrary, C6/2 strain plants had the highest constitutive Chl and Car contents, which additionally increased after rehydration, similarly to the values of F₀, Fm and Fv, which reflects the high photosynthetic potential of this genotype. It was accompanied by the relatively high yield of its anthodia after drought. Considering the drop in the yield triggered by drought, it seems to be the only parameter which may be linked with the ploidy level. Although the yield formation of chamomile strains cannot simply be estimated by CF assay, this technique may serve as an additional tool in the selection of plants to drought. The following circumstances should be submitted; namely: measurement at the proper developmental stage of plants, in different water regimes, and an analysis of various CF parameters. The increase in F₀ and F₀′, and the reduction in ETR, Fv′/Fm′, ΦPSII and qP values in response to water deficit should be an indicator of the impairment of the photosynthetic apparatus through drought. 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3acarotenoids 3achamomile 3achlorophyll 3adiploidy 3adrought 3aelectron transfer 3afluorescence 3agenotype 3aleaves 3aphotosystem II 3arehydration 3asoil 3atetraploidy 3awater content 3awater shortages 3awater stress 3awild plants1 aKozieł, A.1 aSeidler-Łożykowska, K.0 tPhotosynthetica.g2011 Mar., v. 49, no. 1 p.87-97dSpringer Netherlandsx0300-36047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11099-011-0013-3 7aarticle01124naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245007700129300001600206500002100222520016600243650002700409650001700436650001300453650003600466651001100502653001300513653001100526655002700537711005900564773010200623852000900725939003300734945000800767946001100775655001200786991614510670742620221120125616.0820518s1971    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGC829553722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCujes, R.14aThe involvement of Canadian Slavs in the co-operative movement in Canada  ap. 151-170.  aIncludes tables.  aThis paper reviews Canadian Slavic participation in various co-operatives (particularly credit unions) during the 20th century, and the benefits members derived. 3afinancial institutions 3acooperatives 3aresearch 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aCanada 0amovement 0aSlavic 7aconference publication2 aSlavs in Canada 1969 : York University, Toronto, Ont.)0 tSlavs in Canada: proceedings - National Conference on Canadian Slavs.g1971, v. 3 p.151-1707nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19820518c00000000  aAGC  aNon-US 7aarticle02688naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013900129300001400268500001500282520165900297650002001956650001401976650001401990650001802004650002202022650002302044650001202067650001702079650001402096653001702110653001702127700001702144773008502161852000902246930003302255945001302288946001302301655001202314IND2268049720221120125731.0010330e200101  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226804972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGary, R.E.

However, field evidence of sugar-free living is inconclusive, and the implications for reproductive fitness and vectorial capacity are unknown. To evaluate the role that sugar may play in the ecology of these mosquitoes, mated female An. gambiae in the laboratory were given access to either no food (water only), 10% sucrose, human blood, or human blood + 10% sucrose, and comparisons of daily mortality, fecundity, and biting frequency were made. The effect of sugar availability on vectorial capacity and the intrinsic rate of increase, a measure of fitness, then were determined. Females (pooled and individual) given blood + sugar lived significantly longer than did those on the other diets. Daily fecundity was higher for females given blood alone than for those fed blood + sugar (13 versus 9 eggs per female daily). However, total fecundity and intrinsic rate of increase were not affected by sugar availability. Biting frequency was significantly higher (0.41 versus 0.26 bites per female per day) for females given blood alone. Despite the reduced survivorship, exclusive blood-feeding led to a theoretically higher vectorial capacity for Plasmodium falciparum at 27 degrees C. These data indicate that female An. gambiae could replace sugar with increased blood feeding without suppressing reproductive fitness. Increased blood feeding could, in turn, increase the rate of malaria transmission and may explain the unusual efficiency of this vector. 3adisease vectors 3alongevity 3afecundity 3asugar feeding 3aAnopheles gambiae 3avectorial capacity 3amalaria 3abiting rates 3amortality 0areproduction 0aavailability1 aFoster, W.A.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2001 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.22-28x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL  a20010501b20010507c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02709naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245010500193300001800298520115800316650001301474650002301487650001101510650001601521650001501537650001401552650003801566650001501604650001101619650001101630650001701641650001001658651001101668651001801679651001101697651001801708653002401726653002001750653002501770653004201795653002001837653001801857653002801875700002301903773010601926852000902032856009202041930003302133946001302166655001202179IND4399304420221120125645.0071223e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439930442DNAL7 a181734772pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00765.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVAN KLEUNEN, MARK10aEffects of Self-Compatibility on the Distribution Range of Invasive European Plants in North America  ap. 1537-1544.  aMany plant species have been introduced to new continents, but only a small subset of these have become invasive. It has been predicted that self-compatible species, particularly those that do not need the services of pollinators, are more likely to establish and spread after long-distance dispersal. We tested whether this hypothesis, commonly called Baker's law, applies to 361 species that have invaded the United States from Europe. Species capable of autonomous seed production occurred in significantly more states than species requiring a pollen vector. Moreover, of the species that are not capable of autonomous seed production, self-compatible species occurred in significantly more states than those that are not self-compatible. The positive effect of autonomous seed production on the range of invasion was larger for abiotically pollinated species than for biotically pollinated species and for monocarpic species than for polycarpic species. These results support Baker's law, and we recommend that screening protocols for predicting invasiveness of species considered for introduction should include assessment of their breeding system. 3abreeding 3aintroduced species 3apollen 3apollinators 3aprediction 3ascreening 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDemography 2aPlants 2aPollen 2aReproduction 2aSeeds 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0aEurope 0aNorth America 0abiological invasion 0abreeding system 0anonindigenous plants 0aphylogenetically independent contrast 0aplant life span 0apollen vector 0avegetative reproduction1 aJOHNSON, STEVEN D.0 tConservation biology.g2007 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1537-1544dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00765.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02739naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001900141245015400160300001800314520147400332650002901806650001301835650002201848650001501870650002501885650002201910650001401932650001101946650002401957650001701981650001701998650002002015650001302035700002602048700002102074700002202095700002602117773007302143852000902216856008102225946001102306655001202317IND4444636220221120125613.0101105e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444463622DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwq1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Byung H.10aCAZymes Analysis Toolkit (CAT): Web service for searching and analyzing carbohydrate-active enzymes in a newly sequenced organism using CAZy database  ap. 1574-1584.  aThe Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme (CAZy) database provides a rich set of manually annotated enzymes that degrade, modify, or create glycosidic bonds. Despite rich and invaluable information stored in the database, software tools utilizing this information for annotation of newly sequenced genomes by CAZy families are limited. We have employed two annotation approaches to fill the gap between manually curated high-quality protein sequences collected in the CAZy database and the growing number of other protein sequences produced by genome or metagenome sequencing projects. The first approach is based on a similarity search against the entire nonredundant sequences of the CAZy database. The second approach performs annotation using links or correspondences between the CAZy families and protein family domains. The links were discovered using the association rule learning algorithm applied to sequences from the CAZy database. The approaches complement each other and in combination achieved high specificity and sensitivity when cross-evaluated with the manually curated genomes of Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 and Saccharophagus degradans 2-40. The capability of the proposed framework to predict the function of unknown protein domains and of hypothetical proteins in the genome of Neurospora crassa is demonstrated. The framework is implemented as a Web service, the CAZymes Analysis Toolkit, and is available at http://cricket.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/cat.cgi. 3aClostridium thermocellum 3aInternet 3aNeurospora crassa 3aalgorithms 3aamino acid sequences 3acomputer software 3adatabases 3agenome 3aglycosidic linkages 3aglycosylases 3ametagenomics 3aprotein domains 3aproteins1 aKarpinets, Tatiana V.1 aSyed, Mustafa H.1 aLeuze, Michael R.1 aUberbacher, Edward C.0 tGlycobiology.g2010 Dec., v. 20, no. 12 p.1574-1584x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwq1063Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03141naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245007200176520205100248650002302299650001402322650002102336650002302357650002402380650001402404650003202418650002402450650001502474653003202489700001702521773012402538852000902662930003302671945002502704946001102729961001502740655001202755IND4397330620221120125702.0071031s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439733062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPitt, W.C.10a12 Invasive Predators: a synthesis of the past, present, and future  aInvasive predators have had devastating effects on species around the world and their effects are increasing. Successful invasive predators typically have a high reproductive rate, short generation times, a generalized diet, and are small or secretive. However, the probability of a successful invasion is also dependent on the qualities of the ecosystem invaded. Ecosystems with a limited assemblage of native species are the most susceptible to invasion provided that habitat and climate are favorable. In addition, the number of invasion opportunities for a species increases the likelihood that the species will successfully establish. The list of routes of entry or pathways into many ecosystems continues to grow as transportation of goods into even the remotest areas become common. Species may enter new areas accidentally (e.g., hitchhikers on products) or as intentional introductions (e.g., sport fish). Pet releases, either accidental or intentional, are a growing area of concern as exotic pets become common and the desire for new or different species grows. Several invasive predators have had major effects on prey populations around the world (e.g., black rats, feral cats, mongoose) or have had devastating effects in isolated areas (e.g., brown treesnakes, Nile perch). Although management of established species has been a priority, eradication has been extremely difficult once a species has become widely distributed. However, little resources are directed toward interdiction efforts, removing incipient populations, or preventing new introductions. The regulation of animal movement in most countries and the inspection of products being moved were not developed to protect native ecosystems. Thus, species may be moved with relative ease between regions and countries. The most cost effective approach to invasive species management is to prevent new species from becoming established by providing funding for interdiction efforts, research prior to a species becoming widespread, and restricting the movement of species. 3aindigenous species 3apredators 3ainvasive species 3aintroduced species 3aecological invasion 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3awildlife management 3aecosystems 0ainvasive species management1 aWitmer, G.W.0 tPredation in organisms : a distinct phenomenon / Ashraf M.T.

It is unknown, however, whether these changes have occurred across larger regions of hardwood forests, which plant species are most vulnerable, or with which earthworm species such changes are associated most closely. To address these issues we conducted a regional survey in the Chippewa and Chequamegon national forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin (U.S.A.), respectively. We sampled earthworms, soils, and vegetation, examined deer browse in 20 mature, sugar-maple-dominated forest stands in each national forest, and analyzed the relationship between invasive earthworms and vascular plant species richness and composition. Invasion by Lumbricus was a strong indicator of reduced plant richness in both national forests. The mass of Lumbricus juveniles was significantly and negatively related to plant-species richness in both forests. In addition, Lumbricus was a significant factor affecting plant richness in a full model that included multiple variables. In the Chequamegon National Forest earthworm mass was associated with higher sedge cover and lower cover of sugar maple seedlings and several forb species. The trends were similar but not as pronounced in Chippewa, perhaps due to lower deer densities and different earthworm species composition. Our results provide regional evidence that invasion by Lumbricus species may be an important mechanism in reduced plant-species richness and changes in plant communities in mature forests dominated by sugar maples. 3aLumbricus 3asugars 3athreatened species 3aforbs 3ahardwood forests 3aseedlings 3amodels 3asurveys 3asoil 3anational forests 3aforest stands 3aspecies diversity 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aearthworms 3aecological invasion 3adeer 3ajuveniles 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aOligochaetaxphysiology 2aPlants 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSoil 2aTrees 3aMinnesota 3aChequamegon-Nicolet National Forest 3aWisconsin 0aChequamegon National Forest 0aUnited States 0aearthworm invasion 0aplant-species richness 0adeer herbivory 0aherbaceous layer 0aregional survey 0anorthern hardwood forests1 aFRELICH, LEE E.1 aREICH, PETER B.0 tConservation biology.g2007 Aug., v. 21, no. 4 p.997-1008dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00740.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03755naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245007300190300001800263520202200281650001502303650002002318650001902338650001202357650001702369650002302386650001402409650002602423650001002449650001702459650001302476650001202489650002202501650002202523650001002545650001202555650002802567650004702595650001402642650001002656650002202666650002402688650001002712651001202722651002902734651002002763653002402783653001602807653002002823653002302843700002202866773010602888852000902994856009203003930003303095946001303128655001203141IND4399305420221120090613.0071223e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439930542DNAL7 a181734802pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00808.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTOIVANEN, TERO10aBurning of Logged Sites to Protect Beetles in Managed Boreal Forests  ap. 1562-1572.  aNatural disturbance-based management and conservation strategies are needed to protect forest biodiversity. Boreal forests of northern Europe are typically clearcut and otherwise intensively managed for timber production. As a result, natural disturbances such as forest fires have became rare and the volume of dead wood has decreased. These changes have had a profound negative effect on species that depend on dead wood (saproxylic). Therefore, it is important to determine whether modifications of forest management methods can enhance the survival of these species. In our study area in southern Finland, we determined whether burning of logged sites and leaving trees (i.e., retention trees) on the sites benefited saproxylic, rare, and red-listed beetle species and how long the burned sites remained suitable habitat for these species. We surveyed the beetle fauna at 40 sites logged 1-16 years previously, 20 of which were burned after logging. The abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles were positively affected by burning, but the effect depended on the retention of trees in the otherwise clearcut stands. The difference between burned and unburned sites increased with the number of retention trees, and the effect of burning was not significant when there were fewer than approximately 15 retention trees/ha. Most important, the species groups that were unlikely to persist in ordinarily managed forests (rare saproxylic and red-listed beetles), benefited strongly from burning and tree retention. The species richness of saproxylic beetles decreased with time since logging at both burned and at unburned sites. We conclude that burning of logged sites and leaving an adequate number of retention trees may be useful in the conservation of disturbance-adapted species and can be used to improve the environmental quality of the matrix surrounding protected areas. Unfortunately, sites remained high-quality habitat for only a short time; thus, a continuum of burned areas must be ensured. 3aColeoptera 3aadverse effects 3aboreal forests 3aburning 3aclearcutting 3aconservation areas 3adead wood 3aenvironmental quality 3afauna 3aforest fires 3ahabitats 3alogging 3aspecies diversity 3atimber production 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxphysiology. 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aEcosystem 2aFires 2aForestryxmethods 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aTrees 3aFinland 3aNorthern European region 0aArctic regions. 0abeetle conservation 0adisturbance 0aretention trees 0asaproxylic species1 aKOTIAHO, JANNE S.0 tConservation biology.g2007 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1562-1572dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00808.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02909naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245007500200300001800275500002400293506007600317520177500393506003702168650001502205650001202220650002302232700001702255700001902272700002102291700002102312773013702333852000902470856008002479655001202559IND4406826020221207131732.0080613e20080615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440682602DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02537-072doi7 aPMC24465582pmcid7 a184411122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpaan, Suzanne10aEffect of Extraction and Assay Media on Analysis of Airborne Endotoxin  ap. 3804-3811.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe measurement of airborne endotoxins is thus far not standardized. Earlier studies reported higher endotoxin yields when Tween 20 was added to the media used for filter extraction and in the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. This study compared four common media and assessed the effects of Tween during extraction and analysis separately. Parallel airborne dust samples from five work environments (n = 250) were used to compare the four media (pyrogen-free water [PFW], PFW-Tween 20, PFW-Tris, and PFW-triethylamine-phosphate [TAP]) and an extraction time of 10 or 60 min. A subset of the extracts in PFW or PFW-Tween (n = 40) were analyzed in parallel LAL assays with PFW or PFW-Tween as the assay medium. The results produced by a shorter extraction time or the presence of Tris were similar to the results for the reference procedure (PFW and 60 min of shaking). The use of PFW-TAP showed overall lower yields and a deviant calibration curve. The presence of Tween in the extraction medium resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher endotoxin yields from all dust types, independent of the effect of Tween in the assay. Tween in the LAL assay, however, also strongly inhibited the reactivity of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) standard, thus shifting the calibration curve to higher values. The inhibition of LPS in test samples was less pronounced and varied between dust sources, resulting in enhanced calculated concentrations. This assay effect could be circumvented by diluting extracts at least 50-fold before the LAL assay. In conclusion, of the media tested, only Tween enhances the efficiency of endotoxin extraction from airborne dust samples in a consistent manner. We recommend extraction in PFW-Tween combined with dilution and LAL analysis in PFW.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendotoxins 3afilters 3aworking conditions1 aDoekes, Gert1 aHeederik, Dick1 aThorne, Peter S.1 aWouters, Inge M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 June 15, v. 74, no. 12 p.3804-3811dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02537-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02507naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245011500176300001800291520120600309650001001515650001501525650001801540650002001558650001101578650001701589650001401606650004001620650001701660650001101677650002501688650003201713650001901745700001801764700001501782700001401797773010501811852000901916856007701925930003302002945001302035946001302048655001202061IND2330747720221120075110.0030211e20021106dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233074772DNAL7 a124057542pmid7 a10.1021/jf020212a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCataldi, T.R.I.10aAssay of riboflavin in sample wines by capillary zone electrophoresis and laser-induced fluorescence detection  ap. 6643-6647.  aTo routinely assay the concentration of riboflavin (RF) in wines, a rapid and sensitive method was developed and evaluated. The method is based on a simple sample preparation, capillary zone electrophoretic separation and laser-induced fluorescence detection (CZE-LIF). Sample preparation required only dilution and filtration. Under optimized conditions, the limit of detection of riboflavin was 0.5 microgram/L, using a hydrodynamic sample introduction of 10 s at 54 mbar. The method was fully validated: the recovery of RF in wines was >95%. The concentrations of RF within the three sample types of Italian wines investigated here ranged from 69 to 151 microgram/L with a mean value (+/-SD) of 112 +/- 25 microgram/L, from 74 to 193 microgram/L with a mean value of 115 +/- 45 microgram/L, and from 156 to 292 microgram/L with a mean value of 226 +/- 40 microgram/L, for white, rose, and red wines, respectively. Such an accurate and highly sensitive CZE-LIF method represents a powerful improvement over previous methods in terms of sensitivity, simplicity, and efficiency. It is well suited to satisfy the demands for accurate and sensitive detection with minimal sample preparation and cleanup. 3awines 3ariboflavin 3afood analysis 3aelectrophoresis 3alasers 3afluorescence 3adetection 2aElectrophoresis, Capillaryxmethods 2aFluorescence 2aLasers 2aRiboflavinxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aWinexanalysis1 aNardiello, D.1 aScrano, L.1 aScopa, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Nov. 6, v. 50, no. 23 p.6643-6647x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf020212a3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02528naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001100156245008800167300001600255500001500271520107400286650001701360650001801377650001301395650001701408650002001425650002001445650001701465650001001482650001301492650002401505650002801529650002001557650002401577650002401601650002101625650003501646650003001681653002701711653002101738700001501759773010301774852000901877856007701886930003301963945001301996946001302009655001202022IND2330713420221120075221.0030204e20030115dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233071342DNAL7 a125171152pmid7 a10.1021/jf020644l2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, L.10aEffects of xylanase treatments on gelling and water-uptaking properties of psyllium  ap. 492-495.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of a commercial food-grade xylanase on the physicochemical properties of psyllium were evaluated. The enzymatic reactions were conducted in solid state at ambient temperature. The enzyme-treated psyllium preparations were analyzed and compared with the starting psyllium for their water-uptake properties, gelling capacities, soluble and insoluble fiber contents, and surface structures. The solid-state xylanase treatment significantly reduced both water-uptake and gelling capacities of psyllium (p < 0.01), with a slight decrease of soluble fiber content, whereas no effect on insoluble fiber content was observed. The xylanase treatment also resulted in a smoother surface structure of psyllium particles. In addition, no special equipment and operation were required to conduct the enzymatic reaction, which generated no waste. These data indicated a potential to improve the physicochemical properties of psyllium by use of the solid-state xylanase reactions to promote the utilization of psyllium fiber in functional foods for promoting human health. 3aglycosidases 3afiber content 3aPlantago 3ahealth foods 3afood processing 3aenzyme activity 3awater uptake 3ahulls 3agelation 2aChemistry, Physical 2aDietary Fiberxanalysis 2aGelsxchemistry 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPsylliumxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry 2aXylan Endo-1,3-beta-Xylosidase 2aXylosidasesxpharmacology 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0afunctional foods1 aPerret, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Jan. 15, v. 51, no. 2 p.492-495x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf020644l3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03399naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245017400173300001600347500001500363520119600378650001401574650001201588650001001600650001801610650002601628650002001654650002001674650002301694650001201717650001401729650001501743650000901758650001501767650001201782650001001794650001201804650002801816650002201844650006501866650002801931650001101959650002001970650003101990650004302021650000902064650002002073650002502093650002502118650006802143650000902211650001702220650001402237653002302251653002002274653002302294653001902317700002002336700002002356700001402376700001502390773010302405852000902508856007702517930003302594945001302627946001302640655001202653IND2330715520221120075058.0030204e20030115dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233071552DNAL7 a125171192pmid7 a10.1021/jf020693y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNestares, T.10aEffect of different soaking solutions on nutritive utilization of minerals (calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium) from cooked beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in growing rats  ap. 515-520.  a2019-12-04  aThe effects of the commonly used processing techniques of soaking (at different pH values) and cooking on the digestive and nutritive utilization of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium from common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were studied. Before the cooking step, the beans were soaked in solutions of acid (2.6 and 5.3) or basic (8.4) pH. Chemical and biological methods were used to determine nutritional parameters in growing rats, and the fiber content of the beans was established. As the pH of the soaking solution increased, so did mineral absorption and the apparent digestibility coefficient, which reached suitable values for growing rats, due to the reduced losses of soluble minerals and the increased food intake. Metabolic utilization also improved with increased pH of the soaking solution, although the values were, in general, low as a result of urinary losses under the experimental conditions. For the experimental period of 10 days, the femur and the muscle seem to be good metabolic indicators for calcium, but not for phosphorus or magnesium. The increased amount of cellulose in the soaked seed did not have a negative effect on the digestive utilization of minerals. 3asolutions 3aacidity 3abeans 3afiber content 3anutrient availability 3amineral content 3askeletal muscle 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3asoaking 3amagnesium 3aalkalinity 3arats 3aphosphorus 3acooking 3afemur 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aDietary Fiberxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMagnesiumxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aMale 2aNutritive Value 2aPhaseolusxchemistry 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSolutions 0acalcium absorption 0afood processing 0amineral absorption 0amineral uptake1 aBarrionuevo, M.1 aLopez-Frias, M.1 aVidal, C.1 aUrbano, G.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Jan. 15, v. 51, no. 2 p.515-520x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf020693y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03978naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245009000172300001600262500001500278520193900293650001302232650002802245650001702273650002202290650001902312650001202331650001702343650001202360650002202372650001202394650001602406650001802422650002902440650001902469650001702488650001202505650001202517650001302529650001002542650001702552650002002569650001302589650003502602650002702637650001302664650005202677650003302729650002802762653001402790653001502804653001002819700001702829700002402846700002302870700001202893700001402905700001702919700001502936700001502951700001802966773010302984852000903087856007703096930003303173945001303206946001303219655001203232IND2330713320221120064604.0030204e20030115dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233071332DNAL7 a125171142pmid7 a10.1021/jf020701a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCodon, A.C.10aNew Saccharomyces cerevisiae baker's yeast displaying enhanced resistance to freezing  ap. 483-491.  a2019-12-04  aThree procedures were used to obtain new Saccharomyces cerevisiae baker's yeasts with increased storage stability at -20, 4, 22, and 30 degrees C. The first used mitochondria from highly ethanol-tolerant wine yeast, which were transferred to baker's strains. Viability of the heteroplasmons was improved shortly after freezing. However, after prolonged storage, viability dramatically decreased and was accompanied by an increase in the frequency of respiratory-deficient (petite) mutant formation. This indicated that mitochondria were not stable and were incompatible with the nucleus. The strains tested regained their original resistance to freezing after recovering their own mitochondria. The second procedure used hybrid formation after protoplast fusion and isolation on selective media of fusants from baker's yeast meiotic products resistant to parafluorphenylalanine and cycloheximide, respectively. No hybrids were obtained when using the parentals, probably due to the high ploidy of the baker's strains. Hybrids obtained from nonisogenic strains manifested in all cases a resistance to freezing intermediate between those of their parental strains. Hybrids from crosses between meiotic products of the same strain were always more sensitive than their parentals. The third method was used to develop baker's yeast mutants resistant to 2-deoxy-D-glucose (DOG) and deregulated for maltose and sucrose metabolism. Mutant DOG21 displayed a slight increase in trehalose content and viability both in frozen doughs and during storage at 4 and 22 degrees C. This mutant also displayed a capacity to ferment, under laboratory conditions, both lean and sweet fresh and frozen doughs. For industrial uses, fermented lean and sweet bakery products, both from fresh and frozen doughs obtained with mutant DOG21, were of better quality with regard to volume, texture, and organoleptic properties than those produced by the wild type. 3afreezing 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3abakers yeast 3aprotoplast fusion 3afrozen storage 3ahybrids 3afermentation 3atexture 3amitochondrial DNA 3asucrose 3abreadmaking 3ahybridization 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abaking quality 3afrozen dough 3amaltose 3amutants 3agenomics 2aBread 2aFermentation 2aFood Technology 2aFreezing 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxanalysis 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aMutation 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aalpha-Glucosidasesxanalysis 2abeta-Fructofuranosidase 0astability 0aresistance 0adough1 aRincon, A.M.1 aMoreno-Mateos, M.A.1 aDelgado-Jarana, J.1 aRey, M.1 aLimon, C.1 aRosado, I.V.1 aCubero, B.1 aPenate, X.1 aCastrejon, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Jan. 15, v. 51, no. 2 p.483-491x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf020701a3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03120naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245015900171300001600330500001500346520144300361650000801804650001801812650001601830650003701846650001301883650001501896650004801911650002001959650003101979650001602010650002402026650003002050650002802080650001402108650002002122650001902142650001002161653001602171653001402187653002302201700001302224700001602237700001502253700001502268700002302283773010302306852000902409856007702418930003302495945001302528946001302541655001202554IND2330715020221120064457.0030204e20030115dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233071502DNAL7 a125171182pmid7 a10.1021/jf02106272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, M.10aEpimerization of tea catechins and O-methylated derivatives of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate: relationship between epimerization and chemical structure  ap. 510-514.  a2019-12-04  aEpimerization at C-2 of O-methylated catechin derivatives and four major tea catechins were investigated. The epimeric isomers of (-)-epicatechin (I), (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (II), (-)-epigallocatechin (III), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (IV), and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-(3-O-methyl)-gallate (V) in green tea extracts increased time-dependently at 90 degrees C. The epimerization rates of authentic tea catechins in distilled water are much lower than those in tea infusion or in pH 6.0 buffer solution. The addition of tea infusion to the authentic catechin solution accelerated the epimerization, and the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, disodium salt (Na2EDTA) decreased the epimerization in the pH 6.0 buffer solution. Therefore, the metal ions in tea infusion may affect the rate of epimerization. The proportions of the epimers to authentic tea catechins [III, IV, V, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-(4-O-methyl)gallate (VI)] in pH 6.0 buffer solution after heating at 90 degrees C for 30 min were 42.4%, 37.0%, 41.7%, and 30.4%, respectively. These values were higher than those of I and II (23.5% and 23.6%, respectively). The O-methylated derivatives at the 4'-position on the B ring of IV and VI were hardly epimerized. These results suggest that the hydroxyl moiety on the B ring of catechins plays an important role in the epimerization in the order 3',4',5'-triol type > 3',4'-diol type >> 3',5'-diol type. 3atea 3aisomerization 3amethylation 3astructure-activity relationships 3acatechin 3ametal ions 2aCatechinxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMethylation 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aSolutions 2aStereoisomerism 2aTeaxchemistry 2aWater 0aderivatives 0aflavanols 0achemical structure1 aSano, M.1 aYoshida, R.1 aDegawa, M.1 aMiyase, T.1 aMaeda-Yamamoto, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2003 Jan. 15, v. 51, no. 2 p.510-514x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf02106273Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02377naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001800178245008200196520097300278650003101251650001901282650001001301650001601311650000901327650002101336650001801357650002401375650001001399650001301409650002501422650001501447650001501462650001101477650001401488650001801502650002001520653003101540653002701571653001801598700001901616773013301635852000901768930003301777945002501810946001101835961001301846655001201859IND4409715120221120054908.0080902s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440971512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYermiyahu, U.10aBinding and electrostatic attraction of trace elements to plant root surfaces  aAn important feature of the biogeochemistry of trace elements in the rhizosphere is the interaction between plant-root surfaces and the ions of the soil solution. These ions may accumulate in the aqueous phases of cell surfaces external to the plasma membranes (PMs). In addition, ions may bind to cell wall (CW) components or to the PM surface with variable strength. In this chapter we shall describe the distribution of ions among the extracellular phases using electrostatic models (i.e., Gouy-Chapman-Stern and Donnan-plus-binding models) for which parameters are now available. Many plant responses to ions correlate well with computed PM-surface activities but only poorly with activities in the soil solution. These responses include ion uptake, ion-induced intoxication, and the alleviation of intoxication by other ions. We illustrate our technique for the quantitative resolution of multiple ion effects using cell-surface activities in nonlinear equations. 3aelectrostatic interactions 3atrace elements 3aroots 3arhizosphere 3aions 3abinding capacity 3asoil solution 3aextracellular space 3acells 3asurfaces 3asurface interactions 3acell walls 3aadsorption 3amodels 3aequations 3aphytotoxicity 3aplasma membrane 0aextracellular accumulation 0aplant-ion interactions 0acell surfaces1 aKinraide, T.B.0 tBiogeochemistry of trace elements in the rhizosphere /  edited by P.M.

The sex and slaughtered age of the animals had no statistical significance in the intramuscular fatty acids. Furthermore, the livestock production system showed differences in the fatty acid profiles from the Longissimus dorsi. The feeding system showed significant differences in PUFA content (P<0.001) higher in freedom extensive production system that semi extensive system, whereas MUFA content was significantly (P<0.001) higher in semi extensive system. This major PUFA content in freedom extensive production showed a significant (r=0.70, P<0.01) correlation with C18:3n−3 content and can be attributed to their eaten only pasture until slaughtered. The higher MUFA contents (P<0.001) observed for semi extensive production system foals were very significant (r=0.98, p<0.01) correlated with C18:1cis−9 content and less significant (r=0.81, P<0.01) correlated with C16:1cis−9 content. In addition, the data reinforced the evidence that foals from extensive production system on wood pasture have a higher nutritional quality (mainly due to the higher levels of n−3 PUFA) when compared to concentrate-fed foals, as a result of the beneficial effects of grass on meat fatty acid profiles. 3aage at slaughter 3afoals 3agrasses 3aranching 3afatty acid composition 3alivestock production 3apastures 3agender 3afree range husbandry 3ameat 3ameat quality 3anutritive value 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3alongissimus muscle 3aanimal feeding 3afeed concentrates 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aanimal age 3ahorse breeds 2aAdipose Tissuexchemistry 2aAge Factors 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aDiet 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aHorses 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistry 2aPoaceae 2aSex Characteristics 0alongissimus dorsi1 aFuciños, Clara1 aPurriños, Laura1 aFranco, Daniel0 tMeat science.g2010 Nov., v. 86, no. 3 p.825-831dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.07.004 7aarticle02618naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002300143245009500166300001600261500002400277520143000301650001201731650002001743650002301763650001101786650001601797650001401813650001001827650002401837650001401861650001101875650001301886650002101899650001901920650001201939650001601951650000901967650002001976650001001996651001002006773010102016852000902117856004602126655001202172IND4463363820221123013439.0120605s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446336382DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10260974233512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnim-Kwapong, G.J.10aPotential of some Neotropical Albizia species as shade trees whenreplanting cacao in Ghana  ap. 185-193.  aIncludes references  aThe Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana has embarked on studies to support the replanting of cacao (Theobroma cacao L) in areas, which previously carried the crop but are now degraded. A key component of the studies is to identify fast growing tree species capable of ameliorating degraded soils and ultimately providing suitable shade for cacao. A screening trial involving ten Albizia species in a randomized complete block design experiment was therefore initiated in 1996 to evaluate growth rate, leaf biomass production, carbon and nitrogen contents and decomposition rates. Over a four-year period, Albizia adenocephala, A. guachapele, A. niopoides, A. plurijuga,A. saman and A. tomentosa showed promising results, with 12.2 to 14.5 m height and between 12.4 and 22.4 cm stem diameter (DBH). Crown diameter ranged between 6.1 and 10.1 m, with light transmission through crowns averaging 50-65% of full sunlight throughout the year. Half-yearly leaf biomass production ranged between 3and 10 t ha–1, yielding between 0.07 and 0.32 t N ha-1 from each coppicing. Half-life for carbon and nitrogen release from leaves of the six species averaged 31.0 and 32.0 days respectively. This short-term release of C and N is an indication of the quality of the leaf prunings. These species can provide early ground cover, appropriate shade, N and organic matter requirements for re-establishing cacao on denuded and degraded lands. 3aAlbizia 3aTheobroma cacao 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acocoa beans 3acoppicing 3acrops 3aexperimental design 3ahalf life 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3apruning 3ashade trees 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3astems 3aGhana0 tAgroforestry systems.g2003, v. 58, no. 3 p.185-193dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-43667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026097423351 7aarticle02511naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245015500160300001600315500002400331520124200355650001901597650002101616650002601637650000901663650001101672650001201683650002201695650001201717650002501729650002101754650001401775650001501789650001101804650001301815650001001828650001001838700001901848700002001867700002401887773009701911852000902008856004802017655001202065IND4430116820221123013250.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443011682DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-009-0016-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wenju10aBotanical composition, production and nutrient status of an originally Lolium perenne-dominant cut grass sward receiving long-term manure applications  ap. 355-367.  aIncludes references  aEffects of long-term applications (50, 100 and 200 m³ ha⁻¹y⁻¹) of pig and cow slurries on yield, botanical composition and nutrient content of herbage of an original perennial ryegrass sward were assessed in a three-cut silage system and compared with unamended and fertilized controls in the 36th year of the experiment. Cow slurry at 50 m³ ha⁻¹ produced similar annual herbage DM yield to 200 kg ha⁻¹ fertilizer N in 2006, whereas about 100 m³ ha⁻¹ pig slurry were required to produce a similar amount of DM. The highest slurry application rate significantly influenced sward botanical composition without depressing DM yield. The principal invading species were creeping bent and meadow grasses (similar to findings at a previous assessment in 1981) except in the unamended control (which were common bent and Yorkshire fog). Perennial ryegrass remained a main species in plots receiving fertilizer (31 % annual DM yield) and low slurry rates (38 %) but declined to 3 % annual DM yield at the highest slurry rate where the ability of ryegrass to utilize slurry N and P may have been affected by chemically or physically induced deficiencies of other nutrients (e.g. Ca) or direct physical effects such as smothering. 3aLolium perenne 3aapplication rate 3abotanical composition 3acows 3aforage 3agrasses 3along term effects 3ameadows 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3apig manure 3asilage 3aslurries 3asward 3aswine1 aZhu, Yong-Guan1 aChristie, Peter1 aLaidlaw, Adam Scott0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Jan., v. 326, no. 1-2 p.355-367dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-0016-z 7aarticle01738naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245004900165300001800214500002400232520078000256650002001036650001601056650001501072650001401087650002401101650001601125650001001141651000901151700002101160700001501181700001701196773011801213852000901331856004801340655001201388IND4413997920221123013516.0081219e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441399792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-008-9319-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Khanjari, S.10aMorphological spike diversity of Omani wheat  ap. 1185-1195.  aIncludes references  aLittle is known about the diversity of field crops in Oman.

The standardized phenotypic diversity index (H') was with 0.66 higher for quantitative characters than for qualitative characters (0.52) in tetraploid wheats and with 0.63 and 0.62, respectively, in hexaploid wheats.

At large spatial scales, concurrence between patterns of richness, rarity, and composition of species and higher taxa is generally high. Only a few researchers, however, have examined this relationship at the local scale, which is frequently the relevant scale in land-use conflicts. We investigated the reliability of the higher-taxon approach in assessing patterns of species richness, rarity, and composition at the local scale. We studied diversity patterns of three commonly used surrogate taxa: vascular plants, ground-dwelling beetles, and moths. We conducted year-round field surveys for these taxa in the Jerusalem Mountains and the Judean foothills, Israel. Richness and composition of species were highly correlated with richness and composition of genera for all taxa. At the family level, correlations with richness and composition of species were much lower. Excluding monotypic genera and families did not affect these relations. Rarity representation based on higher taxa varied considerably depending on the taxon, and rarity scale and was weaker compared with richness and composition representation. Cumulative richness curves of species and genera showed similar patterns, leveling off at equivalent sampling efforts. Genus-level assessments were a reliable surrogate for local patterns of species richness, rarity, and composition, but family-level assessments performed poorly. The advantage of using coarse taxonomic scales in local diversity surveys is that it may decrease identification time and the need for experts, but it will not reduce sampling effort. 3aColeoptera 3aexperts 3ahills 3aland use 3amoths 3amountains 3aresearchers 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3avascular plants 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxclassificationxphysiology. 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aMothsxclassificationxphysiology. 2aPlantsxclassification 2aPopulation Dynamics 3aIsrael 0aIsrael 0aconservation planning 0aJerusalem Mountains 0aspecies diversity indicators 0aspecies rarity 0asurrogate taxa1 aDAYAN, TAMAR1 aCHIKATUNOV, VLADIMIR1 aKRAVCHENKO, VASILIY0 tConservation biology.g2007 Dec., v. 21, no. 6 p.1506-1515dBlackwell Publishing Incx0888-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00823.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04058naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100001700182245018400199300001600383500002400399500001500423506007600438520188100514506003702395650002502432650003002457650001402487650002202501650001502523650001002538650001402548650002202562650001002584650001202594650001802606650001002624650002302634650006102657650006002718650003802778650001402816650008902830650003002919650004402949650002402993650006103017650001503078653001303093700002503106700002203131700002003153700002403173773011203197852000903309856008103318856003303399655001203432IND4391697320221207132501.0070523e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439169732DNAL7 a173694272pmid7 aPMC19138032pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.107.0966282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuto, Hideki10aSpecificity and Similarity of Functions of the Aux/IAA Genes in Auxin Signaling of Arabidopsis Revealed by Promoter-Exchange Experiments among MSG2/IAA19, AXR2/IAA7, and SLR/IAA14  ap. 187-196.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs indicated by various and some overlapped phenotypes of the dominant mutants, the Aux/IAA genes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) concomitantly exhibit a functional similarity and differentiation. To evaluate the contributions of their expression patterns determined by promoter activity and molecular properties of their gene products to Aux/IAA function, we examined phenotypes of transgenic plants expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged msg2-1/iaa19, axr2-1/iaa7, or slr-1/iaa14 cDNA by the MSG2 or AXR2 promoter. When driven by the MSG2 promoter (pMSG2), each GFP-tagged cDNA caused the msg2-1 phenotype, that is, the wild-type stature in the mature-plant stage, long and straight hypocotyls in the dark, reduced lateral root formation, relatively mild agravitropic traits in hypocotyls, and a normal gravitropic response in roots. However, development of one or two cotyledonary primordia was often arrested in embryogenesis of the pMSG2::axr2-1::GFP and pMSG2::slr-1::GFP plants, resulting in monocotyledonary or no cotyledonary seedlings. Such defects in embryogenesis were never seen in pMSG2::msg2-1::GFP or the msg2-1, axr2-1, or slr-1 mutant. The MSG2 promoter-GUS staining showed that expression of MSG2 started specifically in cotyledonary primordia of the triangular-stage embryos. When driven by the AXR2 promoter (pAXR2), each GFP-tagged mutant cDNA caused, in principle, aberrant aboveground phenotypes of the corresponding dominant mutant. However, either the axr2-1::GFP or slr-1::GFP cDNA brought about dwarf, agravitropic stems almost identical to those of axr2-1, and the pAXR2::msg2-1::GFP and pAXR2::slr-1::GFP hypocotyls exhibited complete loss of gravitropism as did axr2-1. These results showed functional differences among the msg2-1, axr2-1, and slr-1 proteins, though some phenotypes were determined by the promoter activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aphenotype 3acomplementary DNA 3ahypocotyls 3astems 3aseedlings 3atransgenic plants 3agenes 3amutants 3aembryogenesis 3aroots 3aindole acetic acid 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aPhenotype 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTransgenes 0aproteins1 aWatahiki, Masaaki K.1 aNakamoto, Daisuke1 aKinjo, Masataka1 aYamamoto, Kotaro T.0 tPlant physiology.g2007 May, v. 144, no. 1 p.187-196dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.0966283Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle03796naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001500181245011200196300001800308500002400326506007600350520214000426506003702566650001502603650001602618650002002634650001802654650001602672650001102688650004402699650001502743650002302758650001002781650001302791650001502804650003302819650001702852650001602869650001402885650002202899650001802921650001302939650002202952700001602974700002102990700001803011773013603029852000903165856008003174655001203254IND4410692320221207124136.0080926e20081001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441069232DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01315-082doi7 aPMC25659832pmcid7 a186767062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Zheng10aMolecular Detection of Fungal Communities in the Hawaiian Marine Sponges Suberites zeteki and Mycale armata  ap. 6091-6101.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSymbiotic microbes play a variety of fundamental roles in the health and habitat ranges of their hosts. While prokaryotes in marine sponges have been broadly characterized, the diversity of sponge-inhabiting fungi has barely been explored using molecular approaches. Fungi are an important component of many marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and they may be an ecologically significant group in sponge-microbe interactions. This study tested the feasibility of using existing fungal primers for molecular analysis of sponge-associated fungal communities. None of the eight selected primer pairs yielded satisfactory results in fungal rRNA gene or internal transcribed spacer (ITS) clone library constructions. However, 3 of 10 denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) primer sets, which were designed to preferentially amplify fungal rRNA gene or ITS regions from terrestrial environmental samples, were successfully amplified from fungal targets in marine sponges. DGGE analysis indicated that fungal communities differ among different sponge species (Suberites zeteki and Mycale armata) and also vary between sponges and seawater. Sequence analysis of DGGE bands identified 23 and 21 fungal species from each of the two sponge species S. zeteki and M. armata, respectively. These species were representatives of 11 taxonomic orders and belonged to the phyla of Ascomycota (seven orders) and Basidiomycota (four orders). Five of these taxonomic orders (Malasseziales, Corticiales, Polyporales, Agaricales, and Dothideomycetes et Chaetothyriomcetes incertae sedis) have now been identified for the first time in marine sponges. Seven and six fungal species from S. zeteki and M. armata, respectively, are potentially new species because of their low sequence identity (<=98%) with their references in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis indicated sponge-derived sequences were clustered into "marine fungus clades" with those from other marine habitats. This is the first report of molecular analysis of fungal communities in marine sponges, adding depth and dimension to our understanding of sponge-associated microbial communities.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgaricales 3aCorticiales 3aDothideomycetes 3aMalasseziales 3aPolyporales 3aclones 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aecosystems 3afungal communities 3agenes 3ahabitats 3ahost range 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amarine fungi 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aprokaryotic cells 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater 3asequence analysis1 aLi, Binglin1 aZheng, Chengchao1 aWang, Guangyi0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Oct. 1, v. 74, no. 19 p.6091-6101dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01315-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01921naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001900181245006600200300001800266500002400284506007600308520040000384506003700784650002100821650002700842650001000869650004100879650005900920650001300979650006700992700001801059700001801077700002201095700001901117700002401136700001701160700002701177773013401204852000901338856008001347856004801427655001201475IND4384177920221207124154.0061007e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438417792DNAL7 a170212362pmid7 aPMC16102822pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00588-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorvinen, Eila10aMycobacteria and Fungi in Moisture-Damaged Building Materials  ap. 6822-6824.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn contrast to the growth of fungi, the growth of mycobacteria in moisture-damaged building materials has rarely been studied.

Three different probes have been identified that can be used to detect DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms between strains of this species. The strains used in this study differ only in terms of their geographic origin or genetic background. One of the probes used is the bacteriophage vector M13, and the other two are repetitive sequences derived from the medfly genome based on a weak homology to M13. Within a strain, each probe produces a consistent restriction fragment profile that is not affected by the method or timing of DNA extraction. Between strains, when M13 is used as a probe, an average of 10% of the observable bands are polymorphic. Use of the medfly genomic sequences as a probe increases the proportion of polymorphic bands between strains up to 30%. The fact that genetic differences between even such closely related strains can be reliably detected by this method holds great promise for studies of insect pests including the ability to monitor the movements of pest species, determining the extent of genetic variation in pest populations, and in making identifications from otherwise unidentifiable material. 3aCeratitis capitata 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic variation 3astrain differences 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA Fingerprinting 2aDNA Probes 2aDipteraxgenetics 2aGenetic Variation 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSpecies Specificity1 aMcInnis, D.O.1 aArcangeli, L.0 tGenome.g1992 June, v. 35, no. 3 p.528-533wJournal:jnl41235x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01148naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245004200148300001600190520019000206650002500396650001000421650004500431650001100476650003500487650000900522651001400531651001400545653004900559700001800608773011100626852000900737939003300746945000800779946001100787655001200798991614485800742620221122051718.0830317e198107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830026872DNAL7 a73014232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, T.10aIsospora belli infection in Australia  ap. 593-595.  aIsospora belli, 29-year-old man, clinical case report, poor results with metronidazole but tinidazole cured infection, had just returned from 6-month visit to Asia: Melbourne, Australia 3adisease transmission 2aAdult 2aCoccidiosisxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aIsosporaxgrowth & development 2aMale 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0aIsospora belli (Protozoa)Homo sapiens (Host)1 aDe Boer, W.G.0 tPathology.

However, wind-pollinated angiosperm trees have not been studied adequately in this respect. The present study analyses the relationships among parental genetic similarity, outcrossing distances, progeny vigour and mortality in Polylepis australis (Rosaceae), a wind-pollinated treeline species endemic to Argentina. We investigated whether spatial genetic structuring occurs in anthropogenically fragmented P. australis woodlands of the Córdoba Mountains. We also performed a controlled crossing experiment using pollen collected from different distances. Genetic variability (using RAPD-PCR), vigour (N-metabolism capacity) and mortality of the resulting progeny were contrasted with progeny from unmanipulated flowers. We found a continuous decrease in parental genetic similarity with spatial distance among mates and an increase in N-metabolism capacity in the progeny produced from pollen at increasing distances, as well as a very high mortality of seedlings resulting from short-distance crosses. Additionally, our results suggest that there is still fragment connectivity in P. australis through long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow. 3aRosaceae 3aflowers 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding depression 3aindigenous species 3amortality 3amountains 3aoutcrossing 3apollen 3aprogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseedlings 3atreeline 3atrees 3avigor 3awoodlands 3aArgentina1 aHensen, Isabell1 aRenison, Daniel1 aWesche, Karsten1 aPloch, Sebastian1 aDueñas, Juan Rondan1 aCocucci, Andrea1 aJung, Klaus0 tPlant ecology.g2009 Nov., v. 205, no. 1 p.155-164dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-009-9605-4 7aarticle02540naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245011400173300002000287500002400307520100600331650001601337650002001353650001201373650001001385650002701395650001601422650002701438650001601465650001701481650002401498650005001522650002001572650002701592650003001619650002301649650003301672650002401705650003801729650002401767650002401791651001201815700002501827773010801852852000901960856007701969655001202046IND4462863420221122025148.0120306s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446286342DNAL7 a220264602pmid7 a10.1021/jf202775m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanner, Gina10aLC-MS/MS Analysis of Neonicotinoid Insecticides in Honey: Methodology and Residue Findings in Austrian Honeys  ap. 12271-12277.  aIncludes references  aAn analytical method for the simultaneous determination of residues of eight neonicotinoid insecticides and two metabolites in honey using LC-MS/MS was developed and validated. Two approaches of sample preparation were investigated, with the final method involving acetonitrile extraction and subsequent cleanup by dispersive solid-phase extraction (QuEChERS type). Validation was based on quintuplicate analysis at three fortification levels and showed satisfactory recoveries (60-114%) and high precision (RSDs between 2.7 and 12.8%). Low limits of detection and quantification could be achieved for all analytes ranging from 0.6 to 5 micrograms/kg and from 2 to 10 micrograms/kg, respectively. Investigations of Austrian honey samples revealed the presence of acetamiprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam residues in honey; however, no sample exceeded the maximum residue limits. On average, flower honey samples contained neonicotinoid residues in higher quantities compared to forest honey samples. 3aacetamiprid 3adetection limit 3aflowers 3ahoney 3amaximum residue limits 3ametabolites 3asolid phase extraction 3athiacloprid 3athiamethoxam 2aAnabasinexanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aHoneyxanalysis 2aInsecticidesxanalysis 2aNitro Compoundsxanalysis 2aOxazinesxanalysis 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aPyridinesxanalysis 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aThiazinesxanalysis 2aThiazolesxanalysis 0aAustria1 aCzerwenka, Christoph0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Dec. 14, v. 59, no. 23 p.12271-12277x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf202775m3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03174naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245013700171300001600308500002400324500001500348520183100363650002302194650001202217650001902229650002402248650002902272650001002301650001002311650002202321650001202343650002102355650002302376650001502399650001202414651003202426651001802458653001502476700002402491700002102515700002302536773009302559852000902652856005502661655001202716IND4440559920221121235808.0100730e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444055992DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06016.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunn, Windy A.10aChange within and among forest communities: the influence of historic disturbance, environmental gradients, and community attributes  ap. 425-434.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUnderstanding how ecological communities change over time is critical for biodiversity conservation, but few long-term studies directly address decadal-scale changes in both the within- and among-community components of diversity. In this study, we use a network of permanent forest vegetation plots, established in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (USA) in 1978, to examine the factors that influence change in community composition within and among communities. In 2007, we resampled 15 plots that were logged in the late 1920s and 15 plots that had no documented history of intensive human disturbance. We found that understory species richness decreased by an average of 4.3 species over the 30-yr study period in the logged plots, but remained relatively unchanged in the unlogged plots. In addition, tree density decreased by an average of 145 stems ha⁻¹ in the logged plots, but was relatively stable in the unlogged plots. However, we found that historic logging had no effect on within-community understory or tree compositional turnover during this time period. Instead, sites at lower elevations and sites with lower understory biomass in 1978 had higher understory compositional turnover than did sites at higher elevations and sites with higher understory biomass. In addition, sites with lower soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) and with lower tree basal area in 1978 had higher tree compositional turnover than did sites with higher soil CEC and higher tree basal area. Among-community similarity was unchanged from 1978 to 2007 for both the logged and unlogged plots. Overall, our results indicate that human disturbance can affect plant communities for decades, but the extent of temporal change in community composition may nevertheless depend more on environmental gradients and community attributes. 3atemporal variation 3alogging 3anational parks 3acommunity structure 3acation exchange capacity 3astems 3atrees 3aspecies diversity 3abiomass 3astand basal area 3aforest communities 3aunderstory 3aforests 3aGreat Smoky Mountain region 3aUnited States 0abasal area1 aJenkins, Michael A.1 aBrown, Claire B.1 aSanders, Nathan J.0 tEcography.g2010 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.425-434dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.06016.x 7aarticle02599naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245011600175300002000291500002400311520103300335650002101368650001101389650001701400650002301417650002201440650001201462650001401474650001601488650002201504650002101526650001101547650001201558650002901570650001101599650002701610650001801637650002701655650002301682650003101705650003201736650002401768700002101792700002301813700002001836700001901856773010801875852000901983856007701992655001202069IND4462902220221121224421.0120313s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446290222DNAL7 a220109622pmid7 a10.1021/jf20320222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaar, Ruud ter10aCross-Linking Behavior and Foaming Properties of Bovine α-Lactalbumin after Glycation with Various Saccharides  ap. 12460-12466.  aIncludes references  aalpha-Lactalbumin was glycated via the Maillard reaction in the dry state using various mono- and oligosaccharides. The reaction resulted not only in coupling of the saccharides to alpha-lactalbumin but also in cross-linked proteins. The glycation rate and the extent of cross-link formation were highly dependent on the saccharide used. Glycation by arabinose and xylose led to a very fast protein cross-link formation, whereas glucose showed a relatively low protein cross-linking ability. The stability of foams, created using the various glycated protein samples, depended on the type of saccharide used, the extent of glycation, and possibly the amount of cross-linked protein. Compared to nonmodified alpha-lactalbumin, glycation with rhamnose and fucose improved foam stability, whereas application of glucose, galacturonic acid, and their oligosaccharides did not exert a clear effect. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that dehydration of the Amadori products is an indicator of the formation of protein cross-links. 3aAmadori products 3acattle 3acrosslinking 3afoaming properties 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3aglycation 3alactalbumin 3amass spectrometry 3aoligosaccharides 3axylose 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydratesxchemistry 2aCattle 2aCross-Linking Reagents 2aGlycosylation 2aLactalbuminxchemistry 2aMaillard Reaction. 2aMonosaccharidesxchemistry 2aOligosaccharidesxchemistry 2aChemical Phenomena.1 aWestphal, Yvonne1 aWierenga, Peter A.1 aSchols, Henk A.1 aGruppen, Harry0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Dec. 14, v. 59, no. 23 p.12460-12466x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf20320223Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02542naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245007000170300002000240500002400260520104000284650002101324650001701345650001301362650001201375650002801387650001701415650001801432650001601450650001201466650001601478650002301494650004701517650005001564650001001614650002401624650001001648650002301658650004601681650004601727700001801773700001701791700001601808700001801824773010801842852000901950856007701959655001202036IND4462903520221121141605.0120313s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446290352DNAL7 a220294022pmid7 a10.1021/jf20311542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Wen10aSynthesis of Glucose–Fipronil Conjugate and Its Phloem Mobility  ap. 12534-12542.  aIncludes references  aPhloem-mobile insecticides are preferred to achieve economically useful activity. However, only a few phloem-mobile synthetic insecticides are available. One approach to converting nonmobile insecticides into phloem-mobile types is introducing sugar to the parent compound. To test whether the addition of a glucose group to a non-phloem-mobile insecticide enables conversion into phloem-mobile, N-[3-cyano-1-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-[(trifluoromethyl)sulfinyl]-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]-1-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-4-methanamine (GTF) was prepared through click chemistry. A phloem-mobility test in Ricinus communis L. seedlings confirmed that GTF was mobile in the sieve tubes. Although GTF exhibited lower insecticidal activity against the third-instar larvae of Pzlutella xylostella than fipronil did, it can be reconverted into fipronil in adult plants of castor bean, thereby offsetting the decrease of insecticidal activity. Therefore, the presence of a glucose core confers phloem mobility to fipronil. 3aRicinus communis 3acastor beans 3afipronil 3aglucose 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticides 3amature plants 3asieve tubes 2aAnimals 2aCastor Bean 2aGlucosexchemistry 2aGlucosidesxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aInsecticidesxchemical synthesisxmetabolism. 2aLarva 2aMolecular Structure 2aMoths 2aPhloemxmetabolism 2aPyrazolesxchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aTriazolesxchemical synthesisxchemistry.1 aWu, Han-Xiang1 aXu, Han-Hong1 aHu, An-Long1 aLu, Meng-Ling0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Dec. 14, v. 59, no. 23 p.12534-12542x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf20311543Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02661naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245011000179300002000289500002400309520104600333650001601379650002401395650002801419650001701447650002601464650001901490650000901509650001701518650004801535650002101583650002201604650001901626650003601645650002701681650002001708650003501728650002501763650002401788650003001812650002101842650003601863650001001899700001801909700002201927773010801949852000902057856007702066655001202143IND4462905320221121061730.0120313s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446290532DNAL7 a220499922pmid7 a10.1021/jf203273y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnyango, Joseph O.10aImprovement in Water Stability and Other Related Functional Properties of Thin Cast Kafirin Protein Films  ap. 12674-12682.  aIncludes references  aImprovement in the water stability and other related functional properties of thin (<50 micrometer) kafirin protein films was investigated. Thin conventional kafirin films and kafirin microparticle films were prepared by casting in acetic acid solution. Thin kafirin films cast from microparticles were more stable in water than conventional cast kafirin films. Treatment of kafirin microparticles with heat and transglutaminase resulted in slightly thicker films with reduced tensile strength. In contrast, glutaraldehyde treatment resulted in up to a 43% increase in film tensile strength. The films prepared from microparticles treated with glutaraldehyde were quite stable in ambient temperature water, despite the loss of plasticizer. This was probably due to the formation of covalent cross-linking between free amino groups of the kafirin polypeptides and carbonyl groups of the aldehyde. Thus, such thin glutaraldehyde-treated kafirin microparticle films appear to have good potential for use as biomaterials in aqueous applications. 3aacetic acid 3aambient temperature 3abiocompatible materials 3acrosslinking 3afunctional properties 3aglutaraldehyde 3aheat 3apolypeptides 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3atensile strength 3awater temperature 2aDrug Stability 2aFood Packagingxinstrumentation 2aGlutaralxpharmacology 2aHot Temperature 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPepsin Axmetabolism 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistry 2aTensile Strength 2aTransglutaminasesxpharmacology 2aWater1 aTaylor, Janet1 aTaylor, John R.N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Dec. 14, v. 59, no. 23 p.12674-12682x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf203273y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02938naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004400097040001800141100001400159245011600173300001400289520194100303650001802244650002502262650001902287650001702306650001402323650001602337650001302353700001802366700001602384773009002400852000902490856005702499939003302556946001102589655001202600991614474940742620221121061644.0880113e198707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870853272DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0874252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, N.K.10aLoss of viability in lettuce seeds and the accumulation of chromosome damage under different storage conditions  ap. 85-96.  aLoss of seed viability in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) during storage is associated with an increase in the frequency of cells in the surviving seeds showing chromosome damage during first mitoses. The relation is linear when probit of the frequency of aberrant cells is plotted as a function of probit percentage normal germination. The slope of the relation, however, varies according to moisture content so that the proportion of aberrant cells for any given loss of germination increases with decrease in moisture content over the range 13.0–5.5 per cent. At 3.3 per cent moisture content, however, the proportion of aberrations was no greater than at 5.5 per cent moisture content; and at 18.1 per cent moisture content the proportion was no less than at 13.0 per cent moisture content. Despite these differences, the increase in chromosomal aberrations per unit time for a given temperature was always less the lower the moisture content. Diplontic selection markedly reduced the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and eliminated the differences in these frequencies between the different storage treatments. But even after five weeks' growth, root tips from aged seed still contained about twice as many aberrant cells as compared with similar root tips derived from the original seed stock. Studies on the frequency of recessive mutations indicated that excessive amounts of heritable mutations were not present in the progenies of aged seed, even when stored at moisture contents as low as 5.5 per cent. All this and other evidence reinforces the view that orthodox seeds for genetic conservation should be stored at not more than about 5 per cent moisture content, and that even lower moisture contents are worth considering. The results also emphasise the need for maintaining a high regeneration standard, i.e. the percentage to which seed viability is allowed to fall during storage before the seed stock is regenerated. 3awater content 3aabnormal development 3aLactuca sativa 3aseed storage 3aviability 3achromosomes 3amutation1 aRoberts, E.H.1 aEllis, R.H.0 tAnnals of botany.g1987 July, v. 60, no. 1 p.85-96wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087425  a00000000b19880113c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03177naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245010700174300002000281500002400301520136600325650002701691650001601718650001801734650001201752650002201764650003801786650001301824650001901837650003101856650001701887650001501904650002101919650000901940650001601949650002001965650002201985650002502007650004502032650001502077650002202092650004202114650004402156650002102200650003502221650003102256700001702287700001202304700001502316700001702331700001802348700001502366773010802381852000902489856007702498655001202575IND4462905220221121050712.0120313s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446290522DNAL7 a220594422pmid7 a10.1021/jf203167f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Fengling10aStructural Properties of Hydrolyzed High-Amylose Rice Starch by α-Amylase from Bacillus licheniformis  ap. 12667-12673.  aIncludes references  aHigh-amylose cereal starch has a great benefit on human health through its resistant starch (RS) content. Enzyme hydrolysis of native starch is very helpful in understanding the structure of starch granules and utilizing them. In this paper, native starch granules were isolated from a transgenic rice line (TRS) enriched with amylose and RS and hydrolyzed by alpha-amylase. Structural properties of hydrolyzed TRS starches were studied by X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and differential scanning calorimetry. The A-type polymorph of TRS C-type starch was hydrolyzed faster than the B-type polymorph, but the crystallinity did not significantly change during enzyme hydrolysis. The degree of order in the external region of starch granule increased with increasing enzyme hydrolysis time. The amylose content decreased at first and then went back up during enzyme hydrolysis. The hydrolyzed starches exhibited increased onset and peak gelatinization temperatures and decreased gelatinization enthalpy on hydrolysis. These results suggested that the B-type polymorph and high amylose that formed the double helices and amylose-lipid complex increased the resistance to BAA hydrolysis. Furthermore, the spectrum results of RS from TRS native starch digested by pancreatic α-amylase and amyloglucosidase also supported the above conclusion. 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aX-radiation 3aalpha-amylase 3aamylose 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3agelatinization 3agelatinization temperature 3ahuman health 3ahydrolysis 3aresistant starch 3arice 3arice starch 3astarch granules 2aAmylosexanalysis 2aBacillusxenzymology 2aGlucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidasexmetabolism 2aHydrolysis 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aPancreatic alpha-Amylasesxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxchemistry 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aStarchxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aalpha-Amylasesxmetabolism1 aMan, Jianmin1 aXu, Bin1 aHu, Maozhi1 aGu, Minghong1 aLiu, Qiaoquan1 aWei, Cunxu0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Dec. 14, v. 59, no. 23 p.12667-12673x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf203167f3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01271naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245002800133500001500161520045500176650001700631650001800648650002700666650002600693650002500719650001700744653001300761773013400774852000900908939003300917945000800950946001100958655001200969991614474220742620221121050718.0830407s1980    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830038272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepulveda, B.10aImmunology of amebiasis  a2019-12-06  aEntamoeba histolytica, human, immunology, review: humoral immune reactions (antiamebic antibodies in serum; specific antibodies in serological diagnosis of invasive amebiasis; specific antibodies in seroepidemiology of amebiasis in Mexico); cellular immune reactions (intradermal reaction; macrophage inhibition factor test); immunity and antiamebic immunization (immunity as consequence of infection; experimental immunization of laboratory animals) 3aepidemiology 3aserodiagnosis 3acell-mediated immunity 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aprotozoal infections 3aimmunization 0aimmunity0 tMolecules, cells, and parasites in immunology / edited by Carlos Larralde [et al.].dNew York : Academic Press, Inc., 1980.7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830407c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02452naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245005900164300001400223500002400237500001500261520117100276650002601447650002301473650002201496650000901518650002501527650002001552650002901572650002101601650001801622650001401640650001601654650002001670650001301690650002801703653001001731700001901741700002001760700001801780700002101798700002201819773008401841852000901925856004801934655001201982IND4387489520221121050544.0070204e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438748952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10267-006-0327-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanda, Satoshi10aPhotoregulated tyrosinase gene in Polyporus arcularius  ap. 34-41.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  atyr1, the gene for tyrosinase, which is related to pigmentation of mycelia in dikaryotic strains, has been cloned and characterized from the basidiomycete Polyporus arcularius. The gene was present in a single copy in the genome. The putative amino acid sequence of Tyr1 was very similar to that of gLeTyr from Lentinula edodes. However, the carboxy-terminal region of the amino acid sequence of Tyr1 was variable among L. edodes, Agaricus bisporus, and this fungus. In the 5'-untranslated region near the initiation codon, a consensus sequence to the Dof1 binding site that is involved in light-regulated gene expression in maize was found. Transcription of tyr1 was photoregulated; transcription of tyr1 in P. arcularius was activated in light mycelia and inactivated in the dark mycelia. These results suggest that tyr1 is a light-regulated gene regulated by a Dof-like transcription factor in P. arcularius. Although the enzyme activity was observed only in a dikaryon, tyr1 was transcripted in both dikaryotic and monokaryotic strains. Thus, activation of the precursor of Tyr1 may require a posttranslational processing event that is developmentally regulated. 3atranscription factors 3aconsensus sequence 3aAgaricus bisporus 3acorn 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aLentinula edodes 3abinding sites 3aPolyporus 3astart codon 3aenzyme activity 3amycelium 3a5' untranslated regions 0agenes1 aAimi, Tadanori1 aMasumoto, Seita1 aNakano, Kaori1 aKitamoto, Yutaka1 aMorinaga, Tsutomu0 tMycoscience.g2007 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.34-41dSpringer-Verlagx1340-35407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10267-006-0327-3 7aarticle01135naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110242005900130245006200189300001600251500002400267520026600291650002300557650001500580650001600595650002400611653001600635700001700651700001800668773008200686852000900768939003300777946001100810655001200821IND9300557620221120232715.0930128e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND930055762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDautrebande, S.10aMobility tests of pesticides in agricultural soils.

The segregation pattern was followed by the presence or absence of the 18S + 26S rRNA locus using in situ hybridization and Southern analysis of the TaqI digest. The BC(1)F(2) progeny segregated for four to seven NOR chromosomes. This confirmed that one homoeologue carried a nucleolar organizing region (NOR), while in the other it was absent or greatly reduced in copy number. That is, for example, 5J(1) and 6J(1) carry a NOR site, while 5J(2) and 6J(2) both lack NORs. Both in situ hybridization and Southern analysis confirmed that presence or absence of NORs did not segregate at random. The NOR on 5J had a 2.9-kb TaqI fragment and this NOR was present in the progeny less frequently than expected. The 6J NOR that carried a 1.1- and 0.8-kb fragment was transmitted to the progeny with a normal frequency. The results are discussed with respect to the implications for creating reconstructed genomes and recovering the genetic variation of a polyploid in addition lines. 3aElytrigia 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aribosomal DNA 3aloci 3aribosomal RNA 3achromosome transmission 3aintergeneric hybridization 3ahybrids 0anucleolus organizer 0asegregation1 aMolnar, S.J.1 aFedak, G.0 tGenome =.g1992 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.985-991x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03399naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002300184245013800207300001400345500002400359520178900383650003002172650001902202650001702221650001102238650001902249650001702268650003202285650001002317650002602327650001302353650001602366650001102382650001102393650001002404650001802414650002002432650001302452650001402465651001202479653002402491653002302515700002202538773010702560852000902667856008802676930003302764945002502797946001102822655001202833IND4402457120221120212753.0080306e20080220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440245712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2007.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aF500 0aX1001 aCortini, Francesco10aEvaluation of competitive effects of green alder, willow and other tall shrubs on white spruce and lodgepole pine in Northern Alberta  ap. 82-91.  aIncludes references  aIn boreal forests of western Canada, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud.) and white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) often grow together with numerous tall shrubs such as green alder (Alnus crispa (Ait.) Pursh) and little-tree willow (Salix spp.). In an area south of Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada, we examined the effects of shrubs, herbs and other trees on nutrient and light availability and growth of white spruce and lodgepole pine. For white spruce the best competition measure (tested against volume increments of the past 3 years) was visually estimated % ground cover times the height of the competitor (VCHT) with light (DIFN) ranking in third place. For lodgepole pine, DIFN was the best competition measure for predicting volume increment and the best competition index was again VCHT. Taller conifers had a stronger competitive effect than tall shrubs, with their effect on white spruce being larger than that on lodgepole pine. Comparison of the effects of alder and willow indicates that both species are having negative effects on growth of pine and spruce on these sites with green alder having a stronger influence on spruce than pine due to the smaller size of the spruce. Herbaceous cover was having more effect on white spruce than lodgepole pine and may be related to both their height and differences in rooting depth. The results did not show any significant relationship (p >0.05) between nitrogen availability and cover of alder and willow and between conifer foliar nutrient concentrations and cover of alder and willow. Our study suggests that the current Alberta regeneration standards may be overestimating the effect that competing vegetation has on conifer growth since significant growth reduction occurs only at high shrub densities. 3ainterspecific competition 3aboreal forests 3aforest trees 3ashrubs 3aPinus contorta 3aPicea glauca 3aAlnus viridis subsp. crispa 3aSalix 3anutrient availability 3anitrogen 3atree growth 3aheight 3avolume 3alight 3atransmittance 3ashade tolerance 3aconifers 3aequations 3aAlberta 0acompetition indices 0avegetation control1 aComeau, Philip G.0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Feb. 20, v. 255, no. 1 p.82-91dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.08.0273Available from publisher's Web site  a20081023b20081101c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/10/23  aNon-US 7aarticle04058naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001600184245010300200300001400303500002400317500001500341520251700356650002002873650001202893650003402905650001702939650001202956650002102968650001702989650001103006650002503017650001803042650002103060650001903081650001703100651001003117653002303127653001303150653001503163700001503178700002203193700001603215773010703231852000903338856008803347930003303435945002503468946001103493655001203504IND4402455420221120212828.0080306e20080220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440245542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2007.06.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK800 0aE110 0aK2501 aLi, Hongmei10aPast, present and future land-use in Xishuangbanna, China and the implications for carbon dynamics  ap. 16-24.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLand use/land cover change is an important driver of global change and changes in carbon stocks. Estimating the changes in carbon stocks due to tropical deforestation has been difficult, mainly because of uncertainties in estimating deforestation rates and the biomass in the forest that have been cut. In this study, we combined detailed land-use change over a 27-year period based on satellite images and forest inventory data to estimate changes in biomass carbon stocks in the Xishuangbanna prefecture (1.9millionha) of China. Xishuangbanna is located in southwestern China in the upper watershed of the Mekong River, and the major forest types are tropical seasonal rain forest, mountain rain forest, and subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest. In the past when the region was completely forested the total biomass carbon would have been approximately 212.65±8.75TgC. By 1976 forest cover had been reduced to 70%, and in addition many forests had been degraded resulting in a large decrease in the total biomass carbon stocks (86.97±3.70TgC). From 1976 to 2003, the mean deforestation rate was 13 722hayear⁻¹ (1.12%), and this resulted in the loss of 370,494ha of forest, and by 2003 total biomass carbon stocks had been reduced to 80.85±2.64TgC. The annual carbon emissions due to land-use change, mainly forest conversion to agriculture and rubber plantations, were 0.37±0.03TgCyear⁻¹ between 1976 and 1988 and 0.13±0.04TgCyear⁻¹ between 1988 and 2003. During the next 20 years, if rubber plantations expand into forests outside of reserves, shrublands, grasslands, and shifting cultivation below 1500m the total biomass carbon stocks of Xishuangbanna will decrease to 76.45±1.49TgC in 2023. This would reflect a loss of 4.13±1.14TgC between 2003 and 2023, or an annual loss of 0.21±0.06TgCyear⁻¹. Alternatively, if rubber plantations only expand into areas of shifting cultivation below 1500m, and all areas presently in shrublands and grasslands are allowed to recover into secondary forests, total biomass carbon stock of the region would increase to 92.65±3.80TgC in 2023. Under this scenario, the growth of existing forests and the expansion of new forests would result in a net sequestration of 0.60±0.06TgCyear⁻¹. This study demonstrates that the uncertainty of biomass estimates can be greatly reduced if detailed land-use analyses are combined with forest inventory data, and that slight changes in future land-use practices can have large implications for carbon fluxes. 3aland use change 3ahistory 3abroadleaved evergreen forests 3aforest trees 3atropics 3avegetation cover 3arain forests 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3adeforestation 3aforest inventory 3aremote sensing 3aspatial data 3aChina 0arubber plantations 0aland use 0avegetation1 aMa, Youxin1 aAide, T.

Their antioxidant activities were expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC) in mg/100 g apple or mg/100 mL of the reference chemical compounds in 10 and 30 min using the ABTS(radical-) and DPPH(radical) scavenging assays, respectively. The antioxidant capacity of Gala apples and seven phenolic standards, determined by both ABTS(radical-) and DPPH(radical) scavenging assays, showed a dose-response of the first-order. Fresh Gala apples had a VCEAC of 205.4 +/- 5.6 mg/100 g using the ABTS assay, and the relative VCEACs of phenolic standards were as follows: gallic acid > quercetin > epicatechin > catechin > vitamin C > rutin > chlorogenic acid > Trolox. With the DPPH radical assay, the VCEAC of fresh Gala apples was 136.0 +/- 6.6 mg/100 g, and the relative VCEACs of seven phenolic standards were, in decreasing order, as follows: gallic acid > quercetin > epicatechin > catechin greater than or equal to vitamin C > Trolox > rutin > chlorogenic acid. Because the ABTS assay can be used in both organic and aqueous solvent systems, employs a specific absorbance at a wavelength remote from the visible region, and requires a short reaction time, it is a more desirable method than the DPPH assay. Therefore, it is recommended that antioxidant capacity be expressed as vitamin C mg/100 g equivalent (VCEAC) using the ABTS assay. 3apolyphenols 3aapples 3afree radicals 3atesting 3aoxidation 3aextracts 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aAscorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aBenzothiazoles 2aBiphenyl Compounds 2aCatechinxpharmacology 2aChlorogenic Acidxpharmacology 2aChromansxpharmacology 2aFree Radical Scavengers 2aFree Radicals 2aGallic Acidxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aMalusxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhenolsxpharmacology 2aPicrates 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aPlants, Ediblexchemistry 2aQuercetinxpharmacology 2aRutinxpharmacology 2aSulfonic Acids 0acomparisons 0adpph radical 0achemical reactions 0aactivity 0aabts radical anion1 aLee, K.W.1 aLee, H.J.1 aLee, C.Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 June 19, v. 50, no. 13 p.3713-3717x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf020071c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02532naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245012000123300001600243500002300259500001500282520153100297650002301828650002501851650001201876650001701888650001101905650002001916650001901936650000901955653001601964653001301980653002701993700001902020773006602039852000902105939003302114946001102147655001202158IND9300581020221120160806.0930128e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930058102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerg, C.10aCold-sensitive chromosome regions and their relation to constitutive heterochromatin in Cestrum parqui (Solanaceae)  ap. 921-930.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aThe structural cause for cold-induced undercondensation of certain chromosome segments is still unknown, and no consistent cytochemical correlations have emerged as yet. Cestrum parqui belongs to one of the few plant genera having chromosomes with such cold-sensitive regions. In the present study, four heterochromatin classes were distinguished in the karyotype of this species by sequential fluorochrome staining with chromomycin A3, DAPI, and D 287/170, and C-banding, N-banding, and silver impregnation. (i) Cold-sensitive regions (CSRs): Banding behaviour indicates AT-rich constitutive heterochromatin. Silver impregnation occurs after cold-treatment from interphase to metaphase. CSRs are subject to polymorphisms. Quantitatively they are only a minor component of the band endowment. (ii) Nucleolar organizers: Two pairs were identified. Banding behaviour indicates GC-rich constitutive heterochromatin. The nucleolar constrictions proper are morphologically indistinct at mitotic metaphase and lose silver impregnation capability at that stage. (iii) Non-nucleolar CMA-positively fluorescent C-bands: There is only one polymorphic paracentromeric band in this class. (iv) Low-fluorescence N-bands. These show quenched fluorescence with all fluorochromes and occur as clusters of small bands scattered over all chromosome arms. This class of bands is quantitatively predominating. Dull fluorescence with both the "GC-specific" chromomycin and the "AT-specific" DAPI is an anomaly but not completely unknown in plants. 3achromosome banding 3acytogenetic analysis 3aCestrum 3afluorescence 3asilver 3aheterochromatin 3acell nucleolus 3acold 0achromosomes 0astaining 0achromosome conensation1 aGreilhuber, J.0 tGenome =.g1992 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.921-930x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03310naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002100195245007300216300001600289500002400305500001500329520127300344650001501617650001801632650002701650650002801677650001201705650002301717650002301740650001501763650002701778650001601805650001901821650001601840650001601856650000801872650002001880650001501900650001701915650002101932650002301953650001701976650001901993650002702012650002402039650001902063653003502082653004602117653002802163653003102191700002202222700002602244700002902270700002202299700002402321773008802345852000902433856008902442930003302531945002502564946001102589655001202600IND4402452320140724000000.0080306e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440245232DNAL7 a220624682pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ202 0aQ5021 aMartin, Alberto.10aCharacterisation of microbial deep spoilage in Iberian dry-cured ham  ap. 475-484.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe purpose of this work was to investigate the micro-organisms involved in overlooked “bone taint” spoilage of dry-cured Iberian hams. The physico-chemical characteristics of spoiled hams with 12 and 24 months of ripening, showing initial signs of alteration, were analyzed and their correlations with microbial counts studied. The spoilage potential of different microbial groups was assessed by the relationship between the microbial counts and the proteolysis level of spoilage as observed in the degradation of myofribrillar and sarcoplasmic protein fractions and in the changes in free amino acids. Non-enteric gram-negative bacteria (NEGN) were the dominant microbial group, showing a positive correlation with the moisture of spoiled hams. The Catalase-positive cocci (GPCP) growth was favoured by high NaCl concentrations in the spoiled hams, whereas the counts of Enterobacteriaceae were negatively affected by high NaCl concentration. The highest proteolytic microorganisms were the Gram-negative microbial groups playing Enterobacteriaceae a major role in the undesirable changes of the texture properties of the spoiled hams. With respect to the sensorial analysis, a synergy between NEGN and GPCP was observed in most of the strongly spoiled samples. 3adried meat 3afood spoilage 3aGram-positive bacteria 3abacterial contamination 3atexture 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3asensory evaluation 3asarcomeres 3aGram-negative bacteria 3acured meats 3amicrobial load 3aproteolysis 3aplate count 3aham 3asodium chloride 3ameat aging 3asalt content 3afree amino acids 3afood contamination 3ameat quality 3afood pathogens 3asarcoplasmic reticulum 3aprotein degradation 3awater activity 0acatalase-positive cocci (GPCP) 0anon-enteric gram-negative bacteria (NEGN) 0amicrobial contamination 0aphysicochemical properties1 aBenito, María J.1 aHernández, Alejandro1 aPérez-Nevado, Francisco1 aCórdoba, Juan J.1 aCórdoba, María G.0 tMeat science.g2008 Apr., v. 78, no. 4 p.475-484dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2007.07.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20110617b20110701c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/04/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02548naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245010800174300001800282500001500300520086900315650001601184650002301200650002101223650001301244650001801257650001901275650000901294650001501303650001501318650001201333650004601345650003301391650001801424650004101442650002001483650002201503650002001525650003101545650001801576650001901594653001901613653002801632653001901660653001401679653001201693700001501705773010501720852000901825856007701834930003301911945001301944946001301957655001201970IND2330768920221122052332.0030211e20021204dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233076892DNAL7 a124526572pmid7 a10.1021/jf025713a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContarini, G.10aVolatile fraction of milk: comparison between purge and trap and solid phase microextraction techniques  ap. 7350-7355.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this research was to validate the results obtained previously by purge and trap (PT) and to investigate the ability of solid phase microextraction (SPME), a more rapid and less expensive technique, to discriminate drinking milk subjected to different heat treatments (i.e., pasteurization, ultrahigh temperature, "in-bottle" sterilization) and produced at different factories. The data obtained by both methods were processed by multivariate statistical analysis. PT and SPME showed comparable repeatability, although with different performances for the yield of extraction, and allowed the three milk categories to be distinguished.

Topographic roughness index (TRI) is a measure of variability in the landscape surface and a proxy of the potential of disturbances to propagate across the earth's surface, such as a wildland fire burning across a landscape. We describe the significance of TRI, present methods for calculation, and demonstrate the utility of the index in a fire frequency prediction model. The model was used to show how the relationships between topography, fire, and humans changed during the period of AD 1620-1850 for a study area (5180km²) in Missouri, USA. The model predicted historic mean fire return intervals from TRI and two human population variables. The model explained 46% of the variation in mean fire return intervals and demonstrated that topographic roughness was most important in controlling fire frequency during the period AD 1620-1780 when human population density was lowest (<0.35humans/km²). Due to increases in human population, mean fire return intervals were shortened by up to one-fourth of their original length and the landscape became more homogeneous with respect to fire frequency despite topographic roughness. The use of TRIs in wildland fire research aid in quantifying and visualizing topographic variability and could be applicable to multiple scales and ecosystem processes. 3aforest fires 3afrequency 3ahistory 3atopography 3asurface roughness 3ahuman population 3apopulation size 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3afire ecology 3alandscape ecology 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 3aspatial data 3aMissouri 3aOzarks 0afire intervals 0aindices 0afire history 0atopographic roughness index 0afire frequency1 aGuyette, Richard P.0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Feb. 10, v. 254, no. 3 p.463-473dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.08.0293Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/10/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02439naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245012600154300001800280500001500298520108600313650001901399650001801418650001501436650002001451650001201471650002201483650000901505650001501514650001501529650002401544650001901568650001801587653002301605653001101628653003101639653001301670700001901683700001701702773010501719852000901824856007701833930003301910945001301943946001301956655001201969IND2330770420221122041533.0030211e20021204dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233077042DNAL7 a10.1021/jf020199u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUndeland, I.10aRecovery of functional proteins from herring (Clupea harengus) light muscle by an acid of alkaline solubilization process  ap. 7371-7379.  a2019-12-04  aProteins from herring (Clupea harengus) light muscle were extracted using acidic or alkaline solubilization; 92 and 89% of the initial muscle proteins were solubilized at pH 2.7 and 10.8, respectively, of which 96 and 94% were recovered during precipitation at pH 5.5. Consistency of the pH-adjusted muscle homogenates increased with increased raw material age and homogenization intensity; it declined following holding on ice. Some hydrolytic myofibrillar protein degradation occurred during cold storage of the acidified (pH 2.7) homogenates. With alkalized homogenates, hydrolysis was negligible. The total lipid content changed from 0.13 g/g of proteir in the muscle to 0.04 g/g of protein in both the acid- and alkali-produced protein isolates. Corresponding values for the phospholipid content were from 0.037 to 0.02 g/g of proteins. Acid- and alkali-produced proteins made gels with equal strain and color. Stress values were equal or lower in acid- versus alkali-produced protein gels. When ice-stored raw material was used, strain and stress values of gels were reduced. 3asolubilization 3aacidification 3amyofibrils 3askeletal muscle 3aherring 3ahydrochloric acid 3agels 3ahydrolysis 3asolubility 3aprotein degradation 3aacid treatment 3aphospholipids 0aprotein extraction 0alipids 0asodium hydroxide treatment 0astrength1 aKelleher, S.D.1 aHultin, H.O.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Dec. 4, v. 50, no. 25 p.7371-7379x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf020199u3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02861naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001900166245011600185300001600301500002400317500001500341520138700356650001901743650002201762650001001784650001701794650002101811650002501832650001801857650002301875650002201898650002401920650002101944650001601965650001901981651001002000653000902010700001902019700002102038700002102059773010902080852000902189856008802198930003302286945002502319946001102344655001202355IND4402455220221122030209.0080306e20080220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440245522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2007.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK0011 aJomura, Mayuko10aSpatial variation in respiration from coarse woody debris in a temperate secondary broad-leaved forest in Japan  ap. 149-155.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe measured the rates of respiration from snags and logs (“coarse woody debris”, CWD) of Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc.) to examine the rate of decomposition and CO₂ efflux from these materials in a temperate secondary broad-leaved forest in Japan. At this site, a high quantity of CWD of P. densiflora had accumulated as a result of pine wilt disease during the 1970s. Respiration rates were measured using a dynamic closed chamber method combined with an infrared gas analyzer. We measured the respiration rate of 7 samples of snags and 10 samples of logs from August 2003 to January 2004. The responses of the respiration rates of snags (R snag) and logs (R log) to changing temperature were both exponential and the responses to water content were quadratic, and the same function could be used to estimate annual values of both R snag and R log. Intensive measurements of water contents of snags and logs showed a marked difference in water content. The mean water content of snags was 20% of log water content. This difference was likely responsible for the observed difference in annual R snag and R log. The decay rate constants estimated from the respiration rates measurement of snags and logs were 0.019 and 0.081year⁻¹, respectively. Despite being lower than R log, R snag was a significant compartment of the CWD carbon budget at this site. 3acarbon dioxide 3atemperate forests 3asnags 3adecayed wood 3acell respiration 3aglobal carbon budget 3awater content 3aseasonal variation 3aspatial variation 3acoarse woody debris 3aPinus densiflora 3atemperature 3abiodegradation 3aJapan 0alogs1 aKominami, Yuji1 aDannoura, Masako1 aKanazawa, Yoichi0 tForest ecology and management.g2008 Feb. 20, v. 255, no. 1 p.149-155dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.09.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20081024b20081101c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/10/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02634naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001200156245012500168300001800293520122500311650001601536650001701552650002301569650002301592650002201615650006001637650002701697650005101724650002101775650004101796650003001837650003101867650002501898700001301923700001301936773010601949852000902055856007702064930003302141945001302174946001302187655001202200IND2328998720221122004627.0020919e20020619dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232899872DNAL7 a120591612pmid7 a10.1021/jf020055f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Y.10aSeparation, characterization, and quantitation of benzoic and phenolic antioxidants in American cranberry fruit by GC-MS  ap. 3789-3794.  aA GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids (benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric (0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid.

Changes in the headspace of aroma compounds were monitored over the whole packaging period (47 days) using the HS-SPME method. Initially, the concentration of methanethiol increased before reaching a plateau. This evolution could be linked to the growth of Brevibacterium linens. During the shelf life of cheese, levels of acetic acid and 3-methylbutanoic acid remained constant, whereas butane-2,3-dione, 3-hydroxybutan-2-one, and hydroxypropan-2-one levels gradually declined and acetone and 3-methylbutanol levels dropped sharply to a plateau. Changes in odor could be related to changes of the rind, which behaved as a barrier, strongly influencing the distribution of volatile compounds in the headspace. Using a gas chromatography-olfactometry technique without separation, it was shown that the SPME extract was representative of the cheese odor. 3acheeses 3acheese ripening 3aBrevibacterium linens 3avolatile compounds 3aodors 3aextraction 3agas chromatography 3asmell 2aBrevibacteriumxgrowth & development 2aCheesexanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aChromatography, Gas 2aFood Handling 2aFood Preservation 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHumans 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aSmell 2aTime Factors 2aVolatilization1 aDucruet, V.1 aJouquand, C.1 aGratadoux, J.J.1 aFeigenbaum, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 June 19, v. 50, no. 13 p.3810-3817x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01171073Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02543naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001600156245013900172300001800311500001500329520101000344650002101354650001401375650001201389650001601401650002001417650002001437650001501457650003101472650003501503650002501538650002201563650002301585651001701608651001701625653002301642700001801665700001601683700001701699700001401716700002401730700002001754773010601774852000901880856007701889930003301966945001301999946001302012655001202025IND2328998620221121222848.0020919e20020619dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232899862DNAL7 a120591602pmid7 a10.1021/jf011642o2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDicko, M.H.10aComparison of content in phenolic compounds, polyphenol oxidase, and peroxidase in grains of fifty sorghum varieties from Burkina Faso  ap. 3780-3788.  a2019-12-04  aAnalysis of fifty sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] varieties used in Burkina Faso showed that they have different contents of phenolic compounds, peroxidase (POX), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Most of the varieties (82%) had a tannin content less than 0.25% (w/w). POX specific activity was higher than the monophenolase and o-diphenolase specific activities of PPO. For POX, there was a diversity of isoforms among varieties. No clear correlation could be made between the quantitative imposition of the grain in phenolics, PPO, and POX, and resistance of plant to pathogens. In general, varieties good for a thick porridge preparation ("to") had low phenolic compounds content and a medium POX activity. From the red varieties, those used for local beer ("dolo") had a high content in phenolic compounds and PPO, and a low POX activity. The variety considered good for couscous had a low POX content. The characteristics might be useful as selection markers for breeding for specific applications. 3acatechol oxidase 3avarieties 3atannins 3afood grains 3aSorghum bicolor 3aenzyme activity 3aperoxidase 2aCatechol Oxidasexanalysis 2aHydrolyzable Tanninsxanalysis 2aPeroxidasexanalysis 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPoaceaexchemistry 3aBurkina Faso 0aBurkina Faso 0aphenolic compounds1 aHillhorst, R.1 aGruppen, H.1 aTraore, A.S.1 aLaane, C.1 aBerkel, W.J.H. van.1 aVoragen, A.G.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 June 19, v. 50, no. 13 p.3780-3788x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf011642o3Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02897naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153100001700162245011200179300001600291500002400307500001500331520133000346650002801676650002201704650001001726650001801736650003501754650002901789650001201818650002701830650001101857650002401868650001101892650002401903653001701927700001501944700001901959700002101978700002001999700001902019700001502038700001602053700001902069773010802088852000902196856009302205930003302298945002502331946001102356655001202367IND4402461520221121222717.0080306e20080303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440246152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL2101 aMadgwick, S.10aEffects of treatment with GnRH from 4 to 8 weeks of age on the attainment of sexual maturity in bull calves  ap. 177-188.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn bull calves an early transient increase in circulating concentrations of LH occurs between 6 and 20 weeks of age. This has been shown to influence reproductive development and performance later in life. In an attempt to hasten the onset of sexual maturity, bull calves (HerefordxCharolais) were treated (im) with 120ng/kg of GnRH (n =6) twice every day from 4 to 8 weeks of age; control calves received saline (n =6). Injection of GnRH resulted in an LH pulse in all animals. GnRH treated bulls displayed more rapid testicular growth rates between 22 and 44 weeks of age. Sexual maturity (SC>=28cm) was achieved earlier in GnRH treated bulls compared to saline treated bulls (41.7±2.22 and 47.0±0.45 weeks of age, respectively) and this was confirmed by age of sexual maturity based on ejaculate characteristics (>50 million spermatozoa, >10% motility; 45.0±0.86 and 49.0±1.13 weeks of age for GnRH and control treated bull calves, respectively; P <0.05). We concluded that treatment with GnRH, twice daily, from 4 to 8 weeks of age, prior to the endogenous early increase in plasma LH concentrations, could increase in plasma LH concentrations, advance testicular development and reduce age at puberty in beef bull calves. This may provide the basis for a simple regimen to hasten sexual development in the bull calf. 3aintramuscular injection 3ahormone secretion 3abulls 3adose response 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3amale reproductive system 3apuberty 3atesticular development 3adosage 3ahormonal regulation 3acalves 3aluteinizing hormone 0atherapeutics1 aBagu, E.T.1 aDuggavathi, R.1 aBartlewski, P.M.1 aBarrett, D.M.W.1 aHuchkowsky, S.1 aCook, S.J.1 aBeard, A.P.1 aRawlings, N.C.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2008 Mar. 3, v. 104, no. 2-4 p.177-188dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.02.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20080709b20080801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/06/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03360naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189100002100198245011700219300001600336500002400352500001500376520166700391650002102058650001602079650001702095650002302112650001302135650001702148650001402165650000902179650001602188650002302204650002602227650001502253650002302268650001302291651000902304653001602313653002202329653003602351700003002387700002102417700002402438700002902462773010802491852000902599856009302608930003302701945002502734946001102759655001202770IND4402461620221121222842.0080306e20080303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440246162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2007.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL210 0aL100 0aE400 0aE2001 aMeadows, Cheyney10aEvaluation of a contract breeding management program in Ohio dairy herds: Test day summary and economic measures  ap. 189-200.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA field study was conducted to assess the impact of a contract breeding program that was offered by a breeding co-operative and featured tail chalking and daily evaluation of cows for insemination by co-operative technicians; dairy employees no longer handled estrous detection and insemination activities. From early 2002until mid-2004, herd-level test day summary records related to production and reproduction were obtained for 32 herds identified as well-managed client herds of the breeding co-operative. Using analyses that controlled for other predictors and random herd-level effects, average days to first service were less by 13 days (P =0.0037) and estrous detection rate was greater by 12% (P =0.0011) for program than for non-program herds. Although first service conception rate was slightly less and the program herds used 0.34 more services per conception (P =0.1488) than non-program herds, the program herds averaged 16 fewer days before pregnancy (P =0.028). Test day summary information and representative estimates of feed, milk, and semen prices were used in a spreadsheet-based model to estimate a partial budget annuity value for an average cow in each herd on each test day. Value of an average cow from a contract herd did not significantly differ from a non-contract herd, even though the analyses suggested an economic benefit for the program herds; the modeling did not, however, account for costs of the program implementation. Additional analyses did not find any significant associations between technician and on days to first service, first service conception rate, estrous detection rate, services per conception, or days open. 3aestrus detection 3adairy herds 3ainsemination 3adairy cooperatives 3avalidity 3adairy cattle 3apregnancy 3atail 3acontractors 3aeconometric models 3adairy herd management 3aconception 3aanimal performance 3aaccuracy 3aOhio 0acontracting 0atailhead chalking 0afull service technician program1 aRajala-Schultz, Päivi J.1 aFrazer, Grant S.1 aMeiring, Richard W.1 aHoblet, K.

The paper was proven to have overestimated the productivity of organic agriculture, and that the proposal on a legume-based cropping strategy is not viable to meet the required nutrients (i.e., nitrogen) of the crops. 3aweed control 3amineral fertilizers 3acover crops 3aconsumer preferences 3afood security 3acrop yield 3asoil fertility 3awillingness to pay 3aintercropping 3acrop rotation 3aorganic production 3aplant protection 0aliterature reviews 0afarming systems 0acrop management0 tField crops research.g2008 Mar. 5, v. 106, no. 2 p.187-190dElsevierwJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2007.11.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080709b20080801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01832naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245004900146300001600195500002300211500001500234520080500249650002501054650001101079650004301090650001201133650002101145650001001166650002001176650002501196650001601221653001301237653001201250700002101262700001601283773008201299852000901381939003301390946001101423655001201434IND9300580820221121204043.0930128e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930058082DNAL7 a14737252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherman, J.D.10aSilver staining two types of meiotic nodules  ap. 907-915.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aWe have developed a reliable method for silver staining nodules on synaptonemal complexes (SCs) of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). This technique involves hypotonically bursting primary microsporocytes, fixing SC spreads with paraformaldehyde, and incubating the spreads at 40 degrees C in a 33% aqueous silver nitrate solution covered with nylon mesh. When tomato SCs were stained by this method, nodules were observed with the same distribution and frequency as nodules stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Incubation in silver nitrate at higher temperatures caused the loss of some or all nodules. The pattern of loss suggests that two types of nodules coexist during late zygonema and early pachynema and that one type becomes the late nodules of mid-pachynema through early diplonema. 3asynaptonemal complex 3asilver 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aMeiosis 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aSalts 2aSilver Staining 2aSynaptonemal Complex 2aTemperature 0astaining 0ameiosis1 aHerickhoff, L.A.1 aStack, S.M.0 tGenome.g1992 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.907-915wJournal:jnl41235x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03629naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245011200170300001800282520164100300650001401941650001301955650002001968650002401988650002002012650002602032650000902058650003202067650002602099650001502125650003402140650002802174650004102202650000902243650002902252650002002281650004702301650002302348650001302371650002202384650006902406650004502475650001402520653002302534653003102557653001902588653002002607700001802627700001902645700001302664700001702677700001602694700001802710773010602728852000902834856007702843930003302920945001302953946001302966655001202979IND2328999920221121204027.0020919e20020619dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232899992DNAL7 a120591732pmid7 a10.1021/jf011646t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCases, J.10aAssessment of selenium bioavailability from high-selenium spirulina subfractions in selenium-deficient rats  ap. 3867-3873.  aIt was previously found that the bioavailability of Se from Se-rich spirulina (SeSp) was lower than that from selenite or selenomethionine when fed to Se-deficient rats. The present study examined the bioavailability of Se from SeSp subfractions: a pellet (P) issuing from the centrifugation of a suspension of broken SeSp and a retentate (R) resulting from ultrafiltration of the supernatant through a 30 kDa exclusion membrane. Animals were fed a torula yeast based diet with no Se (deficients) or supplemented with 75 microgram of Se/kg of diet as sodium selenite (controls) for 42 days. Se-deficient rats were then repleted for 56 days with Se (75 microgram/kg of diet) supplied as sodium selenite, SeSp, P, or R. During this period, controls continued to receive sodium selenite. Speciation of Se in subfractions showed that the majority was present in the form of high molecular weight compounds; free selenomethionine was only a minor constituent. Gross absorption of Se from sodium selenite, P, and R was not different and was higher than from SeSp. Only retentate allowed full replenishment of Se concentration in liver and kidney (as did sodium selenite) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activity in liver, kidney, plasma, and erythrocytes. The bioavailabilities of Se in retentate, as assessed by slope ratio analysis using selenite as a reference Se, were 89 and 112% in the tissue Se content and 106-133% in the GSHPx activities. SeSp and P exhibited a gross bioavailability of < 100%. These results indicate that Se in retentate is highly bioavailable and represents an interesting source of Se for food supplementation. 3aSpirulina 3aselenium 3amineral content 3ainorganic compounds 3abioavailability 3aintestinal absorption 3arats 3adietary mineral supplements 3anutrient deficiencies 2aAbsorption 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistry 2aBiological Availability 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDiet 2aErythrocytesxenzymology 2aFood, Fortified 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexbloodxmetabolism. 2aKidneyxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosagexdeficiencyxpharmacokinetics. 2aSodium Selenitexadministration & dosage 2aSpirulina 0amineral absorption 0atrace element deficiencies 0amineral uptake 0asodium selenite1 aWysocka, I.A.1 aCaporiccio, B.1 aJouy, N.1 aBesancon, P.1 aSzpunar, J.1 aRouanet, J.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 June 19, v. 50, no. 13 p.3867-3873x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf011646t3Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01714naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245003700115300001400152300001900166520101000185650001501195650002901210650001401239650001801253653001901271773008301290852000901373939003301382945000801415946001301423655001201436991614449240742620221121164901.0831214e198304  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830034732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aJob opportunities for dieticians  ap. 51-52.  ap. 51-52. ill.  aThe demand for qualified dietitians is on the upswing due to increased interest in improved and preventive health care. Most dietitians fall into 5 general categories: clinical dietitian (used in hospitals, nursing homes, clinics) work with patients, assess their nutritional needs, plan menus, and advise on sound eating habits. Administrative dietitians manage foodservice systems (hospitals, prisons, cafeterias, schools) and are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising. They set policy, manage, budget, and purchase foods and supplies. Community dietitians teach individuals and groups about nutrition, meal preparation, and purchasing while considering the physical, financial, and social needs of their clients. Teaching dietitians develop curricula and programs of study in medical, dental, nursing, and dietetic environments. Research dietitians find ways to improve the nutrition of sick and healthy people.

It is well-recognised that mediterranean Proteaceae have comparatively large seeds that are enriched with phosphorus (P), stored mainly as salts of phytic acid in protein globoids. Seed P can contribute up to 48% of the total aboveground P, with the fraction allocated depending on the species fire response. For SWA species, 70-80% of P allocated to fruiting structures is invested in seeds, compared with 30-75% for Cape species, with SWA species storing on average 4.7 times more P per seed at twice the concentration. When soil P is less limiting for growth, seed P reserves may be less important for seedling establishment, and hence plants there tend to produce smaller seeds with less P. For Australian Hakea and Grevillea species the translocation of P from the fruit wall to the seed occurs in the days/weeks before final fruit dry mass is reached, and accounts for 4-36% of seed P. Seed P content increases with the level of serotiny, though it decreases marginally as a fraction of the total reproductive structure. The greater occurrence of serotiny and higher seed P content within the Proteaceae in SWA supports the notion that SWA soils are more P-impoverished than those of the Cape. 3aGrevillea 3aHakea 3aMediterranean climate 3afruiting 3anutrient uptake 3apericarp 3aphosphorus 3aphytic acid 3asalts 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil 3aAustralia 3aSouth Africa 0aSouthwestern Australia 0aCape Floristic Region 0aSeed phosphorus concentration 0aSerotiny1 aLamont, Byron B. 0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Sept., v. 334, no. 1-2 p.61-72dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-009-0135-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02685naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011400166300001600280520130500296650002301601650001901624650001401643650001001657650001601667650001501683650002401698650001301722650001301735650002601748650001001774650000901784650001801793650002001811653001101831653002501842700002701867700002601894700002301920700002401943773011001967852000902077856008502086930003302171946001102204655001202215IND4441592620221121100931.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444159262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0402-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamin, Virginia 10aHerbicide application increases nitrogen (¹⁵N) exudation and root detachment of Brachiaria decumbens Stapf  ap. 511-519.  aCurrent research shows that glyphosate herbicides can increase nitrogen exudation by plant roots and, as a consequence, favor pathogenic fungal colonization in soil. In Brazilian agroecosystems, the main herbicides used in conservationist systems for glyphosate substitution are glufosinate and paraquat. However, no studies have been developed that to evaluate the effects of these herbicides on nitrogen exudation by roots. This work was carried out with the objective of evaluating the exudation of nitrogen (¹⁵N) compounds and root detachment after the application of glyphosate, glufosinate-ammonium or paraquat on Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. The ammonium concentration in the plant's tissues and the nitrogen (¹⁵N) recovery in the plant-solution system were also evaluated. The nitrogen left by the soil-solution system and the ammonium concentration in the plant's tissues were increased after glyphosate or glufosinate application, but they were not modified by paraquat. Nitrogen compound exudation and root detachment were increased by the desiccation of Brachiaria decumbens Stapf by the use of the following herbicides: glyphosate, glufosinate-ammonium and paraquat. This increase demonstrated that the nitrogen exudation was not affected by a particular herbicide's mode of action. 3aUrochloa decumbens 3aagroecosystems 3aexudation 3afungi 3aglufosinate 3aglyphosate 3amechanism of action 3anitrogen 3aparaquat 3apesticide application 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil solution 3astable isotopes 0a¹⁵N 0aGlufosinate-ammonium1 aTrivelin, Paulo C.

For this, the availability of fluorescent and electron-dense markers for light and electron microscopy, respectively, is an essential tool to attach to the molecules of interest. In recent years, there has been an increasing effort to combine light and electron microscopy in a single experiment. Such correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) experiments thus rely on using markers that are both fluorescent and electron dense. Unfortunately, there are very few markers that possess both these properties. Markers for light microscopy such as green fluorescent protein are generally not directly visible in the electron microscopy and vice versa for gold particles. Hence, there has been an intensive search for markers that are directly visible both in the light microscope and in the electron microscope. Here we discuss some of the strategies and pitfalls that are associated with the use of CLEM markers, which might serve as a “warning” that new probes should be extensively tested before use. We focus on the use of CLEM markers for the study of intracellular transport and specifically endocytosis. 3aelectron microscopy 3aendocytosis 3afluorescence 3agold 3agreen fluorescent protein 3alight microscopy 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aEpidermal Growth Factorxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMicroscopy, Electronxmethods 2aMolecular Probesxmetabolism 2aQuantum Dots 2aTransferrinxmetabolismxultrastructure. 0aLive cell imaging1 aVerkade, Paul 0 tProtoplasma.g2010 Aug., v. 244, no. 1-4 p.91-97dVienna : Springer Viennax0033-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-010-0165-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03417naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245011500186300001600301520170200317650002202019650002802041650002302069650001702092650001002109650002002119650001102139650002302150650002602173650000702199650001902206650002002225650002602245650001602271650002502287650001202312650001102324650002702335650001902362650004202381650003102423650003502454653001202489653003802501700002102539700002402560700002602584773010302610852000902713856008502722930003302807946001102840655001202851IND4441594120221121100902.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444159412DNAL7 a206350962pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-010-1221-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Manoj K. 10aBiochemical properties of the matrix metalloproteinase NtMMP1 from Nicotiana tabacum cv. BY-2 suspension cells  ap. 899-910.  aA zinc-dependent matrix metalloproteinase (NtMMP1) found in the plasma membrane of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Bright Yellow 2 (BY-2) suspension cells is thought to be responsible for the degradation of recombinant proteins secreted into the culture supernatant. We have characterized the proteolytic activity of NtMMP1 by expressing a recombinant derivative lacking the C-terminal transmembrane domain in yeast. After purifying the protein by affinity chromatography, its autocatalytic activity was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies raised against its N-terminal and C-terminal portions. Both the unprocessed and processed forms of NtMMP1 displayed caseinolytic activity and N-terminal sequencing identified an autocatalytic cleavage site within the sequence motif HFSFFP, which is similar to the corresponding sequences of the human matrix metalloproteinases stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and stromelysin-2 (MMP-10). Unlike all other matrix metalloproteinases investigated so far, NtMMP1 contains a disulfide bond within its propeptide thus rendering the proenzyme catalytically active. Kinetic analysis of NtMMP1 with a synthetic substrate revealed a K m of 10.55 ± 0.9 μM, a k cat of 0.6 ± 0.01 s⁻¹ and maximum activity at pH 7.5. We found that NtMMP1 degrades Desmodus rotundus salivary plasminogen activator alpha 1 (DSPAα1), a biopharmaceutical protein, that has proven difficult to produce in tobacco BY-2 cells. This provides a likely explanation for the frequent instability of secreted recombinant biopharmaceuticals produced in plant suspension cell cultures. Our data suggest new avenues that can be explored to improve the production of pharmaceutical proteins in plants and plant cells. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aaffinity chromatography 3abiopharmaceuticals 3acell culture 3acells 3adisulfide bonds 3ahumans 3ametalloproteinases 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apH 3aplant proteins 3aplasma membrane 3aplasminogen activator 3aproteolysis 3arecombinant proteins 3atobacco 3ayeasts 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aImmunoblotting 2aMatrix Metalloproteinasesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxcytologyxenzymology. 0aDSPAα1 0aMonoclonal anti-NtMMP1 antibodies1 aFischer, Rainer 1 aSchillberg, Stefan 1 aSchiermeyer, Andreas 0 tPlanta.g2010 Sept., v. 232, no. 4 p.899-910dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-010-1221-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02688naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012300163300001600286520133200302650002301634650002801657650002601685650001101711650002601722650002201748650002601770650001601796650002501812650000901837650002401846650002201870650002101892653002401913653002701937700002001964700002201984773011002006852000902116856008502125930003302210946001102243655001202254IND4441592520221121074039.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444159252DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0400-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Silong 10aRelating net primary productivity to soil organic matter decomposition rates in pure and mixed Chinese fir plantations  ap. 501-510.  aIn a 5-year field trial, we examined plant productivity and soil organic matter decomposition on plots with a mixture of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) and broadleaved trees. We compared pure fir (PF) plots to two mixed plots (2:1 ratio of fir to broadleaved trees): MP1 (C. lanceolata and Liquidambar formosana Hance) and MP2 (C. lanceolata and Alnus cremastogyne Burk). The mixed plots differed in that the MP2 plots incorporated a nitrogen-fixing tree (A. cremastogyne). We hypothesized that the mixed plots would have higher soil organic matter decomposition rates than the PF plots as a result of increased primary productivity. The increased productivity would increase carbon input into soils, thus resulting in greater microbial biomass and soil basal respiration. We measured tree biomass, soil organic matter decomposition rates, microbial biomass carbon, total organic carbon, metabolic quotient and microbial quotient for each plot. The results showed that the productivity, microbial biomass carbon, and total carbon in the MP2 plots were significantly higher than in the PF and MP1 plots. Path analyses suggested that soil respiration varied with the amount of tree biomass produced. However contrary to our hypothesis, soil basal respiration was higher in the PF plots than in the MP2 plots. 3aAlnus cremastogyne 3aCunninghamia lanceolata 3aLiquidambar formosana 3acarbon 3afield experimentation 3amicrobial biomass 3anitrogen-fixing trees 3aplantations 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3asoil organic matter 3asoil productivity 3asoil respiration 0aMicrobial biomass C 0aSoil basal respiration1 aZhang, Weidong 1 aSánchez, Felipe.0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Sept., v. 334, no. 1-2 p.501-510dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0400-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01467naa a2200217 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245003000135300001400165520089200179650002001071773008301091852000901174939003301183945000801216946001301224655001201237991614445870742620221121074008.0800625e198002  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800013482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCobe, Patricia.10aEating the vegetarian way  ap. 44-64.  aCritics of vegetarianism contend that animal foods contain the most protein and meatless diets cannot provide enough of this nutrient to maintain health. While the amino acids found in animal foods offer balanced, high-quality protein nutrients, vegetarians can balance two or more incomplete protein plant foods to obtain essential amino acids and avoid eating meat. By following a four-food-groups eating plan similar to that followed by meat eaters, vegetarians can get all of the protein their bodies need from plants. By combining complementary protein plant foods, shoppers can also save money at the store and still eat well. Vegetarians should also be aware that meat and dairy products are sources of vitamin D, calcium, riboflavin, vitamin B-12 and iron. Deficiencies of these nutrients must be avoided in any vegetarian diet.

Hinoat) genomic DNA. Restriction analysis and cross-hybridization studies revealed that these clones represent two different families of repeated DNA. Single accessions of 10 Avena species, representing three ploidy levels (2x, 4x, and 6x; X = 7) and comprising all available genomic constitutions (AA, CC, AABB, AACC, and AACCDD), were analyzed with these probes. Differences were observed among single representatives of the 10 species in the relative abundance of each probe and between the probes in relative abundance in each species. In slot-blot experiments, for each of the two probes, hybridization intensities were independent of genome composition. Southern blots of HindIII DNA digests from the 10 species, using each of the two probes, allowed classification of these species into two groups: the three diploid species with a CC genomic constitution had one specific pattern and the remaining seven species having different genomic constitutions (AA, AABB, AACC, AACCDD, the A genome being in common) had a different pattern. Therefore, these probes will distinguish the C-genome diploid species from the diploid and polyploid species carrying the A genome. 3aSouthern blotting 3agenome 3aDNA probes 3agenomics 3aAvena sativa 3anucleic acid hybridization 3arepetitive sequences 0aspeciation 0aploidy 0aAvena (Poaceae)1 aGiband, M.1 aAltosaar, I.0 tGenome =.g1992 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.916-920x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02871naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245013400183300001600317520128700333650000901620650001301629650001601642650001501658650003701673650001401710650001901724650001301743650000901756650005201765650004001817650002201857650002901879650002401908650005001932653003601982653002102018653002402039700002502063700002902088773013402117852000902251856008502260930003302345946001102378655001202389IND4441611320221121040102.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444161132DNAL7 a206450842pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-010-2761-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUm, Youngsoon 12aA simple and effective plating method to screen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria under various redox conditions  ap. 291-297.  aAgar plates with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) layer have been used to screen for microorganisms that degrade PAHs, leaving clear zones around colonies; however, there are several problems with previous methods such as undesired contamination in the fume hood and difficulty in controlling the amount of PAH on the plates. In this study, we developed a modified screening method to address the drawbacks encountered with previous screening methods. A uniform white layer of PAHs was generated by spreading PAHs dissolved in volatile solvents over a surface of solidified agar medium, followed by the evaporation of the solvents. An inoculation was then performed by spreading a molten agar medium containing microbial samples over the solidified agar medium with a PAH layer. Subsequently, the white PAH layer migrated to the surface of the molten agar medium. This essential modification enabled us not only to solve problems of the previous screening methods but also to prepare an agar plate with a PAH layer without a complicated experimental scheme in the anaerobic chamber. After solidification of the molten agar medium and incubation of the plates, clear zones were successfully detected around colonies with aerobic and anaerobic PAH-degrading microbial cultures. 3aagar 3abacteria 3aevaporation 3afume hoods 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3ascreening 3asolidification 3asolvents 2aAgar 2aBacteriaxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBacteriological Techniquesxmethods 2aBiotransformation 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxmetabolism. 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 0aScreening method 0aAnaerobic condition1 aChang, Matthew Wook 1 aHoloman, Tracey Pulliam 0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2010 Sept., v. 88, no. 1 p.291-297dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2761-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02023naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010600166300001600272520111000288650001401398650001401412650001201426650001101438650002001449700002201469700001801491773010701509852000901616856008501625946001101710655001201721IND4441608720221121040231.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444160872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10603-010-9138-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirchler, Erich 10aPrice and its Relation to Objective and Subjective Product Quality: Evidence from the Austrian Market  ap. 275-286.  aThe correlation between price and product quality is usually found to be low, but still, consumers use a rule of thumb that higher prices indicate higher quality. In the present study, data from the Austrian consumer magazine Konsument from 2004 to 2007 were analysed, and price-quality correlations were computed. Results confirm former studies as the overall price-quality relation was positive and statistically significant but small (r = .30). It was especially small in the food and beverages sector as well as for cosmetics and for inexpensive products generally. Consumers' subjective beliefs about a price-quality link and product complexity were also analysed. Results show that consumers believe that a high price signals high quality, but that these beliefs are not well calibrated, i.e., not corresponding to the product categories where actually higher price-quality correlations can be found. In sum, the results confirm for the Austrian market that price is a poor signal of quality, and that consumers are hardly aware of the particular product sectors where this signal is more valid. 3abeverages 3acosmetics 3amarkets 3aprices 3aproduct quality1 aFischer, Florian 1 aHölzl, Erik 0 tJournal of consumer policy.g2010 Sept., v. 33, no. 3 p.275-286dBoston : Springer USx0168-70347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10603-010-9138-13Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02896naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245013400190300001600324520122000340650002401560650002001584650001701604650001701621650001501638650001601653650001401669650001101683650001601694650000901710650001601719650001001735650001201745650002801757650002201785650002701807650001501834650002601849650002001875650004401895650002101939650001601960650001601976653001101992653001802003700002202021700002502043773012402068852000902192856008502201930003302286946001102319655001202330IND4404949920221121040310.0080425e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440494992DNAL7 a186490332pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-007-9156-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValenzuela, Ariel E. 10aEffects of different artificial photoperiods and temperatures on haematological parameters of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 159-167.  aThis study assessed the effects of two artificial photoperiods (LD 24:0 and LD 12:12) and three temperature regimes (9, 11, and 18°C) for 30 days on haematological parameters of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) kept in freshwater. Samples were taken at days 7, 14, and 30 during exposure to treatments. A higher mortality (22%) and lower oxygen concentration (<8.0 mg/l) were associated with the combination of photoperiod LD 24:0 and 18°C. The LD 24:0 photoperiod (independently of temperature) increased the haematocrit and the number of erythrocytes at days 7, 14, and 30 (P < 0.01). A temperature of 18°C (independently of photoperiod regimes) diminished the number of total leucocytes, lymphocytes and thrombocytes (P < 0.01). The LD 24:0 photoperiod (also independently of temperature) lowered the number of lymphocytes only after 14 days of experimentation (P < 0.01). Interaction between artificial photoperiod and temperature was only observed at day 14 for polychromatophils (P < 0.01). These results resemble the effects of stress caused by elevated temperatures and the application of continuous light photoperiods, indicating that survival risks may develop in trout farming when this combination is met. 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3ablood platelets 3aerythrocytes 3afish culture 3afreshwater 3alymphocytes 3amortality 3aoxygen 3aphotoperiod 3arisk 3atemperature 3atrout 2aAnimals 2aBlood Cellsxphysiology 2aErythrocyte Count 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aHematocrit 2aHemoglobinsxanalysis 2aLeukocyte Count 2aOncorhynchus mykissxbloodxphysiology. 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aPhotoperiod 2aTemperature 0aStress 0aOxygen levels1 aSilva, Victor M. 1 aKlempau, Alfredo E. 0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2008 June, v. 34, no. 2 p.159-167dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0920-17427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-007-9156-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20080425b20080502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02046naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002600142245010800168300001600276500002400292520086000316650002501176650001301201650001401214650001801228650001401246650001401260700003301274700003001307700003301337700002801370700003201398700003101430700003001461773012701491852000901618856004501627655001201672IND4446223020101208222513.0101208e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444622302DNAL7 a10.1002/jpln.2009001472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanco Macias, Fidel.10aNutritional reference values for Opuntia ficus-indica determined by means of the boundary-line approach  ap. 927-934.  aIncludes references  aOptimum concentrations and/or sufficiency ranges of nutrients are useful for a correct diagnosis and improvement of nutrient status of cultivated plants.

The BLA standards are comparable to those obtained in a previous study using compositional-nutrient-diagnosis (CND) approach. 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3acladodes 3adatabases 3anormal values 3anutrients 3anutrition1 aMagallanes-Quintanar, Rafael1 aValdez-Cepeda, Ricardo D.1 aVázquez-Alvarado, Rigoberto1 aOlivares-Sáenz, Emilio1 aGutiérrez Ornelas, Erasmo.1 aVidales-Contreras, Juan A.1 aMurillo Amador, Bernardo.0 tZeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde.g2010 Dec., v. 173, no. 6 p.927-934dWiley-VCH Verlagx1436-87307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200900147 7aarticle03141naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245005900190300001600249520144300265650001901708650001701727650001801744650001801762650001201780650005401792650004301846650003901889650005101928650003001979650004302009650001102052650002302063650001802086650004302104650004002147650002502187650000902212653000902221700002402230700002402254700002202278700002502300700002202325773011902347852000902466856009202475930003302567946001102600655001202611IND4407651620221121012127.0080712e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440765162DNAL7 a186138432pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00646.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanaba, Koichi10aB-lymphocyte contributions to human autoimmune disease  ap. 284-299.  aAutoimmunity results from abnormal B- and T-cell recognition of self-antigens, which leads to autoantibody production in many cases. Autoantibodies produced by B-cell-derived plasma cells provide diagnostic markers for autoimmunity but also contribute significantly to disease pathogenesis. As discussed in this review, the therapeutic benefit of depleting B cells in mice and humans has refocused attention on B cells and their role in autoimmunity beyond autoantibody production. B cells specifically serve as cellular adjuvants for CD4⁺ T-cell activation, while regulatory B cells, including those that produce interleukin-10 (B10 cells), function as negative regulators of inflammatory immune responses. The emerging picture is that B cells, autoantibodies, and T cells are all important components of abnormal immune responses that lead to tissue pathology unique to each autoimmune disease, with their relative contributions changing during disease progression. Autoimmune diseases where B-cell functions are closely correlated with disease activity include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Understanding the overlapping roles of B cells as mediators of autoimmune disease will facilitate the development of more precisely directed therapies and combination therapies with broader clinical efficacy than current depletion strategies that remove all B cells. 3aautoantibodies 3aautoimmunity 3aB-lymphocytes 3aimmunotherapy 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived 2aAntigen Presentationxdrug effects 2aAutoimmune Diseasesxdrug therapyximmunology. 2aB-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aHumans 2aImmunologic Memory 2aImmunotherapy 2aInterleukin-10ximmunologyxsecretion. 2aLymphocyte Activationxdrug effects 2aLymphocyte Depletion 2aMice 0aCD201 aBouaziz, Jean-David1 aMatsushita, Takashi1 aMagro, Cynthia M.1 aSt.Clair, E.

It considers why the nature and level of protection is particularly important given the range of coverage of the regime and the Europeanisation agenda. It argues that the UCPD concept provides the potential for a relatively protective approach to consumer decision making. At the same time, it emphasizes that realisation of this potential is partly dependent on recognizing the limits of transparency as a protective tool and in understanding the “professional diligence” and “average consumer” concepts in particular ways. It is further suggested that the protective potential of the regime is not necessarily undermined by the “average consumer” concept or by the “informed decision-making” paradigm of the general unfairness clause. Indeed, the general clause may be capable of extending the protective effects to some extent. Finally, it is suggested that regulators may have a key role to play in maximizing both the level of protection and the prospects for a genuinely common European approach. 3aconsumer behavior 3adecision making 3aEurope0 tJournal of consumer policy.g2010 Sept., v. 33, no. 3 p.247-273dBoston : Springer USx0168-70347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10603-010-9128-33Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03505naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014500185300001500330520136500345650002501710650002301735650001601758650002501774650001101799650001501810650003801825650002201863650001001885650001001895650001901905650001901924650001701943650001201960650001801972650002801990650001402018650003002032650003502062650002302097650002902120650004502149650002002194650002402214650003002238650004802268650003102316650003902347653002802386653001602414700002302430700002502453700003502478700002402513700003502537773013302572852000902705856008502714930003302799946001102832655001202843IND4441613020221120231922.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444161302DNAL7 a205678182pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-010-2710-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmoll, Monika 10aRecombinant production of an Aspergillus nidulans class I hydrophobin (DewA) in Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei) is promoter-dependent  ap. 95-103.  aFungal hydrophobins have potential for several applications because of their abilities to change the hydrophobicity of different surfaces. Yet because of their tendency for aggregation and attachment to interfacial areas only few production processes have so far been reported. Towards the development of a heterologous production system, we report here the expression of a class I hydrophobin DewA of Aspergillus nidulans in Hypocrea jecorina (Trichoderma reesei). Using the H. jecorina hfb2 (class II hydrophobin-encoding) promoter and lactose as a carbon source, only a minor fraction of the DewA remained cell-wall-bound and the majority of it secreted into the medium with up to 15% of the total secreted protein. N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that it was correctly processed. In contrast, no DewA was produced under the cel7A (cellobiohydrolase I) promoter, although its mRNA was abundantly detected in the cells. This lack of secretion is not due to trapping in the cell wall or to its degradation because of the unfolded protein response. Recombinant DewA could be conveniently precipitated from the culture filtrate, and its bioactivity proven by its ability to stably bind to hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces (glass and Teflon, respectively). We thus consider H. jecorina as a promising host for further optimization of DewA production. 3aAspergillus nidulans 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aamino acids 3abioactive properties 3acarbon 3acell walls 3acellulose 1,4-beta-cellobiosidase 3aculture filtrates 3afungi 3aglass 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydrophobins 3alactose 3amessenger RNA 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3asecretion 3aunfolded protein response 2aAspergillus nidulansxgenetics 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression 2aLactosexmetabolism 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aTrichodermaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aHeterologous production 0aHydrophobin1 aSeibel, Christian 1 aKotlowski, Caroline 1 aWöllert Genannt Vendt, Frank 1 aLiebmann, Burghart 1 aKubicek, C.

When the criteria of the Microbiological Guidelines were used, 99.4% of samples were found to be of satisfactory microbiological quality, 0.5% were of acceptable quality, and 0.1% were of unsatisfactory quality as a result of high levels (>100 CFU/g) of Listeria spp. The butter samples with Listeria spp. present at more than 100 CFU/g were negative for L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes was detected in 0.4% (n = 13) of samples, all at levels of less than 10 CFU/g, and were therefore of acceptable quality. Butter was contaminated more frequently with Listeria spp., including L. monocytogenes, when packed in plastic tubs, when in pack sizes of 500 g or less, when stored or displayed above 8 degrees C, when a hazard analysis system was not in place, and when the manager had received no food hygiene training. This study demonstrates that although butter is regarded as a low-risk product, it may provide an environment for the persistence and growth of Listeria spp., including L. monocytogenes. The control of L. monocytogenes in food processing and supply systems is critical in order to minimize the potential for this bacterium to be present in foods at the point of consumption at levels hazardous to health. 3asupermarkets 3abutter 3abacterial contamination 3afood processing plants 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial detection 3aListeria monocytogenes 3afood sanitation 3acatering 2aButterxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethodsxstandards. 2aFood-Processing Industryxmethodsxstandards. 2aFoodborne Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aHumans 2aHygiene 2aListeriaxisolation & purification 2aListeria monocytogenesxisolation & purification 2aListeriosisxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aPrevalence 2aQuality Control 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britainxepidemiology. 0aListeria1 aLittle, C.L.1 aElson, R.1 aGreenwood, M.1 aGrant, K.A.1 aMcLauchlin, J.0 tJournal of food protection.g2006 July, v. 69, no. 7 p.1518-1526x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060919b20061003c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/09/19  aOther US 7aarticle03319naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010900170300001800279520175200297650002502049650002402074650002102098650003102119650001702150650001202167650001102179650002202190650001902212650001302231650002602244650001702270650001302287650001402300650002402314650001702338653002102355653002902376653002402405653001402429653003102443700002302474700002202497700002902519773011502548852000902663856008502672930003302757946001102790655001202801IND4441614120221120222012.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444161412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10682-010-9363-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPregitzer, Clara C. 10aSoils as agents of selection: feedbacks between plants and soils alter seedling survival and performance  ap. 1045-1059.  aSoils are one of the first selective environments a seed experiences and yet little is known about the evolutionary consequences of plant-soil feedbacks. We have previously found that plant phytochemical traits in a model system, Populus spp., influence rates of leaf litter decay, soil microbial communities and rates of soil net nitrogen mineralization. Utilizing this natural variation in plant-soil linkages we examined two related hypotheses: (1) Populus angustifolia seedlings are locally adapted to their native soils; and (2) Soils act as agents of selection, differentially affecting seedling survival and the heritability of plant traits. We conducted a greenhouse experiment by planting seedlings from 20 randomly collected P. angustifolia genetic families in soils conditioned by various Populus species and measured subsequent survival and performance. Even though P. angustifolia soils are less fertile overall, P. angustifolia seedlings grown in these soils were twice as likely to survive, grew 24% taller, had 27% more leaves, and 29% greater above-ground biomass than P. angustifolia seedlings grown in non-native P. fremontii or hybrid soils. Increased survival resulted in higher trait variation among seedlings in native soils compared to seedlings grown in non-native soils. Soil microbial biomass varied significantly across soil environments which could explain more of the variation in seedling performance than soil texture, pH, or nutrient availability, suggesting strong microbial interactions and feedbacks between plants, soils, and associated microorganisms. Overall, these data suggest that a “home-field advantage” or a positive plant soil feedback helps maintain genetic variance in P. angustifolia seedlings. 3aPopulus angustifolia 3aaboveground biomass 3agenetic variance 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aheritability 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aplant litter 3aplanting 3aseedlings 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil texture 0aLocal adaptation 0aNarrowsense heritability 0aPlant-soil feedback 0aSelection 0aSoil microbial communities1 aBailey, Joseph K. 1 aHart, Stephen C. 1 aSchweitzer, Jennifer A. 0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2010 Sept., v. 24, no. 5 p.1045-1059dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0269-76537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-010-9363-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01764naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245010100161300001600262520053400278650001900812650000900831650001600840650001400856650001700870650001300887650001700900650001400917650001600931650001400947653001800961653004500979653001901024653001801043700001701061700001901078773010701097852000901204856008501213930003301298946001101331655001201342IND4441617720221120211434.0100820e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444161772DNAL7 a10.1007/s11099-010-0040-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZulini, L. 10aChlorophyll fluorescence as a tool for evaluation of viability in freeze-stressed grapevine buds  ap. 317-319.  aThis study examined the utility of the ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) to detect freezing injury on buds of two Vitis vinifera cultivars: Pinot noir and Pinot gris.

These fractions had no influence on the growth of rats, which were fed a basal diet containing 1% cholesterol, but lowered plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol. Inhibition of copper-oxidation of plasma and LDL ex vivo, and a reduction in lipid peroxidation in liver and aorta in vivo, were also observed. The antioxidant enzymes were not induced in rats fed natto fraction diets. These results demonstrate that ingestion of the natto fractions led to inhibition of LDL oxidation, and that the fractions perform direct antioxidant action in the body. It is suggested that natto fractions might help to prevent arteriosclerosis, as they appear to reduce lipid peroxidation and improve lipid metabolism. 3anatto 3asoybeans 3afractionation 3afood intake 3alow density lipoprotein 3alipid metabolism 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3atriacylglycerols 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3aaorta 3aenzyme activity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acatalase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione 3arats 2aAntioxidantsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aAortaxmetabolism 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCopperxchemistry 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFermentation 2aGlutathionexblood 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteins, LDLxbloodxchemistry. 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhospholipidsxblood 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substancesxanalysis 2aTriglyceridesxblood1 aNakaya, N.1 aKawasaki, Y.1 aMatsue, H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 June 5, v. 50, no. 12 p.3597-3601x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01171993Available from publisher's Web site  a20021002b20021010c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03690naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245014000142300001600282500002400298520175500322650002502077650001402102650002202116650001202138650002302150650001202173650000902185650001402194650001302208650002802221650000902249650006602258650003602324650003002360650002402390650002402414650002202438650003002460650003302490650001102523650002502534650001102559650001102570650005202581650000902633650001302642650004202655650006402697651001402761700001802775700001702793700002002810700001502830700002002845700001802865773017202883852000903055655001203064IND4364357420221120181517.0040910e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436435742DNAL7 a153218152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLind, T.12aA community-based randomized controlled trial of iron and zinc supplementation in Indonesian infants: effects on growth and development  ap. 729-736.  aIncludes references  aBackground: Deficiencies of iron and zinc are associated with delayed development, growth faltering, and increased infectious-disease morbidity during infancy and childhood. Combined iron and zinc supplementation may therefore be a logical preventive strategy. Objective: The objective of the study was to compare the effects of combined iron and zinc supplementation in infancy with the effects of iron and zinc as single micronutrients on growth, psychomotor development, and incidence of infectious disease. Design: Indonesian infants (n = 680) were randomly assigned to daily supplementation with 10 mg Fe (Fe group), 10 mg Zn (Zn group), 10 mg Fe and 10 mg Zn (Fe+Zn group), or placebo from 6 to 12 mo of age. Anthropometric indexes, developmental indexes (Bayley Scales of Infant Development; BSID), and morbidity were recorded. Results: At 12 mo, two-factor analysis of variance showed a significant interaction between iron and zinc for weight-for-age z score, knee-heel length, and BSID psychomotor development. Weight-for-age z score was higher in the Zn group than in the placebo and Fe+Zn groups, knee-heel length was higher in the Zn and Fe groups than in the placebo group, and the BSID psychomotor development index was higher in the Fe group than in the placebo group. No significant effect on morbidity was found. Conclusions: Single supplementation with zinc significantly improved growth, and single supplementation with iron significantly improved growth and psychomotor development, but combined supplementation with iron and zinc had no significant effect on growth or development. Combined, simultaneous supplementation with iron and zinc to infants cannot be routinely recommended at the iron-to-zinc ratio used in this study. 3aanalysis of variance 3achildhood 3adisease incidence 3ainfancy 3ainfant development 3ainfants 3airon 3amorbidity 3aplacebos 3apsychomotor development 3azinc 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxcomplicationsxprevention & control. 2aChild Developmentxdrug effects 2aCommunity Health Services 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aDrug Interactions 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aFemale 2aGrowthxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aIronxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aPlacebos 2aPsychomotor Performancexdrug effects 2aZincxadministration & dosagexdeficiencyxtherapeutic use. 0aIndonesia1 aLonnerdal, B.1 aStenlund, H.1 aGamayanti, I.L.1 aIsmail, D.1 aSeswandhana, R.1 aPersson, L.A.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2004 Sept., v. 80, no. 3 p.729-736dThe American Society for Nutrition, with the assistance of Highwire Pressx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03240naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002300157245011200180300001800292500002400310520155200334650002201886650001501908650001501923650001401938650000901952650003201961650001401993650001602007650001402023650001702037650002702054650002102081650001302102650002302115650003502138650002102173650004102194650002202235650003502257700002102292700001902313700002002332700001802352700002202370700002502392700001902417700002402436700001802460773010902478852000902587856007802596655001202674IND4410177020221120145007.0080912e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441017702DNAL7 a186763782pmid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcn1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurai-Hatano, Mari10aEffect of Low Root Temperature on Hydraulic Conductivity of Rice Plants and the Possible Role of Aquaporins  ap. 1294-1305.  aIncludes references  aThe role of root temperature TR in regulating the water-uptake capability of rice roots and the possible relationship with aquaporins were investigated. The root hydraulic conductivity Lpr decreased with decreasing TR in a measured temperature range between 10°C and 35°C. A single break point (TRC = 15°C) was detected in the Arrhenius plot for steady-state Lpr. The temperature dependency of Lpr represented by activation energy was low (28 kJ mol⁻¹) above TRC, but the value is slightly higher than that for the water viscosity. Addition of an aquaporin inhibitor, HgCl₂, into root medium reduced osmotic exudation by 97% at 25°C, signifying that aquaporins play a major role in regulating water uptake. Below TRC, Lpr declined precipitously with decreasing TR (Ea = 204 kJ mol⁻¹). When TR is higher than TRC, the transient time for reaching the steady-state of Lpr after the immediate change in TR (from 25°C) was estimated as 10 min, while it was prolonged up to 2-3 h when TR < TRC. The Lpr was completely recovered to the initial levels when TR was returned back to 25°C. Immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies for the major aquaporin members of PIPs and TIPs in rice roots revealed that there were no significant changes in the abundance of aquaporins during 5 h of low temperature treatment. Considering this result and the significant inhibition of water-uptake by the aquaporin inhibitor, we hypothesize that the decrease in Lpr when TR < TRC was regulated by the activity of aquaporins rather than their abundance. 3aactivation energy 3aantibodies 3aaquaporins 3aexudation 3arice 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3aroot tips 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awater uptake 2aAquaporinsxmetabolism 2aCold Temperature 2aKinetics 2aModels, Biological 2aOryzaxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aWaterxmetabolism 2aXylemxmetabolismxphysiology.1 aKuwagata, Tsuneo1 aSakurai, Junko1 aNonami, Hiroshi1 aAhamed, Arifa1 aNagasuga, Kiyoshi1 aMatsunami, Toshinori1 aFukushi, Keiko1 aMaeshima, Masayoshi1 aOkada, Masumi0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2008 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.1294-1305dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcn1043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02688naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001300133245010100146300001600247520150200263650001801765650002201783650001101805650001401816650001201830650002501842650002301867650004601890650002101936650001101957650001801968650001101986651001301997653001002010700001602020700001602036700001902052700001502071773006802086852001302154939003302167945000802200946001302208852000902221655001202230991614431610742620221120140541.0930108e199210  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930000622DNAL7 a14085072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShea, S.10aVariability and self-regulation of energy intake in young children in their everyday environment  ap. 542-546.  aRecent data from small numbers of children studied under controlled protocols indicate that intraindividual variation in energy consumption over 24 hours is smaller than variation from eating occasion to eating occasion, implying that children self-regulate their energy consumption. This hypothesis was tested in children living in their everyday environment. Between 1986 and 1989, 24-hour recalls were administered on seven occasions (four times in 1986 through 1987 and three times in 1988 through 1989) to the mothers of 181 preschool children in New York City. Each 24-hour period was divided into six meals or snacks. The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) was calculated for each child for energy consumption at each eating occasion and for the day as a whole. Coefficients of variation for energy consumption at the six eating occasions ranged from 46.5% to 165.8%, compared with 30.3% for the whole day. This coefficient of variation for the observed whole-day energy consumption was significantly less (P < .001) than would be expected if no autoregulation of energy intake (no meal-to-meal correlation) occurred. These findings in children living in their everyday environment are consistent with observations under more controlled study conditions. These data suggest that children who eat less at one meal compensate at another, although the data do not address the issues of longer term energy self-regulation, overall energy balance, or diet quality. 3aenergy intake 3adiurnal variation 3asnacks 3aHispanics 3amothers 3alongitudinal studies 3apreschool children 2aChild Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aChild, Preschool 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aHumans 3aNew York 0ameals1 aStein, A.D.1 aBasch, C.E.1 aContento, I.R.1 aZybert, P.0 tPediatrics.g1992 Oct., v. 90, no. 4 p.542-546x0031-40057nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245010400147300001400251500002400265520161800289650001201907650001301919650001301932650001801945650002101963650001601984650001302000650000902013650001602022650001702038650001002055650001202065650002502077650003102102650002602133650000902159650003602168650004802204650004802252650004102300650001102341650000902352650001302361650001102374650000902385650002702394650004202421650003602463650002602499650003702525650003102562650001202593650002202605700001702627700001702644700001602661700001902677700001702696700001502713700002402728700001802752700001502770773016902785852000902954655001202963IND4363323820221120140704.0040712e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436332382DNAL7 a152130322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEpstein, L.H.10aRelation between food reinforcement and dopamine genotypes and its effect on food intake in smokers  ap. 82-88.  aIncludes references  aBackground: Food reinforcement and dopaminergic activity may influence food consumption, but research on whether they interact has not been performed. Objective: We assessed the effects of food reinforcement and the interaction of food reinforcement with the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) genotype and the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) genotype on energy consumption. Design: We studied food-consumption and reinforcing-value-of-food tasks in 88 smokers of European ancestry before they enrolled in smoking-cessation treatment. In the food-consumption task, subjects tasted and consumed 8 snack foods ad libitum. The reinforcing-value-of-food task assessed how hard subjects would work for food. Results: Significant interactions between dopamine genotypes and food reinforcement were observed. Subjects high in food reinforcement who lacked an SLC6A3*9 allele consumed significantly more calories (>150 kcal; P = 0.015) than did subjects low in food reinforcement or those high in food reinforcement who carried at least one SLC6A3*9 allele. Similarly, subjects high in food reinforcement who carried at least one DRD2*A1 allele consumed >130 kcal more (P = 0.021) than did subjects low in food reinforcement or those high in food reinforcement who lacked a DRD2*A1 allele. There was also a main effect of food reinforcement on energy intake (P = 0.005), with subjects high in food reinforcement consuming 104 kcal (or 30%) more than did subjects low in food reinforcement. Conclusions: Food reinforcement has a significant effect on energy intake, and the effect is moderated by the dopamine loci SLC6A3 and DRD2. 3aalleles 3aancestry 3adopamine 3aenergy intake 3afood consumption 3afood intake 3agenotype 3aloci 3asnack foods 3atransporters 2aAdult 2aAlleles 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBupropionxtherapeutic use 2aConditioning, Operant 2aDiet 2aDopaminexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins 2aDopamine Uptake Inhibitorsxtherapeutic use 2aEnergy Intakexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFood 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMembrane Glycoproteins 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgenetics 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aReceptors, Dopamine D2xgenetics 2aReinforcement, Psychology. 2aSmoking 2aSmoking Cessation1 aWright, S.M.1 aPaluch, R.A.1 aLeddy, J.J.1 aHawk, L.W.

The portable permanent-magnet-based systems, by contrast, can be used in situ to study works of art, in a noninvasive manner. One of these portable NMR systems, NMR-MOUSE®, measures the information contained in one pixel in an NMR image from a region of about 1 cm², which can be as thin as 2-3 µm. With such a high depth resolution, profiles through the structures of art objects can be measured to characterize the materials, the artists' techniques, and the deterioration processes. A novel application of the technique to study a deterioration process and to follow up a conservation treatment is presented in which micrometer-thick oil stains on paper are differentiated and characterized. In this example, the spin-spin relaxation T ₂ of the stain is correlated to the iodine number and to the degree of cross-linking of the oil, parameters that are crucial in choosing an appropriate conservation treatment to remove them. It is also shown that the variation of T ₂ over the course of treatments with organic solvents can be used to monitor the progress of the conservation interventions. It is expected that unilateral NMR in combination with multivariate data analysis will fill a gap within the set of high-spatial-resolution techniques currently available for the noninvasive analysis of materials in works of art, where procedures to study the inorganic components are currently far more developed than those suitable for the study of the organic components. 3acrosslinking 3aiodine value 3amagnetic materials 3amultivariate analysis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoils 3asampling 3asolvents1 aCenteno, Silvia A. 1 aKehlet, Cindie 1 aCurrier, Penelope 1 aStockman, Denise 1 aJerschow, Alexej 0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2010 Jan., v. 396, no. 1 p.213-220dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-009-3128-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20091212b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03707naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245012100208300001600329520188600345592002802231650001402259650002002273650003102293650001402324650003002338650002002368650002402388650002502412650001502437650002302452650002302475650002102498650002102519650001502540650001702555650001702572653002002589653001502609653001502624653003202639653003102671653002002702700006602722700006302788700002102851700006302872700002502935773011302960856008303073852000903156655001203165IND60771644620221119183211.0220515e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077164462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2022.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarbox, Bryan C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5040-394910aBridging the Gap Between Spatial Modeling and Management of Invasive Annual Grasses in the Imperiled Sagebrush Biome  ap. 104-115.  aInvasions of native plant communities by non-native species present major challenges for ecosystem management and conservation. Invasive annual grasses such as cheatgrass, medusahead, and ventenata are pervasive and continue to expand their distributions across imperiled sagebrush-steppe communities of the western United States. These invasive grasses alter native plant communities, ecosystem function, and fire regimes, threatening sagebrush ecosystem persistence. Spatial data describing the distribution and abundance of invasive species are often used by resource managers to identify, target, and determine needed interventions. However, there are challenges associated with translating these datasets into management actions. We conducted a review of available spatial products to assess advances in, and barriers to, applying contemporary model-based maps to support rangeland management. We found dozens of regional data products describing cheatgrass or annual herbaceous cover and few maps describing ventenata or medusahead. Over the past decade, IAG spatial data increased in spatial and temporal resolution and increasingly used response variables that indicate the severity of infestation such as percent cover. Despite improvements, use of such data is limited by the time required to find, compare, understand, and translate model-based maps into management strategy. There is also a need for products with higher spatial resolution and accuracy. In collaboration with a multipartner stakeholder group, we identified key considerations that guide selection of IAG spatial data products for use by land managers and other users. On the basis of these considerations, we discuss issues that contribute to a research-implementation gap between users and product developers and suggest future directions for improved development of management-ready spatial products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aBromus tectorum 3aTaeniatherum caput-medusae 3aVentenata 3aadministrative management 3adata collection 3aecological function 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3arange management 3arangelands 3aspatial data 3astakeholders 0aBromus tectorum 0aCheatgrass 0aMedusahead 0aResearch-implementation gap 0aTaeniatherum caput-medusae 0aVentenata dubia1 aVan Schmidt, Nathan D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5973-79341 aShyvers, Jessica E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4307-00041 aSaher, D.

Several efforts have been taken to overcome E. coli limitations, including the use of fusion partners that improve protein expression and solubility. New fusion technologies are emerging to complement the traditional solutions. This work evaluates two novel fusion partners, the Fh8 tag (8 kDa) and the H tag (1 kDa), as solubility enhancing tags in E. coli and their comparison to commonly used fusion partners. A broad range comparison was conducted in a small-scale screening and subsequently scaled-up. Six difficult-to-express target proteins (RVS167, SPO14, YPK1, YPK2, Frutalin and CP12) were fused to eight fusion tags (His, Trx, GST, MBP, NusA, SUMO, H and Fh8). The resulting protein expression and solubility levels were evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before and after protein purification and after tag removal. The Fh8 partner improved protein expression and solubility as the well-known Trx, NusA or MBP fusion partners. The H partner did not function as a solubility tag. Cleaved proteins from Fh8 fusions were soluble and obtained in similar or higher amounts than proteins from the cleavage of other partners as Trx, NusA or MBP. The Fh8 fusion tag therefore acts as an effective solubility enhancer, and its low molecular weight potentially gives it an advantage over larger solubility tags by offering a more reliable assessment of the target protein solubility when expressed as a fusion protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3agene fusion 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotein solubility 3aprotein synthesis 3arecombinant proteins 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primers 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Fusion 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSolubility1 aAlmeida, André,1 aCastro, Antonio,1 aDomingues, Lucília,1 aBesir, Hüseyin0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2013 Aug., v. 97, no. 15 p.6779-6791dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4559-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01619naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245007300175300001600248520073300264592002800997650001901025650001201044650001401056650002401070700002001094773013601114856008201250852000901332655001201341IND60592064320221117080851.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059206432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-016-0096-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicolaï, Jean-Philippe10aWindfall Profits Under Pollution Permits and Output-Based Allocation  ap. 661-691.  aThis paper analyzes the implementation of pollution permits.

A new type of profit increase in sectors that are not exposed to international competition, when energy-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) sectors are granted output-based allocations, is demonstrated theoretically. The paper also illustrates a profit increase in the electricity sector in a possible fourth phase of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, in which output-based allocation will be granted to EITE sectors, compared with the case in which all permits are auctioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3amarkets 3apollution 3aprofits and margins1 aZamorano, Jorge0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2018 Apr., v. 69, no. 4 p.661-691dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-016-0096-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245021200166300001600378520139600394592002801790650002301818650001501841650001101856650002001867650002901887650001601916650002201932650001301954650001101967650002601978650001202004650002002016653000902036653002302045653001002068653000902078653000802087700002102095700001802116700001702134700001702151700002002168773011102188856008302299852000902382655001202391IND60553612520221120061726.0180831e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.09.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chongning12aA surface enhanced Raman scattering quantitative analytical platform for detection of trace Cu coupled the catalytic reaction and gold nanoparticle aggregation with label-free Victoria blue B molecular probe  ap. 888-893.  aWith development of economy and society, there is an urgent need to develop convenient and sensitive methods for detection of Cu²⁺ pollution in water. In this article, a simple and sensitive SERS sensor was proposed to quantitative analysis of trace Cu²⁺ in water. The SERS sensor platform was prepared a common gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-SiO2 sol substrate platform by adsorbing HSA, coupling with the catalytic reaction of Cu²⁺-ascorbic acid (H2A)-dissolved oxygen, and using label-free Victoria blue B (VBB) as SERS molecular probes. The SERS sensor platform response to the AuNP aggregations by hydroxyl radicals (•OH) oxidizing from the Cu²⁺ catalytic reaction, which caused the SERS signal enhancement. Therefore, by monitoring the increase of SERS signal, Cu²⁺ in water can be determined accurately. The results show that the SERS sensor platforms owns a linear response with a range from 0.025 to 25μmol/L Cu²⁺, and with a detection limit of 0.008μmol/L. In addition, the SERS method demonstrated good specificity for Cu²⁺, which can determined accurately trace Cu²⁺ in water samples, and good recovery and accuracy are obtained for the water samples. With its high selectivity and good accuracy, the sensitive SERS quantitative analysis method is expected to be a promising candidate for determining copper ions in environmental monitoring and food safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiosensors 3acopper 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afood safety 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ananogold 3aoxygen 3aquantitative analysis 3asociety 3awater pollution 0aCu2+ 0aCatalytic reaction 0aAuNPs 0aSERS 0aRRS1 aOuyang, Huixiang1 aTang, Xueping1 aWen, Guiqing1 aLiang, Aihui1 aJiang, Zhiliang0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Jan. 15, v. 87 p.888-893dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.09.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245016600205300001400371520140300385592002801788650001101816650002301827650002001850650001501870650001101885650001401896650003001910650002401940650001901964650001701983650001202000650001102012650001302023650002802036650001402064650002202078650001502100653003702115653001802152653001902170653002802189653003902217700001502256700001902271700001502290700001802305773014602323856008302469852000902552655001202561IND60771644720221119183452.0220704e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077164472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2022.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Ya-qiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3819-188010aEffects of Aboveground Community Structure and Belowground Root Morphological Characteristics on Nitrogen Use Efficiency of Mixed-Perennial Legume-Grass Pastures  ap. 59-68.  aNitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in plants is dependent on various factors including nitrogen availability and root morphology. This study investigated changes in root morphological and growth features in response to plant community structures in legume-grass mixed pastures. Three types of legume forage and three gramineous forage were selected, including Bromus. innermis, Onobrychis. viciaefolia, Phleum pretense, Trifolium. pretense, Dactylis glomerata, and Medicago sativa. The effects of different community structures on changes in the land equivalent ratio, crowding, aggressivity, and competition, as well as the NUE, N yield, and root morphologies, were investigated. It was found that mixed seeding combinations increased the forage yield significantly but increasing the number of mixed seeding species did not further affect the herbage yield. Both the root lengths and root specific areas of the forage grass increased with increasing spatial distance, indicating that while the root morphology of the grass was controlled by genetic factors, the phenotypic characteristics of forage grass were changed by the balance between aboveground and underground growth. Root morphology was found to play a significant role in the NUE and the relation between specific root area of legume and LN(WN), specific root length of grass, and LN (WNₜ) can be expressed by the binomial function model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromus 3aDactylis glomerata 3aMedicago sativa 3aOnobrychis 3aPhleum 3aTrifolium 3aadministrative management 3acommunity structure 3aforage grasses 3aforage yield 3alegumes 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphenotype 3aplant communities 3arangelands 0aaboveground competitive patterns 0aintercropping 0amixed cropping 0anitrogen use efficiency 0aroot morphological characteristics1 aZheng, Wei1 aMonaco, Thomas1 aNaerkezi, 1 aLi, Song-song0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2022 July, v. 83 p.59-68dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2022.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001400143245010500157300001800262500000900280520179200289592002802081650001802109650001002127650002302137650001502160650001902175650001502194650002602209650002002235650002002255650002102275650002402296650001502320650002602335700001502361700001802376700002802394700001602422773012602438852000902564856008002573655001202653IND4425954620221120103122.0191226e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442595462DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2009.00432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelsh, C.10aHigh Yielding Organic Crop Management Decreases Plant-Available but Not Recalcitrant Soil Phosphorus  ap. 1027-1035.  aepub  aPhosphorus is a nonrenewable resource, raising concerns that agricultural practices may deplete reserves. Organic farming with low P inputs can result in deficient levels of plant-available phosphorus (available-P). The purpose of this study was to determine if common organically managed rotations are depleting P reserves or if large reserves still exist in unavailable forms. The research was performed in the 13th year of the Glenlea Long-term Crop Rotation and Management study in southern Manitoba. The site has three 4-yr rotations under Organic and Conventional management: spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa-flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) (forage grain) with and without manure compost, and spring wheat-field pea (Pisum sativum L.)-spring wheat-flax (grain only), as well as a restored prairie grass planting (Prairie). Conventional treatments received synthetic fertilizers and herbicides whereas the Organic received no inputs other than a one-time application of manure compost. The modified Hedley sequential P extraction procedure revealed organic management to have lower concentrations of readily available P than conventional but recalcitrant forms were similar between systems. The Prairie had P concentrations similar to conventional in all forms. Estimated cumulative P balance indicated that organic grain-only rotations compared to conventional had low P removal resulting in slightly lower concentration of available-P forms. The high yielding and P removal rotation of forage-grain decreased available-P forms to below an agronomic response threshold. Only high yielding, high P export organic rotations are a concern for developing P deficiency depending on initial reserves and the length of time without additional inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3aorganic production 3acrop yield 3asoil fertility 3aphosphorus 3anutrient availability 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient uptake 3acomposted manure 3amineral fertilizers 3aherbicides 3anutrient deficiencies1 aTenuta, M.1 aFlaten, D.

While the standard economic reasoning is that these institutional constraints lead to welfare losses, the size of those losses and optimal second-best policies are usually unknown. We develop a dynamic bioeconomic model, in which a scientific body provides an optimal TAC given restrictions on (i) transferability between vessel segments and (ii) entrance of new vessels. Further, we also quantify welfare losses arising from not maximizing economic welfare, but physical yield—which is actually the case in many fisheries. We apply the model to the Northeast Arctic cod fishery, and estimate not only the cost and harvesting functions of the various vessel types, but also the parameters of the biological model as well as those of the demand function. This allows us to determine optimal second-best policies and quantify corresponding welfare effects for our case study fishery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomic models 3acase studies 3ademand functions 3afisheries 3aharvesting 3aissues and policy 3aArctic region1 aEikeset, AnneMaria1 avan Soest, Daan1 aDiekert, FlorianKlaus1 aStenseth, NilsChr.0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2018 Apr., v. 69, no. 4 p.811-835dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-016-0106-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245008600162520135500248592002801603650002001631650002301651650001301674650001601687650001401703650001701717650001001734650001501744651001901759700001801778700001901796700001801815700002001833773012001853856007301973852000902046655001202055IND60744122020221123022237.0210709e20210628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074412202DNAL7 a10.3390/w131317892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Mayra,10aExploring the Spatial Impact of Green Infrastructure on Urban Drainage Resilience  aThis paper explores the spatial impact of green infrastructure (GI) location on the resilience of urban drainage systems by the application of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). A framework that integrates resilience assessment, location sensitivity analysis and ESDA is presented and applied to an urban catchment in the United Kingdom. Three types of GI, namely a bioretention cell, permeable pavement, and green roof, are evaluated separately and simultaneously. Resilience is assessed using stress-strain tests, which measure the system performance based on the magnitude and duration of sewer flooding and combined sewer overflows. Based on the results of a location sensitivity analysis, ESDA is applied to determine if there is spatial autocorrelation, spatial clusters, and spatial outliers. Results show a stronger spatial dependency using sewer flooding indicators. Different GI measures present differences in spatial autocorrelation and spatial cluster results, highlighting the differences in their underlying mechanisms. The finding of conflicting spatial clusters indicates that there are trade-offs in the placement of GI in certain locations. The proposed framework can be used as a tool for GI spatial planning, helping in the development of a systematic approach for resilience-performance orientated GI design and planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3abioretention areas 3adrainage 3agreen roofs 3apavements 3aspatial data 3awater 3awatersheds 3aUnited Kingdom1 aFu, Guangtao 1 aButler, David 1 aYuan, Zhiguo 1 aSharma, Keshab 0 tWater.g2021 June 28, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131317893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03356naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245013800165300001600303520204000319592002802359650002002387650002402407650001202431650001802443650001602461650001902477650002702496650002402523650002002547650002302567650001602590650001902606650002002625650001202645650002202657700001602679700002402695700001702719773009302736856008402829852000902913655001202922IND4447420320221120055625.0141112e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444742032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2010.06.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, R.A.10aEffect of dietary betaine supplementation on growth, carcass and immunity of New Zealand White rabbits under high ambient temperature  ap. 103-109.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary betaine supplementation on growth performance, carcass characteristics, rectal temperature, respiration rate and immune response of growing rabbits under high ambient temperature. A total of 120 weaned New Zealand White male rabbits, 6weeks old, were randomly divided into five experimental treatments (24 each). Animals were fed ad libitum the basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 250, 500, 750 and 1000mg betaine/kg diet from 6 to 12weeks of age. Animals were provided with water freely. The average daily temperature and relative humidity inside the rabbitry were 30.3±0.9°C and 76.2±2.5%, respectively. Under heat stress conditions, diet significantly increased the body weight and hot carcass weight and significantly reduced the feed conversion. Dietary 1000 and 750mg betaine/kg increased (P<0.05) final body weights (2529.1 and 2418.5g, respectively) compared with the control (2110.3g). Betaine supplementation ameliorated some of the adverse effects of heat stress on immune responsiveness, rectal temperature and respiration rate. Dietary 250, 500, 750 and 1000mg betaine/kg led to a decrease in rectal temperature (40.03, 39.85, 39.63 and 39.53°C, respectively) compared with the control (40.20°C). The inclusion of 1000mg betaine/kg in the growing rabbits' diets nearly doubled the humoral and immune responses compared to the controls (P<0.05) and significantly reduced rectal temperature and respiration rate. Serum T3, T4, total protein, globulin and total lipids were significantly increased while serum glucose concentration was significantly decreased due to dietary betaine. In conclusion, supplemental dietary betaine enhanced growth performance and humoral and cell-mediated immunity as well as reduced rectal temperature and respiration rate in growing rabbits subjected to heat stress. From an economic point of view, high levels of betaine are not recommended because betaine is reasonably effective at lower, less expensive, doses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aambient temperature 3abetaine 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acarcass weight 3acell-mediated immunity 3adietary supplements 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3aimmune response 3arabbits 3arelative humidity1 aEbeid, T.A.1 aAbd El-Lateif, A.I.1 aIsmail, N.B.0 tLivestock science.g2011 Feb., v. 135, no. 2-3 p.103-109dElsevier B.V.x1871-14137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2010.06.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008300166300001600249520107300265592002801338650001301366650002401379650001201403700001901415700001901434700001901453700001901472700002001491700001901511700001601530700002201546700001901568773009801587856008101685990002301766852000901789655001201798IND60093759320221121024926.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009375932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuh, Jun-Young10aLight and bias stability of a-IGZO TFT fabricated by r.f. magnetron sputtering  ap.

For the investigation of electrical bias effect on device stability, +20 V gate bias or −20 V gate bias was continuously applied on devices for 10000 s. For the investigation of illumination effect, we used monochromatic light source illuminating devices under the stress test. There was a specific stress condition to result in the degradation of device performance. Our IGZO TFT was considerably degraded only when the negative gate bias was applied with the light illumination. The subthreshold region was stretched in the negative direction and a humped shaped was observed in the middle of the subthreshold region. We propose two kinds of possible degradation mechanisms on the basis of experimental results and numerical simulations. The one is hole trapping in the gate insulator and the other is the change of transition level of deep donor states. The peculiar humped shape in the subthreshold region could be explained by the latter mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3alighting 3amathematical models 3aphysics1 aSeo, Seung-Bum1 aPark, Han-Sung1 aJeon, Jae-Hong1 aChoe, Hee-Hwan1 aLee, Kang-Woong1 aSeo, Jong-Huyn1 aRyu, Min-Ki1 aKo Park, Sang-Hee1 aHwang, Chi-Sun0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 Sept., v. 11, no. 5S p.S49-S53dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015500154300001600309500002000325520173900345592002802084650001502112650001002127650001302137650001602150650001102166650001902177650001002196650001302206650001802219650002102237650001302258650001202271700002302283700001602306700002002322700005302342773012402395856007402519852000902593655001202602IND60754086420221119170650.0211023e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408642DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.128902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, Maya10aTreatment with chloroquine is retinotoxic in captive African penguins (Speniscus demersus). Attenuation and recovery of electroretinographic responses  ap. 336-345.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of prophylactic anti‐malarial chloroquine treatment, and its cessation, on electroretinographic (ERG) responses of captive African penguins. METHODS: A brief ERG protocol (“QuickRetCheck”) was recorded under mesopic conditions with manual restraint and no sedation or pupil dilation. Birds were recorded on two separate occasions, first while being treated with a daily chloroquine dose of 10 mg/kg for 12 days (n = 15, treatment group) and second after 4 months without chloroquine treatment (n = 6, off‐treatment group). Three birds were recorded on both occasions. Three other birds from the flock that died were studied histopathologically. RESULTS: Scotopic responses were unmeasurable in either recording and therefore were not analyzed. Mean a‐ and b‐wave amplitudes of the mixed rod‐cone responses to standard (3 cd·s/m²) and high (10 cd·s/m²) intensity flashes were higher in the off‐treatment group. No difference in implicit times was observed. Sex, age, and number of previous chloroquine treatments did not affect ERG responses. Histopathology revealed Plasmodium spp.in the lungs, liver, and brain, but not in the eyes, of the necropsied birds, and there were no signs of retinitis or retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Daily chloroquine treatment was associated with attenuated ERG responses in penguins, which improve following cessation of treatment. Further work is warranted to establish a chloroquine dose that is efficacious yet has minimal adverse effects. Our results suggest that ERG responses of captive penguins undergoing ERG for any indication (such as prior to cataract surgery), must be evaluated in light of the birds' anti‐malaria treatment status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium 3abrain 3acataract 3achloroquine 3aflocks 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3anecropsy 3aophthalmology 3aretinal diseases 3asedation 3asurgery1 aAvni‐Magen, Nili1 aPe'er, Oren1 aBerkowitz, Asaf1 aOfri, Ron1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3825-31130 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2021 July, v. 24, no. 4 p.336-345dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.128903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013600154520133100290592002801621650001201649650001901661650001401680650001501694650001001709650001201719650001401731650001501745650001601760650001101776650001301787650001601800650001401816650002001830700002001850700002101870773012001891856007302011852000902084655001202093IND60744122120221123022156.0210709e20210629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074412212DNAL7 a10.3390/w131317912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Siyu 10aApplication of Polyaluminium Chloride Coagulant in Urban River Water Treatment Influenced the Microbial Community in River Sediment  aPolyaluminium chloride (PAC) has been widely used as a chemical coagulant in water treatment. However, little is known about the impact of PAC performance on the microbial community in sediments. In this study, the archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities in urban river sediments with and without PAC treatment were investigated. Prokaryotic diversity decreased at the PAC addition site (A2) and increased along with the river flow (from A3 to A4), while eukaryotic diversity was the opposite. The abundance of core microbiota showed a similar trend. For example, the dominant Proteobacteria presented the highest relative abundance in A1 (26.8%) and the lowest in A2 (15.3%), followed by A3 (17.5%) and A4 (23.0%). In contrast, Rozellomycota was more dominant in A2 (56.6%) and A3 (58.1%) than in A1 (6.2%) and A4 (16.3%). Salinity, total dissolved solids, and metal contents were identified as the key physicochemical factors affecting the assembly of core microorganisms. The predicted functions of archaea and fungi were mainly divided into methane cycling and saprotrophic nutrition, respectively, while bacterial function was more diversified. The above findings are helpful to enhance our understanding of microorganism response to PAC and have significance for water treatment within the framework of microecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aProteobacteria 3achlorides 3acoagulants 3afungi 3amethane 3anutrition 3ariver flow 3ariver water 3arivers 3asalinity 3asaprotrophs 3asediments 3awater treatment1 aZhuang, Xuchao 1 aWang, Chuandong 0 tWater.g2021 June 29, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131317913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02570naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011500167300001600282520119300298592002801491650000801519650002601527650001701553650003901570650002101609650001801630650001501648650003101663650002501694650001901719650001801738653003001756653002301786653002201809700003101831700002101862700002001883700001701903773012501920856008202045852000902127655001202136IND60599317220221120145748.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059931722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Shin Yong10aDNA fluorescence shift sensor: A rapid method for the detection of DNA hybridization using silver nanoclusters  ap. 183-188.  aDNA-templated silver nanoclusters (AgNC) are a class of subnanometer sized fluorophores with good photostability and brightness. It has been applied as a diagnostic tool mainly for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection. Integration of DNA oligomers to generate AgNCs is interesting as varying DNA sequences can result in different fluorescence spectra. This allows a simple fluorescence shifting effect to occur upon DNA hybridization with the hybridization efficiency being a pronominal factor for successful shifting. The ability to shift the fluorescence spectra as a result of hybridization overcomes the issue of background intensities in most fluorescent based assays. Here we describe an optimized method for the detection of single-stranded and double-stranded synthetic forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) target by hybridization with the DNA fluorescence shift sensor. The system forms a three-way junction by successful hybridization of AgNC, G-rich strand (G-rich) to the target DNA, which generated a shift in fluorescence spectra with a marked increase in fluorescence intensity. The DNA fluorescence shift sensor presents a rapid and specific alternative to conventional DNA detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3ahybridization 3ananosilver 3anucleic acid hybridization 3anucleotide sequences 3aphotostability 3arapid methods 0aSilver nanocluster (AgNC) 0aFluorescence shift 0aDNA hybridization1 aHairul Bahara, Nur Hidayah1 aChoong, Yee Siew1 aLim, Theam Soon1 aTye, Gee Jun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 433 p.183-188dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245004900167300001600216520069200232592002800924650001500952650001500967650001500982650001500997650001201012650002101024650001801045650001401063650002101077650001301098650002801111653001001139653001101149653000801160653001101168653000901179653000801188653000801196653001001204653000901214653000801223653000801231653000901239653000801248653000701256653001001263653001001273653001001283653000701293653000801300653000901308653000801317653000901325653001101334653000901345653000901354653001001363653000901373653000801382653001001390653000801400653000801408653000801416653000801424653000701432653001001439653000901449653000901458653000801467653001401475653002101489653002901510653002601539653001801565700002501583700002801608773011101636856008301747852000901830655001201839IND60553612820221120061821.0180831e20170115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.09.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan, Rajeev10aRapid biosensing tools for cancer biomarkers  ap. 918-930.  aThe present review critically discusses the latest developments in the field of smart diagnostic systems for cancer biomarkers.

The quinoid thiophene in TTDBC can endow not only a wide optical band gap (∼1.9 eV) but also a deep HOMO (∼5.3 eV) for the resulting polymers. The conventional configuration solar cells based on PTTDBC-BTC12 exhibit a large Vₒc of 0.91 V and a power conversion efficiency of 4.30% (with a Jₛc of 9.27 mA cm–² and a FF of 0.51), while a slightly higher PCE of 4.50% can be achieved for the inverted structure devices. We believe that these wide band gap polymers have potential to be used for tandem cell applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3asolar cells 3athiophene1 aZang, Yue1 aChueh, Chu-Chen1 aCho, Namchul1 aLu, Jinrong1 aWang, Xuyang1 aHuang, Jiang1 aLi, Chang-Zhi1 aYu, Junsheng1 aJen, Alex K.-Y.0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Nov. 11, v. 47, no. 21 p.7407-7415dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501736m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245011500179300001400294520097800308592002801286650000801314650001601322650001501338650001901353650001901372650001301391650001601404650001101420650001301431650001001444650002601454650002301480651001101503653001601514653001601530653003001546653001601576653001401592653002201606700003001628700006601658700003901724700002401763700003201787700002801819700002901847700002801876773011101904856008602015852000902101655001202110IND60542844120221120211837.0190408e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViccini, Lyderson Facio10aCitral and linalool content has been correlated to DNA content in Lippia alba (Mill.)

The samples were cloned from cuttings, grown under identical greenhouse conditions and collected simultaneously to eliminate as many variables as possible. The foliage was subjected to steam distillation and subsequently analyzed by GC/MS. The DNA content of the accessions was also estimated. In addition to some morphological variations, the principal essential oil components varied significantly among the samples.

Conventional and molecular identification proved that bacterial isolates belonging to Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, Pectobacterium atrosepticum, Dickeya solani and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The above plant bacterial isolates and human pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli, Sarcina lutea, and Staphylococcus aureus were used for the bioassay. The chloroform leaf extracts from Duranta plumieri variegata, Lantana camara, and Citharexylum spinosum were assayed for their antibacterial activity by measuring the inhibition zones and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The suggested chemical compositions of extracts were analyzed using GC/MS apparatus. The main compounds in leaf extract of L. camara were 5,8-diethyl-dodecane, pyrimidin-2-one, 4-[N-methylureido]-1-[4-methylaminocarbonyloxymethyl, oleic acid,3-(octadecyloxy)propyl ester; in D. plumieri were 4,7-dimethoxy-2-methylindan-1-one and 5-(hexadecyloxy)-2-pentadecyl-,trans-1,3-dioxane; and in C. spinosum were N-[5-(3-hydroxy-2-methylpropenyl)-1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenzo[cd]indol-3-yl]-N-methylacetamide. Promising activity was found against A. tumefaciens, E. coli, P. carotovorum, Sar. lutea, and Staph. aureus with MIC values of 8, 128, 64, 500 and 500 μg/mL, respectively, as L. camara leaf extract was applied. D. plumieri leaf extract showed good activity against D. solani and P. atrosepticum with MIC values of 16 μg/mL and 128 μg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, weak bioactivity was found with leaf extract from C. spinosum. It could be concluded that leaf extracts from D. plumieri and L. camara have a promising antibacterial agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aDickeya solani 3aDuranta erecta 3aEscherichia coli 3aLantana camara 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aPectobacterium carotovorum 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3abioactive compounds 3abioassays 3achloroform 3acrown galls 3adioxane 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aleaf extracts 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apears 3apotatoes 3atrees 3atubers 3awoody plants 0aCrown gall 0aBacterial pathogens 0aBioactive molecules 0aLeaf extracts 0aSoft rot 0aWoody plants1 aSalem, Mohamed Z.M.1 aEL-Hefny, Mervat1 aAbd El-Kareem, Mamoun S.M.1 aEl-Shanhorey, Nader A.1 aMohamed, Abeer A.1 aSalem, Abdelfattah Z.M.0 tMicrobial pathogenesis.g2018 Aug., v. 121 p.331-340dElsevier LtdwJournal:11911x0882-40107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03376naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245023600162520214600398592002802544650001902572650001302591650002802604650002502632650002602657650001002683650001002693650001602703650001502719650001102734651001402745651001002759651001002769700001802779773012302797856007302920852000902993655001203002IND60660458820221119234109.0190823e20190812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066045882DNAL7 a10.3390/d110801322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKritsky, Delane C.10aDactylogyrids (Platyhelminthes: Monogenoidea) Infecting the Gill Lamellae of Flatheads (Scorpaeniformes: Platycephalidae), with Proposal of <em>Platycephalotrema</em> n. gen. and Descriptions of New Species from Australia and Japan  aPlatycephalotrema n. gen.

The study was carried out from January 2014 to July 2015 in the southwestern Bay of Bengal (BoB) and sampling was carried out on board Sagar Manjusha and Sagar Purvi. SST ranged from 26.2 to 33.1 °C while Chl-a varied from 0.04 to 6.09 μg L⁻¹. During the course of the study period, there was a weak correlation (r = 0.32) between SST and Chl-a statistically. MSP biomass varied from 0.42 to 9.63 mg C m⁻³ and inversely related with SST. Two kinds of approaches were adopted to develop the model by grouping seasonal datasets (four seasonal algorithms) and comprising all datasets (one annual algorithm). Among the four functions used (linear, paraboloid, the Lorentzian and the Gaussian functions), paraboloid model was best suited. The best seasonal and annual algorithms were applied in the synchronous MODIS-derived SST and Chl-a data to estimate the MSP biomass in the southwestern BoB. The modelled MSP biomass was validated with field MSP biomass and the result was statistically significant, showing maximum regression coefficient for the seasonal algorithms (R² = 0.60; p = 0.627; α = 0.05), than the annual algorithm (R² = 0.52; p = 0.015, α = 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3adata collection 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3asurface water temperature 3azooplankton 3aBay of Bengal1 aSaravanakumar, A.1 aThangaradjou, T.1 aSolanki, H.U.1 aRaman, Mini0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Apr., v. 190, no. 4 p.246-246dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6578-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03524naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245020300192300001800395500001100413520154300424592002801967596010501995596006902100650002302169650002302192650002502215650001702240650001302257650002502270650002702295650002002322650001002342650001102352650001402363650001502377650004302392650001402435650002002449650002402469650001502493650001702508650001302525650002902538650002402567700001402591700005402605700001602659700001702675700001702692700003202709773012302741856007302864852000902937655001202946IND60675777820221118044244.0191108e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067577782DNAL7 a10.1111/are.143162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5214-905910aCloning, characterization and transcription analysis of fatty acyl desaturase (Δ6Fad‐like) and elongase (Elovl4‐like, Elove5‐like) during embryos development of Strongylocentrotus intermedius  ap. 3483-3492.  aREVIEW  aStrongylocentrotus intermedius has high nutritional value because it is rich in proteins, amino acids and long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC‐PUFA). LC‐PUFA are essential nutrients that not only determine the nutritional value of sea urchins but also guarantee normal growth and reproduction performance. To better understand the molecular basis of LC‐PUFA biosynthesis in S. intermedius, the Δ6Fad‐like, Elovl4‐like and Elovl5‐like genes were cloned and fatty acid compositions during the early developmental stages of sea urchins were detected. The full‐length of Δ6Fad‐like was 2,199 bp, with a putative open reading frame of 1,248 bp encoding a polypeptide of 415 amino acid (AA). The Elovl4‐like and Elovl5‐like genes encoded 310 and 234 AA, respectively, which exhibited all of the characteristics of the Elovl family, such as a histidine box motif and putative transmembrane‐spanning domains. Tissue distribution analysis revealed that Δ6Fad‐like, Elovl4‐like and Elovl5‐like genes were expressed at the highest levels in the gonads and intestine, and the expression levels gradually increased in embryos during development. These results can help to understand the role of the Δ6Fad‐like, Elovl4‐like and Elovl5‐like genes in the different developmental stages of the sea urchin and to clarify the biosynthetic pathways of LC‐PUFA during the development of the sea urchin and provide a theoretical basis for improving the quality and breeding of excellent traits in sea urchins.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014cElitist of Agricultural Scientific Research and Innovative Team of the Ministry of Agriculture  a20170540108cScience and Technology Project of Liaoning Province 3aStrongylocentrotus 3aacetyltransferases 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding 3adevelopmental stages 3afatty acid composition 3agene expression 3agenes 3agonads 3ahistidine 3aintestines 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3anutrients 3anutritive value 3aopen reading frames 3aoxygenases 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3areproductive performance 3atissue distribution1 aYang, Dan1 aWang, Heng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0829-65231 aZuo, Rantao1 aQi, Shoubing1 aHan, Lingshu1 aChzhan, I︠A︡t︠s︡in,0 tAquaculture research.g2019 Dec., v. 50, no. 12 p.3483-3492dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.143163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015900165300001600324520110400340592002801444650001201472650001501484650000901499650001301508650001801521650001101539650001201550650001301562650001901575650001201594650001301606700001701619700001901636700001701655700001701672773009801689856008101787990002301868852000901891655001201900IND60093759720221121015930.0141104e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009375972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Dongwoo,10aEffect of ammonia (NH₃) plasma treatment on silicon nitride (SiNₓ) gate dielectric for organic thin film transistor with soluble organic semiconductor  ap. S67-S72.  aThe effect of an ammonia plasma treatment on silicon nitride (SiNₓ) gate dielectrics for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) with soluble organic semiconductors (OSCs) was studied. Our OTFTs were fabricated by using the soluble derivatives of Poly(bi-thiophene) as the p-type polymer semiconductor material and SiNₓ thin films with nitrogen oxygen (N₂O) and ammonia (NH₃) plasma treatments as the gate dielectric. To improve the performance and stability of the OTFT devices, we studied the basic mechanism of the plasma treatment on the SiNₓ gate dielectric and the gold (Au) electrode surface. The SiNₓ-OTFTs with a NH₃ plasma treatment yielded the improved results in terms of a higher field-effect mobility (μfₑ) of 0.06 cm² V⁻¹ S⁻¹ with a lower interface charge trap density of 4.45 × 10⁻¹¹ (cm² eV)⁻¹ and a lower contact resistance of 0.384 MΩ-cm. The repulsive force of the soluble OSC solvent was reduced at the edge of the source-drain (S-D) electrode due to the difference between the surface energies of the channel region and Au S-D electrodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aelectrodes 3agold 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3aphysics 3apolymers 3asemiconductors 3asilicon 3asolvents1 aKim, DooHyun1 aKim, HyoungJin1 aSo, HyunWook1 aHong, MunPyo0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 Sept., v. 11, no. 5S p.S67-S72dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.05.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009900170300001200269520187700281592002802158650002702186650001702213650001302230650000902243650002102252650001502273650001002288650001302298650001502311650001002326650001202336650001502348651002302363651001302386700001702399773015102416856008202567852000902649655001202658IND60592065120221117080917.0180619e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059206512DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6627-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKniowski, AndrewB.10aSpatial factors of white-tailed deer herbivory assessment in the central Appalachian Mountains  ap. 248.  aBecause moderate to over-abundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory impacts biodiversity and can alter community function, ecological benchmarks of herbivory impact are needed to assess deer impacts. We evaluated spatial patterns of deer herbivory and their relation to herbivory assessment by evaluating woody vegetation along 20 transects at each of 30 sites spread across a wide range of deer herd densities and vegetative condition throughout the biodiverse Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, USA. Surprisingly, herbivory patterns and the availability of woody forage generally were unchanged among physiographic regions and land use diversity classes. However, some relationships between browsing pattern and vegetation varied with scale. The total quantity of vegetation browsed on a given site and at the transect scale were related positively to the availability of forage, as the proportion of stems browsed decreased as stem density increased. However, this was only true when all stems were considered equally. When stem densities by species were weighted for deer preference, the proportion of stems browsed had no relationship or increased with stem density. Compared to the value from all transects sampled, on average, the mean of ≥ 3 transects within a site was within 0.1 of the browsing ratio and stem densities were within 0.5 stems m⁻². Our results suggest that one transect per square kilometer with a minimum of three transects may be sufficient for most browsing intensity survey requirements to assess herbivory impacts in the Appalachian region of Virginia. Still, inclusion of spatial factors to help partition variation of deer herbivory potentially may allow for improved precision and accuracy in the design of field herbivory impact assessment methods and improve their application across various landscape contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3abiodiversity 3abrowsing 3adeer 3aecological zones 3aherbivores 3aherds 3aland use 3alandscapes 3astems 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aAppalachian region 3aVirginia1 aFord, W.Mark0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Apr., v. 190, no. 4 p.248-248dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6627-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245014100169300001600310500002000326520139800346592002801744596008601772650001501858650000901873650001801882650001101900700002701911700002401938700002801962700002201990700006402012773012502076856007402201852000902275655001202284IND60754087020221119170553.0211023e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408702DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.129292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerdchuchuen, Kamolchanok10aComparison of intraocular pressure in healthy brachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic cats using the Icare® TONOVET Plus rebound tonometer  ap. 484-490.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To compare intraocular pressure using the Icare® TONOVET Plus rebound tonometer in healthy brachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic cats. ANIMALS STUDIED: Both eyes of 78 healthy cats were investigated in this study. Cats were divided into two groups: brachycephalic (n = 39) and nonbrachycephalic (n = 39). PROCEDURES: Nose position and muzzle ratio were photographically recorded and analyzed. Physical and ophthalmic examinations were performed. Intraocular pressure was measured using the Icare® TONOVET Plus rebound tonometry instrument. Quantitative mean values were statistically compared using an unpaired t‐test at a significance level of p < .05. RESULTS: Mean values of the nose position and muzzle ratio were significantly lower in the brachycephalic group (20.14 ± 5.43%, 9.61 ± 3.29%) compared with the nonbrachycephalic group (29.21 ± 4.30%, 13.97 ± 6.01%). The mean intraocular pressure for brachycephalic cats (15.76 ± 0.50 mmHg) was significantly lower (p < .001) than for nonbrachycephalic cats (18.77 ± 0.49 mmHg). CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular pressure was significantly lower in brachycephalic cats using the Icare® TONOVET Plus rebound tonometer. Intraocular pressure values obtained in this study could be used as a guideline for measurements obtained using this tonometry device in healthy brachycephalic and nonbrachycephalic cats.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Special Project 2019, Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University 3aguidelines 3anose 3aophthalmology 3at-test1 aSamathayanon, Kingkarn1 aPhientong, Pitchapa1 aChattraphirat, Suprapha1 aJaturakan, Orapun1 aTuntivanich, Nalinee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4214-78150 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2021 Sept., v. 24, no. 5 p.484-490dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.129293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245006700178300001400245520086700259592002801126650001601154650001001170650001801180650002601198650001501224650001001239650002301249650003101272650003201303650001101335650001001346650001501356650002401371650002101395650001301416700002401429700001901453773009501472856008401567852000901651655001201660IND60553613120221120073111.0161021e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2013.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdarme-Vega, T Catalina10aTowards sustainable sources for omega-3 fatty acids production  ap. 14-18.  aOmega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docohexaenoic acid (DHA), provide significant health benefits for brain function/development and cardiovascular conditions. However, most EPA and DHA for human consumption is sourced from small fatty fish caught in coastal waters and, with depleting global fish stocks, recent research has been directed towards more sustainable sources. These include aquaculture with plant-based feeds, krill, marine microalgae, microalgae-like protists and genetically-modified plants. To meet the increasing demand for EPA and DHA, further developments are needed towards land-based sources. In particular large-scale cultivation of microalgae and plants is likely to become a reality with expected reductions in production costs, yield increasese and the adequate addressing of genetically modified food acceptance issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquaculture 3abrain 3acoastal water 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty fish 3afeeds 3afood acceptability 3agenetically modified foods 3agenetically modified plants 3ahumans 3akrill 3amicroalgae 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aproduction costs 3aprotists1 aThomas-Hall, Skye R1 aSchenk, Peer M0 tCurrent opinion in biotechnology.g2014 Apr., v. 26 p.14-18dElsevier Ltdx0958-16697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.copbio.2013.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01735naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014200169300001600311520054000327592002800867650001400895650002300909650001500932650001500947650004400962650002301006700002001029700002201049700002301071700002301094700002301117700002301140773011801163856008301281852000901364655001201373IND60698298620221117012350.0220225e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069829862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-020-03068-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYakovleva, M.

Pers.] along Latitudinal Gradients and the Relationship with Polyploidy Level  aUnderstanding the population genetic pattern and process of gene flow requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. Although Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (common bermudagrass) is widely distributed in the world, information on its genetic pattern and population structure along latitudinal gradients is limited. We tried to estimate the genetic diversity and genetic structure of C. dactylon along a latitudinal gradient across China. Genetic diversity among different ploidy levels was also compared in the study. The material used consisted of 296 C. dactylon individuals sampled from 16 geographic sites from 22&deg;35&prime; N to 36&deg;18&prime; N. Genetic diversity was estimated using 153 expressed sequence tag-derived simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) loci. Higher within-population genetic diversity appeared at low-latitude, as well as having positive correlation with temperature and precipitation. The genetic diversity increased with the ploidy level of C. dactylon, suggesting polyploidy creates higher genetic diversity. No isolation by distance and notable admixture structure existed among populations along latitudes. Both seed dispersal (or vegetative organs) and extrinsic pollen played important roles for gene flow in shaping the spatial admixture population structure of C. dactylon along latitudes. In addition, populations were separated into three clusters according to ploidy levels. C. dactylon has many such biological characters of perennial growth, wind-pollination, polyploidy, low genetic differentiation among populations, sexual and asexual reproduction leading to higher genetic diversity, which gives it strong adaptability with its genetic patterns being very complex across all the sampled latitudes. The findings of this study are related to landscape population evolution, polyploidy speciation, preservation, and use of bermudagrass breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aasexual reproduction 3aexpressed sequence tags 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant breeding 3apollen 3apolyploidy 3apopulation structure 3aseed dispersal 3atemperature 3awind pollination 3aChina1 aWang, Miaoli 1 aGuo, Zhipeng 1 aGuan, Yongzhuo 1 aLiu, Jianyu 1 aYan, Xuebing 1 aGuo, Yuxia 0 tDiversity.g2019 Aug. 14, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d110801353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245013500197300001600332500001700348520172400365592002802089650001702117650002102134650001102155650000902166650001202175650001802187650001202205650001002217650001402227700002602241700005902267700001802326700002402344773012502368856007402493852000902567655001202576IND60754087120221119170500.0211023e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408712DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.128842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavaud, Arnold1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7415-058410aPenetrating Keratoplasty in Dogs using Acellular Porcine Corneal Stroma (BioCorneaVet™): A prospective pilot study of five cases  ap. 543-553.  aCase Reports  aOBJECTIVE: This prospective pilot study was conducted to evaluate the outcome of a commercially available corneal stroma substitute, Acellular Porcine Corneal Stroma (APCS), in dogs undergoing penetrating keratoplasty (PK) to restore corneal integrity after having deep ulcers. METHOD: Five dogs (1 eye in each dog) underwent a PK using APCS (BioCorneaVet™) as a graft. The surgical procedure and peri‐ and postoperative treatment were standardized. All cases required a minimum 6 months follow‐up. Ease of keratoprosthetic tissue handling, graft survival, anterior chamber stability, corneal opacity, neovascularization and re‐epithelialization were noted. Presence of secondary uveitis was investigated. RESULTS: BioCorneaVet™ was easy to handle and, at all‐time points, provided adequate tectonic support. Graft survival was achieved in all 5 cases. A minimum follow‐up period of 10 months was available for the five eyes (22 months maximum). Degree and area of corneal graft opacity progressively improved resulting in minimal to moderate loss of transparency in all cases but one, where it was severe. Neovascularization degree was most severe 0.5–1 month after surgery and fully resolved 4–6 months post‐surgery. Re‐epithelialization was complete in the majority of grafts in 1 month. Secondary uveitis was not detected at any time in 4 of 5 dogs. CONCLUSION: BioCorneaVet™ seems to be an effective graft for PK in the dog. In this case series, APCS was convenient to handle during surgery and provided excellent tectonic support. The material showed good tissue biocompatibility and resulted in the majority of cases in minimal to moderate graft opacity, that ameliorates with time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abiocompatibility 3acornea 3adogs 3aopacity 3aophthalmology 3asurgery 3aswine 3atectonics1 aKowalska, Malwina Ewa1 aVoelter, Katrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6349-67821 aPot, Simon A.1 aRampazzo, Antonella0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2021 Sept., v. 24, no. 5 p.543-553dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.128843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008400159520213900243592002802382650001502410650002002425650001802445650001202463650002502475650001002500650001502510650001002525650001402535700002302549700002102572700002302593773012902616856007502745852000902820655001202829IND60757933320221119134949.0211125e20211116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075793332DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132245982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArkin, Jeremy 10aEstimation of Vertical Fuel Layers in Tree Crowns Using High Density LiDAR Data  aThe accurate prediction and mitigation of wildfire behaviour relies on accurate estimations of forest canopy fuels. New techniques to collect LiDAR point clouds from remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) allow for the prediction of forest fuels at extremely fine scales. This study uses a new method to examine the ability of such point clouds to characterize the vertical arrangement and volume of crown fuels from within individual trees. This method uses the density and vertical arrangement of LiDAR points to automatically extract and measure the dimensions of each cluster of vertical fuel. The amount and dimensions of these extracted clusters were compared against manually measured clusters that were collected through the manual measurement of over 100 trees. This validation dataset was composed of manual point cloud measurements for all portions of living crown fuel for each tree. The point clouds used for this were ground-based LiDAR point clouds that were ~80 times denser than the RPAS LiDAR point clouds. Over 96% of the extracted clusters were successfully matched to a manually measured cluster, representing ~97% of the extracted volume. A smaller percentage of the manually measured clusters (~79%) were matched to an extracted cluster, although these represented ~99% of the total measured volume. The vertical arrangement and dimensions of the matched clusters corresponded strongly to one another, although the automated method generally overpredicted each cluster’s lower boundary. Tree-level volumes and crown width were, respectively, predicted with R-squared values of 0.9111 and 0.7984 and RMSE values of 44.36 m² and 0.53 m. Weaker relationships were observed for tree-level metrics that relied on the extraction of lower crown features (live crown length, live crown base height, lowest live branch height). These metrics were predicted with R-squared values of 0.5568, 0.3120, and 0.2011 and RMSE values of 3.53 m, 3.55 m, and 3.66 m. Overall, this study highlights strengths and weaknesses of the developed method and the utility of RPAS LiDAR point clouds relative to ground-based point clouds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3adata collection 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3afuels (fire ecology) 3alidar 3aprediction 3atrees 3awildfires1 aCoops, Nicholas C.1 aDaniels, Lori D.1 aPlowright, Andrew 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 16, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132245983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007000139245009200209300001600301500001700317520174700334592002802081650001102109650002202120650001102142650000902153650001002162650001402172650001802186650001302204650001702217650004002234700006102274700006202335700001802397773012502415856007402540852000902614655001202623IND60754087220221119170445.0211023e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075408722DNAL7 a10.1111/vop.129312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuellerleile, Lisa‐Marie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0969-806510aTopical bevacizumab for the treatment of corneal vascularization in dogs: A case series  ap. 554-568.  aCase Reports  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect and safety of topical anti‐human vascular endothelial growth factor bevacizumab in dogs with persistent corneal vascularization. ANIMALS STUDIED: Prospective case series of 15 adult dogs (20 eyes). PROCEDURES: Dogs received 0.25% bevacizumab eye drops BID for 28 days. Follow‐ups were scheduled 28 days and 6–7 months after treatment start. Macroscopic findings were scored for conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, ocular discharge, corneal edema, vascularization, and pigmentation. Vascularized area was assessed by analyzing photographs using an imaging software. RESULTS: The treatment response was variable. Some cases showed a marked reduction in vascularized area and edema, while other eyes had subtle signs of improvement. Vascularization score decreased from 1.5 to 1.1 and vascularized area was reduced by 48.8% after 28 days. A thinning of vessels, consolidation of areal bleedings into fine vascular networks, decrease in distal vessel branching, and a change from blurry vascularized beds into demarcated thin vessels were observed. One dog developed a SCCED 6 months after the last bevacizumab administration. Two dogs died 4 and 4.5 months after the last bevacizumab administration, aged 16 and 12 years, respectively. In all events, a causal relationship is unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that topical 0.25% bevacizumab may be an effective treatment option for corneal vascularization in dogs. Further long‐term placebo‐controlled studies with larger patient cohorts are recommended to provide scientific evidence of efficacy and to investigate dosage, safety, possible use as a single treatment, and routes of administration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acomputer software 3acornea 3adogs 3aedema 3ahyperemia 3aophthalmology 3apatients 3apigmentation 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aBernkopf, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9319-25601 aWambacher, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8668-04001 aNell, Barbara0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2021 Sept., v. 24, no. 5 p.554-568dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58131x1463-52167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vop.129313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03132naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011300167300001800280520210800298592002802406650001802434650001202452650001502464650001502479650001402494650001302508650001402521651001902535700001702554773014302571856008302714852000902797655001202806IND60648544220221118183220.0200217e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064854422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDraper, Carrie10aP189 The Readiness of Health Clinics to Partner with the SNAP-Ed Program on Nutrition Support Implementation  ap. S117-S118.  aThe national SNAP-Ed Evaluation Framework encourages program implementers to assess the readiness of potential partner sites as a short-term outcome. The readiness of health clinics to partner with the program is an understudied area, though, this setting on the surface seems ripe for partnership based on the alignment of clinic and SNAP-Ed priorities and efforts to prevent chronic diet-related disease.This study assessed the readiness of clinics in South Carolina to implement evidenced-based nutrition support strategies in partnership with the SNAP-Ed program.Clinics across the state were sent an interest flyer to participate in a readiness assessment, resulting in a positive response from 15 clinics. An interview guide was created based on the readiness framework: R (readiness) = M (motivation) C2 (general and innovation-specific capacities) that explored overall clinic readiness to partner with the SNAP-Ed program and the readiness to implement 12 nutrition support strategies conductive to a clinic setting.Interview transcripts were analyzed based on the R = MC2 framework to identify the readiness of health clinics to partner with the SNAP-Ed program on nutrition support implementation, in general, and to implement the 12 nutrition support strategies, specifically. Capacity-building needs were also captured.All clinics demonstrated a high level of motivation and capacity to partner with the SNAP-Ed program (e.g., strong staff and leadership buy-in; mission and values alignment). Clinics were most interested in screening patients for food insecurity and referring them to resources for nutrition (n = 14) and providing produce prescriptions (n = 14). The main capacity-building needs identified included finding community partners for referrals and funding for providing coupons with produce prescriptions.Health clinics could serve as an untapped setting for SNAP-Ed programming nationally to reach medically disadvantaged populations. Implementers should work to identify ready clinics and help them build capacity for nutrition support implementation.USDA.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood security 3afunding 3aleadership 3amotivation 3anutrition 3apatients 3ascreening 3aSouth Carolina1 aDreyer, Erin0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2019 July,  Aug., v. 51, no. 7 p.S117-S118dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.05.5653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01606naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245015300160300001600313520050000329592002800829650001100857650002100868650001100889650001100900653002200911653002400933653002100957653002500978700001401003700001501017773015001032856007701182852000901259655001201268IND60521565720221121234459.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052156572DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1978-09052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, A.,10aMolekül-und Elektronenstruktur des Thioheteroanions [S2 WS2CoS2WS2]2- / Molecular and Electronic Structure of the Thiohetero Anion [S2WS2CoS2WS2]2-  ap. 978-982.  aThe crystal and molecular structure of [(C₆H₅)₄P]₂[Co(WS₄)₂] was determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction data (space group P2₁/c with a = 18.542(4), b = 15.443(2), c= 18.713(2) Å, β= 108.73(1)°, Z = 4).

In the first period, bulldozers were used to create windrows for mechanized reforestation of immission-declined stands, causing profound devastation of forest sites, because removed surface humus was the only source of nutrients and environment for tree species roots. Preparatory stands have been established, and have to undergo re-construction in the coming years. Nowadays, the windrows are spread by the bulldozers again, covering 1/3 f the whole area between windrows by the rest of holorganic matter. This substratum is impoverished by the extensive mineralization and connected nutrient (especially N) losses, representing differently suitable space for tree rooting. Presented paper documents the effects of fertilization by different types of the SILVAMIX fertilizer on the growth and prosperity of new spruce plantations. Effects of fertilization are visible very soon and they are significantly beneficial for the new forest plantations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3afertilizers 3aforests 3ahumus 3amechanization 3amineralization 3areforestation 3atrees1 aPodrázský, V.V.1 aUlbrichová, I.1 aMeduna, V.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 51, no.

Thus, to understand the molecular mechanism behind inhibition of aflatoxin biosynthesis by quercetin, interaction study with polyketide synthase A (PksA) of Aspergillus flavus was undertaken. The 3D structure of seven domains of PksA was modeled using SWISS-MODEL server and docking studies were performed by Autodock tools-1.5.6. Docking energies of both the ligands (quercetin and hexanoic acid) were compared with each of the domains of PksA enzyme. Binding energy for quercetin was lesser that ranged from − 7.1 to − 5.25 kcal/mol in comparison to hexanoic acid (− 4.74 to − 3.54 kcal/mol). LigPlot analysis showed the formation of 12 H bonds in case of quercetin and 8 H bonds in hexanoic acid. During an interaction with acyltransferase domain, both ligands showed H bond formation at Arg63 position. Also, in product template domain, quercetin creates four H bonds in comparison to one in hexanoic acid. Our quantitative RT-PCR analysis of genes from aflatoxin biosynthesis showed downregulation of pksA, aflD, aflR, aflP and aflS at 24 h time point in comparison to 7 h in quercetin-treated A. flavus. Overall results revealed that quercetin exhibited the highest level of binding potential (more number of H bonds) with PksA domain in comparison to hexanoic acid; thus, quercetin possibly inhibits via competitively binding to the domains of polyketide synthase, a key enzyme of aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway. Further, we propose that key enzymes from aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway in aflatoxin-producing Aspergilli could be explored further using other phytochemicals as inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus flavus 3aaflatoxins 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3aenergy 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahexanoic acid 3aligands 3apolyketide synthases 3aquercetin 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atransferases1 aShishodia, Sonia K.1 aShankar, Jata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4993-95800 t3 Biotech.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.149-149dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1675-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008200164300001600246520093600262592002801198650002401226650002601250650002601276650003001302650001401332650002501346650001701371650001901388650003701407653001801444653002601462653002401488653002701512653001701539700001701556700001601573773011301589856008601702852000901788655001201797IND60542844920221120191414.0190408e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054284492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2014.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzen, F.14aThe inhibition of Helicobacter pylori infected cells by Origanum minutiflorum  ap. 329-334.  aThis study aimed to investigate the potential use of Origanum minutiflorum for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori by determining antimicrobial activity, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and chemical composition of its essential oil (EO). Furthermore, cell cytotoxicity and anti-H. pylori action of EO on AGS/H. pylori infected cells were also determined. Essential oil extracts displayed a strong antimicrobial activity against H. pylori. Carvacrol (29.22%), a known antimicrobial agent, was observed as the predominant compound. The MBC (1/20,000 v/v) of EO was nontoxic to AGS cells, revealing a >80% reduction. Moreover, EO at the same concentration displayed the ability to kill H. pylori in/on infected cells.

Numerical results were in good agreements with experimental results on measured temperature at reactor exit and a damaged appearance of the inner reaction tube after the practical decomposition process. A sufficiently large area and high temperature over 1500 K for HFC-23 decomposition was predicted in the torch operation with an arc current of 50 A. In this condition, a high decomposition rate over 99.5%was achieved in spite of a short residence time estimated around 50 ms.

In this study, we examined the effect of the Japanese smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis) invasion on the fish assemblage in Lake Erhai, a subtropical plateau lake in southwestern China. Through cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), we found a significant fish assemblage shift: the population of sharpbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus) fell by 67% in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 2.262 to 0.741; topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva) fell by 52% from 0.61 to 0.29; and icefish (Neosalanx taihuensis) plummeted by 88% from 0.736 to 0.088. Meanwhile, the numbers for crucian carp (Carassius auratus) improved by almost 185% from 1.82 to 3.36. A Pearson correlation analysis showed that these four species significantly correlated with the invasion of the Japanese smelt: sharpbelly (−0.71), topmouth gudgeon (−0.71), icefish (−0.62), and crucian carp (0.81). This study documented the expansion of invasive fish and their effects on native species over time, thus providing a case study of invasive fish as well as a theoretical basis for further research into interspecies interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius auratus 3aHemiculter leucisculus 3aHypomesus nipponensis 3aNeosalanx taihuensis 3aPseudorasbora parva 3acase studies 3acluster analysis 3afish 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3awater 3aChina1 aChen, Yushun 1 aGuo, Longgen 1 aNi, Leyi 0 tWater.g2021 June 29, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131318003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01201naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002600143245015600169300001600325520016800341592002800509650002300537650002300560650002300583653004100606653004000647773015000687856007700837852000900914655001200923IND60521566020221122002847.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052156602DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1978-09082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreunig, Hans Joachim10aDi-t-butyl(trimethylstannyl)stibin und Tetrakis(trimethylstannyl)distiban / Di-t-butyl(trimethylstannyl)stibine and Tetrakis(trimethylstannyl)distibane  ap. 990-992.  aBy reaction of t-butyliodide with tris(trimethylstannyl)stibine di-t-butyl (trimethy 1 - stannyl)stibine as well as tetrakis(trimethylstannyl)distibane are formed.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 0aDi-t-butyl(trimethylstannyl )stibine 0aTetrakis(trimethylstannyl)distibane0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 33, no. 9 p.990-992dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1978-09083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014000165300001400305520124700319592002801566650002101594650001501615650000901630650001501639650001601654650002001670650001901690650000701709650003401716650002701750650001801777653000901795653000901804653001601813653001401829653002701843700001701870700001601887700001401903700001901917700001701936700001901953773012301972856008202095852000902177655001202186IND60599318020221120140937.0180702e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059931802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Yueping10aRemoval of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) from water by coagulation: Mechanisms and influencing factors  ap. 59-64.  aIn this study, alum (Al2(SO4)3⋅18H2O), ferric chloride (FeCl3⋅6H2O) and polyaluminium chloride (PACl) were used to remove perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) from water. The influencing factors, including pH and natural organic matter (NOM), were investigated. A positive correlation was found between the size of the flocs and the removal efficiency of PFOX (X=S and A). The removal ratios of PFOS and PFOA were 32% and ∼12%, respectively, when 50mg/L of FeCl3⋅6H2O was added as the coagulant at the initial pH. Coagulation achieved high removal ratios for PFOX under acidic conditions (∼47.6% and 94.7% for PFOA and PFOS at pH 4, respectively). In addition, increasing NOM concentrations decreased the removal rates of PFOX because of the existence of competitive adsorption between NOM molecules and PFOX on the surface of the coagulants and flocs. The combination of adsorption by powdered activated carbon (PAC) and coagulation increased the removal ratios up to >90% for PFOX at the initial concentration of 1mg/L, implying that the adsorption enhanced coagulation. Meantime, the experiments with natural water showed that coagulation is a feasible method to remove PFOS and PFOA from surface water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aalum 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3aferric chloride 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asurface water 0aPFOS 0aPFOA 0aCoagulation 0aMechanism 0aNatural organic matter1 aNiu, Junfeng1 aXu, Zesheng1 aGao, Ding1 aShi, Jianghong1 aSun, Xiaomin1 aHuang, Qingguo0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 434 p.59-64dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245018400175300001600359520099900375592002801374650004101402650002301443650001501466650002101481650001801502650003201520650001301552650001601565700002301581773013001604856008201734852000901816655001201825IND60592065820221117081733.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059206582DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348180300852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalseiro-Romero, María10aDiesel-Range Organics Extraction and Determination in Environmental Samples by Gas Chromatography‒Mass Spectrometry: Headspace Solid Phase Microextraction vs. Solvent Extraction  ap. 292-301.  aAn accurate and sensitive analytical method for the determination of diesel-range organics (DRO) is the basis to monitoring and soil remediation studies. In the present work, the determination of DRO in different water and soil samples was optimized. Solvent extraction procedures, i.e. ultrasonic assisted extraction (USAE) (for water samples) and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) (for soil samples), and a solvent-free procedure, headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME), were optimized to achieve the highest recoveries for the simultaneous determination of all DRO. One hour of USAE for water samples and ASE of soil samples at 100°C, 2000 psi and two extraction cycles lead to analytical recoveries of 70‒100%. Using HS-SPME, 30 min of incubation at 90°C were sufficient to achieve analytical recoveries up to 90% for water and soil samples. HS-SPME enables higher preconcentration factors, which makes this method more appropriate for samples with trace DRO concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3amonitoring 3asoil remediation 3asoil sampling 3asolid phase microextraction 3asolvents 3aultrasonics1 aMonterroso, Carmen0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2018 Mar., v. 73, no. 3 p.292-301dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000418x1061-93487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10619348180300853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001300188245014200201300001200343506007600355520143500431592002801866506003701894650001801931650002501949650002001974650001301994650001002007650001502017650001802032650001102050650001402061650002202075650002402097650001402121650002902135650001402164650002202178700001702200700001802217700001702235700001502252773011602267856008202383852000902465655001202474IND60634927120221207092253.0190416e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063492712DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-019-1669-92doi7 aPMC64340022pmcid7 a309447992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Gang10aTranscriptome-wide analysis of the difference of alternative splicing in susceptible and resistant silkworm strains after BmNPV infection  ap. 152.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNovel alternative splicing events were identified from BmNPV-susceptible and -resistant silkworm strains after BmNPV infection using high-throughput RNA-sequencing strategy. In total, 12.82 Gb clean RNA-seq data were generated for the two midgut samples from BmNPV-susceptible and -resistant silkworm strains, and 14.78 Gb clean data for the two fat body samples. The number of alternative splicing events and isoforms in the BmNPV-susceptible silkworm strain was more than that in the BmNPV-resistant silkworm strain. Furthermore, alternative splicing genes uniquely present in BmNPV-resistant silkworm strain were involved in functions about ribosome, whereas, alternative splicing genes uniquely present in BmNPV-susceptible silkworm strain were implicated in functions like DNA helicase activity and signal transduction. Additionally, 33 expressed SR or SR-like proteins were identified, and three genes encoding SR or SR-like proteins (tetratricopeptide repeat protein 14 homolog, ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 32 and zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 18) have a higher number of different alternative splicing events between two silkworm strains. The present study suggested BmNPV treatment may have a smaller effect on the mRNA transcription in BmNPV-resistant silkworms than that in BmNPV-susceptible silkworms, and functions of alternative splicing genes are different between the two silkworm strains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA helicases 3aalternative splicing 3aenzyme activity 3afat body 3agenes 3ahydrolases 3amessenger RNA 3amidgut 3aribosomes 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3asilkworms 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitin 3azinc finger motif1 aZhou, Kaiyue1 aZhao, Guodong1 aQian, Heying1 aXu, Anying0 t3 Biotech.g2019 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.152-152dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-019-1669-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01563naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245023000161300001700391520049700408592002800905650001400933650001200947650001800959650001400977650001800991650001201009650001601021773013801037856007701175852000901252655001201261IND60521566220221122025858.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052156622DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1978-09102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHitzel, Erich10aAbbau von Induktionsperioden und Steigerung der Aktivität homogener Hydrierungskatalysatoren mit Iridium als Zentralatom / Reduction of Induction Periods and Increase of Activity of Homogenous Iridium Hydrogenation Catalysts  ap. 997-1000.  aWith complexes of iridium as catalysts, induction periods are typical for homogeneous hydrogenation of olefins in bulk.

The adhesion forces were measured by using a micro-scratch tester and an adhesion improvement mechanism is suggested in terms of thin film microstructure and polymer surface modification. The adhesion force of thin copper film on the polymer substrate is greatly enhanced by variation of deposition conditions such as argon pressure, DC power voltage oxygen plasma pretreatment and annealing treatment. As the sputter dc voltage increased from 500 V to 640 V, the critical adhesion force of the molybdenum on the polyimide film increased from 420 mN to 900 mN. As the argon pressure increased from 5 mTorr to 30 mTorr, the adhesion force slightly decreased from 860 mN to 660 mN. The post-annealing process after the film deposition also yielded an enhanced adhesion force.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aannealing 3aargon (noble gases) 3acopper 3amicrostructure 3amolybdenum 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3athermal stability1 aPark, In-Sun1 aSeo, Bo-Hyeon,1 aSeo, Jong Hyun1 aChoe, Heehwan1 aJeon, Jae-Hong1 aLee, Yong Uk1 aHong, Munpyo0 tCurrent applied physics.g2011 Sept., v. 11, no. 5S p.S12-S15dElsevier B.V.x1567-17397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cap.2011.06.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010300174300001400277500001500291520102200306592002801328650001901356650001801375650001101393650001501404650002001419650002201439650002701461650001901488650001201507650002001519650001801539650001701557650003101574650002801605653001801633773009501651856008401746852000901830655001201839IND60553613920221120072938.0161021e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055361392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.copbio.2013.08.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShikanai, Toshiharu10aCentral role of cyclic electron transport around photosystem I in the regulation of photosynthesis  ap. 25-30.  a2019-12-06  aCyclic electron transport around photosystem I generates ATP without the accumulation of NADPH in chloroplasts. In angiosperms, electron transport consists of a PGR5–PGRL1 protein-dependent pathway and a chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex-dependent pathway. Most likely, the PGR5–PGRL1 pathway corresponds to the cyclic phosphorylation discovered by Arnon and contributes mainly to ΔpH formation in photosynthesis. ATP synthesis utilizes this ΔpH formed by both linear and PSI cyclic electron transport. Furthermore, acidification of the thylakoid lumen downregulates light energy utilization in photosystem II and also electron transport through the cytochrome b6f complex. In the absence of PGR5, chloroplast NDH compensates for the reduced ΔpH formation to some extent. Additionally, proton conductivity is upregulated, probably through ATPase, in pgr5 mutants.

In order to provide a cost-effective weed management strategy that does not promote glyphosate-resistant weed biotypes, differences between resistant and susceptible biotypes have to be identified accurately in the field conditions. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted thermal and multispectral remote sensing has potential for detecting biophysical characteristics of weed biotypes during the growing season, which includes distinguishing glyphosate-susceptible and glyphosate-resistant weed populations based on canopy temperature and deep learning driven weed identification algorithms. The objective of this study was to identify herbicide resistance after glyphosate application in true field conditions by analyzing the UAV-acquired thermal and multispectral response of kochia, waterhemp, redroot pigweed, and common ragweed. The data were processed in ArcGIS for raster classification as well as spectral comparison of glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible weeds. The classification accuracy between the sensors and classification methods of maximum likelihood, random trees, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared. The random trees classifier performed the best at 4 days after application (DAA) for kochia with 62.9% accuracy. The maximum likelihood classifier provided the highest performing result out of all classification methods with an accuracy of 75.2%. A commendable classification was made at 8 DAA where the random trees classifier attained an accuracy of 87.2%. However, thermal reflectance measurements as a predictor for glyphosate resistance within weed populations in field condition was unreliable due to its susceptibility to environmental conditions. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a composite reflectance of 842 nm, 705 nm, and 740 nm wavelength managed to provide better classification results than thermal in most cases.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3acanopy 3acost effectiveness 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3amechanism of action 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3astatistical analysis 3asupport vector machines 3atemperature 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awavelengths 3aweed control 3aweeds1 aKoparan, Cengiz 1 aZhang, Yu 1 aOstlie, Michael 1 aHowatt, Kirk 1 aSun, Xin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 16, v. 13, no. 22dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132246063Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014600155300001400301520093500315592002801250650001601278650001301294650001201307650001501319651002201334651001901356651001101375651001301386700001701399700002001416700001701436773012701453856007501580852000901655655001201664IND60764731120221119041439.0220422e20190517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076473112DNAL7 a10.17221/11853-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacala, M.10aEffect of site altitude on the growth and survival of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) provenances on the Slovak plots of IUFRO experiment 1972  ap. 16-26.  aThe growth, survival, damage and provenance × environment interactions of 30 provenances of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) from Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, were analyzed at the age of 26 years.

Correlation of growth and survival appeared to be insignificant at individual plots and their series. The highest differentiation among provenances was revealed on the plots at the minimum and maximum altitudes (350 and 950 m). Several Slovak (Western-Carpathian) provenances proved to grow significantly better than the average at nearly all plots, and also exhibited insignificant provenance × site interaction. Indigenous provenances from the southern part of the Western Carpathians showed higher adaptability to sites in lower altitudes with longer vegetation but seasonal water deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3aaltitude 3aforests 3aprovenance 3aCarpathian region 3aCzech Republic 3aPoland 3aSlovakia1 aLongauer, R.1 aKrajmerová, D.1 aGömöry, D.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 48, no. 1 p.16-26dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/11853-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245014600158300001600304500001900320500002000339520167600359592002802035596003802063650001802101650002202119650001102141650001802152650001202170650001802182650002502200650002702225650001502252650001402267650002502281650001802306650002802324650001302352700002102365700001602386700002302402773013402425856007202559852000902631655001202640IND60725498520221122090237.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072549852DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.49192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Carolyn10aAlterations in Hemolymph Ion Concentrations and pH in Adult Daphnia magna in Response to Elevations in Major Ion Concentrations in Freshwater  ap. 366-379.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncreases in the concentrations of major ions (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Cl⁻) in freshwater are a growing concern for ecosystem health. These increases may originate from anthropogenic activities such as road deicing, fracking spills, mining, and fertilizer application and have detrimental effects on freshwater organisms through disturbances in ionoregulation and acid–base balance. The cladoceran Daphnia magna is adapted for active ion uptake and reduction of ion loss to maintain osmotic balance, but alterations in ionic composition of the environmental water are associated with toxicity. In the present study, hemolymph ion concentrations were measured using ion‐selective microelectrode techniques. Increases in the hemolymph concentrations of Na⁺ and K⁺ correspond to elevations in the concentrations of these ions in ambient water. Water concentrations associated with sustained increases in hemolymph ion concentrations correlate well with median lethal concentration values from previous toxicology studies, indicating that Na⁺ and K⁺ concentrations in hemolymph may predict toxicity. When water K⁺ concentration is increased, a simultaneous increase in water Na⁺ concentration mitigates the increase in hemolymph K⁺ concentration, a finding which is consistent with the reported mitigation of K⁺ toxicity by Na⁺. When ambient concentrations of K⁺, Na⁺, and Cl⁻ are increased, not only is there a rise in hemolymph ion concentration but hemolymph pH is altered and pH regulation appears to be prioritized over regulation of hemolymph Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻ in D. magna.

This study aimed to evaluate Giardia duodenalis and other intestinal parasitic infections in different pediatric groups, with an emphasis on the comparison of Giardia diagnostic techniques. Feces from 824 children from different groups (diarrheic, malnourished, with cancer and from day care) were examined by microscopy and ELISA for Giardia, Cryptosporidium sp. and Entamoeba histolytica coproantigen detection. Giardia-positive samples from day-care children, identified by either microscopy or ELISA, were further tested by PCR targeting of the β-giardin and Gdh genes. Statistically significant differences (P<0.05) were observed when comparing the frequency of each protozoan among the groups. Giardia duodenalis was more frequent in day-care children and Cryptosporidium sp. in diarrheic and malnourished groups; infections by Entamoeba histolytica were found only in children with diarrhea. Considering positivity for Giardia by at least one method, ELISA was found to be more sensitive than microscopy (97% versus 55%). To examine discrepancies among the diagnostic methods, 71 Giardia-positive stool samples from day-care children were tested by PCR; of these, DNA was amplified from 51 samples (77.4%). Concordance of positivity between microscopy and ELISA was found for 48 samples, with 43 confirmed by PCR. Parasite DNA was amplified from eleven of the 20 Giardia samples (55%) identified only by ELISA. This study shows the higher sensitivity of ELISA over microscopy for Giardia diagnosis when a single sample is analyzed and emphasizes the need for methods based on coproantigen detection to identify this parasite in diarrheic fecal samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium 3aDNA 3aEntamoeba histolytica 3aGiardia lamblia 3achildren 3acoproantigens 3adiagnostic techniques 3adiarrhea 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3agenes 3agiardin protein 3alaboratory experimentation 3amalnutrition 3amicroscopy 3aneoplasms 3aparasites 3aparasitoses 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aGiardia duodenalis 0aChildren 0aDiagnosis 0aELISA 0aMicroscopy 0aPCR1 aPacheco, Flávia T.F.1 aMartins, Adson S.1 aMenezes, Joelma F.1 aCosta-Ribeiro, Hugo1 aRibeiro, Tereza C.M.1 aMattos, Ângela P.1 aOliveira, Ricardo R.1 aSoares, Neci M.1 aTeixeira, Márcia C.A.0 tParasitology international.g2016 Dec., v. 65, no. 6 p.635-640dElsevier Ireland LtdwJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2016.08.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010000166300001800266520100800284592002801292653002001320653001701340653002001357653001601377653002001393653001701413700002501430700002201455700002601477700002201503773016901525856008201694852000901776655001201785IND60517072720221120062230.0190728e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707272DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140009762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrusina, Ivana10aOn the reproduction of the Mediterranean keystone limpet Patella rustica: histological overview  ap. 1651-1660.  aThe reproductive cycle of the high shore limpet Patella rustica is described based on histological analysis as the primary method of staging gonad development. Sex-ratios, shell length at sexual maturity, gonad developmental stages, mean gonad index and oocyte size were investigated. Males and females were found to differ in size distribution, with females becoming more prevalent from ~28 mm onwards. The estimated shell length at which 50% of males were sexually mature was 13.1 mm. Patella rustica has only one reproductive cycle per year with a spawning peak between November and December for both sexes, and gonad redevelopment from January. First data on the size–frequency analysis of oocytes for this species are also presented, concurring with the qualitative analysis of the gonad developmental stages. This study presents updated information on the reproductive cycle of this keystone species and provides the first account of the reproductive biology of P. rustica in the Adriatic Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPatella rustica 0areproduction 0agonad histology 0aoocyte size 0asexual maturity 0aAdriatic Sea1 aEzgeta-Balić, Daria1 aLjubimir, Stijepo1 aDobroslavić, Tatjana1 aGlamuzina, Branko0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 Dec., v. 94, no. 8 p.1651-1660dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140009763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245014100171300001600312520128600328592002801614650002401642650001801666650001601684650001001700650001001710650002401720650002101744650001401765650001101779650001501790650002001805653002401825653001001849653002101859653001301880653001601893653003701909700002101946700002301967700002601990700001602016700002302032700001802055700001802073700001602091773011402107856008502221852000902306655001202315IND60557533120221121025749.0180904e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055753312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2016.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamabe, Masafumi10aNovel synthetic compounds with endoperoxide structure damage juvenile stage of Schistosoma mansoni by targeting lysosome-like organelles  ap. 917-924.  aThe new synthetic compound 1,2,6,7-tetraoxaspiro[7.11]nonadecan (N-89), a novel anti-malaria drug candidate, is also a promising drug candidate against schistosomiasis with killing effects against juvenile stage of S. mansoni. In order to investigate how N-89 kills schistosomes, we used a derivative of N-89, 6-(1,2,6,7-tetraoxaspiro[7.11] nonadec-4-yl)hexan-1-ol (N-251), which enables us to conjugate with fluorescent reagents. Firstly, N-251 showed strong killing effects to larvae of S. mansoni in vitro. Ultrastructural analysis showed the disruptions of the lysosome-like organelles or the acetabular glands, followed by cytoplasmic lysis inside the worm body in N-251-treated group under electron microscopy. For rhodamine-conjugated N-251 and organelle markers, we observed that N-251 accumulated in acidic organelle. In addition, LysoTracker signals in these acidic organelles disappeared in N-251-treated group over time. Finally, we observed that the activity of cathepsin B, a lysosome-specific enzyme, was also decreased together with alternation of acidic organelle marker signal by N-251-treated group. These results suggested that our synthesized compounds induced the dysfunction or the disruption of acidic lysosome-like organelles and finally led to worm death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aantimalarials 3acathepsin B 3adeath 3adrugs 3aelectron microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3aorganelles 3aschistosomiasis 0aSchistosoma mansoni 0aN-251 0aAcidic organelle 0aLysosome 0aCathepsin B 0aTransmission electron microscopy1 aKumagai, Takashi1 aShimogawara, Rieko1 aBlay, Emmanuel Awusah1 aHino, Akina1 aIchimura, Koichiro1 aSatō, Akira,1 aKim, Hye-suk,1 aOhta, Nobuo0 tParasitology international.g2017 Feb., v. 66, no. 1 p.917-924dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2016.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245010500204300001800309500001100327520180500338592002802143650002002171650002402191650001502215650001302230650001002243650001602253650001702269650002202286650001402308650002602322650001602348650001702364650001702381773012402398856008302522852000902605655001202614IND60782380320221121165053.0220822e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078238032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07230-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiram, Roddy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4291-831410aResolution-promoting autacoids demonstrate promising cardioprotective effects against heart diseases  ap. 5179-5197.  aReview  aChronic heart diseases have in common an unresolved inflammatory status. In atherosclerosis, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, or atrial fibrillation, mounting evidence suggests that unresolved inflammation contributes to the chronicity, aggravation, and morbidity of the disease. Following cardiac injury or infection, acute inflammation is a normal and required process to repair damaged tissues or eliminate pathogens and promote restoration of normal functions and structures. However, if acute inflammation is not followed by resolution, a chronic and deleterious inflammatory status may occur, characterized by the persistence of inflammatory biomarkers, promoting aggravation of myocardial pathogenesis, abnormal structural remodeling, development of cardiac fibrosis, and loss of function. Although traditional antiinflammatory strategies, including the use of COX-inhibitors, to inhibit the production of inflammation promotors failed to promote homeostasis, mounting evidence suggests that activation of specific endogenous autacoids may promote resolution and perpetuate cardioprotective effects. The recent discovery of the active mechanism of resolution suggests that proresolving signals and cellular processes may help to terminate inflammation and combat the development of its chronic profile in cardiac diseases. This review discussed (I) the preclinical and clinical evidence of inflammation-resolution in cardiac disorders including atrial fibrillation; (II) how and why many traditional antiinflammatory treatments failed to prevent or cure cardiac inflammation and fibrosis; and (III) whether new therapeutic strategies may interact with the resolution machinery to have cardioprotective effects.

We investigated these dynamic relationships over three months by analyzing plant functional traits (PFT), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization, potential N mineralization (PNM), potential nitrification (PNA) and denitrification activities (PDA) in Dactylis glomerata cultures. D. glomerata recruited AMF during early growth, and thereafter maintained a constant root colonization intensity. This may have permitted high enough plant nutrient acquisition over the three months as to offset reduced soil inorganic N. PFT changed with plant age and declining soil fertility, resulting in higher allocation to root biomass and higher root C:N ratio. Additional to root AMF presence, PFT changes may have favored denitrification over mineralization through changes in soil properties, particularly increasing the quality of the labile carbon soil fraction. Other PFT changes, such as N uptake, modified the plants’ ability to compete with bacterial groups involved in N cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adenitrification 3alabile carbon 3amicrobial activity 3amineralization 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aplant age 3aplant growth 3asoil fertility 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asoil separates 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aPotential N mineralization 0aDenitrification enzymatic activity 0aNitrification enzymatic activity 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aPlant functional traits 0aPlant-microbe interactions1 aClément, J.C.1 aGrassein, F.1 aLavorel, S.1 aLemauviel-Lavenant, S.1 aPersoneni, E.1 aPoly, F.1 aPommier, T.1 aRobson, T.M.1 aMouhamadou, B.1 aBinet, M.N.0 tFungal ecology.g2020 Apr., v. 44 p.100910-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000080x1754-50487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2019.1009103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011900162300001800281520100300299592002801302650001801330650001101348650002301359650002001382650001001402650004201412650001801454650001301472650001901485650002201504650005201526650002001578700001601598700001801614700001901632700001601651700001901667700001601686700001801702773012401720856008201844852000901926655001201935IND60080281520221122111558.0181029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3399-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xin-Yi10aApple ring rot-responsive putative microRNAs revealed by high-throughput sequencing in Malus × domestica Borkh.  ap. 5273-5286.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which silence target mRNA via cleavage or translational inhibition to function in regulating gene expression. MiRNAs act as important regulators of plant development and stress response. For understanding the role of miRNAs responsive to apple ring rot stress, we identified disease-responsive miRNAs using high-throughput sequencing in Malus × domestica Borkh.. Four small RNA libraries were constructed from two control strains in M. domestica, crabapple (CKHu) and Fuji Naga-fu No. 6 (CKFu), and two disease stress strains, crabapple (DSHu) and Fuji Naga-fu No. 6 (DSFu). A total of 59 miRNA families were identified and five miRNAs might be responsive to apple ring rot infection and validated via qRT-PCR. Furthermore, we predicted 76 target genes which were regulated by conserved miRNAs potentially. Our study demonstrated that miRNAs was responsive to apple ring rot infection and may have important implications on apple disease resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA libraries 3aapples 3adisease resistance 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amessenger RNA 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aplant development 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astress response1 aDu, Bei-Bei1 aGao, Zhi-Hong1 aZhang, Shi-Jie1 aTu, Xu-Tong1 aChen, Xiao-Yun1 aZhang, Zhen1 aQu, Shen-Chun0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.5273-5286dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3399-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245009500168500001900263520080300282592002801085650001901113650001901132650001701151650001201168650001101180650001601191650002301207653002401230653002201254653001301276653002301289653002801312700001501340700001601355773009001371856008501461852000901546655001201555IND60704803520221117230414.0200824e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070480352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1184172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Xianzhong10aEffects of carbon dioxide on the upper flammability limits of methane in O2/CO2 atmosphere  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, the effects of carbon dioxide on the upper flammability limits of oxy-methane were investigated. Firstly, the upper flammability limits of oxy-methane were measured under normal pressure and temperature. Then, the chemical effect of CO₂ on the upper flammability was studied using the kinetic simulation. Finally, the thermal and radiative effects of CO₂ on the upper flammability limits were discussed using energy balance analysis. The experimental upper flammability limits of CH₄/O₂/CO₂ are from 9.5% to 33.25% in the condition of increasing oxygen concentrations from 15% to 50%. The analysis shows that the upper flammability limits of methane are mainly determined by the thermal property of CO₂ and not significantly changed by the chemical and radiative effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy balance 3aflammability 3amethane 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3athermal properties 0aFlammability limits 0aO2/CO2 combustion 0aOxy-fuel 0aKinetic simulation 0aStability of combustion1 aYu, Qingbo1 aSun, Yasong0 tEnergy.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 208 p.118417-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1184173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007200165300001600237520106300253592002801316650004401344650002201388650003701410650001301447650001401460650001301474650001701487650001901504650000901523650001301532650001901545650002101564650003701585650002601622700001701648700001801665700001401683773011901697856008201816852000901898655001201907IND60681780320221119222615.0200201e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068178032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-012-6799-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shi-Jie10aCoating graphene oxide sheets with luminescent rare-earth complexes  ap. 805-811.  aRare-earth (RE) complexes can be easily adsorbed on the surface of graphene oxide sheets (GOSs) by a simple noncovalent approach. The resulting nanocomposite materials, RE complexes functionalized GOSs, have been comprehensively characterized via transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, FT-IR spectra, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. The luminescence properties of GOSs-RE were also investigated. Under the excitation of UV light, these samples display the characteristic emissions of Eu³⁺ ions. The photophysical investigations revealed that the presence of GOSs do not quench the lanthanide-centered luminescence stemming from the characteristic electronic transitions within the 4f shell of the Eu³⁺ ions. The GOSs–RE complex hybrids and their dispersion can emit bright red luminescence. Moreover, the presence of GOSs can elongate the fluorescence lifetime of the RE complexes to 983 μs. These properties make them useful in many practical fields, such as in the lighting and biological labeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acoatings 3aemissions 3aeuropium 3afluorescence 3agraphene oxide 3aions 3alighting 3ananocomposites 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet radiation1 aHu, Jiang-Bo1 aWang, Yin-Yin1 aLuo, Fang0 tJournal of materials science.g2013 Jan., v. 48, no. 2 p.805-811dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-012-6799-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02552naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015400165520104600319592002801365650001501393650002101408650002001429650002701449650001001476650001801486650001801504650001901522650001601541650002001557650001901577650001001596650002101606650001201627650001501639653001401654653002801668653002801696653004001724653003701764700002101801700005701822773011201879856008201991852000902073655001202082IND60680497320221121230741.0200210e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068049732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2020.1037782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAribas, Merve10aIn vitro glycemic index, bile acid binding capacity and mineral bioavailability of spaghetti supplemented with resistant starch type 4 and wheat bran  aIn this study effects of resistant starch type 4 (RS4) on nutritional and quality properties of spaghetti were investigated.

RS4 supplementation caused lower negative effects on quality properties (total organic matter value, color and textural properties) than bran supplementation. The results point out that RS4 supplementation of spaghetti caused higher total dietary fiber content and comparable glycemic index value at the same bran supplementation level. RS4 caused an increase in bile acid binding capacity and expected to have positive effects on cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, RS4 supplemented spaghetti had generally better mineral bioavailability values compared to bran supplemented and control spaghettis. Overall results indicated that RS4 supplementation provided improvement in nutritional properties of spaghetti and can be an alternative ingredient for fiber supplemented spaghetti compared to bran.  aPublisher supplied data 3abile acids 3abinding capacity 3abioavailability 3acholesterol metabolism 3acolor 3adietary fiber 3afiber content 3aglycemic index 3aingredients 3anutritive value 3aorganic matter 3apasta 3aresistant starch 3atexture 3awheat bran 0aSpaghetti 0aResistant starch type 4 0aIn vitro glycemic index 0aIn vitro bile acid binding capacity 0aIn vitro mineral bioavailability1 aKahraman, Kevser1 aKoksel, Hamit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2786-39440 tJournal of functional foods.g2020 Feb., v. 65 p.103778-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2020.1037783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03380naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245011300211300001800324520194700342592002802289596003202317650001702349650002202366650003102388650001602419650002202435650002302457650002202480650001302502650002202515650001502537650001702552650001902569650001902588650001002607700006002617700006502677773012402742856008302866852000902949655001202958IND60782380620221121211117.0220822e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078238062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-022-07118-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÜnüvar, Ömer Can1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8711-616910aBacteria isolated from Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum roots can improve wheat hologenome in agriculture  ap. 5389-5395.  aBACKGROUND: Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum is an ancestral wheat species originated from Karacadağ Mountain of Turkey more than ten thousand years ago. Because of environmental and anthropogenic effects, food supply and demand are not balanced. Agricultural activities such as breeding, and fertilization are important to sustain the balance. Conventional breeding and fertilization applications usually neglect contribution of plant related hologenomes in agricultural yield. The disruption of plant growth promoting microorganisms results in intensive usage of chemical fertilizers. The harmony between plant and plant-associated microorganisms is important for sustainability. In this study, isolation, biochemical characterization, and impact on plant growth parameters of natural bacteria associated with Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum hologenome were aimed. METHODS AND RESULTS: The collection of root samples and isolations of the root-associated bacterial species were carried out from local wheat lands. According to interpretation of three identification methods (MALDI-TOF, 16S rDNA, 16S-23S rDNA) eight isolates are Arthrobacter spp. ESU164, Arthrobacter spp. ESU193, Pseudomonas spp. ESU131, Pseudomonas spp. ESU141, Pseudomonas poae strain ESU182, Pseudomonas thivervalensis strain ESU192, Pseudomonas spp. ESU1531, Bacillus subtilis strain ESU181. For each isolate we investigated biochemical properties especially nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and indole-3-acetic acid production abilities. The results show that all isolates are nitrogen fixers and the best phosphate solubilizer have been reported as Pseudomonas spp. ESU131 with 2.805 ± 0.439. CONCLUSIONS: All isolates are indole-3-acetic acid productors. 2 isolates affected the coleoptile lengths, 7 bacterial isolates showed statistically positive effect on root number, and 5 isolates promote the root lengths and the root fresh weights.  aPublisher supplied data  a2180200cTÜBİTAK (TEYDEB) 3aArthrobacter 3aBacillus subtilis 3aPseudomonas thivervalensis 3acoleoptiles 3afood availability 3aindole acetic acid 3amolecular biology 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3asolubilization 3asupply balance 3awheat1 aZencirci, Nusret1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3460-75751 aÜnlü, Ercan Selçuk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0097-11250 tMolecular biology reports.g2022 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.5389-5395dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-022-07118-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245013200165300001600297500001900313500002000332520171300352592002802065596007102093596007802164650001202242650001602254650002102270650001402291650001802305650002302323650000902346650001702355650001102372650001602383650002502399650000902424650002002433650001802453650002502471651001202496700001802508700002102526700002102547700001702568773013402585856007202719852000902791655001202800IND60725499020221122150440.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072549902DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.49292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiriac, Florentina L.10aOccurrence and Fate of Bisphenol A and its Congeners in Two Wastewater Treatment Plants and Receiving Surface Waters in Romania  ap. 435-446.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study investigated the distribution and environmental fate of Bisphenol A (BPA), the 4‐hydroxyacetophenone (4‐HAP) metabolite, and 5 other bisphenol congeners in 2 municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and their receiving rivers in Romania. Accordingly, a new, highly sensitive and accurate solid‐phase extraction–liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated. This technique generated low limit of quantitation values: below 2.3 ng/L for surface water and less than 2.4 and 2.7 ng/L for WWTP effluent and influent water. The sum of detected analytes in wastewater was between 1337 and 16 118 ng/L for influent samples and between 15 and 96 ng/L for effluent samples. In surface water, the total of all compounds was somewhere between 34 and 240 ng/L. The highest concentration observed was for BPA in all 3 types of analyzed water (up to 9140 ng/L for influent, as high as 75 ng/L for effluent, and a maximum of 135 ng/L in surface waters). All analyzed samples were free of bisphenols B, C, and F. For all analytes detected in surface water, the concentration values were higher than those determined in the effluent samples, which may be caused by intrinsic contamination of the 2 rivers (Danube and Jiu Rivers). Values of environmental risk coefficients, calculated for both effluents and surface waters, indicated a low ecological risk or no ecological risk for 3 types of organisms (algae, daphnia, and fish). Human risk assessment calculation suggests no risk to human health as a result of the presence of BPA in either of the 2 rivers.

This type of PVT system features potentially high “net solar-to-electric efficiency” in general, primarily resulting from a key difference in the design of the thermal part compared with conventional PVT systems, i.e. replacing heat engines by a thermochemical power generation module for thermal energy utilization. Key design parameters of the system, including PV cell type, emissivity, solar concentration ratio and solar concentrator type, are individually studied. A system combining all such optimized aspects is projected to achieve net solar-to-electric efficiencies up to 51.5%, after taking all major (e.g. optical, radiative) losses into consideration. This study reveals important insights and enriches understanding on design principles of efficient PVT systems aimed at comprehensive and effective utilization of solar energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat 3amethanol 3apower generation 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aSolar thermal 0aPhotovoltaic 0aThermochemistry 0aMethanol 0aEfficiency1 aHao, Yong0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 206 p.843-850dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.1723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009200170300001600262520093000278592002801208650000801236650001501244650001501259650001001274650001601284650002301300650002001323650003101343650003501374650002201409650001501431650002101446653000801467653001701475653001701492700001801509700001201527700001601539700001801555700001501573700001301588700001601601700001701617773009201634856008501726852000901811655001201820IND60599437520221119182405.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xiaohua10aG-quadruplex DNA biosensor for sensitive visible detection of genetically modified food  ap. 445-449.  aIn this paper, a novel label-free G-quadruplex DNAzyme sensor has been proposed for colorimetric identification of GMO using CaMV 35S promoter sequence as the target. The binary probes can fold into G-quadruplex structure in the presence of DNA-T (Target DNA) and then combine with hemin to form a DNAzyme resembling horseradish peroxidase. The detection system consists of two G-rich probes with 2:2 split mode by using the absorbance and color of ABTS²⁻ as signal reporter. Upon the addition of a target sequence, two probes both hybridize with target and then their G-rich sequences combine to form a G-quadruplex DNAzyme, and the DNAzyme can catalyze the reaction of ABTS²⁻ with H2O2. Then the linear range is from 0.05 to 0.5μM while detection limit is 5nM. These results demonstrate that the proposed G-quadruplex DNAzyme method could be used as a simple, sensitive and cost-effective approach for assays of GMO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorbance 3abiosensors 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3agenetically modified foods 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aperoxidase 3apromoter regions 0aGMO 0aG-quadruplex 0aColorimetric1 aZhang, Huimin1 aWu, Jun1 aYang, Xiang1 aShao, Jingwei1 aLu, Yujing1 aQiu, Bin1 aLin, Zhenyu1 aChen, Guonan0 tTalanta.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 128 p.445-449dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010700168300001600275520106100291592002801352650004401380650002201424650001601446650002201462650003801484650001801522650001401540650003301554650001101587650002301598650002501621650001401646653001101660653001801671653002001689653001401709700001601723700001501739773010801754856008601862852000901948655001201957IND60540780720221123010034.0190318e20140615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054078072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2014.02.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qingjie10aPreparation and characterization of starch nanoparticles through ultrasonic-assisted oxidation methods  ap. 359-364.  aIn this work, starch nanoparticles (SNPs) were prepared from waxy corn starch (WCS) through ultrasonic-assisted oxidation.

However, the retrospective identification of climatic events responsible for the inter‐annual variation of tree growth is challenging, notably because both their duration and their subsequent effects can be highly variable in time. In this study, we aimed to (1) quantify empirically the effect of climatic stress events on the short‐ and long‐term growth dynamics of sugar maple trees; (2) compare the effects of different types of climatic events, that is, drought and thaw–freeze; and (3) compare the effects of climatic stress events to those of traditional monthly level climate metrics. To achieve this, we paired cross‐dated tree‐ring series to monthly and daily‐level climate metrics over more than 50 yr in two distinct regions of southern Quebec. While the analysis from monthly level metrics first suggested a weak and non‐stationary relationship between climatic conditions and tree growth, the analysis from daily‐level metrics showed that climatic stress events, and more particularly thaw–freeze events, were strongly related to the growth of sugar maple trees. Our results suggest that the synergic influence of cumulative climatic stress events, which was exacerbated by insect outbreaks during the early 1980s, induced an important shift in the growth dynamics of sugar maple and in its response to variation in climatic conditions. These results highlight the potential negative impact of global climate change on our capacity to predict stand productivity accurately, especially if climate‐sensitive growth models are based on projections of future monthly metrics. Because adverse climatic events are expected to increase both in frequency and in severity over the next decades, a general decrease in the growth rate of sugar maple is apprehended in southern Quebec.  aPublisher supplied data  cDiscovery Grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)  cFonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies (FRQNT)  cDomtar Corporation 3aAcer saccharum subsp. saccharum 3aacclimation 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aforest dynamics 3agrowth models 3agrowth rings 3ainsect outbreaks 3atree growth 3aQuebec1 aAchim, Alexis1 aPothier, David0 tEcosphere.g2020 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.e03183-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.31833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04520naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002500132024001100157040001800168100002100186245006000207300001300267506017300280520306200453650001003515650003103525650001603556650002003572650001603592650001903608650002203627650002003649650001403669700002203683773010203705856011203807856007103919956010203990961000904092852000904101655001204110IND60006084520221214225002.0150511e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000608452DNAL7 a3044242aris7 a10113/608452hdl7 a10.1002/ps.38112doi8 ans7234  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiddick, Eric W.10aPlant trichomes have mixed impacts on predatory insects  ap. 1668.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aIn response to our review article on the role of plant trichomes on insect predators (Riddick & Simmons 2014), Krimmel (2014) acknowledged the challenges that are faced in bringing together the varied publications on the subject of impact of plant trichomes on predatory insects. He also suggested that predatory insects may perform better on plant trichomes in the field than one may think, notably because laboratory and field results do not always agree. Certain predatory insects in the field represent a subset of the overall assessment of the impact of plant trichomes on insect predators. We recognize that every publication on this subject was not listed in our review (Riddick & Simmons 2014). On the other hand, we believe that our review summarized the majority of the most relevant published research on this subject. As noted in our review, data for many insect predators are absent or scarce in regards to impact of plant trichomes; our overall conclusions were based on the published data. Moreover, as noted in our review, we excluded predatory mites because they were recently addressed in a review of the impact of plant trichomes on this group (Schmidt 2014). Nevertheless, the published reports in our review show that guilds of insect predators in assorted plant systems can have responses to plant trichomes that range from no effect to mild effect to major effect. Depending on whether research is conducted in a laboratory, greenhouse or field, there are obviously strengths and limitations for each study environment. Sometimes, there are cage effects or environmental effects on plants or insects in studies in either research environment (Simmons & Yeargan 1990; Richards & Coley 2008, Asiimwe et al 2013). For example, plant trichome type and density can vary based on day length (Snyder et al 1998). As illustrated in our review, a host of abiotic and/or biotic factors may even offer different results in the field between two seasons. Yet, data within tri-trophic relationships in different environments (laboratory, greenhouse or field) do not necessarily need to agree to be valid. Of course, the two practical systems for predators in horticultural production systems are protected environments (e.g. greenhouses) and the field. We do not expect plant trichomes to have the same (or lack of) impact on all insect predators in both protected and open field plant systems because of possible differences in insect densities, differences in prey complex, and possible differences in abiotic effects on plants and insect behavior. Although most studies in our review indicated a negative impact on the behavior of predators, the actual impact on fitness is not known. The range of responses lead us to conclude that some predators are apparently more adapted to certain plant trichomes. For some insect predators, the effect is positive, but it is neutral or negative for others. The majority of reports support a negative impact. Yet, much more data are needed to better define which predators are affected by plant trichomes. 3acages 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3ainsect behavior 3aphotoperiod 3aplant response 3apredatory insects 3apredatory mites 3atrichomes1 aSimmons, Alvin M.0 tPest management science.g2014 Nov., v. 70, no. 11 p.1668-1668wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/608453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.38113Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Riddick%20Log%20304424.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008000184300001800264520147700282592002801759650001401787650001201801650001401813650001401827650002101841650001301862650001901875650002001894650001101914650001701925650001801942650001701960650001301977650005201990700001802042700001602060700001602076700001702092700001502109773012402124856008202248852000902330655001202339IND60080281920221122111555.0181029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028192DNAL7 a248719922pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3403-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGogebakan, B.14aThe role of bronchial epithelial cell apoptosis in the pathogenesis of COPD  ap. 5321-5327.  aThere is an increased airway inflammation in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and it has been suggested that there may also be problem in the apoptosis and renewal of cells. However, there are limited human airway cell studies, in particular those from larger airways such as bronchi. We cultured primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from bronchial explants of smokers (n = 6) without COPD and smokers with COPD (n = 8). Apoptosis was studied by fluorescence activated cell sorting. qRT-PCR was used to assess mRNA expression for proteins involving apoptosis including p21Cᴵᴾ¹/ᵂᴬF¹, p53, caspase-8 and caspase-9. Although there was no difference in the rate of viable cells between cells from smokers and COPDs, the level of early apoptotic cells was significantly increased in COPD cells [mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) = 4.86 ± 3.2 %, p = 0.015] as compared to smokers (mean ± SEM = 2.71 ± 1.62 %). In contrast, the rate of late apoptotic cells was significantly decreased in COPD cells (mean ± SEM = 9.82 ± 5.71 %) comparing to smokers (mean ± SEM = 15.21 ± 5.08 %, p = 0.003). Although expression of mRNA for p21Cᴵᴾ¹/ᵂᴬF¹ and caspase-9 was similar in both groups, p53 and caspase-8 mRNA expression was significantly greater in COPD cells. These findings suggest that HBEC apoptosis is increased in COPD, and that this involves p53 and caspase-8 pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abronchi 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3aepithelial cells 3aexplants 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3amessenger RNA 3apathogenesis 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aBayraktar, R.1 aUlaslı, M.1 aOztuzcu, S.1 aTasdemir, D.1 aBayram, H.0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.5321-5327dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3403-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008000173300001600253500001900269520177400288592002802062650001002090650002302100650001802123650001302141650002802154650001302182650000902195650001102204650002802215651001002243653002002253653002502273700001702298700001802315700002002333700001902353773014302372856008502515852000902600655001202609IND60680497620221121052644.0200907e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068049762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chnaes.2019.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd El-Azeim, M.M.10aImpacts of nano- and non-nanofertilizers on potato quality and productivity  ap. 388-397.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aToday, to achieve sustainable agriculture with maximum yield and minimum environmental risks, the use of nanofertilizers has riveted ample consideration. Field experiments were conducted during binary season of 2016 and 2017 at Research Farm, Faculty of Agriculture, Minia University, Egypt to estimate whether NPK nanofertilizers applied in equivalent or lower rates could replace recommended levels of NPK chemical fertilizers in potato farming systems without retrograde effects upon yield production or quality. Impacts of recommended rates of NPK chemical fertilizers (control treatments) compared to NPK nanofertilizers in equivalent or lower rates (100%, 50% and 25%), foliar or soil applied on potato productivity and quality were studied.Compared with control treatments, plots receiving foliar application of NPK nanofertilizers at 50% or 25% of recommended level showed higher values of economic yield (23.59-ton ha⁻¹), starch rates (79.62%), NPK nutrient use efficiency (67.74, 278.92, 118.54 kg potato/kg nutrient), harvest index (59.24%) and only lower potato nitrate content (1.15 g kg⁻¹) as a harmful indicator. Among all treatments, foliar application of NPK nanofertilizers at 50% rate was found to be the most economical treatment as it gave highest potato yield and quality plus highest profit: cost ratio of potato production. This research recommends foliar application of nanofertilizers in potato production to increase production and quality compared to soil applications. As yet, using lower rates of nanofertilizers as foliar application in the present study proved to be an eco-friendly environmental and economic alternative to recommended rates of chemical fertilizers with significant increase in potato productivity and quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarms 3afoliar application 3aharvest index 3anitrates 3anutrient use efficiency 3apotatoes 3asoil 3astarch 3asustainable agriculture 3aEgypt 0aNanofertilizers 0aPotato harvest index1 aSherif, M.A.1 aHussien, M.S.1 aTantawy, I.A.A.1 aBashandy, S.O.0 tActa ecologica Sinica.g2020 Oct., v. 40, no. 5 p.388-397dElsevier B.V.aEcological Society of ChinawJournal:J000000040x1872-20327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2019.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01821naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245012400179300001600303520072300319592002801042653001801070653001601088653002001104653002201124653004201146653001501188700002301203700002301226773016701249856008201416852000901498655001201507IND60517073220221120151426.0190728e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707322DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140007082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPastor De Ward, Catalina T.10aPatagonema iubatum gen. nov. and sp. nov.

At PND4, litters were reduced to small (4 pups/dam) or normal (10 pups/dam) litters. At weaning, SL rats showed higher body weight and characteristic features of the metabolic syndrome. Gene expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and leptin and ghrelin (GHSR) receptors were increased and POMC promoter was hypomethylated in arcuate nucleus, indicating that the early development of obesity may involve the GHSR/NPY system and changes in POMC methylation state. At PND90, body weight, metabolic parameters and gene expression were restored; however, POMC methylation state remained altered. This work provides insight into the effects of neonatal overfeeding, showing the importance of developmental plasticity in restoring early changes in central pathways involved in metabolic programming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamphetamine 3acocaine 3aearly development 3afood intake 3agene expression 3aghrelin 3aleptin 3amales 3ametabolic syndrome 3amethylation 3amodels 3aneuropeptide Y 3aobesity 3aoverfeeding 3aplasticity 3apro-opiomelanocortin 3apups 3arats 3areceptors 3aweaning 0aSmall litter 0aPostnatal programing 0aOverweight 0aHomeostatic system 0aDNA methylation1 aRossetti, María Florencia1 aLazzarino, Gisela Paola1 aCanesini, Guillermina1 aGarcía, Ana Paula1 aStoker, Cora1 aAndreoli, María Florencia1 aRamos, Jorge Guillermo0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 522 p.111123-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.1111233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02624naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245015400159300001600313500001900329500001100348520144300359592002801802650002101830650002201851650002901873650001801902650001801920650002401938650003101962650001901993650001302012700002202025773013402047856007202181852000902253655001202262IND60725499320221122175631.0210126e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072549932DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.49392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamp, Allison A.10aImpacts of Neonicotinoids on the Bumble Bees Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens Examined through the Lens of an Adverse Outcome Pathway Framework  ap. 309-322.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aBumble bees (Bombus sp.) are important pollinators for agricultural systems and natural landscapes and have faced population declines globally in recent decades. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated as one of the reasons for the population reductions in bumble bees and other pollinators due to their widespread use, specificity to the invertebrate nervous system, and toxicity to bees. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) are used to describe the mechanism of action of a toxicant through sequential levels of biological organization to understand the key events that occur for a given adverse outcome. We used the AOP framework to organize and present the current literature available on the impacts of neonicotinoids on bumble bees. The present review focuses on Bombus terrestris and B. impatiens, the 2 most commonly studied bumble bees due to their commercial availability. Our review does not seek to describe an AOP for the molecular initiating event shared by neonicotinoids, but rather aims to summarize the current literature and determine data gaps for the Bombus research community to address.

Based on an extensive survey of recent scientific literature on the water-energy nexus, 70 studies were identified and 35 were selected as comprehensive case studies for review. The reviewed studies were classified and assessed according to groupings based on both geographic scale and their ‘nexus scope’. In addition to providing a depository summary of a wide range of current existing methods and tools for water-energy nexus analysis, the paper discusses these approaches based on their main purposes. From this review, it is clear that the research on water-energy nexus has seen a significant increase in both the number of studies and the capacity of the scientific community to productively assess water and energy interlinkages at a higher resolution. At the same time, this review has also concluded that, while many studies aim to develop new methods and frameworks to comprehensively assess interactions between water, energy and other elements, none can or do provide a singular framework for performing a “nexus study”. Furthermore, many researches are at the “understanding” stage with an emphasis on the quantitative analysis of the water-energy nexus. Fewer approaches are designed to support governance and implementation of technical solutions, and this is considered to a priority challenge area for the scientific community if it aims to achieve greater impact on resource policy and management. There is a clear need to improve our ability to classify and compare the capacities, strengths and weaknesses between existing approaches. This would better enable a wider group of stakeholders to utilize existing knowledge to improve their effective management of water and energy resources. It could also help focus the scientific community to more effectively improve upon the existing knowledge base and to increase focus on “governing” and “implementing” the nexus.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aenergy resources 3agovernance 3aissues and policy 3aquantitative analysis 3astakeholders 3asurveys 0aWater-energy nexus 0aComprehensive case studies 0aMethods and tools 0aNexus challenge level1 aWu, Shiqiang1 aHan, Guoyi1 aWeinberg, Josh1 aXie, Xinghua1 aWu, Xiufeng1 aSong, Xingqiang1 aJia, Benyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8363-08651 aXue, Wanyun1 aYang, Qianc(Chinese literature and film specialist)0 tApplied energy.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 210 p.393-408dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.2433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010600165500001900271520130300290592002801593650001901621650000901640650001101649650001801660650002001678650000901698650002101707650001701728650001601745653001601761653002801777653002201805653002401827653002401851700001301875700001701888700001801905700001801923700001301941700001501954700001801969773009001987856008502077852000902162655001202171IND60704804120221117230148.0200824e20201001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070480412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1184242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Nan10aFull-day dynamic characteristics analysis of a solar aided coal-fired power plant in fuel saving mode  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSolar aided (coal-fired) power generation (SAPG) technology has been rapidly developed over the last few years for its fewer coal consumption rate than the original coal-fired power plant and the lower initial investment than the solar alone thermal power generation. However, due to the frequent variation of meteorological conditions, the operation behaviors of the SAPG plant are ever-changing. In this paper, according to the transient models of SAPG plant, the continuous operation behaviors of a 330 MW SAPG system in a full day are studied. The coupling and decoupling times of the solar field are optimized, and variations of oil and feed water parameters in the solar field during the coupling and decoupling processes are discussed. Besides, some dynamic thermal performances of the SAPG system are studied under the control strategy of maintaining the solar field outlet heat transfer fluid (HTF) temperature constant when the direct normal irradiance (DNI) varies. The research results indicate that during a whole day, the main operating parameters of the SAPG system can operate within the safety ranges, and the system power generation almost keeps 330 MW constant, both the solar output power and the carbon dioxide emission reductions are 207.7 MWh and 186.7t/day, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3aenergy 3aheat transfer 3alight intensity 3aoils 3apower generation 3apower plants 3atemperature 0aSAPG system 0aCoupling and decoupling 0aFull-day analysis 0aParameter variation 0aDynamic performance1 aYu, Gang1 aHuang, Chang1 aDuan, Liqiang1 aHou, Hongjuan1 aHu, Eric1 aDing, Zeyu1 aWang, Jianhua0 tEnergy.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 208 p.118424-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1184243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010300174520135500277592002801632650002201660650002101682650001301703650002501716650001801741650001001759650002001769650001201789650001801801650001101819650002201830650002401852650001001876650001301886653002701899653002201926700002101948700001901969700002701988700002102015700002002036700001702056700001602073700002002089700001702109700001902126700001702145700001802162700001802180700001702198773011502215856008502330852000902415655001202424IND60680497920221121230801.0200405e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068049792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.1013692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarasimhan, Sukanya10aIxodes scapularis saliva components that elicit responses associated with acquired tick-resistance  aTicks and tick-borne diseases are on the rise world-wide and vaccines to prevent transmission of tick-borne diseases is an urgent public health need. Tick transmission of pathogens to the mammalian host occurs during tick feeding. Therefore, it is reasoned that vaccine targeting of tick proteins essential for feeding would thwart tick feeding and consequently prevent pathogen transmission. The phenomenon of acquired tick-immunity, wherein, repeated tick infestations of non-natural hosts results in the development of host immune responses detrimental to tick feeding has served as a robust paradigm in the pursuit of tick salivary antigens that may be vaccine targeted. While several salivary antigens have been identified, immunity elicited against these antigens have only provided modest tick rejection. This has raised the possibility that acquired tick-immunity is directed against tick components other than tick salivary antigens. Using Ixodes scapularis, the blacklegged tick, that vectors several human pathogens, we demonstrate that immunity directed against tick salivary glycoproteins is indeed sufficient to recapitulate the phenomenon of tick-resistance. These observations emphasize the utility of tick salivary glycoproteins as viable vaccine targets to thwart tick feeding and direct our search for anti-tick vaccine candidates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIxodes scapularis 3aanimal pathogens 3aantigens 3adisease transmission 3aglycoproteins 3ahosts 3aimmune response 3amammals 3apublic health 3asaliva 3atick infestations 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3avaccines 0aAcquired tick-immunity 0aSalivary proteins1 aKurokawa, Cheyne1 aDiktas, Husrev1 aStrank, Norma Olivares1 aČerný, Jiří,1 aMurfin, Kristen1 aCao, Yongguo1 aLynn, Geoff1 aTrentleman, Jos1 aWu, Ming-Jie1 aDePonte, Kathy1 aKantor, Fred1 aAnguita, Juan1 aHovius, Joppe1 aFikrig, Erol0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2020 May, v. 11, no. 3 p.101369-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.1013693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011400176300001600290520110100306592002801407653002201435653001801457653002601475653002201501700001901523700002601542773016701568856008201735852000901817655001201826IND60517073520221120160810.0190728e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707352DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140008852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSağlam, Naciye Erdoğan10aDetermination of some population parameters of the veined rapa whelk (Rapana venosa) in the Central Black Sea  ap. 123-129.  aThe veined rapa whelk is one of the most important invasive species in the Black Sea ecosystem since the 1940s. Following its introduction to the Black Sea, it destroyed most of the bivalve populations, mainly the Mediterranean mussel and oysters. However, the veined rapa whelk has commercial importance for the Black Sea fisheries as an alternative product. In this study, we aimed to determine some population parameters of the veined rapa whelk based on indirect ageing through length–frequency data by using the Bhattacharya method. We collected 1704 specimens by dredging along the coasts of Samsun Province in the Central Black Sea in 2011 from June to November. The age of the population varied from 0 to 6. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated as L ∞ = 112.35 mm, k = 0.310, t ₀ = −0.486 and W ∞ = 243.94 g. Mean length and weight, length–weight relationship, mortality and exploitation rates were derived as L = 56.80 ± 0.36 mm, W = 45.67 ± 0.89 g, W = 0.0006 L².⁷¹⁹, Z = 0.96, M = 0.57, F = 0.39 and E = 0.40, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 0aveined rapa whelk 0aRapana venosa 0apopulation parameters 0aCentral Black Sea1 aSağlam, Cemil1 aSağlam, Yeşim Demir0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2015 Feb., v. 95, no. 1 p.123-129dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140008853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03186naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245021600163300001600379520146700395592002801862650001301890650001601903650002401919650001501943650004301958650001902001650001902020650001302039650000902052650003402061650003302095650002702128650001302155650002102168653002902189653002702218653003302245653002302278653004302301700001702344700001602361700001702377700001702394700005702411700001402468773009202482856008502574852000902659655001202668IND60599437920221119182334.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Bin12aA novel restricted access material combined to molecularly imprinted polymers for selective solid-phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography determination of 2-methoxyestradiol in plasma samples  ap. 465-472.  aA feasibility study was performed in order to ensure the possibilities in using a restricted access material combined to molecularly imprinted polymers (RAM-MIP) as sorbent material in solid phase extraction (SPE) for clean-up of 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) from plasma samples. The MIP with hydrophilic external layer was designed by precipitation polymerization. The polymer was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The use of analogs of 2-ME as templates, in combination with a chromatographic separation of the analytes in the sample, overcame the problem of the template bleeding. To demonstrate the property of the RAM-MIP obtained, a comparison of commercially available C18 SPE was performed. The results showed that the RAM-MISPE recoveries were significantly higher than that of C18 SPE for 2-ME in trace concentration. During the extraction process, 2-ME was sufficiently cleaned for further chromatographic analysis with no interferences from template leakage and matrix. Good linearity was obtained from 0.06 to 20μgmL⁻¹ with the correlation coefficient r>0.9991. The coefficient of variation of the inter-assay precision was less than 11.9%. The recoveries of 2-ME in rat plasma at three spiked levels were in the range of 99.10–101.00%. Based on the analytical validation results, the proposed method (RAM-MIP off-line SPE/HPLC) can be a useful tool to determine 2-ME in rat plasma samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3acorrelation 3afeasibility studies 3ahemorrhage 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophilicity 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3arats 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 3athermogravimetry 0aRestricted access matrix 0aSolid phase extraction 0aMolecular imprinted polymers 0a2-Methoxyestradiol 0aHigh performance liquid chromatography1 aQu, Tiantian1 aChen, Zheng1 aCao, Xiaohui1 aHan, Shuping1 aShen, Guopeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4634-04411 aWang, Lei0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.465-472dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245005500182300001800237520165900255592002801914650002601942650001601968650001701984650001902001650002102020650002602041650002202067650001702089650002102106650003902127650001302166650001302179650001202192650001602204650001002220650001402230650002702244650001002271700003202281700002802313700001302341700002002354700001902374700001802393700002002411700002102431700001902452700001702471773012402488856008202612852000902694655001202703IND60080282320221122022032.0181029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028232DNAL7 a249580172pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3407-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Da-Eun10aProfiling of mitochondrial proteome in wheat roots  ap. 5359-5366.  aMitochondria are important organelles for cellular respiration within the eukaryotic cell and have many important functions including vitamin synthesis, amino acid metabolism and photorespiration. To investigate the mitochondrial proteome of the roots of wheat seedlings, a systematic and targeted analysis were carried out on the mitochondrial proteome from 15 day-old wheat seedling root material. Mitochondria were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation; and extracted proteins were disassociated and analyzed by Tricine SDS-PAGE couple to LTQ–FTICR mass spectrometry. From the isolated the sample, 184 proteins were identified which is composed of 140 proteins as mitochondria and 44 proteins as other subcellular proteins that are predicted by the freeware sub-cellular predictor. The identified proteins in mitochondria were functionally classified into 12 classes using the ProtFun 2.2 servers based on biological processes. Proteins were shown to be involved in amino acid biosynthesis (17.1 %), biosynthesis of cofactors (6.4 %), cell envelope (11.4 %), central intermediary metabolism (10 %), energy metabolism (20 %), fatty acid metabolism (0.7 %), purines and pyrimidines (5.7 %), regulatory functions (0.7 %), replication and transcription (1.4 %), translation (22.1 %), transport and binding (1.4 %), and unknown (2.8 %). These results indicate that many of the protein components present and functions of identifying proteins are common to other profiles of mitochondrial proteins performed to date.

Furthermore, our previous study confirmed its cross-reactivity and specificity against rodent ESR2 proteins, enabling the determination of true ESR2 distribution profiles in rodents. Therefore, we aimed to determine optimal conditions for ESR2 detection by PPZ0506 immunostaining and analyze ESR2 distribution in rats. We evaluated several staining conditions using paraffin-embedded and frozen ovary sections. Immunohistochemical staining with PPZ0506 antibody required strong antigen retrieval and appropriate antibody dilution. Subsequent immunohistochemical analysis in multiple tissues under optimized conditions revealed that rat ESR2 proteins are expressed in a more localized manner than previously assumed. Our results suggest that previous immunohistochemical studies using inadequately validated antibodies against ESR2 proteins overestimated their distribution profiles. We expect that optimized immunohistochemical detection with PPZ0506 antibody can help researchers solve several conflicting problems in ESR2 research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3across reaction 3adetection 3aendocrinology 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aproteins 3arats 3aresearch 3aresearchers 3astaining 3atissues 0aAntibody validation 0aERβ 0aEstrogens 0aEstrogen receptor β 0aImmunohistochemistry 0aPPZ05061 aIshii, Hirotaka1 aHigo, Shimpei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2329-93001 aOtsuka, Mai1 aKanaya, Moeko1 aMatsumoto, Keisuke1 aOzawa, Mina1 aOzawa, Hitoshi0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 523 p.111145-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.1111453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005800167300001600225500001100241520142000252592002801672650001101700650001301711650001401724650001101738650003101749650001901780650001101799650001501810700001601825773011901841856008201960852000902042655001202051IND60681781220221119222511.0200201e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068178122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-012-6938-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomez, Jorge L.10aZinc oxide nanostructures: from growth to application  ap. 612-624.  aReview  aZinc oxide’s (ZnO) physical and chemical properties make it a viable and extremely attractive compound to use in a variety of nanotechnology applications. Some of these applications include biomedical, energy, sensors, and optics. As the research in ZnO nanostructures continue to grow, it has inspired a whole host of new innovative applications. Complementing its unique chemical qualities, it also has a simple crystal-growth technology and offers significantly lower fabrication costs when compared to other semiconductors used in nanotechnology. Several processes have been developed in order to synthesize high quality ZnO nanostructures—specifically in the case of nanowires. Here we offer a comprehensive review on the growth methods currently employed in research, industry, and academia to understand what protocols are available to meet specific needs in nanotechnology. Methods examined include: the vapor–liquid–solid, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, metal–organic chemical vapor deposition, and the hydrothermal-based chemical approach. Each of these methods is discussed and their strengths and weaknesses are analyzed with objective comparison metrics. In addition, we study the current state-of-the-art applications employing ZnO nanostructures at their core. A historical perspective on the evolution of the field and the accompanying literature are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aindustry 3ananowires 3aoptics 3aphysicochemical properties 3asemiconductors 3avapors 3azinc oxide1 aTigli, Onur0 tJournal of materials science.g2013 Jan., v. 48, no. 2 p.612-624dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-012-6938-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01870naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002500136245008700161300001600248520083100264592002801095653001301123653001401136653001101150653001401161653001401175653001301189653001501202653001301217653001801230653001101248700002301259700001901282773012601301856007201427852000901499655001201508IND60126086920221120200052.0151105e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012608692DNAL7 a10.1654/4420.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAllister, Chris T.10aHelminth Parasites of Herpetofauna from the Rupunini District, Southwestern Guyana  ap. 184-201.  aTwenty-four individual amphibians (4 families, 11 species) and 52 individual reptiles (9 families, 19 species) from the Rupunini District of southwestern Guyana were examined for helminths.

The aim of this research was to study the fish communities associated with four shipwrecks, by means of underwater visual censuses performed by a remotely operated vehicle, and to test the differences in composition of fish assemblages between these shipwrecks and the adjacent soft bottoms, considered as control sites. Multivariate analysis on the total fish assemblage showed significant differences between wrecks and controls. Results also showed higher levels of species richness and abundance near all wrecks than at a short distance from them on soft bottoms, thus indicating that these sunken vessels, thanks to their higher habitat complexity, act as artificial reefs, attracting aggregations of fish species and leading to a greater diversification of the local fish assemblage. Nevertheless, shipwrecks, which are an ideal target for recreational fishermen, could contribute to the over-exploitation of some high-value fish species, such as Mycteroperca rubra, Dentex dentex and Diplodus spp., attracted by the artificial hard substrate of the vessel-reefs. The recent European directives suggest an urgent need for a better understanding of the crucial role played by these potential sources of pollutants on marine environments and ecosystems. An ecosystem approach to study and monitor these pollutant sources is, therefore, mandatory for appropriate remediation and/or mitigation of the potential negative effects on a productive and healthy ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 0afish diversity 0aremotely operated vehicle 0aunderwater visual census 0aartificial habitat1 aMartino, Andrea1 aRomeo, Teresa1 aSinopoli, Mauro1 aPerzia, Patrizia1 aCanese, Simonepietro1 aVivona, Pietro1 aAndaloro, Franco0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2015 Feb., v. 95, no. 1 p.17-24dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140009403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002300136245018500159300001600344520101900360592002801379653001701407653001901424653002701443653003501470653001401505653002401519653001201543653001001555700002101565700001701586773012601603856007201729852000901801655001201810IND60126087020221120184417.0151105e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012608702DNAL7 a10.1654/4422.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKritsky, Delane C.10aMicroncocotyle bicoccae n. gen., n. sp.

The monotypic Microncocotyle gen. n. is proposed for this species and is characterized, in part, by its members possessing a cup-shaped haptor armed with a ventral anchor/bar complex (dorsal complex absent); 14 hooks with pairs 2––4, 6 and 7 marginal and pairs 1 and 5 central in the haptor; one pair of eyespots; confluent intestinal ceca lacking diverticula; tandem gonads; a vas deferens looping the left intestinal cecum; articulated male copulatory organ and accessory piece; and a dextromarginal vaginal pore. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian interference analyses of the 18S rDNA gene suggest that Microncocotyle originated independently of two other dactylogyrid genera, Dactylogyrus and Pseudodactylogyrus, in which species possess a single anchor/bar complex.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMonogenoidea 0aDactylogyridae 0aMicroncocotyle gen. n. 0aMicroncocotyle bicoccae sp. n. 0aGerreidae 0aGerres longirostris 0aRed Sea 0aEgypt1 aAquaro, Giovanni1 aGalli, Paolo0 tComparative parasitology.g2010 July, v. 77, no. 2 p.137-144dThe Helminthological Society of Washingtonx1525-26477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1654%2F4422.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03377naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245015600176300001600332500001900348520182400367592002802191650001702219650001802236650002802254650002302282650001402305650001402319650002302333650001102356650003102367650002202398650001302420650002302433650001402456650001502470650002902485653001402514653001902528653001402547700002802561700002202589700002602611700002302637773012902660856008502789852000902874655001202883IND60735810220221121040558.0210428e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073581022DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2020.18677062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajabdollahi, Najmeh10aDifferentially expressed genes in resistant and susceptible Pistacia vera L. Cultivars in response to Pseudomonas fluorescens and Phytophthora parsiana  ap. 451-467.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGummosis (Phytophthora root and crown rot) is an important and destructive disease that affects fruit trees like pistachio (Pistacia vera L.). Although many studies have been performed on the possibility of biological control of gummosis, up to now few studies have been done on transcriptionally induced resistance genes in pistachio against Phytophthora disease. In the present research, the cDNA-AFLP method was used to analyze the transcriptionally regulated genes during the interaction between susceptible (Sarakhs) and resistant (Badami-Rize Zarandi) pistachio cultivars with Pseudomonas fluorescens and/or Phytophthora parsiana. Using 12 AFLP primer combinations, approximately 740 different cDNA-AFLP fragments with sizes ranged from 50 to 700 bp were generated for susceptible and resistant pistachio cultivars. Forty six TDFs (transcript derived fragments) were then selected for susceptible cultivar and 24 TDFs for resistant cultivar. Accordingly, each one of these TDFs was recognized by similarity search using the BlastX program against the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database. Notably, 18.5% of TDFs were hypothetical or uncharacterized proteins and 1.4% of them indicated no significant similarity to the known genes. Among the TDFs with known function, disease resistance proteins were identified, which were newly regulated in response to pathogen or rhizobacterium. Furthermore, we found that the expression level of different growth-regulatory or defense-related genes was higher after the exposure to Pseudomonas fluorescens and/or Phytophthora parsiana. To better understand the defense mechanism of pistachio plants and recognition of P. fluorescens-activated genes, which induce resistance against P. parsiana, would significantly assist in the development of new resistant pistachio cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora 3aPistacia vera 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3abiological control 3acrown rot 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic databases 3agummosis 3ainduced resistance 3apathogens 3apistachios 3atranscription (genetics) 0aCDNA-AFLP 0aP. fluorescens 0apistachio1 aSaberi Riseh, Roohallah1 aKhodaygan, Pejman1 aMurādī, Muḥammad,1 aMoslemkhani, Kobra0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2021 May 04, v. 31, no. 5 p.451-467dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl55514x1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2020.18677063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010300162300001600265520131700281592002801598650001501626650001201641650002001653650001901673650002201692650001701714650001601731650000901747650001701756650001701773700001801790700001901808700001801827773011901845856008201964852000902046655001202055IND60681781520221119222236.0200201e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068178152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-012-6770-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ping10aCdSe/Cd1−x Zn x S core/shell quantum dots with tunable emission: growth and morphology evolution  ap. 651-658.  aWe demonstrate an organic synthesis to fabricate hydrophobic core/shell CdSe/Cd₁₋ₓ Zn ₓ S quantum dots (QDs) with tunable photoluminescence (PL) between green and red at relatively low temperature using trioctylphosphine S reacted directly with cadmium and zinc acetate. A seeded growth strategy was used for preparing large CdSe cores. Large CdSe cores revealed a rod-like morphology while small one exhibited a spherical shape. Being coated with a Cd₁₋ₓ Zn ₓ S shell on spherical CdSe cores with an average size of 3.9 nm in diameter, core/shell QDs exhibited a cubic morphology (a length of 5 nm). In contrast, the core/shell QDs created using a small core (3.3 nm in diameter) show a spherical morphology. Namely, the anisotropic aggregation behavior of CdS monomers on CdSe cores occurs when the rod-like core is coated with a Cd₁₋ₓ Zn ₓ S shell. CdS interlayer plays an important role for such morphology evolution because all CdSe cores with a pure ZnS shell exhibited a spherical morphology. The PL properties of CdSe/Cd₁₋ₓ Zn ₓ S core/shell QDs depended strongly on the size and morphology of the cores. The QDs revealed a narrow and tunable PL spectrum. It is believed that this facile strategy can be extended to synthesize other core–shell QDs at low temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acadmium 3acadmium sulfide 3ahydrophobicity 3aphotoluminescence 3aquantum dots 3atemperature 3azinc 3azinc acetate 3azinc sulfide1 aWang, Shiquan1 aAndo, Masanori1 aMurase, Norio0 tJournal of materials science.g2013 Jan., v. 48, no. 2 p.651-658dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-012-6770-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011700170300001600287520082100303592002801124650003501152650001301187650001501200650001801215650001901233653003601252653001301288653001001301653000801311653001001319653001201329700002501341700001901366700001901385700002201404700002301426773008901449856008301538990002301621852000901644655001201653IND60697472120221119193535.0200605e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSliepen, Kwinten10aBinding of inferred germline precursors of broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies to native-like envelope trimers  ap. 116-120.  aHIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env) and Env-based immunogens usually do not interact efficiently with the inferred germline precursors of known broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). This deficiency may be one reason why Env and Env-based immunogens are not efficient at inducing bNAbs. We evaluated the binding of 15 inferred germline precursors of bNAbs directed to different epitope clusters to three soluble native-like SOSIP.664 Env trimers. We found that native-like SOSIP.664 trimers bind to some inferred germline precursors of bNAbs, particularly ones involving the V1/V2 loops at the apex of the trimer. The data imply that native-like SOSIP.664 trimers will be an appropriate platform for structure-guided design improvements intended to create immunogens able to target the germline precursors of bNAbs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aepitopes 3agerm cells 3aglycoproteins 3aneutralization 0aBroadly neutralizing antibodies 0aGermline 0aHIV-1 0aEnv 0aSOSIP 0aVaccine1 aMedina-Ramírez, Max1 aYasmeen, Anila1 aMoore, John P.1 aKlasse, Per Johan1 aSanders, Rogier W.0 tVirology.g2015 Dec., v. 486 p.116-120dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245005800201500002000259520224200279592002802521596006902549650002502618650001502643650001502658650003002673650001102703650001702714650001902731650002202750700002002772700002102792700001802813773010602831856007302937852000903010655001203019IND60705326620221118033606.0200803e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070532662DNAL7 a10.1002/ecs2.32052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaubert, Franziska1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7594-815214aThe role of species traits for grassland productivity  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe relation between species diversity and ecosystem functioning is one of the most frequently discussed topics in ecology. Experiments often revealed an increase of productivity in species‐rich ecosystems. But large variations in these relationships, both on a local scale and in comparisons of sites along environmental gradients, still challenge our understanding of the role of species (with specific traits) and their interactions in ecosystems. In this study, we explored the role of species traits for ecosystem functioning. We used an individual‐based mechanistic grassland model which captures intra‐ and interspecific competition between plants for light and soil resources. We explored how the dynamics and productivity of grasslands are influenced by species traits and analyzed in a simulation study two species, which differ only in one particular trait. Our focus was on traits that determine how species can cope with resource limitations, for which we identified their relative importance for (1) individual plant growth, (2) monoculture dynamics, and (3) species mixture dynamics. We observed diverse relationships between species traits and different vegetation attributes for the different ecosystem levels. Most traits showed positive but saturating trends of increasing trait values but the variability in these relations increased in monocultures with intraspecific plant interactions and even more pronounced in mixtures with interspecific interactions. Using a process‐based grassland model, we were able to simulate overyielding even though it was not correlated with trait values or trait differences between both species. Correlations were also not found in terms of stability of vegetation dynamics. In contrast, for some traits already small differences supported the dominance of a species in the mixture in which species dynamics generally followed trade‐offs. The here presented simulation study demonstrates the use of process‐based models for analyzing trait‐productivity relationships in grasslands. Such models can complement previous approaches in empirical and theoretical biodiversity research and can help to move closer to understanding the mechanisms governing grassland dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  a2818301116cBundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft 3aecological footprint 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3ainterspecific competition 3amodels 3aplant growth 3asoil resources 3aspecies diversity1 aHetzer, Jessica1 aSchmid, Julia S.1 aHuth, Andreas0 tEcosphere.g2020 July, v. 11, no. 7 p.e03205-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.32053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245018400166300001600350520153100366592002801897596005901925596007501984650001502059650001902074650002602093650002602119650002902145650002702174650002702201650002602228650001002254650001202264650001102276650001202287650001302299650002502312650000702337650002902344650001502373650002202388650002402410650002002434650003302454700001802487700005802505773013402563856008202697852000902779655001202788IND60682125020221120101941.0200125e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068212502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-019-01423-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaochen10aNitrogen addition impacts on soil microbial stoichiometry are driven by changes in plant resource stoichiometry not by the composition of main microbial groups in an alpine meadow  ap. 261-271.  aIncreased nitrogen (N) inputs and subsequent effects on soil microbial stoichiometry have strong influences on organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. The effects of N addition on soil microbial stoichiometry are well documented, but we know little about the mechanisms linking between N addition and soil microbial stoichiometry. We examined how the effects of N addition cascade through soil properties (pH, available N (AN), available phosphorus (AP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DOC/AN, AN/AP and DOC/AP ratios), plant community composition (grasses, sedges, forbs, and legumes), plant resource stoichiometry (community-level leaf and root C/N/P ratios), and the composition of main microbial groups (phospholipid fatty acids profile) to influence microbial stoichiometry using a 5-year N fertilization field experiment in a Tibetan alpine meadow. We found that N addition changed soil microbial C/N and N/P ratios, but not microbial C/P ratios, indicating plasticity in microbial stoichiometry to increasing N deposition. Moreover, the changes in microbial stoichiometry were driven by N not C and P concentrations. Structural equation modeling revealed that N addition predominantly controlled soil microbial C/N and N/P ratios through plant leaf and root stoichiometry, but not the composition of plant community and main microbial groups. Our findings suggest that N addition-induced changes in plant resource stoichiometry are the core drivers of soil microbial stoichiometry responses to N deposition.  aPublisher supplied data  a31870435cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018YFD0502401cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aCyperaceae 3aalpine meadows 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abotanical composition 3adissolved organic carbon 3afatty acid composition 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3aforbs 3agrasses 3aleaves 3alegumes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apH 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil properties 3astructural equation modeling1 aLamb, Eric G.1 aZhang, Shiting1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8266-90600 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2020 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.261-271dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl37530x0178-27627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-019-01423-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245007500180300001600255520108400271592002801355650001401383650001101397650001301408650000901421650002401430653002301454653003301477653001801510653001801528653001901546653003101565700002201596773009801618856008701716852000901803655001201812IND60581720220221119090629.0180830e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058172022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.2462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHajaliakbari, Nasrollah10aAnalysis of thermal energy performance in continuous annealing furnace  ap. 829-842.  aIn this paper, the effects of several parameters such as the strip width and thickness, strip velocity and also heating power produced by radiant tubes and its distribution on the overall efficiency of continuous annealing furnace were analyzed. A mathematical model was developed to compute the total heat absorbed by the strip. Then, the overall efficiency was calculated. It was recognized that the strip with lower thickness and width may reduce the thermal performance of continuous annealing line. According to this study, both of strip velocity and heating power should be carefully adjusted in each heating schedule. One of the greatest benefits of this work rather than other previous studies is that both strip velocity and heat power are simultaneously considered such that the operator can make a better sense of setting parameters among tangible choices for a predetermined schedule. The results showed despite more heat provided at the entry of the furnace, the effect of adjusting the heating power at the exit of furnace on overall efficiency was remarkably more.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aenergy 3afurnaces 3aheat 3amathematical models 0aOverall efficiency 0aContinuous annealing furnace 0aRadiant tubes 0aHeating power 0aStrip velocity 0aHeating power distribution1 aHassanpour, Saied0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 206 p.829-842dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.2463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003100166245009500197300001800292520142900310592002801739650002901767650001001796650002401806650001501830650002101845650005201866650002901918700002601947700002901973700002802002773012402030856008202154852000902236655001202245IND60080282720221122022155.0181029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028272DNAL7 a248442142pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3411-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiqueira, Franciele Maboni10aGenome organization in Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae: identification of promoter-like sequences  ap. 5395-5402.  aInformation related to open reading frame (ORF) organization, transcription regulation and promoter sequence has been available for the Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae 7448 genome, demonstrating that the ORFs are continuously transcribed (cotranscription) in large clusters. A species-specific position-specific scoring matrix was applied to scan for putative promoters upstream of all coding sequences on a genome scale in M. hyopneumoniae. This study consisted of a detailed in silico promoter localization analysis by scanning the position-specific promoters upstream of predicted ORF clusters (OCs) and mCs (monocistronic genes) in the M. hyopneumoniae whole genome; this was combined with experimental data for the promoterless ORFs. Promoter-like sequences were found in 86 % of the OCs (from the OC first gene) and in 85 % of the mCs. A transcription analysis of the promoterless ORF was performed by RT-PCR. This strategy allowed the definition of a specific promoter sequence for all OCs and mCs indicating that all the transcriptional units are preceded by putative promoter sequences (matrix and manually located) and providing evidence for functional gene organization in the M. hyopneumoniae genome. These results shown that the species-specific, position-specific scoring matrix for promoter prediction is effective, further increasing the knowledge of gene organization and transcription initiation in mycoplasmas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycoplasma hyopneumoniae 3agenes 3aopen reading frames 3aprediction 3apromoter regions 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics)1 ade Souto Weber, Shana1 aCattani, Amanda Malvessi1 aSchrank, Irene Silveira0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.5395-5402dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3411-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016100169300001300330520108200343592002801425650002501453650001101478650002401489650001601513650001101529650002001540650002601560650000901586650001501595650001501610650002601625651001401651651001101665653002601676653002401702653001601726653002401742653002101766653002401787700002201811773010201833856008501935852000902020655001202029IND60557534420221121040401.0190411e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055753442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2016.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangil, Carlos10aMacroalgal communities on multi-stressed coral reefs in the Caribbean: Long-term changes, spatial variations, and relationships with environmental variables  ap. 7-19.  aLong-term changes in macroalgal cover, spatial variation between macroalgal communities, and relationships with environmental variables and benthic groups were assessed in coral reefs along the Caribbean coast of Panama. Sampling was conducted in two regions: Western and Central. Data collected between 2000 and 2012 showed a continuous increase in macroalgal abundance, although patterns differed according to region and site. There were differences in macroalgal communities between regions, as well as within regions between different wave-exposure levels. There were also differences between sites within regions exposed to the same level of wave action. Multivariate analysis found that wave exposure along with herbivore density (Echinometra viridis) and sedimentation were the variables that explained most of the variability between communities. Other variables such as Echinometra lucunter and Diadema antillarum densities, fish density, productivity, and live coral cover had significant relationships with community structure, but explained less of the variability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEchinometra lucunter 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3aherbivores 3amacroalgae 3amultivariate analysis 3aCaribbean 3aPanama 0aCoral reef macroalgae 0aCommunity structure 0aTime series 0aLobophora variegata 0aHalimeda opuntia 0aEchinometra viridis1 aGuzman, Hector M.0 tJournal of sea research.g2016 Nov., v. 117 p.7-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03898naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003000131040001800161100002200179245013100201300001800332500000900350500001500359520173400374592002802108650001402136650002502150650002102175650001802196650001502214650001802229650003002247650002102277650002102298650001302319650001202332650001502344650001502359650001002374650001502384650001202399650008802411650002702499650002102526650002302547650003202570650003002602650001502632650002002647650004102667651001902708651001902727653002002746700002402766700002202790700001902812773019502831852000903026856011103035856007703146961001303223655001203236IND4375356020221122065935.0191028e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437535602DNAL7 a161512352pmid7 a10113/72542hdl7 a10.2134/jeq2004.03382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIsrael, Daniel W.10aNitrate Movement in Shallow Ground Water from Swine-Lagoon-Effluent Spray Fields Managed under Current Application Regulations  ap. 1828-1842.  aepub  a2019-12-06  aRapid increases in the swine (Sus scrofa domestica) population in the 1990s and associated potential for nitrate N pollution of surface waters led the state of North Carolina to adopt stringent waste management regulations in 1993. Our objectives were to characterize (i) nitrate N movement from waste application fields (WAFs) in shallow ground water, and (ii) soil, hydrologic, and biological factors influencing the amount of nitrate N in the adjacent stream. A ground water monitoring study was conducted for 36 mo on a swine farm managed under new regulations. Water table contours and lack of vertical gradients indicated horizontal flow over most of the site. Nitrate N concentrations in water from shallow wells in WAFs averaged 30 ± 19 mg L⁻¹ and δ¹⁵N ratios for nitrate N were between +20 and +25 per mil. Nitrate N concentration decreased from field-edge to streamside wells by 22 to 99%. Measurement of δ¹⁸O and δ¹⁵N enrichment of nitrate in ground water throughout the WAF–riparian system indicated that denitrification has not caused significant ¹⁵N enrichment of nitrate. Over a 24-mo period, δ¹⁵N ratios for nitrate N in the stream approached δ¹⁵N ratios for nitrate N in ground water beneath WAFs indicating delivery of some waste-derived nitrate N to the stream in shallow ground water. Nitrate N concentrations in the stream were relatively low, averaging 1 mg L⁻¹ Dilution of high nitrate N water in shallow horizontal flow paths with low nitrate N water from deeper horizontal flow paths at or near the stream, some denitrification as ground water discharges through the stream bottom, and some denitrification in riparian zone contributed to this low nitrate N concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeffluents 3alaws and regulations 3ariparian buffers 3awaste lagoons 3atopography 3awater quality 3agroundwater contamination 3ariparian forests 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3astreams 3awatersheds 3awater flow 3awells 3apig manure 2aAnimals 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxlegislation & jurisprudencexstatistics & numerical data. 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aManurexanalysis 2aNitratesxanalysis 2aNitrogen Isotopesxanalysis 2aOxygen Isotopesxanalysis 2aSus scrofa 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aNorth Carolina 0aNorth Carolina 0awater pollution1 aShowers, William J.1 aFountain, Matthew1 aFountain, John0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2005 Sept., v. 34, no. 5 p.1828-1842dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/72543Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2004.03383Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02637naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012500170300001600295500001900311520100700330592002801337650002401365650001901389650001301408650001901421650001101440650001401451650001101465650000901476650002501485650002601510650001301536650001201549653002401561653002001585653001901605653002501624653002001649653001701669700001301686700001901699700002301718700001401741700002801755700002401783700001901807700002401826700001701850773008901867856008301956990002302039852000902062655001202071IND60697472320221119193938.0200605e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069747232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Jason R.10aDiverse antigenic site targeting of influenza hemagglutinin in the murine antibody recall response to A(H1N1)pdm09 virus  ap. 252-262.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHere we define the epitopes on HA that are targeted by a group of 9 recombinant monoclonal antibodies (rmAbs) isolated from memory B cells of mice, immunized by infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus followed by a seasonal TIV boost.

The subjects were 40 Texel sheep, all female, between 12 and 24 months of age. At the beginning of the experiment, all animals received an oral dose of ivermectin. After 14 days, the animals were separated in four homogeneous groups of 10 animals: Group 1 received 3 g/10 kg of pellets containing mycelium of AC001 body weight twice a week; Group 2 received 3 g/10 kg of pellets containing mycelium of NF34 body weight twice a week; Group 3 received two doses of ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg of live weight) two and five months after the beginning of experiment (in the months of December and March) and Group 4, control, was untreated. Feces of each animal were collected weekly and every 14 days approximately 500 g of pasture crops were harvested of each pickets where the groups were located. The results show that AC001 and NF34 were efficient in reducing egg count per gram of feces (P < 0.05) and the count of L₃ in pastures. At the end of the experiment, the group of animals treated with AC001 presented 17.2 kg of weight gain accumulated in relation to other experimental groups. The fungi D. flagrans (AC001) and M. thaumasium (NF34) were efficient in the control of gastrointestinal nematodes in young ewes, promoting a decreased recurrence of infection, reflecting directly on the weight gain.  aFinancial support by CAPES (Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior), CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico), FAPES (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Espírito Santo), FUNADESP (Fundação Nacional de Desenvolvimento do Ensino Superior Particular), and FAPEMIG (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais) is gratefully acknowledged.  aPublisher supplied data  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superiordhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002322  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológicodhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003593  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Geraisdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004901 3aNematoda 3aTexel 3abiological control 3abody weight 3aeggs 3afeces 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3aivermectin 3amycelium 3aoral administration 3apastures 3atechnology 3aweight gain 0aNematophagous fungi 0anematode 0aDuddingtonia flagrans 0aMonacrosporium thaumasium1 aBogado, Alexey Leon Gomel1 aOkano, Werner1 aFilho, Luiz Fernando Coelho da Cunha1 ada Silva, Luiz César1 aZanol, Daniel1 aFerraz, Carolina Magri1 aMoreira, Tiago Facury1 aTobias, Fernando Luiz1 aBraga, Fábio Ribeiro1 ade Araújo, Jackson Victor0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2021 May 04, v. 31, no. 5 p.499-511dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl55514x1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2020.18696993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016900171300001600340520148700356592002801843650001501871650002401886650003501910650002701945650002001972650000901992650001202001650001302013650000702026650002502033650002002058650002502078653002502103653002202128653001202150653001802162653004902180700001802229700002102247700001802268700002002286773009202306856008502398852000902483655001202492IND60599438420221119182618.0180702e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Keng-Chang10aSelective and eco-friendly method for determination of mercury(II) ions in aqueous samples using an on-line AuNPs–PDMS composite microfluidic device/ICP-MS system  ap. 408-413.  aIn this study we developed an on-line, eco-friendly, and highly selective method using a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite microfluidic (MF) chip coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to separate trace Hg²⁺ ions from aqueous samples. Because Hg²⁺ ions interact with AuNPs to form Hg–Au complexes, we were able to separate Hg²⁺ ions from aqueous samples. We prepared the AuNPs–PDMS composite through in situ synthesis using a PDMS cross-linking agent to both reduce and embed AuNPs onto PDMS microchannels so that no additional reductants were required for either AuNP synthesis or the PDMS surface modification (2% HAuCl4, room temperature, 48h). To optimize the proposed on-line system, we investigated several factors that influenced the separation of Hg²⁺ ions in the AuNPs–PDMS/MF, including adsorption pH, adsorption and elution flow rates, microchannel length, and interferences from coexisting ions. Under optimized conditions (pH 6.0; adsorption/elution flow rates: 0.05/0.5mLmin–¹; channel length: 840mm), we evaluated the accuracy of the system using a standard addition method; the measured values had agreements of ≥93.0% with certified values obtained for Hg²⁺ ions. The relative standard deviations of the proposed method ranged from 2.24% to 6.21%. The limit of detection for Hg²⁺ for the proposed on-line AuNPs–PDMS/MF/ICP-MS analytical method was as low as 0.07µgL⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aambient temperature 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3across-linking reagents 3adetection limit 3aions 3amercury 3ananogold 3apH 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3areducing agents 3astatistical analysis 0aPolydimethylsiloxane 0aGold nanoparticle 0aMercury 0aMicrofluidics 0aInductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry1 aLee, Cheng-Fa1 aTseng, Wei-Chang1 aChao, Yu-Ying1 aHuang, Yeou-Lih0 tTalanta.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 128 p.408-413dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02468naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245010100199300001600300500001900316500002000335520127700355592002801632596002701660650001901687650003501706650001501741650002601756650001101782650001901793650001501812650001301827650000901840651001101849651001101860773012801871856007401999852000902073655001202082IND60725500020221119181112.0210126e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072550002DNAL7 a10.1111/joac.123742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Birgit1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9467-237410aGlyphosate—A love story.

Herbicide tolerant crops became the lynchpin of the technological revolution for large‐scale farming first in the United States and Canada, and now in Europe. Zero‐till farming, as a production scheme and a world view, is based on simplifications promoted by a handful of transnational corporations with the complicity of politicians looking for easy solutions for problems, such as climate change, erosion and the hunger in the world. At the same time, the massive use of glyphosate is branded as an endocrine disrupter, causing cancer, male sterility and infertility. It interferes with soil bacteria and acts on the equilibrium of soil fungi. Glyphosate resistant crops connect farmers to far away consumers ingesting the food they grow together with the traces of chemicals. Farmers intra‐act with the myriads of life‐forms of the soil eco‐system. How do they perceive the life in the soil, when they spray chemicals? The article explores the political dimensions of the agency of both humans and non‐humans to understand the effects of the modernizing project of zero‐till, as well as to identify spaces and scales of possibility from where alternatives can emerge.  aPublisher supplied data  cWenner Gren Foundation 3aclimate change 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aglyphosate 3aglyphosate resistance 3ahunger 3amale sterility 3ano-tillage 3apolitics 3asoil 3aCanada 3aEurope0 tJournal of agrarian change.g2021 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.160-179dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774057x1471-03587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.123743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001600286520163600302592002801938653001801966653001301984653001201997653001802009653001802027700001902045700005302064700001702117773016702134856008202301852000902383655001202392IND60517074120221120142104.0190728e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707412DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140010272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrocetta, F.10aDoes GenBank provide a reliable DNA barcode reference to identify small alien oysters invading the Mediterranean Sea?  ap. 111-122.  aThe Mediterranean Sea is currently under siege by a conspicuous alien pressure, and, within some families (e.g. the Ostreidae), the number of native species seems to be remarkably outnumbered by that of the alien ones. We wanted to test the reliability of the molecular data currently available on the small alien oysters recently invading the Mediterranean Sea. Samples from Greece and Turkey, encompassing the known species-specific morphological variation, were sequenced for the markers with the widest taxonomic coverage in the group of small oysters (i.e. the 16S rDNA and the COI). The sequences obtained have been compared with those available in GenBank, and a possible identification at the species level has been finally tested in a DNA-barcoding fashion. The present results clearly demonstrated that our samples belong to a single, morphologically highly variable species. Their 16S sequences were closely related to a sequence registered under the name Dendostrea folium, with a genetic distance which does not warrant conspecificity. Additionally, a remarkable number of sequences retrieved from the GenBank (of both genes) did not form a monophyletic group according to the published classification of the vouchers, suggesting—at least in part—an origin from specimens not properly identified. Both genes seem promising for use as DNA-barcode, although the COI will probably prove more effective. Therefore, we urge the availability of a baseline of oyster pedigreed DNA barcode sequences in the public databases, to allow the use of such genetic data to reliably monitor bio-invasions in the Mediterranean Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDNA-barcoding 0aMollusca 0aoysters 0aalien species 0aMediterranean1 aMariottini, P.1 aSalvi, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3804-26901 aOliverio, M.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2015 Feb., v. 95, no. 1 p.111-122dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140010273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02691naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245012800196300001800324500001500342520117900357592002801536650002501564650003701589650001001626650002401636650001001660650001401670650002601684650001301710650002001723650002101743650001201764650001001776653001001786700003001796700001701826700001801843700002001861700001801881700001801899700001901917700001901936700001501955773012401970856008202094852000902176655001202185IND60080282920221122022552.0181029e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008028292DNAL7 a248670792pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3413-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasthuri, Saranya Revathy10aMolecular characterization and expressional affirmation of the beta proteasome subunit cluster in rock bream immune defense  ap. 5413-5427.  a2019-12-06  aImmunoproteasomes are primarily induced upon infection and formed by replacing constitutive beta subunits with inducible beta subunits which possess specific cleavage properties that aid in the release of peptides necessary for MHC class I antigen presentation. In this study, we report the molecular characterization and expression analysis of the inducible immunosubunits PSMB8, PSMB9, PSMB9-L, and PSMB10 from rock bream, Oplegnathus fasciatus. The three subunits shared common active site residues and were placed in close proximity to fish homologues in the reconstructed phylogenetic tree, in which the mammalian homologues formed separate clades, indicating a common ancestral origin. The rock bream immunosubunits possessed higher identity and similarity with the fish homologues. RbPSMB8, RbPSMB9, RbPSMB9-L, and RbPSMB10 were multi-exonic genes with 6, 6, 7 and 8 exons, respectively. These four genes were constitutively expressed in all the examined tissues. Immunostimulants such as lipopolysaccharide and poly I:C induced RbPSMB8, RbPSMB9, RbPSMB9-L, and RbPSMB10 in liver and head kidney, suggesting their possible involvement in immune defense in rock bream.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigen presentation 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aliver 3alipopolysaccharides 3abream 3aphylogeny 3aOplegnathus fasciatus 3apeptides 3agene expression 3aimmunostimulants 3akidneys 3aexons 0agenes1 aUmasuthan, Navaneethaiyer1 aWhang, Ilson1 aLim, Bong-Soo1 aJung, Hyung-Bok1 aOh, Myung-Joo1 aJung, Sung-Ju1 aYeo, Sang-Yeob1 aKim, Sung Yeon1 aLee, Jehee0 tMolecular biology reports.g2014 Aug., v. 41, no. 8 p.5413-5427dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-014-3413-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01609naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245038400210520021800594592002800812650002100840650002100861650001500882650001300897650001800910650002900928650002000957650001400977650003300991650002001024650001401044773011801058856008601176852000901262655001201271IND60722785520221120180304.0210926e20210301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072278552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.1118152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuela, Diego M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3398-206910aComments on “Treatment of malachite green dye containing solution using bio-degradable sodium alginate/NaOH treated activated sugarcane baggsse charcoal beads: Batch, optimization using response surface methodology and continuous fixed bed column study” and “Adsorption and oxidation of ciprofloxacin in a fixed bed column using activated sludge derived activated carbon”  aThis comment analyses the results of the fixed-bed column modeling from the studies published by Gupta and Garg (2019), and Das et al.

The behavioural decision between covering and sheltering thus obviously exists. However, no information is available on the preference between the two natural behaviours. Two conditions were designed with covering and sheltering materials to comparatively describe the diel trade-off between covering and sheltering behaviours in male and female Strongylocentrotus intermedius. In the present study S. intermedius had an obvious diel trade-off between covering and sheltering behaviours, preferring covering over sheltering when both behaviours were possible. Sex did not significantly affect the trade-off between the two behaviours, no matter whether covering materials were inside or outside the shelters. The rhythm of covering behaviour was not well correlated with intensity of light in the trade-off with sheltering behaviour. The present study provides new insights into behavioural ecology of sea urchins.  aPublisher supplied data 0aStrongylocentrotus intermedius 0adiel 0asheltering 0acovering 0abehavioural decision-making1 aTian, Xiaofei1 aFeng, Wenping1 aHu, Lunchao1 aZhou, Haisen1 aChzhan, I︠A︡t︠s︡in,0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 Nov., v. 94, no. 7 p.1471-1474dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140006423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011500167300001400282520149600296592002801792650001901820650002301839650002001862650001701882650001101899650002201910650001301932650001501945650001701960650000901977650002001986650001302006650001702019653001702036653002302053653002002076653002302096700001802119700001602137700001602153700001802169700001402187700001502201773009002216856008502306852000902391655001202400IND60599435620221119182458.0180702e20141101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059943562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernard, L.10aAnalytical methods for the determination of DEHP plasticizer alternatives present in medical devices: A review  ap. 39-54.  aUntil 2010, diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) was the plasticizer most commonly used to soften PVC medical devices (MDs), because of a good efficiency/cost ratio. In flexible plasticized PVC, phthalates are not chemically bound to PVC and they are released into the environment and thus may come into contact with patients. The European Directive 2007/47/CE, classified DEHP as a product with a toxicity risk and restricted its use in MDs. MD manufacturers were therefore forced to quickly find alternatives to DEHP to maintain the elasticity of PVC nutrition tubings, infusion sets and hemodialysis lines. Several replacement plasticizers, so-called “alternative to DEHP plasticizers” were incorporated into the MDs. Nowadays, the risk of exposure to these compounds for hospitalized patients, particularly in situations classified “at risk”, has not yet been evaluated, because migrations studies, providing sufficient exposure and human toxicity data have not been performed. To assess the risk to patients of DEHP plasticizer alternatives, reliable analytical methods must be first developed in order to generate data that supports clinical studies being conducted in this area. After a brief introduction of the characteristics and toxicity of the selected plasticizers used currently in MDs, this review outlines recently analytical methods available to determine and quantify these plasticizers in several matrices, allowing the evaluation of potential risk and so risk management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanalytical methods 3aclinical trials 3ahemodialysis 3ahumans 3amedical equipment 3apatients 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3arisk 3arisk management 3atoxicity 3atube feeding 0aPlasticizers 0aPolyvinyl chloride 0aMedical devices 0aAnalytical methods1 aDécaudin, B.1 aLecoeur, M.1 aRichard, D.1 aBourdeaux, D.1 aCueff, R.1 aSautou, V.0 tTalanta.g2014 Nov. 01, v. 129 p.39-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2014.04.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010800169500002900277520193500306592002802241650002402269650002902293650001502322650002802337653002002365653003402385653003302419700001802452700005902470773010002529856008602629852000902715655001202724IND60680495120221122033506.0200417e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068049512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1060612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwatra, Swati12aA critical review of studies related to construction and computation of Sustainable Development Indices  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aSustainable development is a multi-dimensional concept, which emphasizes integration and striking a dynamic balance between economic, social and environmental aspects in a region, to ensure inter-generational and intra-generational equity. One of the major tools to address sustainability concerns is to have indices, which can measure the performance of a region on various dimensions of sustainable development. The review suggests there are various indices that are available at the global scale that compare different countries on different aspects of sustainability; however, a limited number of studies have been reported at regional scale. Further, the paper appraises about the various approaches and frameworks used to develop these Sustainable Development Indices (SDIs). The merits and demerits of these approaches and frameworks have been discussed. The review finds that top-down approaches have been generally employed for construction of SDIs. However, bottom-up approaches which are rarely used, also need to be developed in order to construct robust, contextual and consensus based SDIs. The review shows that composite SDIs are the most common form of framework used across the globe. Most studies have been found to use 30–60 indicators for development of SDIs. The key steps to be followed for construction of Composite Sustainable Development Indices (CSDIs) have been reviewed in detail. The review finds variable processes and steps followed by different studies for development of SDIs. Based on the review, research gaps have been identified and recommendations on steps to be followed in construction of new CSDI have been provided. The review also reveals that most studies have focused on assessment of current state of sustainable development, a limited number where the trends have been studies; no study related to the future projections/predictions of the SDI has been reported in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aenvironmental indicators 3aprediction 3asustainable development 0aComposite Index 0aSustainable Development Index 0aEnvironmental Sustainability1 aKumar, Archna1 aSharma, Prateek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0617-01370 tEcological indicators.g2020 May, v. 112 p.106061-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1060613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012400166300001800290520126400308592002801572653001601600653001601616653002401632653002201656700001601678700001601694700001801710773016901728856008201897852000901979655001201988IND60517071120221122142200.0190728e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051707112DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140006782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiangrande, A.10aFabriciidae (Annelida, Sabellida) from a naturally acidified coastal system (Italy) with description of two new species  ap. 1417-1427.  aPolychaete worms are known to thrive in extreme environmental conditions, however little is known about how polychaete species will respond to major climatic stressors, such as ocean acidification. Here, we examined the distribution of Fabriciidae (Annelida, Sabellida) species along a gradient of ocean acidification, caused by carbon dioxide (CO₂) vent emissions in a shallow, coastal system off the island of Ischia (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). A total of 265 specimens of Fabriciidae, representing six species from five genera, were collected along the gradient. Most of the species were found across the entire CO₂ gradient, suggesting polychaetes may have a high tolerance for ocean acidification in the future. Two of the species were new to science, and two of the genera were previously unrecorded in the Mediterranean. A full description of the new species Brifacia aragonensis sp. nov. and Parafabricia mazzellae sp. nov. is given, both of which were most abundant in the most acidified areas (pH 6.6–7.2). The geographical distribution and ecology of the new taxa, as well as of the other fabriciid species collected, is discussed. Taxonomic keys to identify the Fabriciidae species currently recorded in the Mediterranean Sea are also provided.  aPublisher supplied data 0apolychaetes 0aFabriciidae 0aocean acidification 0aMediterranean Sea1 aGambi, M.C.1 aMicheli, F.1 aKroeker, K.J.0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2014 Nov., v. 94, no. 7 p.1417-1427dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154140006783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01834naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008003300034016002400067024002100091040001800112072000900130072000900139100001600148245007000164300001600234500004200250500002500292520041600317650001500733650002300748650002300771650003200794650001500826650001500841650001900856650001600875650001400891650002200905650001600927650002400943650001200967650001700979650002200996650001901018650001901037773006901056852000901125856011201134930003301246945002501279946001101304961001301315655001201328991597274890742620221123035435.0780601|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890909342DNAL7 a10113/282222hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ200 0aR2001 aCiegler, A.10aDetoxification of aflatoxin contaminated agricultural commodities  ap. 729-738.  aIn International Symposium on Animal.  aIncludes references.  aAflatoxin-contaminated commodities can be detoxified by a variety of methods based to some extent on economics and the physical and chemical characteristics of the substance being treated.

Each herbicide was applied at eight doses. Data were regressed on herbicide dose using a log-logistic curve (R2 = 0.56-0.95 for clethodim, R2 = 0.60-0.94 for glufosinate, and R2 = 0.70-0.96 for glyphosate). The herbicide rate that elicited a 50% plant response (I50) in the bermudagrass cultivars ranged from 0.04 to 0.19 kg ha(-1) clethodim, 0.19 to 1.33 kg ha(-1) glufosinate and 0.34 to 1.14 kg ha(-1) glyphosate. Relative to other cultivars, common bermudagrass was intermediate in its response to clethodim and among the most tolerant cultivars to glufosinate and glyphosate. TifSport was relatively tolerant to clethodim and glufosinate compared with other cultivars, but relatively sensitive to glyphosate. One cultivar, 94-437, was consistently among the most sensitive cultivars to each of the herbicides. While there were differential herbicide tolerances among the tested bermudagrass cultivars, there did not appear to be any naturally occurring herbicide resistance that could be commercially utilized. However, research indicated that breeding efforts should target herbicide resistance that is at least four times the registered use rate. Also, TifSport and Tifway have been identified as suitable representatives of triploid hybrid bermudagrass cultivars to be used to evaluate the success of turfgrass renovation programs. 3alawns and turf 3aCynodon 3aweed control 3aclethodim 3aglufosinate 3aglyphosate 3aapplication rate 3adose response 3astructure-activity relationships 3aherbicide resistance 3acultivars 3ahybrids 3agenetic variation 2aAminobutyratesxtoxicity 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCyclohexanonesxtoxicity 2aCynodonxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Resistance 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity. 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 3aGeorgia1 aHanna, W.W.1 aMullinix, B.G.

In this study, various combinations and volumes of three mycotoxin-reductive VOCs (2,3-dihydrofuran, 3-octanone and decane) were assessed for their cumulative impacts on four Aspergillus strains (LA1–LA4), which were then analyzed for changes in growth, as well as the production of mycotoxins, including aflatoxins, CPA and multiple indole diterpenes. Fungal growth remained minimally inhibited when exposed to various combinations of VOCs. No single combination was able to consistently, or completely, inhibit aflatoxin or CPA across all toxigenic strains tested. However, the combination of 2,3-dihydrofuran and 3-octanone offered the greatest overall reductions in aflatoxin and CPA production. Despite no elimination of their production, findings showed that combining VOCs produced solely by non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus still inhibited several agriculturally important mycotoxins, including B and G aflatoxins and CPA. Therefore, other VOC combinations are worth testing as post-harvest biocontrol treatments to ensure the prolonged effectiveness of pre-harvest biocontrol efforts. 3aAspergillus flavus 3aaflatrem 3abiological control 3acyclopiazonic acid 3adecane 3amass spectrometry 3asecondary metabolites 3asucrose 3atoxicity 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3avolatile organic compounds 3ayeast extract 3aLouisiana1 aLebar, Matthew D.1 aWientjes, Carol H.0 tToxins.g2022 May 13, v. 14 p.340-x2072-66517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins140503403Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001600149245005100165300001600216500002400232520127200256650002501528650001501553650001101568650002701579650002201606650001501628650001601643650001201659650001501671650002601686650002301712650002501735650001001760650003001770650001901800650005201819700001801871700001501889700001501904773009901919852000902018856011202027930003302139945001302172946001302185961001302198655001202211IND2059166320221118151114.0970826s1997    nyu|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND205916632DNAL7 a92690852pmid7 a10113/178572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzogi, A.A.10aSwine wastewater treatment by media filtration  ap. 831-843.  aIncludes references  aA media filter was constructed to treat swine wastewater after anaerobic lagoon treatment. The media filter consisted of a tank (1.5-m-diameter x 0.6-m-height) filled with marl gravel. The marl gravel had a carbonate content of 300 g kg-1. Gravel particle size distributions were 85 and 14% in the 4.7- to 12.7-mm and 12.7- to 19-mm size classes, respectively. Pore space of the filtration unit was 57%. Wastewater flow rate was 606 L m-2 d-1, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) load was 198 g m-2 d-1. The media filter removed 54% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) content after one cycle, but increased cycling did not produce additional COD reduction. Total suspended solids (TSS) removal after one cycle was 50% of initial levels, and additional cycling reduced TSS levels at a much lower rate of 7% per cycle. Removal efficiencies for total phosphorus (TP) ranged from 37% to 52% (one to four cycles), but long-term phosphorus removal would be limited by the sorption capacity of the gravel. Up to 24% of TKN was converted to nitrate-plus-nitrite-N (NO3+NO2-N). Effluents with high NO3+NO2-N levels can be treated further for denitrification with constructed wetlands or anaerobic lagoon. This is important in cases where land is limited for wastewater application. 3awastewater treatment 3afiltration 3agravel 3achemical oxygen demand 3apollution control 3apig manure 2aAgriculture 2aAnimals 2aFiltration 2aFresh Waterxanalysis 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aSwine 2aWaste Managementxmethods 2aWaste Products 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxprevention & control1 aHumenik, F.J.1 aRice, J.M.1 aHunt, P.G.0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g1997, v.

The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that its basic structure is similar to the GABA receptor of Rdl type subunits of Drosophila melanogaster and of Blattella germanica. Particularly conserved are M1, M2 and M3 segments. Within this 146 amino acid stretch, the GABA receptor from the red flour beetle differed from corresponding ones from Drosophila and Rdl subunit of B. germanica by 12 and eight amino acids, respectively. By using an identical approach, the corresponding DNA region was sequenced from the cDNA of a cyclodiene-resistant strain of T. castaneum. While two points of mutation were found only one mutation in DNA was found to result in an amino acid shift. The site of mutation was at the 5th amino acid of the M2 cylinder where G to T conversion of the GCT codon resulted in a conversion of alanine to serine. This is qualitatively the same mutational switch of alanine to serine in resistant strains previously reported to have occurred in cyclodiene-resistant Drosophila melanogaster. Aedes aegypti and Blattella germanica, indicating that this amino acid change is the likely cause for evolution of the nerve insensitive type of resistance to cyclodiene insecticides. 3aTribolium castaneum 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3areceptors 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3acyclodiene insecticides 3ainsecticide resistance 3amutation 2aAlaninexgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCockroachesxgenetics 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aInsecticide Resistancexgenetics 2aInsecticidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis 2aMutation 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRats 2aReceptors, GABAxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSerinexgenetics 2aTriboliumxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data1 aMatsumura, F.1 aBeeman, R.W.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.

This review focuses on the manipulation of the starch and protein composition and modification of the hardness of durum wheat in order to improve its technological and nutritional value and expand its utilization for application to a wider number of end products. Starch is composed of amylopectin and amylose in a 3:1 ratio, and their manipulation has been explored for achieving starch with modified composition. In particular, silencing of the genes involved in amylose and amylopectin synthesis has made it possible to isolate durum wheat lines with amylose content varying from 2-3% up to 75%. This has created opportunities for new products with different properties and enhanced nutritional value. Durum-made bread has generally inferior quality to bread made from common wheat. Attempts to introduce the Glu-D1 subunits 1Dx5 + 1Dy10 and 1Dx2 + 1Dy12 produced stronger dough, but the former produced excessively strong, inelastic doughs, and loaf volume was either inferior or not affected. In contrast, the 1Dx2 + 1Dy12 sometimes improved bread loaf volume (LV) depending on the glutenin subunit background of the genotype receiving these genes. Further breeding and selection are needed to improve the dough extensibility to allow higher LV and better texture. The versatility of durum wheat has been greatly expanded with the creation of soft-textured durum via non-GMO introgression means. This soft durum mills like soft hexaploid wheat and has similar baking properties. The pasta quality is also not diminished by the soft-textured kernels. The Glu-D1 locus containing the subunits 1Dx2 + 1Dy12 has also been introgressed to create higher quality soft durum bread. 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3abreads 3adough 3adurum wheat 3aextensibility 3agenotype 3aglutenins 3ahexaploidy 3aintrogression 3aloaves 3aloci 3anon-genetically modified foods 3anutritive value 3apasta 3aprotein composition 3atexture1 aSestili, Francesco1 aSissons, Mike1 aKiszonas, Alecia1None1 aMorris, Craig F.0 tFoods.g2022 May 24, v. 11, no. 11wJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods111115323Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191100001900200245012300219300001800342500002400360520066200384650001901046650001701065650001601082650002701098650002001125650001801145650002201163650001301185650002001198650001201218650002701230650002101257653000801278700002001286700001701306700002001323700001901343773012801362852000901490856009201499856011201591930003301703945002501736946001101761961001301772655001201785IND4397453320221121001209.0071104e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439745332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01875.x2doi7 a10113/437432hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL200 0aL0011 aShrestha, R.B.10aCharacterization of microsatellite loci in the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae)  ap. 1342-1344.  aIncludes references  aA microsatellite-enriched partial genomic DNA library of Lygus hesperus was generated and screened by sequencing.

Among these pathogens, Pseudoperonospora cubensis and P. humuli, two closely related species, adversely affect cucurbits and hops, respectively. Discordant hypotheses concerning their taxonomic relationships have been proposed based on phytopathological evidence and gene sequences of few individuals, but population genetics evidence for this taxonomic claim is missing. Further, nuclear and mitochondrial regions of both pathogens have been analyzed using microsatellites and other molecular methods, but extensive comparative population genetics research is still lacking. Here, we genotyped 129 current and historical herbarium specimens of the two species using microsatellites (SSRs). Our goals were to assess genetic diversity and spatial distribution, to infer evolutionary history of P. cubensis and P. humuli, and to visualize genome-scale organizational relationship between both pathogens. High genetic diversity, modest gene flow, and presence of population structure, particularly in P. cubensis were indicated. When tested for cross-amplification, 20 out of 27 of P. cubensis-derived SSRs cross-amplified DNA of P. humuli individuals, but only few produced amplification products with downy mildews from related genera. Comparative genomics analyses of the available draft genome sequences evidenced synteny at both the genomic DNA and the translated sequence levels, with tandem repeats expansion in the P. humuli genome. Collectively, our analyses provided a definite argument for the hypothesis that both pathogens are distinct species.  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucurbitaceae 3aDNA 3aPseudoperonospora cubensis 3aPseudoperonospora humuli 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3aherbaria 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3aplant pathology 3apopulation structure1 aGuerry, Denita1 aTrigiano, Robert N.1 aBoggess, Sarah L.1 aKanetis, Loukas1 aWadl, Phillip A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0759-73431 aOjiambo, Peter S.1 aCubeta, Marc A.1 aSpring, Otmar1 aThines, Marco1 aRunge, Fabien1 aScheffler, Brian E.0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2021 July 14, v. 12 p.686759-wJournal:jnl60298x1464-67227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.6867593Available from publisher's Web site  aVersion of Record  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112100002300130245019000153300001600343500002400359500001500383520149800398650002501896650002601921650001201947650002101959650002401980650002102004650002402025650002202049650001402071650001802085650002502103650002302128650001902151650002002170650002602190650001802216653001202234653001502246653001202261653002202273653002802295653004702323653003702370700001802407773007302425852000902498856011102507930003302618945001302651946001302664961001302677655001202690IND2039618520221117052759.0940519e199401  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203961852DNAL7 a10113/25132hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiannattasio, R.B.12aA reexamination of species boundaries and hypotheses of hybridization concerning Solanum megistacrolobum and S. toralapanum (Solanum sect.

Petota) species, classified in series Megistacroloba, that together are distributed from southern Peru to northwestern Argentina. They have variously been synonymized, recognized as varieties of S. megistacrolobum, or recognized as distinct species. We used 22 single- to low-copy random genomic DNA probes from potato, hybridized to total DNA digested with DraI, EcoRI, EcoRV, and HindIII, to investigate their taxonomic status. We also investigated the hybrid origin of S. raphanifolium and the hybrid origin of S. acaule subsp. aemulans. Our results are concordant with a separate morphological study, showing weak differentiation between S. megistacrolobum and S. toralapanum, but possible only with multivariate methods. These combined morphological and molecular results most closely fit the contemporary treatment of S. megistacrolobum and S. toralapanum at the varietal level. We propose the new combination S. megistacrolobum subsp. toralapanum in order to bring consistency to taxa within sect. Petota, where different authors recognize identical taxa as varieties or subspecies. Our results also show possible hybridization between S. megistacrolobum and S. acaule subsp. aemulans in Argentina, discount the hybridization hypothesis of S. raphanifolium, and show that the species-specific bands of S. albicans relative to S. acaule are shared with many other species in sect. Petota. 3aSolanum sogarandinum 3aSolanum raphanifolium 3ahybrids 3aSolanum palustre 3arestriction mapping 3aSolanum albicans 3aenzyme polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeny 3ahybridization 3aSolanum candolleanum 3aSolanum boliviense 3aSolanum acaule 3anew combination 3aSolanum bulbocastanum 3achemotaxonomy 0aspecies 0aphenograms 0aSolanum 0aSolanum bukasovii 0aSolanum megistacrolobum 0aSolanum megistacrolobum subsp. toralapanum 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aSpooner, D.M.0 tSystematic botany.g1994 , v.  19, no.  1 p.106-115x0363-64457nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/25133Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070823b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03182naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003000134024002500164024004000189024002300229040001800252100001900270245009800289506002800387506003200415520155500447596007002002506003702072650001602109650001502125650002302140650001402163650001202177650002202189650001202211650002002223650001302243650001102256700001902267700001902286700001802305700001402323700002002337700005902357773012202416856008002538903002202618961001502640852000902655655001202664IND60748213420221214224044.0210822e20210323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074821342DNAL7 a10113/74821342hdl7 a3824302aris7 a10.3390/ijms220632662doi7 a4360522aris_accn_no7 a3092-51000-061-00D2aris_project_no7 a3824302seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, Justin13aAn arabidopsis oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, AtOXC, is important for oxalate catabolism in plants  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aConsidering the widespread occurrence of oxalate in nature and its broad impact on a host of organisms, it is surprising that so little is known about the turnover of this important acid. In plants, oxalate oxidase is the most well studied enzyme capable of degrading oxalate, but not all plants possess this activity. Recently, an Acyl Activating Enzyme 3 (AAE3), encoding an oxalyl-CoA synthetase, was identified in Arabidopsis. This enzyme has been proposed to catalyze the first step in an alternative pathway of oxalate degradation. Since this initial discovery, this enzyme and proposed pathway has been found to be important to other plants and yeast as well. In this study we identify, in Arabidopsis, an oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (AtOXC) that is capable of catalyzing the second step in this proposed pathway of oxalate catabolism. This enzyme breaks down oxalyl-CoA, the product of AtAAE3, into formyl-CoA and CO2. AtOXC:GFP localization suggested that this enzyme functions within the cytosol of the cell. An Atoxc knock-down mutant showed a reduction in the ability to degrade oxalate into CO2. This reduction in AtOXC activity resulted in an increase in the accumulation of oxalate and the enzyme substrate, oxalyl-CoA. Size exclusion studies suggest that the enzyme functions as a dimer. Computer modeling of the AtOXC enzyme structure identified amino acids of predicted importance in co-factor binding and catalysis. Overall, these results suggest that AtOXC catalyzes the second step in this alternative pathway of oxalate catabolism.  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3acatabolism 3acatalytic activity 3acomputers 3acytosol 3aenzyme substrates 3amutants 3aoxalate oxidase 3aoxalates 3ayeasts1 aCheng, Ninghui1 aParis, Vincent1 aWang, Lingfei1 aWang, Jin1 aWang, Xiaoqiang1 aNakata, Paul A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6331-97000 tInternational journal of molecular sciences.g2021 Mar. 23, v. 22, no. 6 p.3266-wJournal:jnl4060978x1422-00677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms220632663Available from publisher's Web site  aVersion of Record  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139100001500148245006200163500002400225520100000249650002001249650001701269650001501286650001301301650001601314650002201330650002001352650001801372650001201390650000901402651001801411700001601429700001401445773009101459852000901550856011101559930003301670945002501703946000901728961001301737655001201750IND4396496720221119080859.0071022e19980728xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439649672DNAL7 a10113/58512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ120 0aD5001 aCote, G.L.10aBacteria and enzymes for production of alternan fragments  aIncludes references  aA new enzyme, alternanase, which is effective for the endo-hydrolytic cleavage of alternan, producing a thinned composition of low molecular weight fractions which exhibit reduced viscosity and increased solubility relative to native alternan, is described.

Survival, growth, and carcass traits of F1 lambs  ap. 3144-3153.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives of this study were to estimate effects of sire breed (Dorset, Finnsheep, Romanov, Texel, and Montadale), and dam breed (Composite III and Northwestern whiteface) on survival, growth, carcass, and composition traits of F1 lambs. Effects of mating season (August, October, and December) were estimated for survival and growth traits. Data were collected on 4,320 F1 lambs sired by 102 purebred rams over 3 yr. Birth weight was recorded on all lambs, and subsequent BW were adjusted to 56 (weaning), 70, and 140 d of age (n = 3,713, 3,654, and 3,579 observations, respectively). Survival of dam-reared progeny (n = 4,065) to weaning was recorded. Each year, wethers from October matings were slaughtered in three groups at 25, 29, and 33 wk of age to obtain carcass data (n = 546). In addition to standard carcass traits, resistive impedance measurements were recorded on the warm carcass to predict lean mass. Dam breed (P = 0.37) did not influence lamb survival to weaning, but sire breed (P < 0.05) was important. Romanov-sired lambs excelled in survival rate to weaning (94.1%), followed by Finnsheep (93.0%), Texel (90.7%), Dorset (90.0%), and Montadale (89.1%) sired progeny. Lower (P < 0.01) postweaning growth rate was observed for Texel (267 g/d) and Finnsheep (272 g/d) sired progeny than for Dorset (285 g/d), Montadale (282 g/d), and Romanov (278 g/d) sired progeny. Sire breed and dam breed were generally significant for most carcass traits. Breed differences in distribution of carcass fat and carcass shape were detected; however, carcass composition was similar for all sire breeds when compared at a constant carcass weight. When evaluated at a constant 12th-rib fat depth, carcasses of lambs from Finnsheep, Romanov, and Texel sires produced 1 to 1.5 kg less (P < 0.001) predicted lean mass per lamb than carcasses of lambs from Dorset and Montadale sires. These experimental results provide information about the direct breed effects for survival, growth, and carcass traits of these breeds and their potential use in crossbreeding systems. 3asires 3acarcass characteristics 3aseasonal variation 3alambs 3apaternal effect 3aweanlings 3aRomanov 3aovine carcasses 3aDorset (sheep breed) 3abreeding season 3amaternal effect 3aTexel 3aFinnsheep 3amortality 3abreed differences 3aanimal growth 3alamb meat 3adams (mothers) 3awethers 3acarcass composition 3abirth weight 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxgenetics 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aFemale 2aLongevityxgenetics 2aMale 2aReproduction 2aSeasons 2aSheepxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSurvival Rate 2aWeaning 0alamb carcasses 0aMontadale (sheep) 0asheep breeds1 aLeymaster, K.A.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Nov., v.  82, no.  11 p.3144-3153wJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/347423Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091014b20091106c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/01/23  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03439naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024003000117024002500147024004000172024002300212040001800235100002100253245011900274520179200393650002002185650002302205650001102228650001802239650001102257650001002268650001502278650001502293650001102308650001502319650001502334650001502349650001702364650002202381650002002403650003702423651001502460700001302475700001502488700002302503700001702526700001802543700002202561700002402583700005802607773011602665856008002781961001502861852000902876655001202885IND60748213520221118021945.0210822e20211211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074821352DNAL7 a10113/74821352hdl7 a10.1128/AEM.02345-202doi7 a4344542aris_accn_no7 a2030-12210-002-00D2aris_project_no7 a3825552seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWipf, Heidi M-L.10aAgricultural Soil Management Practices Differentially Shape the Bacterial and Fungal Microbiome of Sorghum bicolor  aSoils play important roles in biological productivity. While past work suggests that microbes affect soil health and respond to agricultural practices, it is not well known how soil management shapes crop host microbiomes. To elucidate the impact of management on microbial composition and function in the sorghum microbiome, we performed 16S rRNA gene and ITS2 amplicon sequencing and metatranscriptomics on soil and root samples collected from a site in California's San Joaquin Valley that is under long-term cultivation with 1) standard (ST) or no tilling (NT) and 2) cover-cropping (CC) or leaving the field fallow (NO). Our results revealed that microbial diversity, composition, and function change across tillage and cover type, with a heightened response in fungal communities, versus bacterial. Surprisingly, ST harbored greater microbial alpha diversity than NT, indicating that tillage may open niche spaces for broad colonization. Across management regimes, we observed class-level taxonomic level shifts. Additionally, we found significant functional restructuring across treatments, including enrichment for microbial lipid and carbohydrate transport and metabolism and cell motility with NT. Differences in carbon cycling were also observed, with increased prevalence of glycosyltransferase and glycoside hydrolase carbohydrate active enzyme families with CC. Lastly, treatment significantly influenced arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which had the greatest prevalence and activity under ST, suggesting that soil practices mediate known beneficial plant-microbe relationships. Collectively, our results demonstrate how agronomic practices impact critical interactions within the plant microbiome and inform future efforts to configure trait-associated microbiomes in crops. 3aSorghum bicolor 3aagricultural soils 3acarbon 3acell movement 3afallow 3agenes 3aglycosides 3ahydrolases 3alipids 3ametabolism 3amicrobiome 3aphytobiome 3asoil quality 3aspecies diversity 3atranscriptomics 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aCalifornia1 aXu, Ling1 aGao, Cheng1 aSpinner, Hannah B.1 aTaylor, John1 aLemaux, Peggy1 aMitchell, Jeffery1 aColeman-Derr, Devin1 aColeman, Devin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6282-17310 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2020 Dec. 11, v. 87, no. 5 p.e02345-wJournal:jnl7018x0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02345-203Available from publisher's Web site  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182100002200191245008800213300001600301500002400317500001500341520109800356650002101454650001801475650001101493650002301504650001801527650001701545650001201562650002101574650001201595650002001607650001701627653000901644700001901653700001601672773009801688852000901786856009201795856011201887930003301999945002502032946001302057961001302070655001202083IND4369254420221123000440.0050426s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436925442DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2004.23053.x2doi7 a10113/382442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aKlamczynski, A.P.10aPuffing and jet cooking affect solubility and molecular weight of barley β-glucans  ap. 433-441.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aFoods containing barley or oats are often marketed as healthy because of the dietary fiber (1 to 3) (1 to 4)-β-D-glucan. Processing conditions can affect the molecular structure of these dietary fibers, which in turn affect quality and properties of the products. In this study, the effect of puffing and jet cooking conditions on changes in the solubility and molecular weight of barley β-glucans was investigated. Barley flour was processed in a pasta extruder to produce particles similar in size and shape to rice. These particles were puffed at 230, 250 and 270C for 6, 8 and 10 s in a rice cake machine. Solubility and molecular weight of barley β-glucans were determined by using water extracts (25 or 65C). The amount of β-glucan extracted in water at 25C increased from 41.1% in cakes puffed at 230C/6 s to 69.7% in cakes puffed at 270C/10 s. The amount of β-glucan extracted in water at 65C increased from 63.6% in samples puffed at 230C/6 s to 99.1% in samples puffed at 270C/10 s. The molecular weight of β-glucans in barley was reduced by puffing and jet cooking treatments. 3awater solubility 3adietary fiber 3abarley 3achemical structure 3aparticle size 3abeta-glucans 3apuffing 3amolecular weight 3acooking 3acooking quality 3ahealth foods 0ajets1 aKnuckles, B.E.1 aGlenn, G.M.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2004, v.  28, no.  6 p.433-441x0145-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2004.23053.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/382443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/05/03  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04411naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001400177245022300191300001800414500002400432500001500456520244300471650002302914650002102937650001802958650001002976650001802986650002003004650001803024650001303042650001003055650002003065650002003085650001403105650001703119650001403136650001003150650001603160650001203176650003303188650000903221650002103230650000903251650004303260650001303303650004503316650001603361653002803377700001603405700001703421773010603438852000903544856011203553930003303665945002503698946001303723961001303736655001203749IND4365497220221118151414.0041110e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436549722DNAL7 a155424812pmid7 a10113/178492hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5021 aYen, J.T.10aDried skim milk as a replacement for soybean meal in growing-finishing diets: effects on growth performance, apparent total-tract nitrogen digestibility, urinary and fecal nitrogen excretion, and carcass traits in pigs  ap. 3338-3345.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aTwo trials were conducted to determine the replacement nutritive value of dried skim milk for growing-finishing pigs. In a three-phase feeding trial, 180 growing composite barrows (40.8 +/- 2.9 kg BW) were allotted to three dietary treatments. Each phase lasted 28 d. Treatment 1 comprised a basal corn-soybean meal diet supplemented with crystalline AA to contain true ileal digestible concentrations (as-fed basis) of 0.83, 0.66, and 0.52% Lys; 0.53, 0.45, and 0.40% Thr; and 0.51, 0.45, and 0.42% sulfur amino acids (SAA; Met + Cys) in Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Treatments 2 and 3 were the basal diets with 5 and 10% (as-fed basis) dried skim milk added. The three diets at each phase were formulated to have the same quantities of DE, true ileal digestible Lys, Thr, Trp, SAA, Ca, and available P. Pigs were housed 10 per pen (six pens/treatment), allowed ad libitum access to feed, and slaughtered at 121.6 +/- 9.3 kg BW. No differences were detected between pigs fed the basal diet and the dried skim milk diets or between pigs fed the 5 and 10% dried skim milk diets, respectively, in 84-d ADG (P = 0.84 or P = 0.71), ADFI (P = 0.54 or P = 0.91), and G:F (P = 0.80 or P = 0.97), in hot carcass weight (P = 0.66 or P = 0.74), 45-min postmortem LM pH (P = 0.90 or P = 0.53), 10th-rib backfat thickness (P = 0.24 or P = 0.77), LM area (P = 0.13 or P = 0.63), weights of belly (P = 0.43 or P = 0.70), trimmed wholesale cuts (P = 0.18 to 0.85 or P = 0.06 to 0.53), and ham components (P = 0.25 to 0.98 or P = 0.32 to 0.63). In the N balance trial, four littermate pairs of finishing gilts (82.9 +/- 2.0 kg BW) were assigned within pair to the basal or the 10% dried skim milk (as-fed basis) finishing diet. Daily feed allowance was 2.6x maintenance DE requirement and was given in two equal meals. Total fecal collection from eight meals and a 96-h urine collection began on d 14 when gilts weighed 92.1 +/- 2.2 kg BW. No differences were found between dietary treatments in gilt's daily N intake (P = 0.33) and the daily output of urinary urea (P = 0.88), urinary N (P = 0.97), fecal N (P = 0.69), and total manure (P = 0.62), as well as apparent total-tract N digestibility (P = 0.84) and N retention (P = 0.84). It is concluded that growing-finishing pigs fed diets containing 10% dried skim milk would have growth performance, carcass traits, and N digestibility and use similar to those fed typical corn-soybean meal diets. 3adigestible protein 3anitrogen balance 3acarcass yield 3aurine 3aswine feeding 3aprotein sources 3aprotein value 3anitrogen 3afeces 3aliveweight gain 3adried skim milk 3afinishing 3asoybean meal 3aexcretion 3aswine 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aDiet 2aFecesxchemistry 2aMilk 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolismxurine. 2aSoybeans 2aSwinexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aWeight Gain 0acarcass characteristics1 aWells, J.E.1 aMiller, D.N.0 tJournal of animal science.g2004 Nov., v.  82, no.  11 p.3338-3345wJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/178493Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080811b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/01/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03699naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182100002000191245010900211300001400320500002400334500001500358520181000373650002202183650001402205650001302219650001902232650002902251650002002280650002602300650002002326650002102346650002102367650002602388650001802414650001702432650002002449650001602469650001702485651002102502653001702523653001902540700002302559700001902582700002302601700002202624700002102646773012402667852000902791856011202800856009202912930003303004945002503037946001103062961001203073655001203085IND4398977520110319194857.0071216e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439897752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00635.x2doi7 a10113/320472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aK0011 aStrong, Ward B.10aOptimization of pheromone lure and trap design for monitoring the fir coneworm, Dioryctria abietivorella  ap. 67-77.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe major components of the sex pheromone of Dioryctria abietivorella (Groté) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were recently identified as (9Z,11E)-tetradecadien-1-yl acetate (9Z,11E-14:Ac) and a polyunsaturated, long-chain hydrocarbon (3Z,6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z)-pentacosapentaene (C25 pentaene). The optimal ratio of these components and the role of potential minor components were not fully determined in the initial short report on the pheromone's identification. We tested different ratios of the two major components loaded into grey halobutyl rubber septum dispensers, placed in sticky traps deployed in conifer breeding arboreta. The optimal ratio of the two components was 200 μg 9Z,11E-14:Ac to 2000 μg C25 pentaene. (Z)-9-Tetradecen-1-yl acetate, which had been identified previously in female pheromone gland extracts, and five other potential minor pheromone components, were tested individually as additions to the optimized two-component lure blend. None of the ternary blends were more attractive than the optimized two-component blend, at the ratios tested. Two lure adjuvants, a UV stabilizer (Sumisorb 300) and the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene, added individually or together, did not affect the attractiveness of the optimized lure blend. The Pherotech diamond sticky trap baited with the optimized lure blend was the most effective trap design among eight types of sticky trap and a bucket style trap that were tested. Traps baited with synthetic lures were as attractive as traps baited with virgin female moths. The optimized two-component lure blend in the Pherotech diamond trap is recommended for monitoring fir coneworm infestations. The availability of an effective synthetic pheromone opens the possibility for control tactics using mating disruption or attract-and-kill techniques. 3aPicea engelmannii 3aadjuvants 3atrapping 3asex pheromones 3aDioryctria abietivorella 3asex attractants 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3apheromone traps 3apheromone blends 3aequipment design 3aequipment performance 3aseed orchards 3asticky traps 3apest monitoring 3astabilizers 3aantioxidants 3aBritish Columbia 0aoptimization 0aUV stabilizers1 aMillar, Jocelyn G.1 aGrant, Gary G.1 aMoreira, Jardel A.1 aMichael Chong, J.1 aRudolph, Carline0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2008 Jan., v.  126, no.  1 p.67-77dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/320473Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00635.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090805b20091002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/08/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02738naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173072000900182072000900191072000900200100001900209245007100228300001400299500002400313500001500337520115800352650003001510650000901540650002601549650001801575650001301593650001101606650001201617650002401629650002801653651001601681653001701697653002101714653002101735700001701756700001701773773012401790852000901914856011201923856009202035930003302127945002502160946001102185961001202196655001202208IND4398977620221120055442.0071216e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439897762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00638.x2doi7 a10113/320482hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL001 0aK001 0aL6001 aPeterson, C.J.10aCharring does not affect wood infestation by subterranean termites  ap. 78-84.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aFire is an important part of forest ecosystems, as is the insect fauna.

Eastern subterranean termites, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae), fed on char from burned wood had significantly reduced numbers of protozoa compared to termites fed on pine shavings, but significantly more than starved termites. The ability of termites to find and infest wood was not affected by surface charring. In a laboratory choice test, there were no significant differences in the onset of feeding by termites between charred and non-charred wood boards. Likewise in the field, no differences were observed in the time to initial attack by termites on charred and non-charred wood boards or bolts. Because termites will likely survive fires of low to moderate intensity, in most cases, there should be no disruption of the termite contribution to forest nutrient and carbon cycles. 3aintestinal microorganisms 3awood 3asubterranean termites 3aendosymbionts 3aProtozoa 3acarbon 3aburning 3afeeding preferences 3aReticulitermes flavipes 3aMississippi 0acharred wood 0afeeding behavior 0awood consumption1 aGerard, P.D.1 aWagner, T.L.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2008 Jan., v.  126, no.  1 p.78-84dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/320483Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00638.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090805b20091002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/08/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03354naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111024002100153040001800174072000900192072000900201072000900210100001800219245010800237300001600345500002400361520126300385650002101648650001301669650001901682650002101701650001501722650002201737650002201759650002601781650001901807650002601826650001701852650001201869650002701881650002101908650003801929650001401967650001101981650003101992650002302023650003402046650000902080650002402089651001002113651001002123653002202133653002002155700001302175700001802188700001802206700001402224773012302238852000902361856011202370856009202482930003302574945002502607946001102632961001302643655001202656IND4402255820221122142059.0080302e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440225582DNAL7 a187134362pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2007.00603.x2doi7 a10113/156292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aF3001 aDuan, Wen-Jun10aPathways and Determinants of Early Spontaneous Vegetation Succession in Degraded Lowland of South China  ap. 147-156.  aIncludes references  aContinuous and prolonged human disturbances have caused severe degradation of a large portion of lowland in South China, and how to restore such degraded ecosystems becomes an increasing concern. The process and mechanisms of spontaneous succession, which plays an important role in vegetation restoration, have not been adequately examined. To identify the pathways of early spontaneous vegetation succession, 41 plots representing plant communities abandoned over different times were established and investigated. The communities and indicator species of the vegetation were classified by analyzing the important values of plant species using multivariate analyses. The results indicated that the plant species could be classified into nine plant communities representing six succession stages. The pathway and species composition also changed in the process of succession. We also measured 13 environmental variables of microtopography, soil structure and soil nutrition in each plot to examine the driving forces of succession and the vegetation-environment relationships. Our results showed that the environmental variables changed in diverse directions, and that soil bulk density, soil water capacity and soil acidity were the most important factors. 3abottomland soils 3alowlands 3asoil fertility 3asoil degradation 3avegetation 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3aecological succession 3asoil structure 3aenvironmental factors 3abulk density 3asoil pH 3awater holding capacity 3aland restoration 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEcosystem 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aSoil 2aSpecies Specificity 3aChina 0aChina 0asuccession stages 0amicrotopography1 aRen, Hai1 aFu, Sheng-Lei1 aGuo, Qin-Feng1 aWang, Jun0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2008 Feb., v.  50, no.  2 p.147-156dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/156293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2007.00603.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080602b20080704c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/30  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03004naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100001700187245005400204300001600258500002400274500001500298520127300313650001901586650001701605650001001622650001801632650002401650650002501674650002001699650001601719650001601735650003801751650002101789653001901810653001401829653001301843653002801856700001901884700001301903700001901916700001701935700001701952700002201969700001501991773011702006852000902123856011202132856008802244930003302332945002502365946001102390961001302401655001202414IND4429245720221123000546.0091127e20091215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442924572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.06.0032doi7 a10113/382482hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL2001 aYoo, Jeongmi10aMolecular characterization of duck interleukin-17  ap. 318-322.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aInterleukin-17 (IL17), belonging to the Th17 family, is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated T cells. A 1034bp cDNA encoding duck IL17 (duIL17) was cloned from Con A-activated splenic lymphocytes of ducks. The encoded protein, which is predicted to consist of 169 amino acids, has a molecular weight of 18.8kDa and includes a 29 residue NH₂-terminal signal peptide, a single potential N-linked glycosylation site, and six cysteine residues that are conserved in mammalian IL17. The duIL17 shared 84% amino acid sequence identity with the previously described chicken IL17 (chIL17), 36-47% to mammalian homologues, and open reading frame 13 of Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS13). The genomic structure of duIL17 was quite similar to its chicken and mammalian counterparts. The duIL17 mRNA expression was detected only in Con A-activated splenic lymphocytes by RT-PCR, although its expression was undetectable in a variety of normal tissues. Two mAbs against chIL17 showed cross-reactivity with duIL17 as detected by indirect ELISA and Western blot analysis. These findings indicate that the structure of IL17 is highly conserved among poultry, and two mAbs detecting common epitopes of IL17 are available for molecular and immunological studies of IL17 in birds. 3across reaction 3ainterleukins 3aducks 3aT-lymphocytes 3aopen reading frames 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3asplenocytes 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aWestern blotting 0ainterleukin-17 0acytokines 0apeptides 0amolecular sequence data1 aJang, Seung I.1 aKim, Suk1 aCho, Jae-Hyeon1 aLee, Hu-Jang1 aRhee, Man H.1 aLillehoj, Hyun S.1 aMin, Wongi0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2009 Dec. 15, v.  132, no.  2-4 p.318-322dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/382483Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.06.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/01/14  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02995naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100002000148245016600168300001600334500002400350500001500374520105800389650001001447650001801457650002401475650002601499650001901525650002301544650001201567650001201579650001101591650001101602650006201613650001201675650002601687650006301713650001001776650001201786650002801798650002901826650006501855650002901920650000901949650002601958650001401984653001101998653001502009653002202024700001302046700001802059700001602077773007402093852000902167856011102176930003302287945001302320946001102333961001302344655001202357IND2061799620221123001409.0980211e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206179962DNAL7 a94316732pmid7 a10113/19412hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeissenberg, M.14aThe effect of some Solanum steroidal alkaloids and glycoalkaloids on larvae of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta  ap. 203-209.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aEvaluation of the inhibitory effect of a series of secondary plant compounds including steroidal alkaloids and glycoalkaloids on larvae of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, was investigated.

The inhibitory effect of solamargine and tomatine, but not of solasonine, was completely abolished by addition of 1 micromole g-1 diet cholesterol and/or sitosterol. Nonetheless, synthetic cholesteryl tomatide displayed significant activity at 2 micromole g-1 diet. Parallel studies with the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, showed marked inhibitory activity of tomatine at a dietary concentration of 1 micromole g-1, whereas the other compounds did not affect sterol metabolism or larval development. An appraisal of the factors influencing the mode of action of the active steroidal glycoalkaloids is attempted. 3aseeds 3aManduca sexta 3aTribolium castaneum 3asecondary metabolites 3aglycoalkaloids 3agrowth retardation 3aSolanum 3asterols 3aleaves 3alarvae 2aAlkaloidsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aGlycosidesxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aLarva 2aManduca 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPhytosterolsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxtoxicity. 2aPlant Extractsxtoxicity 2aPupa 2aSolanaceaexchemistry 2aTribolium 0afruits 0ainhibitors 0asteroid alkaloids1 aLevy, A.1 aSvoboda, J.A.1 aIshaaya, I.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Jan., v.  47, no.  2 p.203-209x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/19413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070803b20070902c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03828naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002100119040001800140072000900158072000900167100001500176245013000191300001500321500002400336520235300360650003102713650003002744650001902774650001802793650002302811650002202834653001902856653002102875700001802896700001602914700001702930700001902947700001702966773009302983852000903076856007703085856011203162930003303274945002503307946001303332961001303345655001203358IND4365514320221118211409.0041110e20040405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436551432DNAL7 a10.1002/bit.108792doi7 a10113/164272hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aL0011 aFife, J.P.10aEvaluation of a contraction flow field on hydrodynamic damage to entomopathogenic nematodes - a biological pest control agent  ap. 96-107.  aIncludes references  aMechanized production and delivery of biological pesticides presents challenges because the biological agents must remain viable during these processes. This study evaluates the effect of flow through an abrupt contraction, where flow characteristics similar to that found within bioprocesses and spray equipment are developed, on damage to a benchmark biological pest control agent, entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs). An opposed-pistons, contraction flow device generated volumetric flow rates ranging between 8.26 cm3/s and 41.3 cm3/s. Four EPN species were evaluated: Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Heterorhabditis megidis, Steinernema carpocapsae, and Steinernema glaseri. Damage was quantified by counting living and dead EPNs. Optical and cold field emission scanning electron microscope (CFE-SEM) images provided qualitative information to describe how the damage occurred. The experimental flow field was completely described using FLUENT, a computational fluid dynamics program. Local flow parameters computed in FLUENT were compared to EPN damage. The type and extent of damage varied between EPN species. Damaged Heterorhabditis spp. generally remained whole with an internal rupture located near the center of the body, while Steinernema spp. most often broke into several pieces. The fast-transient stress field generated at the entrance to the contraction caused a momentary tensile loading and then relaxation that damaged the EPNs. At high flow rates, the tensile stresses became large enough to cause failure of the EPN structural membrane. The relative elasticity of the EPN structural membrane may explain the differences in damage observed between the species. It is speculated that the internal rupture of the Heterorhabditis spp. occurred during the processes of stretching and relaxing at the contraction entrance. Appreciable damage was observed at lower average energy dissipation rates for H. bacteriophora (1.23E + 8 W/m3), H. megidis (1.72E + 8 W/m3), and S. glaseri (2.89E + 8 W/m3) compared to S. carpocapsae (3.70E + 8 W/m3). Energy dissipation rates within an equipment component should be kept below 1E + 8 W/m3 to avoid hydrodynamic damage to EPNs. The relationship between average energy dissipation and EPN damage provides important information for future simulation efforts of actual spray equipment components. 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3abiological control agents 3ainsect control 3ahydrodynamics 3aspraying equipment 3amechanical damage 0atensile stress 0aextensional flow1 aDerksen, R.C.1 aOzkan, H.E.1 aGrewal, P.S.1 aChalmers, J.J.1 aKrause, C.R.0 tBiotechnology and bioengineering.g2004 Apr. 5, v.  86, no.  1 p.96-107x0006-35927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bit.108793Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/164273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100504b20100605c00000000  aINDdLDPe2004/12/10  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02331naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100002500193245008500218300001600303500002400319500001500343520092200358650001601280650001601296650001901312650001401331650001501345650002301360653001801383653001301401700002601414700002101440773012201461852000901583856008501592856011201677930003301789945002501822946001301847961001301860655001201873IND4406829820221118151132.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440682982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-008-1235-92doi7 a10113/178532hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX500 0aP1201 aDailey, Oliver D.

In these studies, methyl oleate was brominated in the allylic position and subsequently treated with organocuprate reagents to produce novel branched-chain derivatives (methyl, n-butyl, phenyl). Original reaction conditions afforded only the branched methyl derivatives as major products. Modification of reaction conditions (lower temperature, less organocuprate reagent) afforded predominantly the desired n-butyl and phenyl derivatives and minimized products resulting from attack on the ester functionality. Details of the syntheses, characterization (especially by NMR), and the properties of the products (with emphasis on low-temperature properties) are discussed. 3amethylation 3abromination 3acottonseed oil 3abiodiesel 3aoleic acid 3achemical structure 0amethyl oleate 0abiofuels1 aPrevost, Nicolette T.1 aStrahan, Gary D.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2008 July, v.  85, no.  7 p.647-653dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-008-1235-93Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/178533Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080811b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/08/11  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03276naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001200158245010500170300001800275500002400293500001500317520171600332650001402048650002602062650001502088650001102103650002302114650002502137650003402162650002402196650001802220650001302238650002302251650002102274650001602295650001702311653002502328653001902353700001802372700001802390700001902408700001702427773007302444852000902517856011202526930003302638945002502671946001302696961001302709655001202722IND4373445420221118200306.0050819e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437344542DNAL7 a10113/194102hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ115 0aQ5051 aBai, J.10aResponse of four apple cultivars to 1-methylcyclopropene treatment and controlled atmosphere storage  ap. 1534-1538.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aApples [Malus sylvestris (L.) Mill var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf. ('Gala', 'Delicious', 'Granny Smith' and 'Fuji')], pretreated or nontreated with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, 0.6 to 1.0 microliter.L(-1) for 18 hours at 20 degrees C), were stored in controlled atmosphere (CA, 1 to 1.5 kPa O2; 1 to 2 kPa CO2) or in regular atmosphere (RA) for up to 8 months at 1 degrees C. Firmness, titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids content (SSC), and volatile abundance were analyzed every month directly or after transfer to air at 20 degrees C for 1 week to determine effect of 1-MCP, storage atmosphere and storage time on apple quality immediately after cold storage and after simulated marketing conditions at 20 degrees C. The 1-MCP +/- CA treatments delayed ripening and prolonged storage life as indicated by delayed loss of firmness and TA in all four cultivars during storage. The 1-MCP +/- CA also slightly delayed loss of SSC for 'Gala' but had no effect on SSC levels for the other cultivars. There were differences among treatments for firmness and TA content [(1-MCP + RA) > CA] for 'Gala', 'Delicious', and 'Granny Smith' apples, but not for 'Fuji'. These differences were generally exacerbated after transfer of fruit to 20 degrees C for 1 week. A combination of 1-MCP + CA was generally best [(1-MCP + CA) > (1-MCP + RA) or CA] for maintaining 'Delicious' firmness and TA. However, the treatments that were most effective at retaining TA and firmness also retained the least volatiles. The results indicate that the efficacy of 1-MCP and CA in maintaining apple quality factors is cultivar dependent and that 1-MCP + RA may be a viable alternative to CA for optimal eating quality for some cultivars. 3acultivars 3apostharvest treatment 3ashelf life 3aapples 3avolatile compounds 3atotal soluble solids 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3aethylene production 3afruit quality 3afirmness 3atitratable acidity 3aflavor compounds 3afruit crops 3acold storage 0a1-methylcyclopropene 0asoluble solids1 aBaldwin, E.A.1 aGoodner, K.L.1 aMattheis, J.P.1 aBrecht, J.K.0 tHortScience.g2005 Aug., v.  40, no.  5 p.1534-1538x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/194103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080927b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/12/07  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02354naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100001600193245008700209300001600296520088400312650001601196650002401212650001901236650002201255650002601277650002401303650002701327650001701354650003301371650002801404650003401432650001501466700001601481700001701497773010501514852000901619856008501628856011201713930003301825945001301858961001301871655001201884IND2058360620221122213517.0970714e199706  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205836062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-997-0205-y2doi7 a10113/251192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aW000 0aJ1001 aErhan, S.Z.10aStatistical evaluation of biodegradation of news ink vehicles and ink formulations  ap. 707-712.  aSoybean oil, commercial news ink vehicles--consisting of either soy or mineral oil and petroleum resins--and United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) 100% modified soy oil-based vehicles were subjected to biodegradation.

We investigated the effects of (i) perennial grass cover versus annual cropping and (ii) type of break crop in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-based crop rotation system on surface-soil (0-10 cm) structural and organic matter properties towards the end of a decade of continuous management on an Albic Luvisol in the cold, semiarid region of northwestern Canada. Soil aggregation was at state to resist water erosion more under perennial grass (i.e. bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and red fescue (Festuca rubra L.)) than under annual cropping systems (mean-weight diameter of 2.1 and 1.6 mm under perennial and annual systems, respectively). Soil organic C was higher (44 g C kg-1 soil versus 38 g C kg-1 soil), but total soil N was lower (3.5 g N kg-1 soil versus 3.9 g N kg-1 soil) under perennial compared with annual cropping systems. There were few significant differences in soil-structural properties among the various annual cropping systems. The largest effect was greater light-fraction C and N under continuous wheat (4.0 g C kg-1 soil and 0.27 g N kg-1 soil) compared with other rotations, especially wheat-wheat-fallow (2.4 g C kg-1 soil and 0.16 g N kg-1 soil), as a result of higher residue inputs. Relationships between mean-weight diameter of water-stable aggregates and biochemical properties were strongest for soil microbial biomass C and soil organic C. Perennial grass cover exhibited greater potential to preserve soil-structural properties than no-tillage annual cropping. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3acold zones 3asoil structure 3acarbon sequestration 3aprairies 3asoil aggregates 3abulk density 3asoil microorganisms 3aTriticum aestivum 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop production 3agrasses 3acrop residues 3apermanent grasslands 3acrop rotation 3aBromus inermis 3anitrogen 3atillage 3aFestuca rubra 3asemiarid zones 3aAlberta 0asoil properties 0asurface layers 0aannual systems 0alight fractions 0aperennial systems1 aFranzluebbers, A.J.1 aAzooz, R.H.0 tSoil & tillage research.g2004 May, v.  77, no.  1 p.15-23x0167-19877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/101523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2003.10.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080220b20080301c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/02/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02064naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001900149245010000168300001300268500002400281520096900305650000901274650002101283650002401304650001801328650001401346650001801360650001401378700001801392773007701410852000901487856011201496930003301608945001301641946001101654961001301665655001201678IND2201872220221120115914.0991206e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220187222DNAL7 a10113/347332hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aX1001 aWilliams, C.B.10aPredicting empty body composition and composition of empty body weight changes in mature cattle  ap. 1-25.  aIncludes references  aData on empty body chemical composition of 18 breeds or breed crosses of non-lactating non-pregnant mature cows were used to estimate a standard reference empty body weight (SREBW) for each breed. The SREBW was defined as the empty body weight at skeletal maturity that contained 25% fat. Relationship between empty body fat percentage (EBFP) and empty body weight as a fraction of SREBW (uE) was, EBFP = -15(.)7 + 40(.)7 *uE(r2 = 0(.)77). This relationship was not significantly different among breeds. An evaluation with chemical composition data of five breeds of mature non-lactating cows showed no significant difference in the relationship between EBFP and UK. Data from five experiments showed that cows that lose empty body weight in early lactation had a leaner empty body composition in mid-lactation compared with non-lactating cows at the same value of UK. Equations were formulated to adjust predictions of body composition changes for lactating cows. 3acows 3abody composition 3acarcass composition 3acattle breeds 3aequations 3alinear models 3alactation1 aJenkins, T.G.0 tAgricultural systems.g1997 Jan., v.  53, no.  1 p.1-25x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/347333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091014b20091106c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02836naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003600134024002500170024004000195024002300235040001800258100002400276245011900300520100900419650002001428650001101448650001601459650001501475650002001490650001001510650001901520650001401539650001801553650002201571650002401593650002601617700002301643700002001666700002301686700002001709700001701729700002201746700001801768700002101786700002301807700001801830700002201848700002001870700002001890700002701910700001601937700005601953700002602009773007702035856008602112961001502198852000902213655001202222IND60722289420221214230229.0210101e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072228942DNAL7 a10113/72228942hdl7 a3704882aris7 a10.1038/s41467-020-18890-y2doi7 a4343242aris_accn_no7 a3096-21000-021-00D2aris_project_no7 a3704882seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoursarebani, Naser10aCOMPOSITUM 1 contributes to the architectural simplification of barley inflorescence via meristem identity signals  aGrasses have varying inflorescence shapes; however, little is known about the genetic mechanisms specifying such shapes among tribes. We identified the grass-specific TCP transcription factor COMPOSITUM1 (COM1) expressed in inflorescence meristematic boundaries of different grasses. COM1 specifies "branch-inhibition" in Triticeae-barley versus "branch-formation" in non-Triticeae grasses. Analyses of cell size, cell walls and transcripts revealed barley COM1 regulates cell growth, affecting cell wall properties and signaling specifically in meristematic boundaries to establish identity of adjacent meristems. COM1 acts upstream of the boundary gene Liguleless1, and confers meristem identity independent of the COM2 pathway. Furthermore, COM1 is subject to purifying natural selection, thereby contributing to specification of the "spike" inflorescence shape.

Expanded perlite has long been used as an amendment in container mediums to provide air space to container substrates without adding to bulk density or affecting substrate pH and EC. However, due to increased restrictions on the harvesting of peat, as well as fluctuations in fuel prices necessary for shipping, the future availability of peat is a largely unknown factor in greenhouse production. Additionally, growers consider perlite to be a general nuisance due to the lung and eye irritation problems. Because of these problems, researchers have focused on identifying and evaluating possible alternatives to standard substrates. These studies evaluated three possible substrate alternatives for use in greenhouse production, including fresh sweetgum (SG), hickory (H), and eastern redcedar (RC), in addition to WholeTree (WT) substrate. Three greenhouse annual crops (petunia, impatiens, and vinca) were planted in varying ratios of these species mixed with peat. Plants grown with SG and H as amendments did not perform as well as a traditional peat:perlite mix with respect to flower number, growth indices, and plant dry weight. However, plants grown in RC tended to be equivalent to those grown in a traditional mix. Data showed that greenhouse producers could amend their standard greenhouse substrate with up to 50% eastern redcedar with little to no differences in plant growth. 3aannuals 3agreenhouse production 3atrees 3aperlite 3apeat 3asoil amendments 3abulk density 3apH 3aCarya 3aPetunia 3aImpatiens 3aVinca 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aJuniperus virginiana1 aGilliam, Charles H.1 aFain, Glenn B.1 aTorbert, H.

Evaluations of the e.s.r. spectra of irradiated methyl tetra-O-acetyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (2), methyl tetra-O-[(p-ethoxycarbonyl)benzoyl]-α-D-glucopyranoside (3), methyl tetra-O-(p-methoxybenzoyl)-α-D-glucopyranoside (4), methyl tetra-O-(p-nitrobenzoyl)-α-D-glucopyranoside (5), methyl tetra-O-(ochlorobenzoyl)-α-D-glucopyranoside (6), methyl tetra-O-p-tolylsulfonyl-β-D -glucopyranoside (7), methyl tetra-O-nicotinoyl-α-D -glucopyranoside (8), and methyl tetra-O-(phenylcarbamoyl)-α-D-glucopyranoside (9) contained mainly one type of stable free-radical, together with some secondary radical in low concentration. The e.s.r. spectrum of compound 1 consisted of one doublet and one singlet; this observation was explained by assuming that the free electron position is at C-1, so that the cleavage of the C-1--O glycosidic bond would give rise to the doublet, and the dehydrogenation of the C-1--H bond would give rise to the singlet. For most of the substituted D-glucopyranosides studied, irradiation gave singlet spectra which were explained by assuming the radical site to be C-1 (by the dehydrogenation of the C-1--H bond). The aromatic groups present in the substituted D-glucopyranosides were known to protect the glycosides from radiation damage1. In the aromatically substituted D-glucopyranosides, no reducing power was measurable, even when the compounds were irradiated to dosages as high as 5.2 x 10²¹ eV/g; this was additional evidence that no cleavage of the C-1--O glycosidic bond occurs during irradiation of these compounds. The absence of hyperfine splitting of the free electron at C-1 with H-2 was explained by a change in the conformation of the molecule after H-1 had been cleaved. Displacement of the hydrogen atoms would then occur to remove any deformation of the ring caused thereby; this would remove H-2 from the vicinity of the unpaired electron at C-1. No thermally induced free-radicals could be detected in these compounds, unless they were heated to charring. 3adeformation 3aglycosidic linkages 3adietary carbohydrate 3aglucosides 3aoxidative stability 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahydrogen bonding 3afood irradiation 3agamma radiation 0aglycosides1 aArthur, Jett C.

This exo-anomeric effect lengthens the C-1-O-5 bond, shortens the exocyclic C-1-O bond, and stabilizes the gauche conformers by about 4 kcal/mol over the anti. In the anti orientation, hyperconjugative interaction of the OR group at C-1 with other appropriately oriented σ * orbitals increases, but the geometric and energetic consequences are less marked. Solvation effects reduce the energetic stabilization associated with the exo-anomeric effect in the tetrahydropyrans. This derives from a combination of changes in the overall electrostatics and also from decreased accessibility of the hydrophilic groups in the gauche conformers. For glucose or glucosides, instead of the simple tetrahydropyran model systems, the interactions of the exocyclic OR group at C-1 with the hydroxy group at C-2 can significantly affect these hyperconjugative delocalizations. In the glucose and glucoside systems, solvation effects oppose the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. MM3(94) force field calculations show systematic deviations in the relative energies and structures of the various model systems with respect to the more reliable HF/cc-pVDZ predictions. 3ahydrophilic interactions 3aglycosidic linkages 3aenergy 3acrystal structure 3aglucose 3adietary carbohydrate 3adissociation 3aglucosides 3ahydrogen bonding 3ashape 3amolecular conformation 3aoxygen 0achemical structure1 aTruhlar, Donald G.1 aFrench, Alfred D.0 tCarbohydrate research.g1997 Feb. 20, v.  298, no.  1-2 p.1-147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/363723Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0008-6215(96)00297-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20091205b20100101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/12/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02870naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002100124040001800145072000900163100002600172245008400198300001800282500002400300500001500324520113400339650001801473650001601491650001201507650001101519650001801530650001401548650001201562650002601574650002501600650003401625650001801659650001901677650002701696650001501723653001801738653003301756653002301789700002201812700002001834700001801854700002001872773012701892852000902019856008202028856011202110930003302222945002502255946001102280961001302291655001202304IND4460707120221120181304.0110805e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446070712DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.023762-02doi7 a10113/499702hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3501 aWhitehead, Terence R.10aPeptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov., isolated from a swine-manure storage pit  ap. 1875-1879.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUsing a polyphasic approach, a taxonomic study was performed on seven strains of an unknown Gram-reaction-positive, non-spore-forming, obligately anaerobic coccus-shaped bacterium, isolated from a swine-manure storage pit. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that all seven isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown lineage within the clostridial rRNA XI cluster of organisms. Pairwise analysis demonstrated that the novel organism was most closely related to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius CCUG 7835T and Peptostreptococcus stomatis CCUG 51858T with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 95.5 and 93.0 %, respectively. The peptidoglycan type of the cell wall was determined to be A4α l-Lys–d-Asp and glucose, xylose and traces of mannose were detected as the cell–wall sugars. Based on biochemical, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic evidence the unknown bacterium represents a new species of the genus Peptostreptococcus, for which the name Peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov, is proposed. The type strain is RT-10B(T) ( = CCUG 58235(T) = NRRL B-59380(T) = DSM 23041(T)). 3aribosomal RNA 3anew species 3aglucose 3axylose 3achemotaxonomy 3aphylogeny 3amannose 3amolecular systematics 3acell wall components 3aPeptostreptococcus anaerobius 3apeptic ulcers 3amanure storage 3aGram-positive bacteria 3apig manure 0apeptidoglycan 0aPeptostreptococcus russellii 0aPeptostreptococcus1 aCotta, Michael A.1 aFalsen, Enevold1 aMoore, Edward1 aLawson, Paul A.0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2011 Aug., v.  61, no.  8 p.1875-1879x1466-50267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.023762-03Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/499703Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110816b20110902c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/08/15  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03589naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002300149245012300172300001400295500005500309500002400364520204900388650002102437650001502458650000902473650001402482650001602496650003102512650001002543650002402553650001402577650002102591650001402612650001602626651001402642651001002656653001302666653002002679700002202699700002102721700002202742773008802764852000902852856011202861930003302973945002503006946001303031961001503044655001203059IND4432244020221120210733.0100204s2004    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443224402DNAL7 a10113/398792hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF820 0aP0501 aPipas, Patricia A.10aEvaluation of different rice baits and chemicals to improve efficacy of 2% DRC-1339 to reduce blackbird damage to rice  ap. 77-82.  aMeeting held March 1-4, 2004, Visalia, California.  aIncludes references  aBlackbird damage to sprouting rice can be locally severe and costs Louisiana growers an estimated $4 million/year and Texas growers $4.4 million/year. DRC-1339 blackbird baiting programs probably will continue until available alternative control techniques (i.e., repellents) become available. We conducted 3 studies to evaluate different rice baits and chemicals to improve efficacy of DRC-1339 for use at staging areas. During the first study, individually caged red-winged blackbirds preferred untreated medium grain brown rice over long grain brown rice, rough rice, or rough rice soaked with sodium bisulfite. Of birds offered only medium (control), long, rough, and rough rice soaked with sodium bisulfite treated with 2% DRC-1339 diluted 1:25 with untreated carrier (medium, long, or rough rice), 90 to 100% died within 48 hrs. During the second study, individually caged red-winged blackbirds preferred untreated rice over rice treated with Harvest Guard or ethyl cellulose. Birds were offered only medium brown rice (control), Harvest Guard, or ethyl cellulose-treated medium brown rice treated with 2% DRC-1339 diluted 1 :25 with untreated medium grain brown rice. With the medium grain brown rice (field bait), 100% mortality was observed within 48 hrs. With the Harvest Guard and ethyl cellulose treatments, 580% mortality was observed. The third study was an aviary test to determine if aging the chemical baits (sodium bisulfite, Harvest Guard, ethyl cellulose) for 3 days in Louisiana would affect mortality. Mortality with the fresh field and sodium bisulfite baits were 100%. We did not achieve 280% mortality with either the fresh Harvest Guard or ethyl cellulose bait. Mortality with the aged sodium bisulfite bait was 50%. None of the other aged baits produced >l0% mortality. Degradation occurred with all the aged baits but occurred the least with the sodium bisulfite treatment. Future research will look at possibly combining sodium bisulfite with W protection to further reduce the degradation of DRC-1339 in the field. 3avertebrate pests 3awild birds 3arice 3asprouting 3acrop damage 3awildlife damage management 3abaits 3aAgelaius phoeniceus 3avarieties 3asodium bisulfite 3amortality 3adegradation 3aLouisiana 3aTexas 0aDRC-1339 0aethyl cellulose1 aCummings, John L.1 aHurley, Jerry C.1 aSheffer, Karen H.0 tProceedings - Vertebrate Pest Conference.g2004, , no.  21 p.77-82x0507-67737nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/398793Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100330b20100403c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/03/05  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03931naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002100147040001800168072001700186100002200203245010400225300001600329500002400345500001500369520158100384650002201965650000901987650001101996650001602007650002302023650002302046650001702069650002602086650003802112650001002150650003402160650001502194650002002209650001902229650002502248650002202273650001202295650004602307650002302353650005202376650001102428650006102439650002802500650001102528650002002539650001302559650001402572650002202586653003202608653001302640653005402653700001902707700002102726700001902747773014002766852000902906856008602915856011203001930003303113945002503146946001303171961001303184655001203197IND4420415220221121174359.0090514e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442041522DNAL7 a194070872pmid7 a10.1177/1040638709021003072doi7 a10113/311062hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRidpath, Julia F.10aStability of Bovine viral diarrhea virus antigen in ear punch samples collected from bovine fetuses  ap. 346-349.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aFourteen first-calf heifers were tested free of antibodies against Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) by serum neutralization and free of BVDV by polymerase chain reaction. Twelve were exposed to BVDV-1b strain CA0401186a at 84-86 days of gestation, and 2 were exposed to mock inoculum and served as negative controls. Fetuses were harvested by cesarean section at 115-117 days of gestation. The 12 fetuses removed from the BVDV-exposed heifers were BVDV positive based on virus isolation from kidney, thymus, cerebellum, and spleen. It can be assumed that these fetuses would have developed into persistently infected calves had they been allowed to go to term. Virus was not isolated from the fetuses of control animals. Ear punch samples were collected from all fetuses at time of harvest. Antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACE), using a commercial kit, was performed on ear punch samples that were frozen within 5 hr of collection and stored at -20°C until tested, tested after storage for 7 days at room temperature (18-25°C), or tested after storage for 7 days at 37°C. Samples stored for 7 days at room temperature or 37°C lost an average of 34% of their starting weight. All samples from BVDV isolation-positive fetuses tested positive by ACE, whereas samples from nonexposed fetuses tested negative, regardless of storage conditions. These results suggest that ACE testing of skin samples collected from aborted fetuses and stillborn calves found in the field may represent a practical surveillance method for BVDV-induced reproductive disease. 3adisease detection 3aears 3acattle 3afetal death 3aantibody detection 3aabortion (animals) 3astorage time 3abovine viral diarrhea 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afetus 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3askin tests 3astorage quality 3aviral antigens 3adisease surveillance 3adisease diagnosis 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Viralxisolation & purification 2aBiopsyxveterinary 2aBovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Diseasexvirology 2aCattle 2aDiarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viralxisolation & purification 2aEar Cartilagexvirology 2aFemale 2aFetusxvirology 2aFreezing 2aPregnancy 2aSpecimen Handling 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus 0aetiology 0aantigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay1 aChiang, Yu-Wei1 aWaldbillig, Jill1 aNeill, John D.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g2009 May, v. 21, no. 3 p.346-349dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638709021003073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/311063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090711b20090801c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/06/11  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02212naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100002300187245011400210300001600324500002400340520052100364650002500885650001400910650002800924650001900952650001800971650001300989650001601002650002201018650002201040650001701062650002401079653002001103653001801123700002201141700002001163700002201183700001901205700002501224700002901249700002201278773006701300852000901367856011201376856008801488930003301576945002501609946001101634961001301645655001201658IND4429148120221119031308.0091123e19900919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442914812DNAL7 a10.1016/0008-6215(90)80146-T2doi7 a10113/363762hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aQ1001 aFleet, George W.J.10aSynthesis of the enantiomers of 6-epicastanospermine and 1,6-diepicastanospermine from D- and L-gulbnolactone  ap. 269-282.  aIncludes references  aThe synthesis of the enantiomers of 6-epicastanospermine and of 1,6-diepicastanospermine from the enantiomeric gulonolactones is reported and the structure of the former is established as (1S,6R,7R,8R,8aR)-1,6,7,8-tetrahydroxyoctahydroindolizine.

One area of global change that has not been fully addressed is the effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on agriculture production inputs. Elevated CO2 concentration alterations of plant growth and C:N ratios may modify C and N cycling in soil and N fertility. This study was conducted to examine the effects of legume, soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and non-legume, grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) carbon dioxide-enriched agro-ecosystems on N soil fertility in a Blanton loamy sand (loamy siliceous, thermic, Grossarenic Paleudults). The study was a split-plot design replicated three times with crop species (soybean and grain sorghum) as the main plots and CO2 concentration (ambient and twice ambient) as subplots using open top field chambers. Fertilizer application was made with 15N-depleted NH4NO3 to act as a fertilizer tracer. Elevated CO2 increased total biomass production in all 3 years of both grain sorghum (average 30%) and soybean (average 40%). With soybean, while no impact on the plant C:N ratio was observed, the total N content was greatly increased (average 29%) due to increased atmospheric N2 fixation with elevated CO2 concentration. With grain sorghum, the total N uptake was not affected, but the C:N ratio was markedly increased (average 31%) by elevated CO2. No impact of elevated CO2 level was observed for fertilizer N in grain sorghum. The results from this study indicated that while elevated CO2 may enhance crop production and change N status in plant tissue, changes to soil N fertilizer application practices may not be needed. 3aplant tissues 3acarbon dioxide 3agreenhouse gases 3aGlycine max 3acrop production 3aplant growth 3aisotope labeling 3anitrogen 3aloamy sand soils 3afertilizer application 3agrain sorghum 3asoybeans 3anutrient uptake 3adry matter accumulation 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3asoil fertility 3aSorghum bicolor 3anitrogen fertilizers 0alegumes1 aPrior, S.A.1 aRogers, H.H.1 aRunion, G.B.0 tField crops research.g2004 June 10, v.  88, no.  1 p.57-67x0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/156213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2003.11.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080602b20080704c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/28  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03989naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152100001700170245008800187300001400275500002400289500001500313520218900328650002602517650001502543650002302558650002102581650002202602650002102624650002402645650001302669650001602682650002302698650001802721650002002739650002302759650001102782650001202793650001802805650002502823650001302848650000902861650001702870650002002887650001302907651001302920653001802933700001702951700001802968700001802986773007903004852000903083856011203092856008903204930003303293945001303326946001103339961001303350655001203363IND2151400420221118151411.0980813e19980508ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND215140042DNAL7 a10.1016/S0378-4290(97)00109-32doi7 a10113/178442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamoah, C.F.10aLong-term nitrogen use and nitrogen-removal index in continuous crops and rotations  ap. 15-27.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aCropping systems, nitrogen (N) fertilizer levels, and climate largely dictate patterns of N use and influence problems arising from N fertilization. Nitrogen use was assessed in cropping systems with a nitrogen removal-index (NRI), defined as the ratio of N removed in the grain to total N supply including that from N fixation by legumes grown in rotation. Results are reported from analyses of NRIs of cropping systems that comprised a 12-yr continuous and sequential growing of maize [Zea mays L.], soybean [Glycine max. (L.) Merr.], sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and oat/clover [Avena sativa (L.)/80% Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam., 20% Trifolium pratense] in eastern Nebraska. Rotations involving maize or sorghum had higher NRIs than continuous cereals at 0 N application levels. Increasing N rates reduced NRI and resulted in an increase of residual nitrate in all but the continuous soybean system. Also, NRI was highest in continuous soybean, lower in continuous maize, and lowest in continuous sorghum. Rotations and lower N rates both contributed to higher NRI and lower soil residual nitrate. Biological windows that comprised the cumulative number of days in the entire year when soil is moist and temperature above a specific threshold correlated positively and significantly with NRI, whereas NRI and August temperature were negatively related. Between 43 and 87% of variability of NRI in maize and soybean systems was attributed to August temperature plus August precipitation index. Biological window (moist soil, temperature above 5°C ) plus May temperature explained up to 76% of variability of NRI of maize and soybean. Nitrogen removal index for sorghum was unrelated to weather variables. Estimated additions to the soil organic N reserve from the return of crop residues averaged between 16 and 80 kg ha-1 yr-1 with higher levels from sorghum and from all treatments with high levels of N fertilizer. Crop rotations generally increased the N-removal index, reduced the year-to-year variability in N-removal-index, and at 0 N-application rate, increased the return of N in residue to the soil N pool, compared to continuous cropping of single species. 3aMelilotus officinalis 3acrop yield 3aseasonal variation 3aapplication rate 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen content 3acontinuous cropping 3aZea mays 3aGlycine max 3asoil water content 3acrop residues 3aair temperature 3aTrifolium pratense 3agrains 3abiomass 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen 3arain 3aAvena sativa 3aSorghum bicolor 3anitrates 3aNebraska 0aprecipitation1 aVarvel, G.E.1 aWaltman, W.J.1 aFrancis, C.A.0 tField crops research.g1998 May 8, v.  57, no.  1 p.15-27x0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/178443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4290(97)00109-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20080811b20080905c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03396naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003600134024002500170024004100195024002300236040001800259100002000277245011500297300001400412520147100426650002101897650001701918650001101935650002001946650002101966650002001987650001202007650001302019650002602032650001502058650001602073650001502089651001302104700002002117700002002137700006602157700001502223700001602238700002002254700001802274700002602292700001302318700001702331700002002348700001802368700001802386700001402404700002502418700001602443700001802459700002002477700002002497700001802517773008302535856008602618961000902704852000902713655001202722IND60770936220221214223502.0220321e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077093622DNAL7 a10113/77093622hdl7 a3733252aris7 a10.1038/s41396-021-00916-y2doi7 a4323722aris_accn_no7 a2034-13000-012-000D2aris_project_no7 a3733252seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBates, Colin T.10aConversion of marginal land into switchgrass conditionally accrues soil carbon and reduces methane consumption  ap. 10-25.  aSwitchgrass can be cultivated on soils with low nutrient contents, and its rooting depth, of up to 2 m, has brought attention to the crop with a great potential to sequester soil carbon (C). However, to fully evaluate the sustainability of switchgrass-based biofuel production, it is crucial to understand the impacts of switchgrass establishment and land conversion on biotic/abiotic characteristics of various soils. Here, we characterized the ecosystem-scale consequences of switchgrass at two 'Dust Bowl' remnant field sites (designated SL and CL) in Oklahoma, which are low in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrient availability, C content, and have a high erosion history. Paired plots at each site, including a control fallow plot and a plot cultivated with switchgrass, were assessed by profiling (i) physicochemical soil characteristics, (ii) the biodiversity of prokaryotic communities, and (iii) greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, CH4, and N2O). Switchgrass significantly increased soil C at the SL site and reduced microbial diversity at the CL site. Strikingly, switchgrass significantly reduced the CH4 consumption by an estimated 39% and 47% for the SL and CL sites, respectively; implying carbon balance considerations may need to be accounted for to evaluate the sustainability of switchgrass cultivation fully. Together, our results suggest that site selection by soil type is a crucial factor in improving soil C stocks and mitigating GHG fluxes. 3aPanicum virgatum 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gases 3aland use change 3amethane 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aphosphorus 3asoil carbon 3asoil types 3aOklahoma1 aEscalas, Arthur1 aKuang, Jialiang1 aHale, Lauren Elizabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2574-22251 aWang, Yuan1 aHerman, Don1 aNuccio, Erin E.1 aWan, Xiaoling1 aBhattacharyya, Amrita1 aFu, Ying1 aTian, Renmao1 aWang, Gangsheng1 aNing, Daliang1 aYang, Yunfeng1 aWu, Liyou1 aPett-Ridge, Jennifer1 aSaha, Malay1 aCraven, Kelly1 aBrodie, Eoin L.1 aFirestone, Mary1 aZhou, Jizhong0 tISME journal.g2021 July 1, v. 16 p.10-25wJournal:jnl4637647x1751-73627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-021-00916-y3Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159100001800168245013700186300001600323500002400339500001500363520148100378650001701859650002301876650001101899650001501910650001201925650001401937650000901951650002301960650001501983650002401998650001802022650001402040650001802054650001902072650002302091650002202114650002102136650001802157650003702175650003502212650002802247650001402275650002202289650001902311650002402330650001102354650002302365650007102388650002902459653001202488653001502500653001402515700001802529700001702547700001702564773009902581852000902680856011202689930003302801945002502834946001302859961001302872655001202885IND4370331020221123000538.0050519e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437033102DNAL7 a158957202pmid7 a10113/382412hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aX3801 aSolomon, E.B.10aBiofilm formation, cellulose production, and curli biosynthesis by Salmonella originating from produce, animal, and clinical sources  ap. 906-912.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe ability of 71 strains of Salmonella enterica originating from produce, meat, or clinical sources to form biofilms was investigated. A crystal violet binding assay demonstrated no significant differences in biofilm formation by isolates from any source when tested in any of the following three media: Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 2% glucose, tryptic soy broth (TSB), or 1/20th-strength TSB. Incubation was overnight at 30 degrees C under static conditions. Curli production and cellulose production were monitored by assessing morphotypes on Luria-Bertani agar without salt containing Congo red and by assessing fluorescence on Luria-Bertani agar containing calcofluor, respectively. One hundred percent of the clinical isolates exhibited curli biosynthesis, and 73% demonstrated cellulose production. All meat-related isolates formed curli, and 84% produced cellulose. A total of 80% of produce-related isolates produced curli, but only 52% produced cellulose. Crystal violet binding was not statistically different between isolates representing the three morphotypes when grown in TSB; however, significant differences were observed when strains were cultured in the two other media tested. These data demonstrate that the ability to form biofilms is not dependent on the source of the test isolate and suggest a relationship between crystal violet binding and morphotype, with curli- and cellulose-deficient isolates being least effective in biofilm formation. 3abiosynthesis 3aanimal-based foods 3ahumans 3aSalmonella 3abiofilm 3aserotypes 3ameat 3afood contamination 3aG-proteins 3asignal transduction 3amorphogenesis 3acellulose 3asalmonellosis 3afood pathogens 3abacterial proteins 3aplant-based foods 3acrystal proteins 3aculture media 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aCellulosexbiosynthesis 2aCongo Red 2aFood Microbiology 2aGentian Violet 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aSalmonella entericaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aVegetablesxmicrobiology 0aproduce 0amorphotype 0aisolation1 aNiemira, B.A.1 aSapers, G.M.1 aAnnous, B.A.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 May, v.  68, no.  5 p.906-912wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/382413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/06/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04174naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181072000900190072000900199100001500208245021000223300001600433500002400449520183800473650001602311650001602327650001602343650002902359650003102388650001602419650001302435650002502448650003002473650001602503650001502519650001902534650001602553650002002569650001402589650002102603650001502624650002302639650001802662650002802680650001602708650001202724650003002736650001302766650002402779650000902803650001102812650003802823650002902861650002402890650004302914700001802957700001702975700001702992700001803009773010303027852000903130856008103139856011203220930003303332945002503365946001303390961001303403655001203416IND4435220620221119092209.0100409e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443522062DNAL7 a203718422pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-006152doi7 a10113/465382hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL500 0aL8101 aPark, S.W.10aInfluence of supplemental dietary poultry fat, phytase, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the performance of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum  ap. 910-916.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of 2 levels of supplemental dietary poultry fat (PF) and the combination of PF, phytase (PHY), and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (D₃) on the performance of commercial layers inoculated with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) were investigated in 2 trials. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 (before lay) and 22 (early in lay) wk and dietary treatments [basal control diet (BCD), BCD with 0.75% supplemental PF, BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF, and BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF, 0.013% PHY, and 0.025% D₃] were initiated at 20 wk of age. Hen BW, egg weight, and egg production (EP) were determined every 4 wk between 24 and 58 wk of age. Feed consumption (FC) and feed conversion were determined in 4-wk intervals beginning on wk 25 and ending on wk 58, and total mortality and mean EP were determined over the entire 24 to 58-wk period. The addition of 0.75 and 1.50% PF increased BW at wk 48 and 58, respectively, and supplemental PF at the 1.50% level increased the BW of hens that had been inoculated (sham or FMG) on wk 22 and reduced the FC of hens inoculated on wk 12. Feed conversion was decreased in the 25 to 28- and 57 to 58-wk age periods and increased in the 45 to 48-wk age periods by an FMG inoculation. In birds inoculated at 22 wk of age, FMG increased egg weight. Although EP was reduced at wk 24 and was increased at wk 58 by FMG, total EP was not affected. In conclusion, an inoculation of FMG at either 12 or 22 wk of age can result in a relative shift in EP from the early to late stage of lay without affecting total EP, and although the BW and FC responses of hens to added dietary PF were influenced by their age and the age of inoculation, use of the supplemental combination of PHY and D₃ had no additional effect on performance when provided in conjunction with 1.50% PF. 3alaying hens 3adietary fat 3ahen feeding 3aMycoplasma gallisepticum 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3avaccination 3aphytases 3aanimal fats and oils 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3abody weight 3aegg weight 3aegg production 3afeed intake 3afeed conversion 3amortality 3afeed supplements 3aanimal age 3atemporal variation 3alive vaccines 2a6-Phytasexpharmacology 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCalcifediolxpharmacology 2aChickens 2aDietary Supplements 2aEggs 2aFemale 2aMycoplasma Infectionsxveterinary 2aMycoplasma gallisepticum 2aMycoplasma synoviae 2aOvipositionxdrug effectsxphysiology.1 aBranton, S.L.1 aGerard, P.D.1 aWomack, S.K.1 aPeebles, E.D.0 tPoultry science.g2010 May, v.  89, no.  5 p.910-916dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-006153Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/465383Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101221b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02503naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162100001500171245010000186300001600286500002400302500001500326520101800341650004101359650002901400650001001429650001701439650001301456650001601469650002501485650001401510653002401524653002101548700001601569700001501585700001901600700001601619700001101635773007901646852000901725856011201734856008101846930003301927945002501960946001101985961001301996655001202009IND4372145320221123013907.0050711e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437214532DNAL7 a10.1099/vir.0.80707-02doi7 a10113/382322hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aTaus, N.S.10aExperimental infection of sheep with ovine herpesvirus 2 via aerosolization of nasal secretions  ap. 575-579.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aOvine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) is the causative agent of sheep-associated malignant catarrhal fever in clinically susceptible ruminants, including cattle, bison and deer. Studies of OvHV-2 have been hampered by the lack of an in vitro propagation system. Here, the use of nasal secretions collected from OvHV-2-infected sheep experiencing intense virus shedding episodes as a source of infectious virus for experimental animal infections was examined. OvHV-2 uninfected sheep were nebulized with nasal secretions containing approximately 10(8) to 10(1) copies of OvHV-2 DNA. The time to detectable viral DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes (7-12 days post-infection) and virus-specific antibody in plasma (9-32 days post-infection) varied with the dose of inocula administered. Here, the use of nasal secretions as a source of infectious OvHV-2 was defined and the minimum infectious dose of a pool of nasal secretions that can be used in further studies of viral pathogenesis and vaccine development was determined. 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aOvine gammaherpesvirus 2 3asheep 3anasal cavity 3aaerosols 3abody fluids 3adisease transmission 3ainfection 0aOvine herpesvirus 2 0anasal secretions1 aTraul, D.L.1 aOaks, J.L.1 aCrawford, T.B.1 aLewis, G.S.1 aLi, H.0 tJournal of general virology.g2005 Mar., v.  86 p.575-579x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/382323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.80707-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100205b20100305c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/07/29  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02555naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008003300029016002200062024002100084040001800105072000900123072000900132100001600141245006600157500005700223500002400280500001500304520104800319650002601367650002501393650002601418650001601444651001901460653002801479653001201507653002301519653003801542700002101580700001701601700001501618700001801633773024101651852000901892856011201901930003302013945002502046946001302071961001302084655001202097IND4430597920221123014011.0091230|xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443059792DNAL7 a10113/382332hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP210 0aJ7101 aEvans, R.G.10aControls for precision irrigation with self-propelled systems  aMeeting held November 14-16, 2000, Phoenix, Arizona.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWith appropriate controls, sensors, and decision making tools, self-propelled center pivot and linear move irrigation systems can be equipped and managed to account for spatial variations in water and some fertilizer requirements.

Self-propelled irrigation systems also provide an outstanding platform on which to mount sensors for real time monitoring of plant and soil conditions and interact with the control system for optimal environmental benefits.

Until the present time, no rapid and reliable analytical method has existed for determining the blend level of biodiesel in conventional diesel fuel. In the present work, near-infrared (NIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies were used to determine the blend level of biodiesel in conventional diesel fuel. Several regions in the NIR region (around 6005 cm-1 and 4800-4600 cm-1) are suitable for this purpose. The method is rapid and easy to use, and does not require any hardware changes when using the same instrument for monitoring the biodiesel-producing transesterification reaction and determining biodiesel fuel quality. In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the integration values of the peaks of the methyl ester moiety and the aliphatic hydrocarbon protons in biodiesel and conventional diesel fuel were used for determining blend levels. The results of NIR and NMR blend level determinations are in good agreement. 3aspectral analysis0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2001 Oct., v.  78, no.  10 p.1025-1028x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-001-0382-03Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/156183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080602b20080704c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03989naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111024002100136040001800157072001700175100002200192245014800214300001800362500002400380500002300404500001500427520186100442650001402303650001302317650001802330650001402348650001602362650002302378650002502401650001002426650002502436650001702461650001702478650001202495650001702507650002602524650001202550650001502562650005902577651001402636651001402650653002802664653001202692653001402704700002102718700002702739700002502766700002202791700001902813700002302832700002402855700002102879773011302900852000903013856007503022856011203097930003303209945002503242946001103267961001303278655001203291IND4434483420221119022007.0100326e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443448342DNAL7 a200295262pmid7 a10.1139/W09-0972doi7 a10113/406822hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A total of 164 tabanid flies, representing 27 species, were collected and sustainable spiroplasma isolations were made from 48 of the flies. The morphology of the cultured spiroplasmas, as observed in M1D medium under dark-field microscopy, was typical of either (i) Apis group spiroplasmas (relatively thick cells (~150 nm) with six or more turns) or (ii) chrysopicola–syrphidicola–TAAS-1 clade spiroplasmas (narrower, often much shorter cells) serologically related to Spiroplasma serogroup VIII. Repetitive serological analyses, involving successive rounds of dilution cloning and serological reevaluation, identified one serotype referable to the Spiroplasma serogroup VIII strain complex and five putative members of the Apis clade. Apis clade placement for these five groups was verified using 16S rRNA phylogenetic analyses. Among the Apis clade members, one serotype representing 11 isolates was identified as a geographic variant of Spiroplasma turonicum. Spiroplasma turonicum (Tab4C) was originally isolated from a tabanid Haematopoda sp. in France. The other 34 isolates represented four new serogroups (= putative species). The following strains are proposed as representatives of the new serogroups: strain GSU5478 (group XXXIX), strain GSU5490 (group XL), strain GSU5508 (group XLI), and strain GSU5603 (group XLII). In summary, six serogroups were observed from isolations originating from seven distinct sample sites in Australia. Surprisingly, the serotype with the greatest geographical range (five sites from 16°48.9′S to 35°40.0′S) and the greatest host diversity (nine species over three genera) was the geographic variant of S. turonicum, which had only been reported previously in France. 3aTanacetum 3ataxonomy 3aribosomal RNA 3aserotypes 3aSpiroplasma 3astrain differences 3amicrobial physiology 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3abiodiversity 3acell biology 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aDipteraxmicrobiology 2aEcology 2aSerotyping 2aSpiroplasmaxclassificationxisolation & purification. 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0amolecular sequence data 0astrains 0aisolation1 aMurphy, April C.1 aZarzuela, Alexander B.1 aJandhyam, Haritha L.1 aBostick, David S.1 aBates, C.

The study was conducted on a site infested with C. xenoplax and having a previous history of peach tree short life (PTSL). Plots consisted of five preplant treatments: (i) nonfumigated soil without tarp and urea, (ii) nonfumigated soil with tarp and urea, (iii) sorghum as a green manure without tarp and urea, (iv) sorghum as a green manure with tarp and urea, and (v) preplant methyl bromide fumigation. Sorghum as a green manure with and without tarp was comparable with methyl bromide fumigation in suppressing the population of C. xenoplax in the early stages of this experiment. Nematode population densities were suppressed 11 months longer in sorghum with tarp and urea plots than in sorghum without tarp and urea plots. However, nematode population densities in sorghum with tarp and urea plots were not suppressed as long as in fumigated methyl bromide plots (19 versus 24 months, respectively). 3aPrunus persica 3apeaches 3aorchard soils 3asoil fumigation 3agreen manures 3aurea 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 3amethyl bromide 3anematode control 3anematode infections 3aMesocriconema xenoplax 3apopulation density 0apeach tree short life1 aRodríguez-Kábana, R.0 tPlant disease.g2007 Dec., v.  91, no.  12 p.1607-1611x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-91-12-16073Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/164153Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080630b20080704c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/06/30  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03337naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125024001900146024002000165040001800185072000900203072000900212072000900221072000900230100001500239245009600254300001600350500002400366500001500390506007600405520137900481506003701860650002501897650001901922650000901941650001401950650001401964650001101978650001101989650002002000650001602020650002102036651001502057653002502072653004502097700001702142700001802159700002002177700001502197700001802212700001902230700002102249773014302270852000902413856008302422856011102505930003302616945002502649946001302674961001202687655001202699IND4367984520221207125641.0050329e20050118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436798452DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.04083151022doi7 aPMC5440402pmcid7 a156429482pmid7 a10113/29552hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aF600 0aB2001 aWard, J.K.10aCarbon starvation in glacial trees recovered from the La Brea tar pits, southern California  ap. 690-694.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Rancho La Brea tar pit fossil collection includes Juniperus (C3) wood specimens that 14C date between 7.7 and 55 thousand years (kyr) B.P., providing a constrained record of plant response for southern California during the last glacial period. Atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) ranged between 180 and 220 ppm during glacial periods, rose to approximately 280 ppm before the industrial period, and is currently approaching 380 ppm in the modern atmosphere. Here we report on delta13C of Juniperus wood cellulose, and show that glacial and modern trees were operating at similar leaf-intercellular [CO2] (c(i))/atmospheric [CO2] (c(a)) values. As a result, glacial trees were operating at c(i) values much closer to the CO2-compensation point for C3 photosynthesis than modern trees, indicating that glacial trees were undergoing carbon starvation. In addition, we modeled relative humidity by using delta18O of cellulose from the same Juniperus specimens and found that glacial humidity was approximately 10% higher than that in modern times, indicating that differences in vapor-pressure deficits did not impose additional constrictions on c(i)/c(a) in the past. By scaling ancient c(i) values to plant growth by using modern relationships, we found evidence that C3 primary productivity was greatly diminished in southern California during the last glacial period.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical composition 3acarbon dioxide 3awood 3aJuniperus 3acellulose 3acarbon 3aoxygen 3astable isotopes 3apaleobotany 3apaleoclimatology 3aCalifornia 0aatmospheric sciences 0aatmospheric carbon dioxide concentration1 aHarris, J.M.1 aCerling, T.E.1 aWiedenhoeft, A.1 aLott, M.J.1 aDearing, M.D.1 aColtrain, J.B.1 aEhleringer, J.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2005 Jan. 18, v.  102, no.  3 p.690-694x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.04083151023Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/29553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070904b20071002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/11  aOther US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03163naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002400149245011200173300001600285500002400301500002400325500001500349520165400364650001402018650001802032650001702050650002602067650001502093650002402108650001302132650001502145650001302160650002302173650002102196650002402217650002002241653001202261653002402273653003402297700001802331700001902349773006002368852000902428856011202437930003302549945002502582946001302607961001302620655001202633IND4429489620221120102808.0091201e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442948962DNAL7 a10113/363602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF822 0aF2001 aKokalis-Burelle, N.10aGreenhouse evaluation of Capsicum rootstocks for management of Meloidogyne incognita on grafted bell pepper  ap. 121-132.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-05  aThe growth, development, and nematode susceptibility of various rootstock genotypes grafted to a commercial bell pepper variety scion were evaluated in a series of greenhouse experiments. Nine rootstocks including 'Caribbean Red Habanero', 'PA-136', 'Keystone Resistant Giant', 'Yolo Wonder', 'Carolina Wonder', 'Charleston Hot', 'Mississippi Nemaheart', 'Carolina Cayenne', and 'Charleston Belle', were grafted to the commercial variety 'Aristotle' as a scion, and inoculated with Meloidogyne incognita . 'Aristotle' ungrafted and 'Aristotle' self-grafted plants were included as controls. Graft compatibility was assessed by measuring plant growth, while nematode infestation was assessed using a gall index, and extraction and quantification of juveniles from roots and soil. Stem weight of the scion 'Aristotle' was impacted by the use of different rootstocks, and root weight of the rootstocks varied, however, no rootstock/scion incompatibility occurred. The rootstocks 'Charleston Hot', 'Carolina Wonder', 'Charleston Belle', 'Mississippi Nemaheart' and 'Carolina Cayenne' were consistently resistant to galling by M. incognita in all experiments, while 'Aristotle' ungrafted, 'Aristotle' self-grafted, 'PA-136', and 'Caribbean Red Habanero' were consistently susceptible to galling. Cultivars 'Yolo Wonder' and 'Keystone Resistant Giant' varied in their responses, with reduced galling in one experiment. Grafting a commercial bell pepper variety scion on nematode resistant rootstock has potential to reduce damage caused by M. incognita and contribute to root-knot nematode management as a component in sustainable crop production systems. 3acultivars 3asweet peppers 3aplant growth 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aroot galls 3agraft compatibility 3agenotype 3arootstocks 3aCapsicum 3apopulation density 3anematode control 3aroot-knot nematodes 3apest resistance 0agalling 0anematode resistance 0arootstock-scion relationships1 aBausher, M.G.1 aRosskopf, E.N.0 tNematropica.g2009 June, v.  39, no.  1 p.121-1327nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/363603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091205b20100101c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/12/04  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02488naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001600158245012300174300001600297500002400313520132800337650002701665650002601692650002001718650001101738650001901749650001401768700001801782700001801800773006701818852000901885856011201894930003302006945002502039946001302064961001302077655001202090IND4439867720221121075923.0100714s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443986772DNAL7 a10113/437312hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aWiltz, B.A.10aPotential of Kaolin-based Particle Film Barriers for Formosan Subterranean Termite (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) Control  ap. 405-413.  aIncludes references  aEffects of three particle film products on Formosan subterranean termites, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, were evaluated in feeding, tunneling, and contact assays. The particle films, hydrophobic M96-018 and hydrophilic Surround and Surround WP are based on the inert clay mineral kaolin. In 2-week long no-choice feeding tests, significant mortality occurred only with M96-018-coated wood. When a choice was provided, M96-018 and Surround were consumed at higher rates than untreated wood. Surround WP did not differ from controls in either test. In the tunneling assay termites were given the option of crossing a kaolin-sand mixture to reach an alternate food source. After 3-weeks, rates of 1% and 5% M96-018 provided an effective barrier to Formosan termite tunneling, while termites were not stopped by rates as high as 20% Surround and Surround WP. Dust treatments of all three formulations caused significant increases in mortality within 24 h, with mortality rates ranging from 72.0 - 97.3% within 72 h of treatment. The particle films were most effective when moisture levels were low, suggesting that desiccation was the mechanism for mortality.

In alkaloid II, the methylenedioxy group of I is replaced by one hydroxyl group and one methoxyl group; alkaloid III is the analogous dimethoxy derivative. Alkaloids IV, V and VI are the corresponding C-3 epimers of alkaloids I, II and III. Though schelhammericine itself has not yet been observed in Cephalotaxus, alkaloids IV and V are identical in all respects with two alkaloids found in Schelhammera pedunculata. Alkaloids II, III and VI are previously unreported in the literature. The co-occurrence of these minor homoerythrina-type alkaloids (II-VI) with the major Cephalotaxus alkaloid cephalotaxine (VII) and its antileukemic esters (VIII-XI) is of interest biogenetically. 3aCephalotaxus harringtonia 3aalkaloids 3achemical structure0 tPhytochemistry.g1972 Apr., v.  11, no.  4 p.1467-1472x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/310963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090712b20090801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/07/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02950naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166072000900175072000900184100001400193245024800207300001600455500002400471520147500495650001701970650002301987650001902010650002502029650001902054700001502073700001602088700001402104700001502118773009502133852000902228856011202237856008502349930003302434945002502467946001102492961001302503655001202516IND4377910620221119142822.0060215e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437791062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bse.2004.12.0252doi7 a10113/124882hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL600 0aL0011 aBaker, J.10aAcetate esters of saturated and unsaturated alcohols (C12-C20) are major components in Dufour glands of Bracon cephi and Bracon lissogaster (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), parasitoids of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus (Hymenoptera: Cephidae)  ap. 757-769.  aIncludes references  aChemistry of Dufour glands associated with the venom complex in Bracon cephi (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck (Hymenoptera; Braconidae), two parasitoids of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), was examined by solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Homologous series of five chemical classes were detected in individual glands from each species. Major classes included: (1) acetate esters of saturated and unsaturated primary alcohols with parent chain lengths from C12 to C20. Hexadecanyl acetate, octadecanyl acetate, and octadecenyl acetate were major components in B. cephi. The composition of the acetate series in B. lissogaster was similar except that the octadecanyl acetate was only a minor component. (2) A homologous series of monoenes from C23:1 to C35:1 were detected in both species, with C29:1, C31:1 and C33:1 being the major components. Dienes from C31:2 to C35:2 and trienes (C33:3-C35:3) were also detected in both species. (3) A homologous series of n-alkanes from C19 to C31 was detected in both species. n-Tricosane was the major component. Minor components in both species included homologous series of both mono- and dimethyl branched alkanes. The Dufour gland hydrocarbon components in both B. cephi and B. lissogaster have some similarities to the composition of cuticular hydrocarbons of their host C. cinctus, a species with a complex pheromonal signaling system. 3ainsect pests 3abiological control 3asemiochemicals 3achemical composition 3aDufour's gland1 aHoward, R.1 aMorrill, W.1 aMeers, S.1 aWeaver, D.0 tBiochemical systematics and ecology.g2005 Aug., v.  33, no.  8 p.757-769x0305-19787nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/124883Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bse.2004.12.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/05  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02999naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159100001700168245004600185300001400231500002500245520197900270650002002249650000902269650002002278650001902298650002502317700001902342773009602361852000902457856011202466930003302578946001302611961001302624655001202637IND8901437620221121225632.0890309e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890143762DNAL7 a163478382pmid7 a10113/491642hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aX1001 aParkin, T.B.10aStochastic models of soil denitrification  ap. 72-77.  aIncludes references.  aSoil denitrification is a highly variable process that appears to be lognormally distributed. This variability is manifested by large sample coefficients of variation for replicate estimates of soil core denitrification rates. Deterministic models for soil denitrification have been proposed in the past, but none of these models predicts the approximate lognormality exhibited by natural denitrification rate estimates. In this study, probabilistic (stochastic) models were developed to understand how positively skewed distributions for field denitrification rate estimates result from the combined influences of variables known to affect denitrification. Three stochastic models were developed to describe the distribution of measured soil core denitrification rates. The driving variables used for all the models were denitrification enzyme activity and CO2 production rates. The three models were distinguished by the functional relationships combining these driving variables. The functional relationships used were (i) a second-order model (model 1), (ii) a second-order model with a threshold (model 2), and (iii) a second-order saturation model (model 3). The parameters of the models were estimated by using 12 separate data sets (24 replicates per set), and their abilities to predict denitrification rate distributions were evaluated by using three additional independent data sets of 180 replicated each. Model 2 was the best because it produced distributions of denitrification rate which were not significantly different (P greater than 0.1) from distributions of measured denitrification rates. The generality of this model is unknown, but it accurately predicted the mean denitrification rates and accounted for the stochastic nature of this variable at the site studied. The approach used in this study may be applicable to other areas of ecological research in which accounting for the high spatial variability of microbiological processes is of interest. 3adenitrification 3asoil 3aenzyme activity 3acarbon dioxide 3astochastic processes1 aRobinson, J.A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1989 Jan., v.  55, no.  1 p.72-77x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/491643Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110622b20110701c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02006naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002500149245003700174300001800211500002400229520087600253650001401129650001601143650001601159650002301175650001401198650001501212651001601227700002101243700002301264700002101287773008301308852000901391856011201400930003301512945002501545946001301570961001301583655001201596IND4432212520221120210801.0100202e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443221252DNAL7 a10113/398712hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF1101 aStringer, Stephen J.10a‘Prince’ Rabbiteye Blueberry  ap. 144–145.  aIncludes references  a'Prince' is a new rabbitteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei=V. virgatum) released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS).

We now demonstrate that the acceptor products from gentiobiose, also formed in good yields (nearly 90% in unoptimized reactions), follow a pattern similar to those formed from maltose. The initial product is a single trisaccharide, α-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-β-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-d-Glc. Two tetrasaccharides were formed in approximately equal quantities: α-d-Glcp-(1 to 3)-α-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-β-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-d-Glc and α-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-α-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-β-d-Glcp-(1to 6)-d-Glc. Just one pentasaccharide was isolated from the reaction mixture, α-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-α-d-Glcp-(1 to 3)-α-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-β-d-Glcp-(1 to 6)-d-Glc. Our hypothesis that the enzyme is incapable of forming two consecutive α-(1 to 3) linkages, and does not form products with more than two consecutive α-(1 to 6) linkages, apparently applies to other acceptors as well as to maltose. The glucosylation of gentiobiose reduces or eliminates its bitter taste. 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3afoods 3adietary fiber 3abitterness 3afeeds 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aglycosidic linkages 3acrystal structure 3adietary carbohydrate 3acell free system 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aprebiotics 3aingredients 3agentiobiose 0aalternansucrase 0aoligosaccharides0 tCarbohydrate research.g2009 Jan. 26, v.  344, no.  2 p.187-1907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/363663Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2008.10.0173Available from publisher's Web site  a20091205b20100101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/12/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03445naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145024002100164040001800185072000900203072000900212100001900221245010100240300001800341500002400359506007600383520163000459506003702089650002702126650002202153650001802175650002102193650003002214650001902244650002502263650001502288650001602303650001502319650002102334650002202355651000902377700002302386700002102409700001802430700002102448773012602469852000902595856011202604856008102716930003302797945002502830946001102855961001302866655001202879IND4460703320221207134033.0110805e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446070332DNAL7 a10.3390/ijerph80621812doi7 aPMC31380202pmcid7 a217762252pmid7 a10113/499622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aW0001 aYuan, Yongping10aAssessing the long term impact of phosphorus fertilization on phosphorus loadings using AnnAGNPS  ap. 2181-2199.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh phosphorus (P) loss from agricultural fields has been an environmental concern because of potential water quality problems in streams and lakes. To better understand the process of P loss and evaluate the effects of different phosphorus fertilization rates on phosphorus losses, the USDA Annualized AGricultural Non-Point Source (AnnAGNPS) pollutant loading model was applied to the Ohio Upper Auglaize watershed, located in the southern portion of the Maumee River Basin. In this study, the AnnAGNPS model was calibrated using USGS monitored data; and then the effects of different phosphorus fertilization rates on phosphorus loadings were assessed. It was found that P loadings increase as fertilization rate increases, and long term higher P application would lead to much higher P loadings to the watershed outlet. The P loadings to the watershed outlet have a dramatic change after some time with higher P application rate. This dramatic change of P loading to the watershed outlet indicates that a “critical point” may exist in the soil at which soil P loss to water changes dramatically. Simulations with different initial soil P contents showed that the higher the initial soil P content is, the less time it takes to reach the “critical point” where P loadings to the watershed outlet increases dramatically. More research needs to be done to understand the processes involved in the transfer of P between the various stable, active and labile states in the soil to ensure that the model simulations are accurate. This finding may be useful in setting up future P application and management guidelines.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aagricultural land 3awater quality 3afertilizer rates 3anonpoint source pollution 3apollution load 3aenvironmental models 3awatersheds 3acalibration 3aphosphorus 3alosses from soil 3asimulation models 3aOhio1 aBingner, Ronald L.1 aLocke, Martin A.1 aStafford, Jim1 aTheurer, Fred D.0 tInternational journal of environmental research and public health.g2011 June, v.  8, no.  6 p.2181-2199x1660-46017nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/499623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph80621813Available from publisher's Web site  a20110816b20110902c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/08/15  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03176naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100002100188245006700209300001800276500002400294520172100318650001302039650003102052650001202083650001202095650002502107650001902132650002702151650001702178650002202195650001602217650004402233650002102277700002702298773008902325852000902414856011202423856008902535930003302624945002502657946001102682961001302693655001202706IND4429145720221120102825.0091123e20030910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442914572DNAL7 a10.1016/S0008-6215(03)00324-02doi7 a10113/363672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ120 0aQ5001 aCote, Gregory L.10aAlternansucrase acceptor reactions with methyl hexopyranosides  ap. 1961-1967.  aIncludes references  aAlternansucrase (EC 2.4.1.140, sucrose: (1fwdarw6), (1fwdarw3)-alpha-D-glucan 6(3)-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase) is a D-glucansucrase that synthesizes an alternating alpha-(1fwdarw3), (1fwdarw6)-linked D-glucan from sucrose. It also synthesizes oligosaccharides via D-glucopyranosyl transfer to various acceptor sugars. We have studied the acceptor products arising from methyl glycosides as model compounds in order to better understand the specificity of alternansucrase acceptor reactions. The initial product arising from methyl beta-D-glucopyranoside was methyl beta-isomaltoside, which was subsequently glucosylated to yield methyl beta-isomaltotrioside and methyl alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1fwdarw3)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1fwdarw6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside. These products are analogous to those previously described from methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside. The major initial acceptor product from methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside was methyl alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1fwdarw6)-alpha-D-mannopyranoside, but several minor products were also isolated and characterized, including a 3,6-di-O-substituted mannopyranoside. Methyl alpha-D-galactopyranoside yielded two initial products, methyl alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1fwdarw3)-alpha-D-galactopyranoside and methyl alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1fwdarw4)-alpha-D-galactopyranoside, in a 2.5:1 molar ratio. Methyl D-allopyranosides were glucosylated primarily at position 6, yielding methyl alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1fwdarw6)-D-allopyranosides. The latter subsequently gave rise to methyl alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1fwdarw6)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1fwdarw6)-D-allopyranosides. In general, the methyl alpha-D-hexopyranosides were better acceptors than the corresponding beta-glycosides. 3aalternan 3asucrose-phosphate synthase 3aglucans 3asucrose 3adietary carbohydrate 3aionic strength 3amolecular conformation 3acrosslinking 3acrystal structure 3amethylation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3arefractive index1 aDunlap, Christopher A.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2003 Sept. 10, v.  338, no.  19 p.1961-1967x0008-62157nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/363673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0008-6215(03)00324-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20091205b20100101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/12/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04367naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001800176245010800194300001800302500002400320500001500344520225900359650001002618650000902628650002002637650001202657650001602669650002402685650000802709650001902717650001902736650001302755650001002768650001202778650001802790650002002808650001602828650001202844650003102856650001102887650002002898650004602918650002002964650001302984650002702997650000903024650002003033650001403053650006403067650002603131653001503157653001403172653001003186653001103196653002403207653001303231700001603244700001803260700002003278773010603298852000903404856011203413930003303525945001303558946001303571961001303584655001203597IND2199593820221120110930.0990702e199810  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219959382DNAL7 a98148932pmid7 a10113/347312hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL100 0aL6001 aFreking, B.A.10aEvaluation of the ovine callipyge locus.

Genotypic effects on growth, slaughter, and carcass traits  ap. 2549-2559.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aA resource flock of 362 F2 lambs provided phenotypic and genotypic data to estimate effects of callipyge (CLPG) genotypes on growth, slaughter, and carcass traits. Lambs were serially slaughtered in six groups at 3-wk intervals starting at 23 wk of age to allow comparisons at different end points. Probabilities of CLPG genotypes were calculated at a position 86 cM from the most centromeric marker of chromosome 18. A contrast of CLPG genotypic effects, based on the paternal polar over-dominance model, was used to evaluate callipyge and normal phenotypes. Relationships of traits with slaughter age, carcass weight, or 12th-rib fat depth for callipyge and normal phenotypic groups were estimated by regression. Callipyge and normal lambs did not differ for growth traits measured from birth to slaughter. Callipyge lambs produced 55.9% of live weight as chilled carcass weight compared with 51.7% for normal lambs at the same mean live weight of 48.32 kg. Lighter pelt, kidney-pelvic fat, and liver weights contributed to this advantage of callipyge lambs for dressing percentage (P < .001). Estimated accretion rates of carcass protein at the mean slaughter age were 12.5 and 10.2 g/d for callipyge and normal carcasses, respectively. Corresponding values for carcass fat were 35.2 and 42.1 g/d. Compositional differences in favor of callipyge carcasses were detected at constant values of slaughter age, carcass weight, and 12th-rib fat depth. Callipyge carcasses had 2.56 kg greater fat-free lean and 1.39 kg less fat than normal carcasses at the same mean age of 214.9 d (P < .001). The majority of these differences were established before the initial group was slaughtered and were maintained as age increased. Callipyge carcasses consisted of 24.3% fat and 71.3% fat-free lean, compared with 31.5 and 64.0% for normal carcasses at 25.6 kg of carcass weight. When evaluated at .49 cm of 12th-rib fat depth, callipyge lambs were 15.4 d older and produced 4.1 kg heavier carcasses with 4.3% less fat (P < .001). Effects of CLPG genotypic groups on carcass composition were greater than virtually all reported breed substitution effects. Use of the CLPG mutant allele in structured mating systems can dramatically increase production of lean lamb. 3aliver 3aloci 3aprotein content 3aalleles 3abody weight 3adressing percentage 3aage 3acarcass weight 3afurs and pelts 3agenotype 3alambs 3amutants 3afat thickness 3apaternal effect 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenes, Dominant 2aGenotype 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aPhenotype 2aSheepxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aWeight Gainxgenetics 0aevaluation 0adominance 0asheep 0agrowth 0acarcass composition 0abody fat1 aKeele, J.W.1 aNielsen, M.K.1 aLeymaster, K.A.0 tJournal of animal science.g1998 Oct., v.  76, no.  10 p.2549-2559wJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/347313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091014b20091106c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02721naa a2200409 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001900097024002900116024002100145040001800166100002200184245013000206300001600336500002500352520140000377650001601777650001101793650001801804650001601822650001601838650002201854651001901876653002301895653001101918653002001929653001501949773007601964852000902040856007902049856011202128930003302240946001302273961001302286655001202299991632569550742620221118151327.0880202e198710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL870922982DNAL7 a166657002pmid7 a10.1104/pp.85.2.3502doi7 a10113/178232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasperbauer, M.J.10aFar-red light reflection from green leaves and effects on phytochrome-mediated assimilate partitioning under field conditions  ap. 350-354.  aIncludes references.  aThe influence of plant spacing and row orientation on spectral distribution of light received by growing soybean (Gylcine max [L.] Merr.) plants was measured under field conditions. Light absorption, reflection and transmission of individual leaves showed that most of the blue and red was absorbed while most of the far-red was either reflected or transmitted. Plants growing in the field received different ratios of far-red relative to red, depending on nearness and/or orientation of other vegetation. Plants grown in close-spaced rows, or high population densities, received higher far-red/red ratios than did those grown in wide rows, or sparse populations. Heliotropic movements of the leaves also contributed to the far-red reflection patterns associated with row orientation. Under field conditions, differences in far-red/red ratios associated with nearness of competing vegetation became more pronounced with low solar angle near the end of the day. Plants exposed to far-red for 5 minutes at the end of each day in controlled environments, and those grown in close-spaced rows in the field, developed longer internodes and fewer branches. Red, far-red photoreversibility in the controlled environment study indicated involvement of phytochrome. Dry matter partitioning among plant components in the field was related to far-red/red light ratio received during growth and development. 3aGlycine max 3aleaves 3afar-red light 3arow spacing 3aphytochrome 3aplant development 3aSouth Carolina 0alight transmission 0agrowth 0arow orientation 0areflection0 tPlant physiology.g1987 Oct., v.  85, no.  2 p.350-354x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.85.2.3503Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/178233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080811b20080905c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02824naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002100149245010600170300001800276500002500294520174400319650001302063650002802076650002002104650002602124700002202150700002402172773009802196852000902294856011202303930003302415946001302448961001302461655001202474IND8312563720221119092138.0831213e198311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND831256372DNAL7 a10113/465302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aKopp, Stephen J.10aPhysiological and metabolic characterization of a cardiomyopathy induced by chronic copper deficiency  ap.

Copper deficiency was verified by indirect (anemia, growth retardation, hypercholesterolemia, gross pathology, and abnormal electrocardiograms) and direct (tissue copper analysis) criteria. His bundle electrographic and electrocardiographic changes detected in the copper-deficient group consisted most notably of depressed His-Purkinje system conductivity and S-T segment depression. Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of cardiac, renal, and hepatic tissue perchloric acid extracts revealed significant metabolic changes associated with the dietary copper deficiency, including a generalized marked decrease in ATP and phosphocreatine levels and a corresponding increase in inorganic orthophosphate and ADP levels in the various tissues. Tissue-specific changes consisting of elevated ribose 5-phosphate (heart), phosphocholine (heart), and inosine monophosphate (kidney) and decreased glycerol 3-phosphorylethanolamine (liver) and glycerol 3-phosphorylcholine (liver) levels were detected in copper-deficient rats. Microscopic examination of heart tissue from copper-deficient rats revealed extensive disruption of mitochondrial fine structure, including fragmentation of cristae and inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, which resulted in pronounced vacuolization throughout the tissue. Although the physiological and metabolic disturbances manifested in hearts from copper-deficient animals generally mimic myocardial responses to chronic ischemia, the observed changes are interpreted in a broader context to represent the appearance of a copper-dependent cardiomyopathy. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases1 aKlevay, Leslie M.1 aFeliksik, Janice M.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1983 Nov., v.  245, no.  5:pt.1 p.H855-H866x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/465303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101221b20110101c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02549naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111024002100145040001800166072000900184100001800193245006500211300001800276500002400294520105400318650002001372650003001392650002301422650001401445650002801459650001901487650002001506650003001526650003001556651001201586700001601598700001601614700002201630700001701652700002001669773007701689852000901766856008401775856011201859930003301971945002502004946001302029961001302042655001202055IND4401061220221120144021.0080205e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440106122DNAL7 a189437312pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-97-12-16642doi7 a10113/164052hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aSchnell, R.J.10aDevelopment of a Marker Assisted Selection Program for Cacao  ap. 1664-1669.  aIncludes references  aProduction of cacao in tropical America has been severely affected by fungal pathogens causing diseases known as witches' broom (WB, caused by Moniliophthora perniciosa), frosty pod (FP, caused by M. roreri) and black pod (BP, caused by Phytophthora spp.). BP is pan-tropical and causes losses in all producing areas. WB is found in South America and parts of the Caribbean, while FP is found in Central America and parts of South America. Together, these diseases were responsible for over 700 million US dollars in losses in 2001 (4). Commercial cacao production in West Africa and South Asia are not yet affected by WB and FP, but cacao grown in these regions is susceptible to both. With the goal of providing new disease resistant cultivars the USDA-ARS and Mars, Inc. have developed a marker assisted selection (MAS) program. Quantitative trait loci have been identified for resistance to WB, FP, and BP. The potential usefulness of these markers in identifying resistant individuals has been confirmed in an experimental F1 family in Ecuador. 3aTheobroma cacao 3amarker-assisted selection 3adisease resistance 3acultivars 3aquantitative trait loci 3aplant breeding 3agenetic markers 3afungal diseases of plants 3ainternational cooperation 3aEcuador1 aBrown, J.S.1 aOlano, C.T.1 aPhillips-Mora, W.1 aAmores, F.M.1 aMotamayor, J.C.0 tPhytopathology.g2007 Dec., v.  97, no.  12 p.1664-1669x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-97-12-16643Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/164053Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080630b20080704c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/06/30  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03319naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001800149245007900167300001400246500010500260500002400365500001500389520211200404650001202516650001402528650001202542650001902554650001702573653001402590700001502604700001602619773007102635852000902706856011202715930003302827945002502860946001102885961001302896655001202909IND4381552220221117022757.0060629e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438155222DNAL7 a10113/295342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF700 0aF2001 aAradhya, M.K.10aOrigin, evolution, and biogeography of Juglans: a phylogenetic perspective  ap. 85-94.  aPaper presented at the Vth International Walnut Symposium held November 9-13, 2004, Sorrento, Italy.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPhylogenetic analyses of extant Juglans (Juglandaceae) using five cpDNA intergenic spacer (IGS) sequences (trnT-trnF, psbA-trnH, atpB-rbcL, trnV-16S rRNA, and trnS-trnfM) were performed to elucidate the origin, diversification, historical biogeography, and evolutionary relationships within the genus. Overall, 3848 characters were sampled, yielding 150 (3.8%) variable sites, of which, 45 (1.03%) were potentially parsimony informative. In all, seventeen in-group (Juglans) and two out-group (Carya and Pterocarya) taxa were analyzed using the parsimony and maximum likelihood methods, which produced concordant trees with three well-supported clades corresponding to the sections Juglans, Cardiocaryon (butternuts), and Rhysocaryon (black walnuts). Juglans cinerea from the section Trachycaryon was placed within the black walnut clade, probably suggesting historical introgression of black walnut chloroplast during its evolution in North America. Black walnuts were not well resolved, perhaps suggestive of their relatively recent origin and diversification or reticulate evolution within the section. Within butternuts, J. hopeiensis is moderately supported as a sister to J. ailantifolia, J. cathayensis, and J. mandshurica, which were well supported as a clade in all three analyses. The Persian walnut, J. regia and its sister taxon, J. sigillata formed a distinct clade sister to both butternuts and black walnuts. The cladogenesis within the genus Juglans appears to deviate from the evolutionary hypothesis based on the fossil history and biogeographic evidence. The results suggest that: (1) the IGS sequence divergence levels observed within and between different sections of Juglans are low; (2) basal placement of the section Juglans in both the analyses suggests its ancient origin in contrast to fossil evidence, which suggests the earliest divergence of sections Rhysocaryon and Cardiocaryon; (3) the Persian walnuts and butternuts have evolved at different rates as compared to black walnuts; and finally (4) the extant taxa may not represent the entire evolutionary history of the genus. 3aJuglans 3aphylogeny 3awalnuts 3aplant taxonomy 3abiogeography 0aevolution1 aPotter, D.1 aSimon, C.J.0 tActa horticulturae.g2006 Mar., , no. 705 p.85-94x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/295343Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090602b20090703c00000000  aINDdARSe2006/08/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle05372naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181072000900190072000900199100001400208245013700222300001600359500008600375500002400461500001500485520257000500650002203070650001903092650001003111650001603121650001403137650001503151650002003166650002003186650001503206650002303221650001403244650001903258650002003277650001403297650001303311650001703324650001803341650005203359650002203411650001203433650002303445650002503468650003603493650005203529650003603581650002403617650003003641650003103671650004403702650002703746650005203773650005403825650003803879650004403917653002303961653001803984653001404002653001804016653003804034700001504072700001404087700001504101773010404116852000904220856008104229856011204310930003304422945002504455946001304480961001304493655001204506IND4434613520221119092111.0100326e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443461352DNAL7 a203084202pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-004832doi7 a10113/465342hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL810 0aL200 0aL1051 aShini, S.10aUnderstanding stress-induced immunosuppression: Exploration of cytokine and chemokine gene profiles in chicken peripheral leukocytes  ap. 841-851.  aPaper presented at a symposium held July 20-23, 2009, in Raleigh, North Carolina.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAt present, the poultry meat and egg industry has gained a lot of ground, being viewed as a provider of a healthy alternative to red meat and other protein sources. If this trend is to be maintained, solutions must be found to improve resistance of chickens to disease, which often is weakened by stressful conditions. In poultry, stress-induced immunosuppression is manifested by failures in vaccination and increased morbidity and mortality of flocks. Currently, several modern cellular and molecular approaches are being used to explore the status of the immune system during stress and disease. It is likely that these new techniques will lead to the development of new strategies for preventing and controlling immunosuppression in poultry. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays, a broad spectrum of cytokine, chemokine, and their receptor genes can be quantified in birds and then be used as markers to assess the effects of stress on the immune system. Currently, we are investigating immune and endocrine interactions in the chicken, in particular the cells and molecules that are known to be involved in such interactions in mammals. We have evaluated the effects of corticosterone administration in drinking water on peripheral lymphocyte and heterophil cytokine and chemokine gene profiles. In particular, there seems to be effects on cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression levels in both lymphocytes and heterophils, especially expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-18 and chemokines C-C motif, ligand 1 inflammatory (CCLi1); C-C motif, ligand 2 inflammatory (CCLi2); C-C motif, ligand 5 (CCL5); C-C motif, ligand 16 (CCL16); C-X-C motif ligand 1 inflammatory (CXCLi1); and C-X-C motif ligand 2 inflammatory (CXCLi2), which are initially upregulated and are potentially involved in modulating the adaptive immune response. A chronic treatment with corticosterone downregulates proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, suggesting that the delayed effects of chronic stress can suppress the immune response. Messenger RNA expression levels of transforming growth factor-β4 (TGF-β4) are also upregulated in cortisosterone-treated birds. It appears that the balance between T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2/T regulatory cytokine production is altered in conditions associated with significant changes in plasma corticosterone concentration. Experiments are underway to decipher the cytokine and chemokine responses to vaccination and bacterial challenge on the background of stress-induced immunosuppression. 3aimmunosuppression 3acorticosterone 3agenes 3avaccination 3areceptors 3achemokines 3agenetic markers 3ablood chemistry 3aleukocytes 3adisease resistance 3amorbidity 3aanimal welfare 3aimmune response 3amortality 3achickens 3afood animals 3aanimal stress 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3agenetic variation 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aChemokinesxgenetics 2aChickensxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCoronavirus Infectionsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aCorticosteronextherapeutic use 2aCytokinesxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aImmunosuppression Therapy. 2aInfectious bronchitis virusximmunology 2aLeukocytesxphysiology 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStress, Psychologicalxcomplicationsximmunology. 2aVaccinesxadministration & dosage 2aViral Vaccinesxadministration & dosage 0aliterature reviews 0aanimal health 0acytokines 0aimmune system 0aimmunosuppression (physiological)1 aHuff, G.R.1 aShini, A.1 aKaiser, P.0 tPoultry science.g2010 Apr., v.  89, no.  4 p.841-851dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-004833Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/465343Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101221b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/12  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04425naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002100142040001800163072000900181072000900190100001700199245010600216300001800322500002400340500001500364520224700379650001302626650001702639650002802656650002802684650001802712650002202730650001202752650002302764650003102787650001602818650001202834650002002846650001902866650001502885650002402900650001802924650002202942650001502964650001202979650004402991650002703035650003903062650002303101653002203124653002303146653001703169700001203186700001903198700001603217700001903233700001603252700001703268700001503285773010503300852000903405856008103414856011203495930003303607945002503640946001303665961001303678655001203691IND4435219520221119092116.0100409e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443521952DNAL7 a203718622pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2009-002132doi7 a10113/465362hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ203 0aQ1031 aGuerin, M.T.14aThe change in prevalence of Campylobacter on chicken carcasses during processing: A systematic review  ap. 1070-1084.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA systematic review was conducted to evaluate the change in prevalence of Campylobacter on chicken carcasses during processing. A structured literature search of 8 electronic databases using the key words for "Campylobacter," "chicken," and "processing" identified 1,734 unique citations. Abstracts were screened for relevance by 2 independent reviewers. Thirty-two studies described prevalence at more than one stage during processing and were included in this review. Of the studies that described the prevalence of Campylobacter on carcasses before and after specific stages of processing, the chilling stage had the greatest number of studies (9), followed by washing (6), defeathering (4), scalding (2), and evisceration (1). Studies that sampled before and after scalding or chilling, or both, showed that the prevalence of Campylobacter generally decreased immediately after the stage (scalding: 20.0 to 40.0% decrease; chilling: 100.0% decrease to 26.6% increase). The prevalence of Campylobacter increased after defeathering (10.0 to 72.0%) and evisceration (15.0%). The prevalence after washing was inconsistent among studies (23.0% decrease to 13.3% increase). Eleven studies reported the concentration of Campylobacter, as well as, or instead of, the prevalence. Studies that sampled before and after specific stages of processing showed that the concentration of Campylobacter decreased after scalding (minimum decrease of 1.3 cfu/g, maximum decrease of 2.9 cfu/mL), evisceration (0.3 cfu/g), washing (minimum 0.3 cfu/mL, maximum 1.1 cfu/mL), and chilling (minimum 0.2 cfu/g, maximum 1.7 cfu/carcass) and increased after defeathering (minimum 0.4 cfu/g, maximum 2.9 cfu/mL). Available evidence is sparse and suggests more data are needed to understand the magnitude and mechanism by which the prevalence and concentration of Campylobacter changes during processing. This understanding should help researchers and program developers identify the most likely points in processing to implement effective control efforts. For example, if contamination will occur during defeathering and likely during evisceration, critical control points postevisceration are likely to have a greater effect on the end product going to the consumer. 3achickens 3aevisceration 3acritical control points 3abacterial contamination 3ameta-analysis 3aprocessing stages 3acooling 3afood contamination 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aplate count 3awashing 3afood processing 3afood pathogens 3aprevalence 3ahot water treatment 3aCampylobacter 3achicken carcasses 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aCampylobacterxisolation & purification 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aFood Handlingxmethodsxstandards. 2aMeatxmicrobiology 0afood microbiology 0aliterature reviews 0adefeathering1 aSir, C.1 aSargeant, J.M.1 aWaddell, L.1 aO'Connor, A.M.1 aWills, R.W.1 aBailey, R.H.1 aByrd, J.A.0 tPoultry science.g2010 May, v.  89, no.  5 p.1070-1084dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2009-002133Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/465363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101221b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04867naa a2200925 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133024002100166040001800187072000900205072000900214072000900223100001500232245014900247300001600396500002400412500001500436506007600451520188400527506003702411650001502448650002202463650001202485650002102497650002302518650001802541650002002559650001502579650001502594650001702609650002702626650001802653650002302671650001802694650002102712650002002733650002502753650002302778650002402801650001702825650000902842650003502851650007702886650002802963650005002991650001103041650002403052650001103076650002903087650000903116650003603125650001603161650003303177650003103210650003003241650002803271651001603299651001803315651001103333653002603344653001903370653002803389700002003417700002103437700001903458700002503477773013903502852000903641856008303650856011203733930003303845945002503878946001303903961001303916655001203929IND4431666120221207104713.0100122e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443166612DNAL7 a199554002pmid7 aPMC28068902pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2009.285712doi7 a10113/398622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aShen, Jian10aAssociation of vitamin B-6 status with inflammation, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammatory conditions: the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study  ap. 337-342.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Low vitamin B-6 status has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The cardioprotective effects of vitamin B-6 independent of homocysteine suggest that additional mechanisms may be involved. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine the cross-sectional association of vitamin B-6 status with markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. DESIGN: We measured plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and an oxidative DNA damage marker, urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), in Puerto Rican adults who were living in Massachusetts (n = 1205, aged 45-75 y). RESULTS: There was a strong dose-response relation of plasma PLP concentration with plasma CRP. Increasing quartiles of PLP were significantly associated with lower CRP concentrations (geometric means: 4.7, 3.6, 3.1, and 2.5 mg/L; P for trend < 0.0001) and with lower urinary 8-OHdG concentrations (geometric means: 124, 124, 117, and 108 ng/mg creatinine; P for trend: 0.025) after multivariate adjustment. These negative associations persisted after plasma homocysteine was controlled for. Plasma PLP concentrations were significantly correlated with plasma fasting glucose (r = -0.1, P = 0.0006), glycated hemoglobin (r = -0.08, P = 0.006), and homeostasis model assessment of β cell function (r = 0.082, P = 0.005). Metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes were also significantly associated with low plasma PLP concentrations (P = 0.011, 0.0007, and 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low vitamin B-6 concentrations are associated with inflammation, higher oxidative stress, and metabolic conditions in older Puerto Rican adults. Our data suggest that vitamin B-6 may influence cardiovascular disease risk through mechanisms other than homocysteine and support the notion that nutritional status may influence the health disparities present in this population.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3adiabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aoxidative stress 3aC-reactive protein 3adose response 3aglycohemoglobin 3abiomarkers 3apyridoxine 3ablood plasma 3achemical concentration 3aPuerto Ricans 3ametabolic syndrome 3ablood glucose 3achronic diseases 3ahuman nutrition 3aislets of Langerhans 3anutritional status 3apyridoxal phosphate 3ainflammation 2aAged 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxbloodxmetabolismxprevention & controlxurine. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDeoxyguanosinexanalogs & derivativesxurine. 2aFemale 2aHispanic or Latino. 2aHumans 2aInflammationxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexmetabolism. 2aMiddle Aged 2aOxidative Stressxphysiology 2aPyridoxal Phosphatexblood 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aVitamin B 6xmetabolism 3aPuerto Rico 3aMassachusetts 0aBoston 0adiet-related diseases 0ahuman diseases 0a8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine1 aLai, Chao-Qiang1 aMattei, Josiemer1 aOrdovas, J.

Peanut, corn and cottonseed are among the oil seeds that are susceptible to aflatoxin contamination during invasion of these crops by A. flavus. Contamination of agricultural commodities with aflatoxins can result in serious economic hardships to producers and adverse health impacts in both humans and domestic animals. It is therefore of great importance to determine ways to control A. flavus dissemination, survival and toxin formation. In this study we demonstrate the role of the veA regulatory gene in the contamination of peanut, corn and cotton by A. flavus. Virulence of A. flavus on peanut and corn seeds was reduced in the absence of the veA gene product. Generation of air-borne asexual spores was reduced and production of aflatoxin and sclerotia in peanut seeds, viable or non-viable, or in viable corn seed was completely blocked when infected with the A. flavus veA mutant (ΔveA). In planta inoculation of cotton bolls also showed that conidiation was decreased in bolls inoculated with the ΔveA strain and spread of the ΔveA strain to seed in locules adjacent to the inoculated locule was less than observed with the wild-type veA strain. As observed in peanut and corn, no aflatoxin was produced in seed harvested from cotton bolls inoculated with the ΔveA strain while aflatoxin was present in seed from wild-type veA inoculated bolls. 3aArachis hypogaea 3apeanuts 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acottonseed 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aoilseed crops 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aAspergillus flavus 3avirulence 3atoxigenic strains 3asecondary metabolites 3atoxic substances 3asclerotia 3aviability 3agenes 3aseed-borne diseases 3awild relatives 3aairborne microorganisms 3asporulation 3aconidia 3abolls 3afood pathogens1 aCary, J.W.1 aCalvo, A.M.0 tOpen mycology journal.g2009, v.  3, no.  10 p.27-36x1874-43707nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/437253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2174/18744370009030100273Available from publisher's Web site  a20101009b20101108c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/10/08  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02595naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002300092024002100115040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100003200181245015800213300001600371500001500387520109200402592002801494650001201522650002201534650002801556650002001584650003101604650002101635650001401656650001801670653002401688700003101712700002301743773010601766852000901872856011201881856007301993930003302066945002502099961001302124655001202137IND4419198620221122225305.0090417e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441919862DNAL7 a10.1649/873.12doi7 a10113/281932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL400 0aL001 0aL7001 aChamorro-Lacayo, M.

It was found that female genitalia contain pleurites IX, a rare and apparently primitive feature among leaf beetles. In other features cryptocephaline female genitalia are simpler than genitalia of other leaf beetles in having a poorly sclerotized sternite VIII and lacking the tignum. It is also hypothesized that the vagina is formed by sternites IX (dorsally) and VIII (ventrally), and that sclerotized plate of sternite IX can be homologized with vaginal palpi of flea beetles. A set of characters of diagnostic and of possible phylogenetic value was found. In general, Cryptocephalina and Monachulina bear the greatest affinity in overall morphology of the female genitalia, with Pachybrachina possessing a different set of unique morphological states. Of particular diagnostic and phylogenetic value at the subtribal level, as revealed by this study, are the shape and degree of sclerotization of tergite VIII, tergite IX, and sternite VIII.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdomen 3ainsect morphology 3ainterspecific variation 3ainsect taxonomy 3afemale reproductive system 3afemale genitalia 3aphylogeny 3aChrysomelidae 0aspecies differences1 aKonstantinov, Alexander S.1 aMoseyko, Alexey G.0 tColeopterists' bulletin.g2006 June, v. 60, no. 2 p.113-134dColeopterists' Society.x0010-065X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/281933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1649/873.13Available from publisher's Web site  a20090422b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/04/22  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02875naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180100001400189245009200203300001600295500002400311500001500335520123600350650001501586650001301601650001001614650002301624650002001647650003201667650002301699650002801722650001501750650002901765650002001794650002701814650002301841653001001864700002101874700001901895700001801914700001701932700002201949773005401971856011202025856008102137930003302218945002502251946001102276961001302287852000902300655001202309IND4460687020221123030022.0110804e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446068702DNAL7 a10.3390/toxins30707662doi7 a10113/499522hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ204 0aF8311 aLuo, Meng10aTranscriptional Profiles Uncover Aspergillus flavus-Induced Resistance in Maize Kernels  ap. 766-786.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAflatoxin contamination caused by the opportunistic pathogen A. flavus is a major concern in maize production prior to harvest and through storage. Previous studies have highlighted the constitutive production of proteins involved in maize kernel resistance against A. flavus’ infection. However, little is known about induced resistance nor about defense gene expression and regulation in kernels. In this study, maize oligonucleotide arrays and a pair of closely-related maize lines varying in aflatoxin accumulation were used to reveal the gene expression network in imbibed mature kernels in response to A. flavus’ challenge. Inoculated kernels were incubated 72 h via the laboratory-based Kernel Screening Assay (KSA), which highlights kernel responses to fungal challenge. Gene expression profiling detected 6955 genes in resistant and 6565 genes in susceptible controls; 214 genes induced in resistant and 2159 genes induced in susceptible inoculated kernels. Defense related and regulation related genes were identified in both treatments. Comparisons between the resistant and susceptible lines indicate differences in the gene expression network which may enhance our understanding of the maize-A. flavus interaction. 3aimbibition 3aZea mays 3aseeds 3agenetic resistance 3abioaccumulation 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3aaflatoxins 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aAspergillus flavus 0alines1 aBrown, Robert L.1 aChen, Zhi-Yuan1 aMenkir, Abebe1 aYu, Jiujiang1 aBhatnagar, Deepak0 tToxins.g2011 July, v.  3, no.  7 p.766-7867nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/499523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins30707663Available from publisher's Web site  a20110813b20110902c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/08/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01787naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001600157245010100173500002400274520049600298650001000794650001900804650001200823650002300835650001400858650003900872650001000911650002600921650001200947650000900959651001800968653001800986700002001004700001801024773009101042852000901133856011101142930003301253945002501286946000901311961000901320655001201329IND4397581920221118175827.0071107e19990622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439758192DNAL7 a10113/63662hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aQ203 0aD5001 aCasey, T.A.10aMethod and system for detecting fecal and ingesta contamination on the carcasses of meat animals  aIncludes references  aA method and apparatus for detecting ingesta or fecal contamination on an animal carcass using fluorescent spectroscopy is disclosed.

Intervention studies have shown that lycopene-containing foods may reduce cholesterol levels and lipid peroxidation, factors implicated in the initiation of cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether consumption of lycopene rich foods conferred cardiovascular protection to middle-aged adults as indicated by plasma lipid concentrations and measures of ex vivo antioxidants. Methods: Ten healthy men and women consumed a low lycopene diet with no added lycopene (control treatment) or supplemented with watermelon or tomato juice each containing 20 mg lycopene. Subjects consumed each treatment for three weeks in a crossover design. Plasma, collected weekly was analyzed for total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride concentrations and for the antioxidant biomarkers of malondialdehyde formation products (MDA), plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP). Data were analyzed using Proc Mixed Procedure and associations between antioxidant and lipid measures were identified by Pearson's product moment correlation analysis. Results: Compared to the control diet, the lycopene-containing foods did not affect plasma lipid concentrations or antioxidant biomarkers. Women had higher total cholesterol, HDL-C and triglyceride concentrations than did the men. Total cholesterol was positively correlated to MDA and FRAP while HDL-C was positively correlated to MDA and GPX. GPX was negatively correlated to triglyceride concentration. Conclusions: The inclusion of watermelon or tomato juice containing 20 mg lycopene did not affect plasma lipid concentrations or antioxidant status of healthy subjects. However, plasma cholesterol levels impacted the results of MDA and FRAP antioxidant tests. 3awatermelons 3alipid peroxidation 3amiddle-aged adults 3acholesteremic effect 3atomatoes 3acardioprotective effect 3alycopene 3adietary nutrient sources 3atomato juice 3aepidemiological studies 3ablood lipids 3anutritional intervention 3atriacylglycerols 3aantioxidant activity 3across-sectional studies 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3afree radical scavengers 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3aglutathione peroxidase 0aantioxidants1 aArjmandi, B.H.1 aClaypool, P.L.1 aPerkins-Veazie, P.1 aBaker, R.A.1 aClevidence, B.A.0 tNutrition journal.g2004, v.  3, no.  157nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/363573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1475-2891-3-153Available from publisher's Web site  a20091205b20100101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/12/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03481naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002100122040001800143072000900161100002300170245008100193500001500274520204000289650002502329650002102354650001902375650002902394650002902423650001502452650001302467653001002480700001902490700002602509700002602535700002102561700002102582700002602603700002102629700001702650773004702667856011202714856008002826930003302906945002502939946001302964961001302977852000902990655001202999IND4460688420221123030148.0110804e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446068842DNAL7 a10.1890/ES11-00115.12doi7 a10113/499542hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3301 aPeters, Debra P.C.10aCross-system comparisons elucidate disturbance complexities and generalities  a2019-12-06  aGiven that ecological effects of disturbance have been extensively studied in many ecosystems, it is surprising that few quantitative syntheses across diverse ecosystems have been conducted. Multi-system studies tend to be qualitative because they focus on disturbance types that are difficult to measure in an ecologically relevant way. In addition, synthesis of existing studies across systems or disturbance types is challenging because sufficient information needed for analysis is not easily available. Theoretical advances and improved predictions can be advanced by generalizations obtained from synthesis activities that include multiple sites, ecosystems, and disturbance events. Building on existing research, we present a conceptual framework and an operational analog to integrate this rich body of knowledge and to promote quantitative comparisons of disturbance effects across different types of ecosystems and disturbances. This framework recognizes individual disturbance events that consist of three quantifiable components: (1) environmental drivers, (2) initial system properties, and (3) physical and biological mechanisms of effect, such as deposition, compaction, and combustion. These components result in biotic and abiotic legacies that can interact with subsequent drivers and successional processes to influence system response. Through time, a coarse-scale quasi-equilibrial state can be reached where variation in drivers interacting with biotic processes and feedbacks internal to the system results in variability in dynamics. At any time, a driver of sufficient magnitude can push the system beyond its realm of natural variability to initiate a new kind of event. We use long-term data from diverse terrestrial ecosystems to illustrate how our approach can facilitate cross-system comparisons, and provide new insights to the role of disturbance in ecological systems. We also provide key disturbance characteristics and measurements needed to promote future quantitative comparisons across ecosystems. 3aenvironmental models 3ainvasive species 3aclimate change 3asoil physical properties 3aanthropogenic activities 3aecosystems 3aland use 0apests1 aLugo, Ariel E.1 aChapin, F.

The objective was to determine urban-rural differences in environmental factors associated with the prevalence of adults meeting PA guidelines. Methods: County-level data for non-Frontier counties (n=2,697) were utilized for analyses. A five-category rurality variable was created using the percentage of county population living in a rural area. From Factor Analyses (FA) weighted factor scores were obtained and used in Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analyses, stratified by rurality, to identify associations between environmental factors and prevalence of males and females meeting PA guidelines. Results: A 13-variable, four-factor structure of natural, social, recreation, and transportation environment factors emerged from FA. MLR revealed that natural, social, and recreation environment factors were associated with PA for men and women, with variation by gender for social factors. The natural environment was associated with PA in all but the Urban counties, whereas the recreation environment was associated with PA in the Urban counties and the two most rural categories of counties. Conclusions: Variations across the rural-urban continuum in factors associated with adults' PA highlight the need for improved surveillance and more in-depth understanding of what works in creating active rural places. 3amonitoring 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3arecreation 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arural areas1 aDaily, Shay M.1 aUmstattd Meyer, M.Renée1 aEdwards, Michael B.1 aJacobs, Lauren1 aMcClendon, Megan1 aPerry, Cynthia K.1 aRoemmich, James N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6270-96780 tInternational journal of environmental research and public health.g2021 July 20, v. 18, no. 14 p.7688-x1661-78277nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/74814323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181476883Available from publisher's Web site  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148072000900157100002000166245010100186500002400287500001500311520028300326650002200609650001200631650001800643650001400661650003100675650001700706650002500723650002500748650001900773650000900792650002500801650002200826651001800848653001800866653001800884653002800902700001900930773009700949852000901046856011101055930003301166945002501199946000901224961000901233655001201242IND4397605120221120115918.0071108e20010717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439760512DNAL7 a10113/69742hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX300 0aL832 0aD500 0aX3801 aEverett, K.D.E.10aIntergenic spacer target sequence for detecting and distinguishing chlamydial species or strains  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe intergenic spacer between the 16S and the 23S rRNA genes and a 131-bp segment at the 3' end of Domain I of the 23S gene provides suitable target sequences for developing probes and primers useful in detecting and identifying Chlamydiaceae in laboratory and clinical samples. 3asequence analysis 3apatents 3aribosomal RNA 3aChlamydia 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3ahuman health 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3aintergenic DNA 3aUSDA 3abacterial infections 3adisease diagnosis 3aUnited States 0aChlamydiaceae 0aanimal health 0amolecular sequence data1 aAndersen, A.A.0 tUnited States Department of Agriculture patents.g2001 July 17, , no.

However, copper is an algaecide and may adversely affect phytoplankton and zooplankton populations. We evaluated the effects of prophylactic use of copper sulfate in catfish nursery ponds on water quality and phytoplankton and zooplankton populations. In 2006, treatments of 0 mg/L CSP, 3 mg/L CSP (0.77 mg/L Cu), and 6 mg/L CSP (1.54 mg/L Cu) were randomly assigned to 0.04-ha ponds. In 2007, only treatments of 0 and 3 mg/L CSP were randomly assigned to the 16 ponds. Ponds treated with CSP had significantly higher pH and significantly lower total ammonia concentrations. Treatment of both CSP rates increased total algal concentrations but reduced desirable zooplankton groups for catfish culture. CSP has been shown to be effective in reducing snail populations at the rate used in this study. CSP treatment also appears to be beneficial to the algal bloom, shifting the algal population to green algae and increasing total algal biomass within 1 wk after CSP treatment. Although zooplankton populations were adversely affected, populations of important zooplankton to catfish fry began rebounding 6-12 d after CSP treatment. Therefore, if CSP is used to treat catfish fry ponds of similar water composition used in this study, fry should not be stocked for about 2 wk after CSP application to allow time for the desirable zooplankton densities to begin increasing. 3aIctalurus punctatus 3acatfish 3afish culture 3afish ponds 3acopper sulfate 3adisease control 3aalgicides 3awater quality 3azooplankton 3aphytoplankton 3atoxicity1 aWise, David J.1 aZimba, Paul V.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2009 Feb., v.  40, no.  1 p.122-128dBlackwell Publishing Incx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/320313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2008.00225.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090805b20091002c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/05  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02143naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151072000900169072000900178100001900187245009300206300001600299500002400315520065200339650000900991650002601000650002601026650001401052650002101066650002001087650001301107650001601120650002701136650002301163650001101186700002501197700002301222700002101245700002201266773007001288852000901358856011201367856008801479930003301567945002501600946001101625961001301636655001201649IND4446263720221120090131.0101210e198210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444626372DNAL7 a10.1016/0031-9384(82)90248-72doi7 a10113/465202hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT3001 aTucker, Don M.10aLongitudinal study of brain function and depletion of iron stores in individual subjects  ap. 737-740.  aIncludes references  aSeven men living in a controlled research unit showed decrements in iron stores due to repeated phlebotomy.

For four of the seven subjects, asymmetries of EEG power in the occipital electrodes appeared related to the decline in iron status over time. 3airon 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3acognition 3anutrient content 3amineral content 3aferritin 3ablood serum 3aelectroencephalography 3anutritional status 3ahumans1 aSandstead, Harold H.1 aSwenson, Rodney A.1 aSawler, Bruce G.1 aPenland, James G.0 tPhysiology & behavior.g1982 Oct., v.  29, no.  4 p.737-7407nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/465203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-9384(82)90248-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20101220b20110101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/12/20  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01738naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100001900131245007800150300001600228500002500244500001500269520077500284650001801059650003201077650001501109653001201124700001601136773008001152852000901232856011201241930003301353946001301386961001301399655001201412IND8707705320221118151643.0871117e198707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND870770532DNAL7 a10113/178192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusscher, W.J.10aEnhancement of subsoiling effect on soil strength by conservation tillage  ap. 888-892.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-04  aCone indices were measured for conventional cultivation and conservation tillage before and after in-row subsoil-planting.

Merr.] in many soybean growing countries of the world, mainly in Asia and North America. A single dominant gene in PI 243540 confers resistance to the soybean aphid. The objectives of this study were to identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers closely linked to the gene in PI 243540 and to position the gene on the consensus soybean genetic map. One hundred eighty-four F₂ plants and their F₂:₃ families from a cross between the susceptible cultivar Wyandot and PI 243540, and the two parental lines were screened with the Ohio biotype of soybean aphid using greenhouse choice tests. A SSR marker from each 10-cM section of the consensus soybean map was selected for bulked segregant analysis (BSA) to identify the tentative genomic location of the gene. The BSA technique was useful to localize the gene to a genomic region in soybean linkage group (LG) F. The entire F₂ population was then screened with polymorphic SSR markers from this genomic region and a linkage map with nine SSR markers flanking the gene was constructed. The aphid resistance gene was positioned in the interval between SSR markers Satt334 and Sct_033 on LG F. These SSR markers will be useful for marker assisted selection of this gene. The aphid resistance gene from PI 243540 mapped to a different linkage group than the only named soybean aphid resistance gene, Rag1, from 'Dowling'. Also, the responses of the two known biotypes of the soybean aphid to the gene from PI 243540 and Rag1 were different. Thus, the aphid resistance gene from PI 243540 was determined to be a new and independent gene that has been named Rag2. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aAphis glycines 3abiotypes 3agermplasm screening 3apest resistance 3agenetic resistance 3agenetic markers 3amicrosatellite repeats 3achromosome mapping 3alinkage groups 0aRag2 resistance gene1 aKang, Sung-Taeg1 aBeil, Scott E.1 aHammond, Ronald B.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2008 Oct., v.  117, no.  6 p.955-962dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/320343Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-008-0835-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090805b20091002c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/08/04  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03531naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024002100135040001800156072000900174072000900183072000900192100002000201245013800221300001400359500002400373520193300397650002602330650002002356650001802376650001602394650001302410650002102423650002202444650002302466650001302489650003402502653002502536700001702561700001802578700002202596700001902618773009202637852000902729856011202738856009302850930003302943945002502976946001103001961001303012655001203025IND4389859220221120074732.0070327e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438985922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.11.0022doi7 a10113/465212hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ115 0aQ5051 aSaftner, Robert10aQuality characteristics of fresh-cut watermelon slices from non-treated and 1-methylcyclopropene- and/or ethylene-treated whole fruit  ap. 71-79.  aIncludes references  aMaintaining the postharvest quality of fresh-cut fruit after processing and throughout distribution and marketing is a major challenge facing the fresh-cut fruit industry. Analytical quality characteristics of packaged fresh-cut watermelon slices from non-treated and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP)- and/or ethylene-treated whole fruit were investigated. Freshly harvested seedless watermelon ('Sugar Heart') were stored 7-14 days in air before exposure to 0, 0.5 or 1.0 μL L-1 1-MCP for 18 h followed by 5 days exposure to 0 or 10 μL L-1 ethylene, all at 20 °C. Following treatment, fruit were processed into wedge-shaped slices, packaged into rigid trays sealed with a high oxygen transmission rate film overlap and stored 1, 6 or 12 days at 5 °C. During storage, fresh-cut watermelon slices from non-treated and 1-MCP- and 1-MCP + ethylene-treated whole fruit maintained similar respiration rates and internal atmospheres of CO2 and O2 and were of similar quality with total aromatic volatile concentrations decreasing and puncture firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), cut surface pH and color remaining relatively stable. In contrast, fresh-cut slices from fruit treated with ethylene alone had higher respiration rates and modified package atmospheres containing more CO2 and O2; lower firmness, SSC and chromaticity values; higher pH and an altered volatile profile compared to those of slices from non-treated and 1-MCP- and 1-MCP + ethylene-treated fruit. The 22 most abundant volatiles were various aldehydes, alcohols and ketones. During storage, many individual volatiles decreased in concentration but some increased including (Z)-6-nonen-1-ol, a volatile having a pumpkin-like aroma. The results indicated that low dosage 1-MCP treatments prior to ethylene exposure of whole watermelons prevented ethylene-mediated quality deterioration in fresh-cut slices stored under modified atmosphere conditions at 5 °C. 3apostharvest treatment 3afresh-cut foods 3afruit quality 3awatermelons 3aethylene 3acell respiration 3aCitrullus lanatus 3avolatile compounds 3afirmness 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 0a1-methylcyclopropene1 aLuo, Yaguang1 aMcEvoy, James1 aAbbott, Judith A.1 aVinyard, Bryan0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2007 Apr., v.  44, no.  1 p.71-79x0925-52147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/465213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.11.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20101220b20110101c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/09/03  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03834naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159100002100168245008400189300001800273500002400291500001500315520160900330650001001939650001601949650001101965650001701976650003301993650001402026650001802040650002202058650001902080650003702099650001002136650002602146650001402172650003202186650002102218650002302239650002202262650004802284650006902332650002202401650002502423650002802448650001802476650002002494651001802514653002902532653001302561653001402574653002502588700001602613700001502629700001302644700001702657700001502674700001502689700001702704700001802721700001602739773010302755852000902858856011202867930003302979945002503012946001303037961001403050655001203064IND4374232620221119021908.0050912e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437423262DNAL7 a161616972pmid7 a10113/406682hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX380 0aX2001 aGerner-Smidt, P.10aMolecular surveillance of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli O157 by PulseNet USA  ap. 1926-1931.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aPulseNet USA is the national molecular subtyping network system for foodborne disease surveillance. Sixty-four public health and food regulatory laboratories participate in PulseNet USA and routinely perform pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli isolated from humans, food, water, and the environment on a real-time basis. Clusters of infection are detected in three ways within this system: through rapidly alerting the participants in the electronic communication forum, the PulseNet Web conference; through cluster analysis by the database administrators at the coordinating center at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the patterns uploaded to the central server by the participants; and by matching profiles of strains from nonhuman sources with recent human uploads to the national server. The strengths, limitations, and scope for future improvements of PulseNet are discussed with examples from 2002. In that year, notices of 30 clusters of Shiga toxigenic E. coli O157 infections were posted on the Web conference, 26 of which represented local outbreaks, whereas four were multistate outbreaks. Another 27 clusters were detected by central cluster detection performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, of which five represented common source outbreaks confirmed after finding an isolate with the outbreak pattern in the implicated food. Ten food isolates submitted without suspicion of an association to human disease matched human isolates in the database, and an epidemiologic link to human cases was established for six of them. 3afoods 3aenvironment 3ahumans 3aepidemiology 3aelectronic discussion groups 3aribotypes 3aFoodNet (CDC) 3afoodborne illness 3afood pathogens 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3awater 3aEscherichia coli O157 3adatabases 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aCluster Analysis 2aDatabases as Topic 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Fieldxmethods 2aEscherichia coli O157xclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aFood Microbiology 2aInformation Services 2aPopulation Surveillance 2aPublic Health 2aQuality Control 0aUnited States 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0anetworks 0aisolation 0adisease surveillance1 aKincaid, J.1 aKubota, K.1 aHise, K.1 aHunter, S.B.1 aFair, M.A.1 aNorton, D.1 aWoo-Ming, A.1 aKurzynski, T.1 aSotir, M.J.0 tJournal of food protection.g2005 Sept., v.  68, no.  9 p.1926-1931wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/406683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/20  aOther US  aUSDA/FSIS 7aarticle02873naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113100002000131245007300151300001600224500002400240500002400264500001500288520131400303650002101617650001301638650001701651650001801668650002001686650002301706650002101729650002001750650002301770650001101793650001801804650002201822650002301844650001601867650001001883651001201893653001801905653002001923653001201943700002201955700001701977700001801994700001502012773008702027852000902114856011202123930003302235945001302268946001302281961001302294655001202307IND2325178320221120034131.0020205e200111  cou|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232517832DNAL7 a10113/156082hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaferkamp, M.R.10aSuppression of annual bromes impacts rangeland: vegetation responses  ap. 656-662.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  a2019-12-04  aPresence of invading annual bromes (Bromus spp.) can alter seasonal patterns of forage production and quality and require management changes for efficient use of infested rangelands in the Northern Great Plains. We studied biological impacts of the presence of brome by comparing brome infested rangeland to similar sites in which brome had been suppressed with autumn applications of atrazine [6-chloro-N-ethyl-N'-(1-methylethyl)- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine] at 0.56 kg ha(-1) in 1992 and 1993. Each treatment was randomly assigned to three, 12-ha pastures. Vegetation was measured for 5 months (May to September) each year from 1993 to 1995. Each pasture was stocked with 8 cross-bred steers (Bos taurus) from mid-May to mid-September 1993 and 1995 and to mid-August 1994. The forage base varied temporally by date and year, but generally was not less than 800 kg ha(-1). Brome suppression increased (P less than or equal to 0.05) crude protein concentration for western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii Rydb. [Love]) in July (7.1 vs. 9.1%) and August (6.0 vs. 7.1%). With the variation in annual brome stands among years, as influenced by growing conditions, this experiment demonstrated that improvement in forage nutritional quality can be expected from suppression of annual bromes on semiarid rangelands. 3arange management 3aatrazine 3aweed control 3astocking rate 3aBromus tectorum 3aintroduced species 3aBromus japonicus 3aliveweight gain 3aBouteloua gracilis 3asteers 3acrude protein 3aplant competition 3abiomass production 3aPoa secunda 3aforbs 3aMontana 0aprecipitation 0aarid grasslands 0abiomass1 aHeitschmidt, R.K.1 aGrings, E.E.1 aMacNeil, M.D.1 aKarl, M.G.0 tJournal of range management.g2001 Nov., v.  54, no.  6 p.656-662x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/156083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080602b20080704c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03016naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100002000140245013000160300001400290500016500304500002400469520179000493650001202283650001402295650001702309650002102326650001702347700001602364773007102380852000902451856011202460930003302572945002502605946001102630961001302641655001202654IND4429782320221119022030.0091210e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442978232DNAL7 a10113/406692hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aBroderick, C.E.10aFruit composition, tissues, and localization of antioxidants and capsaicinoids in Capsicum peppers by fluorescence microscopy  ap. 85-90.  aPaper presented at the Second International Symposium on Human Health Effects of Fruits and Vegetables.

Whether the pepper type is non-pungent or spicy, the nutritional contribution of peppers to diet and human health is significant. However, the selectivity among seeds, carpal and placental tissues or pericarp tissues, makes a difference in the product harvest and quality of antioxidants and capsaicin. Despite documentary evidence of differences in nutritional status among pepper types, results that qualitatively compare capsaicin or antioxidant levels in different pepper fruit tissues are scarce. Analyses of microscopic images of varieties of tissues of pepper fruits were carried out with equipment at the Microscopic Imaging Laboratory at the Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), Wyndmoor, PA. Various other biochemical tests were carried out at the ERRC and Delaware State University to characterize capsaicinoids, antioxidants, and other biomolecules. Major differences were found among types and varieties. Work is continuing to characterize the tissue concentration and distribution of antioxidant and capsaicin contents in seeds, placental and pericarp tissues, especially in comparing non-pungent and pungent pepper types. Fluorescence images show significant differences among seeds, placenta, and pericarps. Most comparisons limit their discussion to capsaicin, but capsaicinoids and other important biomolecules exist, and their incidence needs better characterization. Fluorescence microscopy provides measures of these compounds and quantifies nutritional contents; results help in developing a more complete picture of the contribution of peppers to human health and nutrition. These characterizations using fluorescence microscopy are presented in this paper. 3apeppers 3acapsaicin 3aantioxidants 3afood composition 3afluorescence1 aCooke, P.H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2009 Aug., , no. 841 p.85-90x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/406693Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aINDdARSe2010/04/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03967naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147024002100166040001800187072001700205072001700222072001700239072001700256100001600273245010900289500002400398506007600422520219800498506003702696650001902733650001502752650003102767650002902798650002202827650001002849650001802859650001602877700001502893700001402908700002702922700001902949700001602968700002002984700001603004700001703020773007803037852000903115856011203124856008303236930003303319945002503352946001103377961001303388655001203401IND4410266420221207091250.0080916s2008    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND441026642DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2164-9-3012doi7 aPMC24478522pmcid7 a185788632pmid7 a10113/193672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This mite reproduces in brood cells and parasitizes immature and adult bees. We investigated whether Varroa infestation induces changes in Apis mellifera gene expression, and whether there are genotypic differences that affect gene expression relevant to the bee's tolerance, as first steps toward unravelling mechanisms of host response and differences in susceptibility to Varroa parasitism. Results: We explored the transcriptional response to mite parasitism in two genetic stocks of A. mellifera which differ in susceptibility to Varroa, comparing parasitized and non-parasitized full-sister pupae from both stocks. Bee expression profiles were analyzed using microarrays derived from honey bee ESTs whose annotation has recently been enhanced by results from the honey bee genome sequence. We measured differences in gene expression in two colonies of Varroa-susceptible and two colonies of Varroa-tolerant bees. We identified a set of 148 genes with significantly different patterns of expression: 32 varied with the presence of Varroa, 116 varied with bee genotype, and 2 with both. Varroa parasitism caused changes in the expression of genes related to embryonic development, cell metabolism and immunity. Bees tolerant to Varroa were mainly characterized by differences in the expression of genes regulating neuronal development, neuronal sensitivity and olfaction. Differences in olfaction and sensitivity to stimuli are two parameters that could, at least in part, account for bee tolerance to Varroa; differences in olfaction may be related to increased grooming and hygienic behavior, important behaviors known to be involved in Varroa tolerance. Conclusion: These results suggest that differences in behavior, rather than in the immune system, underlie Varroa tolerance in honey bees, and give an indication of the specific physiological changes found in parasitized bees. They provide a first step toward better understanding molecular pathways involved in this important host-parasite relationship.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApis mellifera 3ahoney bees 3agene expression regulation 3atranscription (genetics) 3aVarroa destructor 3amites 3aectoparasites 3aparasitoses1 aMigeon, A.1 aAlaux, C.1 aMartin-Magniette, M.L.1 aRobinson, G.E.1 aEvans, J.D.1 aCros-Arteil, S.1 aCrauser, D.1 aLe Conte, Y.0 tBMC genomics.g2008, v.  9, no.  301wJournal:jnl3943740x1471-21647nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/193673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-3013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080925b20081011c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/09/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04047naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072001700131072001700148072001700165100001800182245011900200300001600319500002400335520253800359650001102897650002502908650001902933650001302952650001302965650003402978650001703012650001303029650001703042650001003059650002303069650001303092650002303105700001703128700001703145700001703162773018103179852000903360856011203369930003303481945001303514946001303527961001303540655001203553IND2332885820221119091902.0030603e200301  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233288582DNAL7 a10113/465292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Mill. Yellow Delicious Group] stored 0 to 5 months at 0 degrees C and 7 days at 20 degrees C. Before storage in air at 0 degrees C, preclimacteric fruit were treated with either MCP at a concentration of 1 microliter(.)L-1 for 17 hours at 20 degrees C, 38 degrees C air for 4 days, MCP plus heat, or left untreated. Some sets of untreated fruit were stored in a controlled atmosphere of 1.5 kPa O2 and 2.5 kPa CO2 at 0 degrees C while other sets were removed from cold storage in air after 2.5 or 5 months, warmed to 20 degrees C, and treated with 1 microliter(.)L-1 MCP for 17 hours. Prestorage MCP, heat, MCP plus heat treatments and CA storage decreased decay severity caused by wound-inoculated Penicillium expansum Link, Botrytis cinerea Pers.:Fr., and Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds (teleomorph Glomerella acutata J.C. Guerber & J.C. Correll sp.nov.). Poststorage MCP treatment had no effect on decay severity. Both prestorage MCP treatment and CA storage delayed ripening as indicated by better retention of green peel color, titratable acidity, and Magness-Taylor flesh firmness, and the reduced respiration, ethylene production rates, and volatile levels that were observed upon transferring the fruit to 20 degrees C. The prestorage MCP treatment delayed ripening more than CA storage. Following 5 months cold storage, the prestorage MCP treatment maintained the shape of the compression force/deformation curve compared with that of fruit at harvest, as did CA storage, but at a lower force profile. The heat treatment had mixed effects on ripening: it hastened loss of green peel color and titratable acidity, but maintained firmness and delayed increases in respiration, ethylene production and volatile levels following cold storage. The MCP plus heat treatment inhibited ripening more than heat treatment alone but less than MCP treatment alone. In one of 2 years, the MCP plus heat treatment resulted in superficial injury to some of the fruit. Results indicated that MCP may provide an effective alternative to CA for reducing decay severity and maintaining quality during postharvest storage of 'Golden Delicious' apples. Prestorage heat to control decay and maintain quality of apples needs further study, especially if used in combination with MCP. 3aapples 3ametabolic inhibitors 3aheat treatment 3aripening 3aethylene 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3afood quality 3aduration 3acold storage 3acolor 3atitratable acidity 3afirmness 3avolatile compounds1 aAbbott, J.A.1 aConway, W.S.1 aBarden, C.L.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2003 Jan., v.  128, no.  1 p.120-127aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/465293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101221b20110101c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02068naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002100123040001800144072000900162100001300171245013800184300001300322500002400335520071700359650002601076650002501102650002301127650001701150650000901167650001001176653002101186700001501207700001501222700001601237700001401253773009301267852000901360856008101369856011201450930003301562945001301595946001301608961001301621655001201634IND2060759920221119152418.0971204s1996    nyu|||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND206075992DNAL7 a10.1300/J030v05n03_032doi7 a10113/250992hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5061 aWu, Y.V.10aSensory evaluation and composition of tilapia (Oreochromus niloticus) fed diets containing protein-rich ethanol by-products from corn  ap. 7-16.  aIncludes references  aFish rations containing 16 to 29% of corn gluten meal, corn gluten feed, or corn distillers' grains with solubles and a control commercial feed were fed to tilapia.

Some of this increase is the result of transition of chemists, physicists, and mathematicians to the study of biology, and some is due to improved methods, increased instrument sensitivity, and better techniques of bioinformatics-based data analysis. Proteomic Biological processes are typically studied in isolation, and seldom are efforts made to coordinate results obtained using structural, biochemical, and molecular-genetic strategies. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis can serve as a platform to bridge these disparate results and to additionally incorporate both temporal and anatomical considerations. Recently, proteomic analyses have transcended their initial purely descriptive applications and are being employed extensively in studies of posttranslational protein modifications, protein interactions, and control of metabolic networks. Herein, we provide a brief introduction to sample preparation, comparison of gel-based versus gel-free methods, and explanation of data analysis emphasizing plant reproductive applications. We critically review the results from the relatively small number of extant proteomics-based analyses of angiosperm reproduction, from flowers to seedlings, and speculate on the utility of this strategy for future developments and directions. 3aelectrophoresis 3amass spectrometry 3apollen 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3aseeds1 aPreová, Anna1 aOlmedilla, Adela1 aKlubicová, Katarína1 aObert, Bohuš1 aHajduch, Martin0 tSexual plant reproduction.g2011 Mar., v.  24, no.  1 p.9-22dSpringer-Verlagx0934-08827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-010-0149-53Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/491353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02156naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099024002100143040001800164072000900182072000900191100001500200245011600215300001800331500002500349500001500374520072100389650001601110650001601126650002501142650001101167650002301178650000701201650001501208650001401223650002001237650001501257650001301272653002101285773008101306852000901387856009401396856011201490930003301602945002501635946001301660961001301673655001201686991616082700742620221122154240.0780801s197807  xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891039052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1978.tb15296.x2doi7 a10113/281862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aWang, L.C.10aUltrasonic peptization of soybean proteins from autoclaved flakes, alcohol washed flakes and commercial samples  ap. 1311-1313.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aAn ultrasonic method to peptize soybean proteins from defatted, autoclaved and alcohol-washed flakes and commercial concentrates and isolates was studied.

The present study reaffirmed the fact that sonication can disperse 80% of total proteins from autoclaved flakes with 1 extraction. Also, this method solubilized >90% of the proteins from alcohol-washed flakes. Results from commercial concentrates and isolates varied. The low solubility of autoclaved commercial concentrates is probably due to high acidity rather than the inability to disperse proteins in water by ultrasound. 3asoy protein 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonic treatment 3aflakes 3asalt concentration 3apH 3aextraction 3adefatting 3aprotein content 3aautoclaves 3aalcohols 0asoybean products0 tJournal of food science.g1978 , v.  43, no.  4 p.1311-1313x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1978.tb15296.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/281863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090421b20090508c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/04/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03546naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024002100126040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100003100192245016000223300001600383500002400399520203600423650002102459650002302480650003002503650002702533650003202560650002802592650001902620650001202639650002302651650002702674700002302701773007502724852000902799856008402808856011202892930003303004945002503037946001303062961001303075655001203088IND4460168920221122031544.0110720e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446016892DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-09-10-02312doi7 a10113/499452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF832 0aF821 0aL0011 aBackus, E.

Instead, bacteria are foregut-borne, persistent in adult vectors but semipersistent in immatures (i.e., bacteria colonize cuticular surfaces of the anterior foregut, are retained for hours to days, but are lost during molting). Yet, exactly how a sharpshooter vector inoculates bacteria from foregut acquisition sites is unknown. The present study used confocal laser-scanning microscopy to identify locations in undissected, anterior foreguts of the glassy-winged sharpshooter colonized by green fluorescent protein-expressing X. fastidiosa. Spatial and temporal distributions of colonizing X. fastidiosa were examined daily over acquisition access periods of 1 to 6 days for both contaminated field-collected and clean laboratory-reared Homalodisca vitripennis. Results provide the first direct, empirical evidence that established populations of X. fastidiosa can disappear from vector foreguts over time. When combined with existing knowledge on behavior, physiology, and functional anatomy of sharpshooter feeding, present results support the idea that the disappearance is caused by outward fluid flow (egestion) not inward flow (ingestion) (i.e., swallowing). Thus, results support the hypothesis that egestion is a critical part of the X. fastidiosa inoculation mechanism. Furthermore, results suggest a cyclical, spatiotemporal pattern of microbial colonization, disappearance, and recolonization in the precibarium. Colonization patterns also support two types of egestion, termed rinsing and discharging egestion herein. Finally, comparison of acquisition results for field-collected versus laboratory-reared sharpshooters suggest that there may be competitive binding for optimum acquisition sites in the foregut. Therefore, successful inoculation of X. fastidiosa may depend, in large part, on vector load in the precibarium. 3aPierce's disease 3aXylella fastidiosa 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3abacterial colonization 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aHomalodisca vitripennis 3ainsect vectors 3aforegut 3avectorial capacity 3aplant-insect relations1 aMorgan, David J.W.0 tPhytopathology.g2011 Aug., v.  101, no.  8 p.912-922x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-09-10-02313Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/499453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110826b20110902c00000000  aINDdRSCe2011/08/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02462naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112100001800130245010400148300001600252500002400268500001500292520118300307650001101490650001301501650000801514650002201522650001401544650001901558650001301577650003701590650002101627650002501648650001701673653001201690700001901702700001701721773008601738852000901824856011101833930003301944945001301977946001301990961001302003655001202016IND2035889420221117053528.0931122e199306  ohu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203588942DNAL7 a10113/25102hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpooner, D.M.10aChloroplast DNA evidence for the interrelationships of tomatoes, potatoes, and pepinos (Solanaceae)  ap. 676-688.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe used chloroplast DNA restriction site analysis to test hypotheses of relationships of solanum subgenus potatoe (including potatoes and pepinos), two other Solanum, Cyphomandra (the tree tomatoes), and Lycopersicon (the tomatoes). Capsicum and Datura were used as outgroups. The results support two main clades among the taxa we studied: 1) Solanum subgenus Potatoe and Lycopersicon; and 2) other Solanum and Cyphomandra. Within the first clade, the following groups were supported: a) sect. Basarthrum and sect. Anarrhichomenum; b) sect. Etuberosum; c) sect. Petota; d) sect. Juglandifolium, including subsect. Lycopersicoides; and e) the genus Lycopersicon. These results, in combination with an analysis of morphological data, advocate the controversial, but previously suggested, treatment of Lycopersicon as congeneric with Solanum in subgenus Potatoe. Thus, the cultivated tomato will be recognized as Solanum lycopersicum L. Solanum chmielewskii and Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme are proposed as new combinations; Solanum neorickii is proposed as a new name for Lycopersicon parviflorum. Our data also suggest that Cyphomandra should be included within Solanum. 3aDatura 3anew taxa 3aDNA 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeny 3aSolanum nigrum 3aCapsicum 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aplant morphology 3agenetic polymorphism 3achloroplasts 0aSolanum1 aAnderson, G.J.1 aJansen, R.K.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g1993 June, v.  80, no.  6 p.676-688x0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/25103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070823b20070902c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02033naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024002100099040001800120072000900138072000900147100001900156245004100175300001600216500002500232520074600257650001701003650003601020650001901056650002201075650001301097650002001110650002301130650002501153650002301178650001301201650001501214700001701229773015001246852000901396856011201405930003301517945002501550946001101575961001301586655001201599991616063900742620221121025127.0780601s1977    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890585212DNAL7 a10113/281882hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aL8101 aVanEtten, C.H.10aGlucosinolates in cruciferous plants  ap. 507-520.  aIncludes references.  aVegetables, forage plants and oilseeds from the Cruciferae are of considerable economic importance as food or feed.

Because liquid water absorbs in the shortwave infrared, the normalized difference infrared index (NDII), calculated from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper band 4 (0.76-0.90 μm wavelength) and band 5 (1.55-1.65 μm wavelength), can be used to determine canopy equivalent water thickness (EWT), which is defined as the water volume per leaf area times the leaf area index (LAI). Alternatively, average canopy EWT can be determined using a landcover classification, because different vegetation types have different average LAI at the peak of the growing season. The primary contribution of this study for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 was to sample vegetation for the Arizona and Sonora study areas. Vegetation was sampled to achieve a range of canopy EWT; LAI was measured using a plant canopy analyzer and digital hemispherical (fisheye) photographs. NDII was linearly related to measured canopy EWT with an R2 of 0.601. Landcover of the Arizona, USA, and Sonora, Mexico, study areas were classified with an overall accuracy of 70% using a rule-based decision tree using three dates of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery and digital elevation data. There was a large range of NDII per landcover class at the peak of the growing season, indicating that canopy EWT should be estimated directly using NDII or other shortwave-infrared vegetation indices. However, landcover classifications will still be necessary to obtain total vegetation water content from canopy EWT and other data, because considerable liquid water is contained in the non-foliar components of vegetation. 3avegetation types 3aimage analysis 3acanopy 3amultispectral imagery 3aleaf area index 3aregression analysis 3avegetation cover 3aspatial data 3awater content 3aLandsat 3ameasurement 3aArizona 3aMexico 0aSonora, Mexico 0amethodology 0acanopy equivalent water thickness 0aspectral analysis 0avegetation1 aHunt, E.R.

The Monsanto Centers of Excellence were established to evaluate the potential benefits of conservation tillage across a range of soils and climates. Our objective is to summarize the results from field-scale studies conducted at 12 Centers of Excellence sites in seven states from 1998 through 2002. No-tillage, strip tillage, reduced tillage and conventional tillage cotton production were evaluated in this study. All sites had a no-tillage and conventional tillage system, while eight of the 12 sites had a reduced tillage system and two of the 12 sites had a strip tillage system. Differences among tillage systems within a site did not show any significant effects on soil quality indicators. The variability within a site was quite large due to the limited number of samples collected at each location and the short-period of record covered by the study. Lint yield differences between no-tillage, strip tillage, reduced tillage, and conventional tillage systems were not significant. The 5-year average profit for the no-tillage system ranged from $17 to $164 ha-1 ($7 to $66 ac-1) higher than the other 3 systems. Even though these differences were not significant because of large variations in environment, soil type, and production practices between sites and years the profit was always positive for no-till systems compared to other tillage systems. We conclude that farmers, crop consultants, and others should carefully consider overall profit rather than just crop yield when evaluating alternative tillage practices. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3alint cotton 3acrop yield 3ano-tillage 3astrip tillage 3areduced tillage 3aconventional tillage 3afarm profitability 3aSoutheastern United States1 aAlesii, B.A.1 aBradley, J.F.1 aHatfield, J.L.1 aKarlen, D.L.0 tJournal of soil and water conservation.g2005 , v.  60, no.  5 p.235-242wJournal:1947x0022-45617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/363503Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091205b20100101c00000000  aINDdGAYe2005/12/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02452naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024001900127024002000146040001800166072000900184100001600193245007000209300001600279500002400295520064300319650002500962650001500987650001401002650001801016650001101034650002101045650001801066650002001084650002601104650001401130650001101144650000901155650001201164650002801176650001101204650003001215650003101245650002301276650002601299650002601325650004901351653002301400653001901423700001901442773010001461852000901561856011101570856008501681930003301766945002501799946001301824961001301837655001201850IND4399153020221119142519.0071219e20041001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439915302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2004.04.0282doi7 a153259182pmid7 a10113/86602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aBurri, B.J.10aCarotenoid and retinoid metabolism: insights from isotope studies  ap. 110-119.  aIncludes references  aUse of isotopes as tracers has had an important role in elucidating key features of vitamin A and retinoid metabolism in animal models and humans.

Recently, however, it's meta-population became highly fragmented due to the introduction of high yielding varieties, new crop rotations and new cropping systems. Its genetic divergence was assessed in 289 populations collected from five villages in each of two eco-geographical regions in each country. Total variation in 15 plant, spike and seed attributes was apportioned among populations (13.5%), among farms (18.3%), among villages (16.5%), among eco-geographical regions (46%) and among countries (5.7%). Percent correct classification of germplasm by village based on discriminant analyses was 71 and 65% in semiarid and arid villages, respectively. This confirms the existence of a highly divergent germplasm in this landrace, with geographical distances among villages being correlated with squared Mahalanobis distances based on all 15 plant, spike and seed attributes (r=0.59; p=0.05). 3adurum wheat 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3alandraces 3aphenotypic variation 3ageographical variation 3ageographical distribution 3aplant characteristics 3agrain yield 3aplant growth 3aquantitative traits 3apopulation genetics 3aarid zones 3asemiarid zones 3aenvironmental factors 3aSyria 3aJordan0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2006 , v.  4, no.  3-4 p.186-191x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/163913Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080909b20081011c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/06/27  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02447naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024002700134024002500161024004100186024002300227040001800250100006300268245008200331300001400413520123700427650002001664650001101684650002001695650002301715650002701738650001401765650001201779650001501791650001301806651001301819700002501832773008501857856007701942961000902019852000902028655001202037IND60770933220221214223516.0220321e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077093322DNAL7 a10113/77093322hdl7 a3681212aris7 a10.3146/PS19-18.12doi7 a4341532aris_accn_no7 a3072-21220-008-000D2aris_project_no7 a3681212seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennett, Rebecca S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5901-613610aResistance to Athelia rolfsii and web blotch in the U.S. Mini-core Collection  ap. 17-24.  aAthelia rolfsii (=Sclerotium rolfsii) is a soilborne fungus that causes the disease commonly known as southern blight, southern stem rot, stem rot, and white mold. Despite the fact that A. rolfsii is one of the most destructive pathogens of peanut, the U.S. germplasm collection has not been evaluated for resistance to this pathogen. Therefore, 71 of the 112 accessions comprising the U.S. peanut mini-core collection were evaluated in the field in Oklahoma for resistance to southern blight in 2016 to 2018. Moderate to low levels of southern blight were observed, but four accessions—CC125, CC208, CC559, and CC650—had low levels of disease in 2017 and 2018, the most favorable years for A. rolfsii. Ratings for web blotch, a yield-limiting disease in some peanut production areas, were also taken in 2017 and 2018, when outbreaks of this foliar disease occurred. Five entries—CC287, CC155, CC149, CC812, and CC559—had between 10% and 20% disease in 2018, a year when over half of the mini-core accessions exhibited between 50% and 93% disease. Because cultivated peanut in the U.S. has a narrow genetic base, these results will be useful to breeders seeking additional sources of resistance to A. rolfsii and web blotch. 3aAthelia rolfsii 3ablight 3afoliar diseases 3agenetic background 3agermplasm conservation 3apathogens 3apeanuts 3asoil fungi 3astem rot 3aOklahoma1 aChamberlin, Kelly D.0 tPeanut science.g2020 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.17-24wJournal:15418x0095-36797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3146/PS19-18.13Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001800149245012700167300001600294500016500310500002400475520169900499650001002198650002402208650002302232650001502255773007302270852000902343856011202352930003302464945002502497946001102522961001302533655001202546IND4429996520221119021735.0091215e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442999652DNAL7 a10113/406632hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aQ1001 aLuthria, D.L.10aPhenolic compounds analysis in foods and dietary supplements is not the same using different sample preparation procedures  ap. 381-387.  aPaper presented at the Second International Symposium on Human Health Effects of Fruits and Vegetables. Favhealth 2007, held October 9-13, 2007, Houston, Texas.  aIncludes references  aRecent epidemiological studies suggest a positive correlation between diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a reduced incidence of chronic diseases. This beneficial effect is partially attributed to phenolic phytochemicals, a complex group of secondary metabolites that provide flavor and color to fruits, vegetables, and grains. More than 8,000 different phenolic phytochemicals belonging to different subgroups (polyphenols, phenolic acids, and a miscellaneous group) have been identified. The large number of phenolic compounds, their structural diversity, and their interaction with other cellular constituents present a considerable challenge in developing efficient procedures for optimum extraction and accurate analysis of different plant matrices. This paper illustrates the difficulties related to the extraction of phenolic compounds using examples from peer-reviewed literature. It discusses the importance of optimizing sample preparation procedures for accurate estimation of phenolic compounds from foods (eggplant, soybean and parsley) and dietary supplements (Black cohosh). A comparison of current and classical procedures for the extraction of phenolic phytochemicals is presented. The influence of different extraction parameters, such as solvent composition, particle size, pressure, temperature, solid-to-solvent ratio, and number of extraction cycles is also discussed. A systematic approach for optimum extraction of phenolic phytochemicals from different plant matrices has been included. Accurate quantification of bioactive phenolic phytochemicals will allow researchers to provide better guidelines on dietary intake levels necessary to achieve the optimum health. 3afoods 3adietary supplements 3aphenolic compounds 3aextraction0 tActa horticulturae.g2009 Aug., , no. 841 p.381-387x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/406633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100416b20100501c00000000  aINDdARSe2010/04/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03765naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002000124040001800144072000900162072000900171100001400180245016800194300002000362500002400382520185300406650002002259650002502279650002402304650001402328650002702342650002802369650003402397650002602431650001602457650002702473650002002500650003102520650002002551650001702571653003802588653002502626653002702651700001102678700001202689700001502701700001402716700001302730700001702743700001602760773010102776852000902877856008202886856011102968930003303079945002503112946001303137961001303150655001203163IND4399155220221119142422.0071219e20030926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439915522DNAL7 a10.1074/jbc.M3052132002doi7 a10113/86622hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT200 0aT3001 aLee, J.Y.10aReciprocal Modulation of Toll-like Receptor-4 Signaling Pathways Involving MyD88 and Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/AKT by Saturated and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids  ap. 37041-37051.  aIncludes references  aToll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) can be activated by nonbacterial agonists, including saturated fatty acids. However, downstream signaling pathways activated by nonbacterial agonists are not known. Thus, we determined the downstream signaling pathways derived from saturated fatty acid-induced TLR4 activation. Saturated fatty acid (lauric acid)-induced NFB activation was inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF6, or IB in macrophages (RAW264.7) and 293T cells transfected with TLR4 and MD2. Lauric acid induced the transient phosphorylation of AKT. LY294002, dominant-negative (DN) phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), or AKT(DN) inhibited NFB activation, p65 transactivation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by lauric acid or constitutively active (CA) TLR4. AKT(DN) blocked MyD88-induced NFB activation, suggesting that AKT is a MyD88-dependent downstream signaling component of TLR4. AKT(CA) was sufficient to induce NFB activation and COX-2 expression. These results demonstrate that NFB activation and COX-2 expression induced by lauric acid are at least partly mediated through the TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT induced by lipopolysaccharide or lauric acid. DHA also suppressed NFB activation induced by TLR4(CA), but not MyD88(CA) or AKT(CA), suggesting that the molecular targets of DHA are signaling components upstream of MyD88 and AKT. Together, these results suggest that saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate the activation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathways involving MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 and PI3K/AKT and further suggest the possibility that TLR4-mediated target gene expression and cellular responses are also differentially modulated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. 3adodecanoic acid 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3asignal transduction 3areceptors 3atransmembrane proteins 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3atranscription factors 3amacrophages 3aprostaglandin synthase 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 0amyeloid differentiation factor-88 0aToll-like receptor-4 0anuclear factor kappa B1 aYe, J.1 aGao, Z.1 aYoun, H.S.1 aLee, W.H.1 aZhao, L.1 aSizemore, N.1 aHwang, D.H.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g2003 Sept. 26, v.  278, no.  39 p.37041-37051x1083-351X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M3052132003Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/86623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071221b20080102c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/12/21  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03619naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111024002100143040001800164072000900182100002200191245015900213300001800372500002400390500001500414520141400429650001301843650001601856650001801872650001001890650002101900650002001921650001301941650001301954650001501967650002001982650001502002650001402017650002102031650005702052650002402109650003602133650005102169650005102220650002902271650002302300650002402323650006302347650002102410650005802431650002402489653001902513700002202532700002802554773009002582852000902672856011202681856008202793930003302875945002502908946001102933961001302944655001202957IND4422223320221120080310.0090619e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442222332DNAL7 a195265502pmid7 a10.1002/pmic.2008008752doi7 a10113/320272hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aKrishnan, Hari B.12aA rapid and simple procedure for the depletion of abundant storage proteins from legume seeds to advance proteome analysis: A case study using Glycine max  ap. 3174-3188.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  a2-D analysis of plant proteomes containing thousands of proteins has limited dynamic resolution because only abundant proteins can be detected. Proteomic assessment of the non-abundant proteins within seeds is difficult when 60-80% is storage proteins. Resolution can be improved through sample fractionation using separation techniques based upon different physiological or biochemical principles. We have developed a fast and simple fractionation technique using 10 mM Ca²⁺ to precipitate soybean (Glycine max) seed storage globulins, glycinin and β-conglycinin. This method removes 87±4% of the highly abundant seed proteins from the extract, allowing for 541 previously inconspicuous proteins present in soybean seed to be more detectable (volume increase of greater-than-or-equal50%) using fluorescent detection. Of those 541 enhanced spots, 197 increased more than 2.5-fold when visualized with Coomassie. The majority of those spots were isolated and identified using peptide mass fingerprinting. Fractionation also provided detection of 63 new phosphorylated protein spots and enhanced the visibility of 15 phosphorylated protein spots, using 2-D electrophoretic separation and an in-gel phosphoprotein stain. Application of this methodology toward other legumes, such as peanut, bean, pea, alfalfa and others, also containing high amounts of storage proteins, was examined, and is reported here. 3aproteome 3aGlycine max 3afractionation 3aseeds 3abeta-conglycinin 3aphosphoproteins 3aglycinin 3asoybeans 3aproteomics 3aprotein content 3aseparation 3aglobulins 3astorage proteins 2aAntigens, Plantxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aChemical Fractionationxmethods 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensionalxmethods 2aGlobulinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aPeptide Mappingxmethods 2aProteomexanalysis 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSeed Storage Proteinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSoybean Proteinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aSoybeansxchemistry 0aplant proteins1 aOehrle, Nathan W.1 aNatarajan, Savithiry S.0 tProteomics.g2009 June, v.  9, no.  11 p.3174-3188dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-98537nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/320273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pmic.2008008753Available from publisher's Web site  a20090805b20091002c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/08/05  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03343naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024002600134024002500160024004000185024002300225040001800248100002300266245013100289300001600420520186600436650002202302650001902324650002802343650001102371650001202382650001602394650001402410650000902424650001502433650002402448650001302472650001802485650001902503650001402522650001502536700001702551700002302568700006202591773010202653856007602755961000902831852000902840655001202849IND60770933420221214223506.0220321e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077093342DNAL7 a10113/77093342hdl7 a3686872aris7 a10.3354/aei003812doi7 a4187772aris_accn_no7 a2072-63000-003-00D2aris_project_no7 a3686872seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuething, Kelly A.10aOn the edge: assessing fish habitat use across the boundary between Pacific oyster aquaculture and eelgrass in Willapa Bay, WA  ap. 541-557.  aEstuaries serve as ecological links between terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems, but are subject to diverse anthropogenic stressors. Along the US West Coast, shellfish aquaculture is one potential stressor as it involves extensive use of estuarine tidelands. Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) aquaculture is a century-old practice that significantly contributes to the regional culture and economy. Native eelgrass (Zostera marina) also commonly occurs in intertidal areas where oyster aquaculture is practiced. Seagrasses provide nursery habitat for many commercially harvested species and have recently garnered more conservation interest because of widespread decline. Eelgrass is federally protected as "essential fish habitat", restricting aquaculture activities within or near eelgrass. To inform associated management decisions, we sought to characterize habitat use of aquaculture and eelgrass by fish. Two perspectives shaped the investigation: 1) seascape ecology, highlighting the role of edge effects, and 2) aquaculture method where. Aa recent shift towards off-bottom culture methods, in part to protect seagrasses, precipitated a comparison between long-line and on-bottom aquaculture. Direct (underwater video) and indirect (e.g. predation tethering units) measures of fish distribution and behavior were used to quantify differences along a transect between aquaculture and eelgrass in each type of aquaculture. Results suggest that most fish species use long-line oyster aquaculture and eelgrass habitats similarly with minimal edge effects, but on-bottom aquaculture was used less than the other two habitat types. These results are consistent with previously observed positive relationships between fish abundance and vertical habitat structure but appear to reflect individual species behavior and use of these intertidal habitats. 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aZostera marina 3aanthropogenic stressors 3acoasts 3adecline 3aenvironment 3aestuaries 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3aoyster culture 3apredation 3aseagrasses1 aTomas, Fiona1 aWaldbusser, George1 aDumbauld, Brett R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0113-47910 tAquaculture environment interactions.g2020 Dec., v. 12 p.541-557wJournal:21447x1869-215X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3354/aei003813Available from publisher's Web site  bUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111024002000142040001800162072000900180072000900189100001700198245013400215300001400349500002400363500001500387520129500402650001101697650001401708650001401722650002301736650002301759650003001782650002801812650002001840650001401860650001801874650001201892650002701904650002001931650002301951650002201974650001901996650002102015650002302036653001602059653001502075653002002090773007202110852000902182856008102191856011102272930003302383945002502416946001302441961001302454655001202467IND4387798920221119150111.0070212e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438779892DNAL7 a189429382pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-97-00662doi7 a10113/94562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aHowell, C.R.10aEffect of Seed Quality and Combination Fungicide-Trichoderma spp. Seed Treatments on Pre- and Postemergence Damping-Off in Cotton  ap. 66-71.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGood quality seeds of cotton cultivars often escaped pre-emergence damping-off incited by Pythium spp. and Rhizopus oryzae, and they were resistant to postemergence damping-off incited by Rhizoctonia solani. Poor quality seeds, however, were highly susceptible to both phases of seedling disease and required seed treatment in order to survive. Preemergence damping-off incited by Pythium spp. and Rhizopus oryzae could be controlled by seed treatment with biocontrol preparations of a number of Trichoderma spp., but these treatments were much less effective in controlling postemergence disease incited by Rhizoctonia solani. Postemergence seedling disease can be controlled by fungicides, but they were much less effective in controlling the pre-emergence phase of the disease. Combination seed treatments of poor quality cotton seeds with fungicides and Trichoderma spp. preparations, followed by planting in pathogen-infested soil, indicated that this technique will control both phases of seedling disease. Seed treatment with either the fungicides or the biocontrol agents alone did not achieve this goal. The optimum combination treatment for disease control was that of chloroneb plus Trichoderma spp., followed by chloroneb plus metalaxyl (Deltacoat AD) plus T. virens strain G-6. 3acotton 3ametalaxyl 3acultivars 3aTrichoderma virens 3aGossypium hirsutum 3afungal diseases of plants 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3adisease control 3achloroneb 3apathogenicity 3aPythium 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aRhizopus oryzae 3adisease resistance 3agenetic variation 3aseed treatment 3aapplication rate 3abiological control 0aTrichoderma 0afungicides 0aHypocrea virens0 tPhytopathology.g2007 Jan., v.  97, no.  1 p.66-71x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-97-00663Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/94563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/02/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02837naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152100002000170245008200190300001400272500002400286500001500310520139000325650001401715650002801729650001601757650002701773650001601800650002301816650001701839650002001856650002101876653002601897653002401923700001901947700002001966700001801986773008302004852000902087856011202096856008902208930003302297945001302330946001102343961001302354655001202367IND2053166720221118094623.0960923e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205316672DNAL7 a10.1016/S0733-5210(05)80006-22doi7 a10113/116832hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraybosch, R.A.10aEnvironmental modification of hard red winter wheat flour protein composition  ap. 45-51.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe intrinsic processing quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars is modified significantly by cultural conditions and climate. In an attempt to understand the biochemical basis of such variation environmental modification of flour protein content and composition was measured. Thirty hard red winter wheat cultivars and experimental lines were grown at 17 Nebraska environments during 1990 and 1991. Environmental conditions, including grain filling duration, temperature and relative humidity during grain filling, were monitored. Grain yield and test weight also were determined as environmental indicators. Significant linear correlations between flour protein content, as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, were observed only with the duration of grain filling. Protein quality, as measured by SDS sedimentation volumes and size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, was highly influenced by the frequency of high temperatures during grain filling and by the relative humidity. Observed ranges in genotypic responses (variance) at locations also were altered by environmental factors. Optimal protein quality, as determined by SDS sedimentation volumes, was observed with exposure to less than 90 h of temperature greater than 32 degrees C during grain filling. Protein quality declined with exposure to a greater number of hours of elevated temperature. 3acultivars 3afood processing quality 3awheat flour 3ageographical variation 3adurum wheat 3amolecular genetics 3awinter wheat 3aprotein content 3aclimatic factors 0aenvironmental factors 0aprotein composition1 aPeterson, C.J.1 aBaenziger, P.S.1 aShelton, D.R.0 tJournal of cereal science.g1995 July, v.  22, no.  1 p.45-51x0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/116833Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0733-5210(05)80006-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDdHBI  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03258naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001600149245011200165300001400277500002400291520160600315650002001921650001401941650002001955650002301975650002301998650002802021650002302049650002302072650002102095650002702116650001102143653003702154653004102191700001502232700001702247700002102264700001402285700002402299700002102323700001302344773006302357852000902420856011202429856009302541930003302634945002502667946001102692961001302703655001202716IND4361367020221118000508.0040225s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436136702DNAL7 a10113/143872hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF8311 aRakshit, S.10aDAF marker tightly linked to a major locus for Ascochyta blight resistance in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)  ap. 23-30.  aIncludes references  aResistance of chickpea against the disease caused by the ascomycete Ascochyta rabiei is encoded by two or three quantitative trait loci, QTL1, QTL2 and QTL 3. A total of 94 recombinant inbred lines developed from a wide cross between a resistant chickpea line and a susceptible accession of Cicer reticulatum, a close relative of cultivated chickpea, was used to identify markers closely linked to QTL1 by DNA amplification fingerprinting in combination with bulked segregant analysis. Of 312 random 10mer oligonucleotides, 3 produced five polymorphic bands between the parents and bulks. Two of them were transferred to the population on which the recent genetic map of chickpea is based, and mapped to linkage group 4. These markers, OPS06-1 and OPS03-1, were linked at LOD-scores above 5 to markers UBC733B and UBC181A flanking the major ascochyta resistance locus. OPS06-1 mapped at the peak of the QTL between markers UBC733B (distance 4.1 cM) and UBC181A (distance 9.6 cM), while OPS03-1 mapped 25.1 cM away from marker UBC733B on the other flank of the resistance locus. STMS markers localised on this linkage group were transferred to the population segregating for ascochyta resistance. Three of these markers were closely linked to QTL1. Twelve of 14 STMS markers could be used in both populations. The order of STMS markers was essentially similar in both populations, with differences in map distances between them. The availability of flanking STMS markers for the major resistance locus QTL1 will help to elucidate the complex resistance against different Ascochyta pathotypes in future. 3aCicer arietinum 3achickpeas 3agenetic markers 3aDNA fingerprinting 3achromosome mapping 3aquantitative trait loci 3alinkage (genetics) 3adisease resistance 3aAscochyta rabiei 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3ablight 0aDNA amplification fingerprinting 0asequence-tagged microsatellite sites1 aWinter, P.1 aTekeoglu, M.1 aJuarez Munoz, J.1 aPfaff, T.1 aBenko-Iseppon, A.M.1 aMuehlbauer, F.J.1 aKahl, G.0 tEuphytica.g2003, v.  132, no.  1 p.23-30x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143873Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0014-2336/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2004/03/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03460naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002100124024001800145024002100163040001800184072000900202072000900211072000900220100001400229245005300243300001800296500002400314506007600338520157500414506003701989650002202026650001702048650002002065650001602085650001102101650001702112650002202129650002202151650001802173650002302191650002502214650001802239653001202257653001102269653004402280653003702324653002802361653002002389653001302409700002402422700001502446700001302461773007302474852000902547856011202556856008202668930003302750945001302783946001302796961001302809655001202822IND2199802320221207144921.0990720e199812  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219980232DNAL7 a10.1105/tpc.10.12.20332doi7 aPMC1439712pmcid7 a98367432pmid7 a10113/268612hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aF4001 aZhong, R.10aDual methylation pathways in lignin biosynthesis  ap. 2033-2045.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCaffeoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) has been proposed to be involved in an alternative methylation pathway of lignin biosynthesis. However, no direct evidence has been available to confirm that CCoAOMT is essential for lignin biosynthesis. To understand further the methylation steps in lignin biosynthesis, we used an antisense approach to alter O-methyltransferase (OMT) gene expression and investigated the consequences of this alteration. We generated transgenic tobacco plants with a substantial reduction in CCoAOMT as well as plants with a simultaneous reduction in both CCoAOMT and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (CAOMT). Linin analysis showed that the reduction in CCoAOMT alone resulted in a dramatic decrease in lignin content. The reduction in CCoAOMT also led to a dramatic alteration in lignin composition. Both guaiacyl lignin and syringyl lignin were reduced in the transgenic plants. However, guaiacyl lignin was preferentially reduced, which resulted in an increase in the S/G (syringl/guaiacyl) ratio. We have also analyzed lignin content and composition in transgenic plants having a simultaneous reduction in both CCoAOMT and CAOMT. The reduction in both OMTs resulted in a further decrease in total lignin content. This is in sharp contrast to the effect that resulted from the reduction in CAOMT alone, which only decreased the syringl lignin unit without a reduction in overall lignin content. These results unequivocally demonstrate that methylation reactions in lignin biosynthesis are catalyzed by both CCoAOMT and CAOMT.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atransferases 3aenzyme activity 3amethylation 3alignin 3abiosynthesis 3atransgenic plants 3acomplementary DNA 3aantisense DNA 3achemical structure 3achemical composition 3aplant anatomy 0avessels 0agrowth 0acaffeoyl-coenzyme a o-methyltransferase 0acaffeic acid o-methyltransferase 0asyringyl/guaiacyl ratio 0asyringyl lignin 0aguaiacyl1 aMorrison, W.H.

Cultivars were planted both in inoculated curly top nurseries in Kimberly, ID, and in commercial cultivar trials in irrigated fields near Ontario, OR and Nampa, ID. Plants were evaluated for curly top using a rating scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 9 (dead). Moderate disease pressure in the Ontario (mean rating = 3.8) and Nampa (mean rating = 4.1) fields resulted in significant differences for disease rating, root yield, sugar content, and estimated recoverable sugar among cultivars. Disease ratings from both commercial fields were positively correlated (r = 0.91 and 0.82, P < 0.0001) with ratings from the inoculated nurseries. In commercial fields, root yield was negatively related to disease rating (r2 = 0.47 and 0.39, P <or= 0.0004). For each unit increase in disease rating (increasing susceptibility), root yield decreased 5.76 to 6.93 t/ha. Thus, curly top nurseries reliably predict curly top resistant cultivars for commercial cultivation. 3aBeta vulgaris 3asugar beet 3aBeet curly top virus 3aplant diseases and disorders 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3acrop yield 3adisease severity 3adisease resistance 3acultivars 3adisease outbreaks 3afield experimentation 3asugar content 3avariety trials 3aleaves 3aOregon 3aIdaho1 aGillen, A.M.1 aCamp, S.1 aShock, C.C.1 aEldredge, E.P.1 aGallian, J.J.0 tPlant disease.g2007 Nov., v.  91, no.  11 p.1459-1463x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-91-11-14593Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/28  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02753naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002000134040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190072000900199100002100208245007100229300001400300500002400314500001500338520139100353650001501744650002901759650001901788650002201807650001901829650001701848650001601865653001601881700001801897773008601915852000902001856009202010856011102102930003302213945002502246946001102271961001302282655001202295IND4397810820221120213610.0071113e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439781082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1477-9730.2005.00305.x2doi7 a10113/67812hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aX600 0aB200 0aX2001 aRieke-Zapp, D.H.10aDigital close range photogrammetry for measurement of soil erosion  ap. 69-87.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMany of the processes involved in soil erosion have dimensions on the millimetre scale. Modelling and quantification of such processes require information on soil surface topography with adequate resolution. The purpose of this study was to generate digital elevation models (DEMs) from soil surfaces with high spatial and temporal resolution. Digital photogrammetry was applied for measuring erosion rates on complex-shaped soil surfaces under laboratory rainfall conditions. A total of 60 DEMs were generated, covering a planimetric area of 16 m2. The DEMs had a grid resolution of 3 mm. A vertical precision of approximately 1 mm was desired for DEM analysis. A consumer-grade digital camera was used for image acquisition. The camera was calibrated using BLUH software. Homologous points in overlapping images were identified with least squares matching software. Irregularly spaced object coordinates were interpolated to a regular grid in a geographic information system. The resulting DEMs represented the soil surface well. A precision of 1·26 mm in the vertical was attained. The precision of DEM production was limited to camera calibration. Improvements of the setup presented could include the use of better control points and more advanced image matching strategies for identification of homologous points. The DEMs allowed for detailed analysis of soil surface evolution. 3atopography 3adigital elevation models 3aimage analysis 3acomputer analysis 3aphotogrammetry 3asoil erosion 3ameasurement 0amethodology1 aNearing, M.A.0 tThe Photogrammetric record.g2005 Mar., v.  20, no.  109 p.69-87x0031-868X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-9730.2005.00305.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071116b20071210c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03875naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001600140245010900156300001600265500012800281500007100409500002400480520239400504650001502898650001902913650001502932650001902947650001902966650002402985650001603009650002003025650001503045650003103060651001203091700001603103700002103119773008603140852000903226856011203235930003303347945001303380946001103393961001303404655001203417IND2059629220221120163724.0970913e19970315ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205962922DNAL7 a10113/110312hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX1001 aMoran, M.S.14aThe scaling characteristics of remotely-sensed variables for sparsely-vegetated heterogeneous landscapes  ap. 337-362.  aIn the special issue: Aggregate description of land-atmosphere interactions / edited by J.D.

This uncertainty is directly related to two factors: (1) the nonlinearity of the relation between the sensor signal and Tk, p, H or lambda E; and (2) the heterogeneity of the site. In this study, we compiled several remotely-sensed data sets acquired at different locations within a semi- and rangeland in Arizona, at a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions. These data sets provided the range of data heterogeneities necessary for an extensive analysis of data aggregation. The general technique to evaluate uncertainty was to compare remotely-sensed variables and energy balance components calculated in two ways: first, calculated at the pixel resolution and averaged to the coarser resolution; and second, calculated directly at the coarse resolution by aggregating the fine-resolution data to the coarse scale. Results showed that the error in the aggregation of Tk and p was negligible for a wide range of conditions. However, the error in aggregation of H and lambda E was highly influenced by the heterogeneity of the site. Errors in H larger than 50% were possible under certain conditions. The conditions associated with the largest aggregation errors in H were: 1. sites which are composed of a mix of stable and unstable conditions; 2. sites which have considerable variations in aerodynamic roughness, especially for highly unstable conditions where the difference between surface and air temperature is large; and 3. sites which are characterized by patch vegetation, where the pixel resolution is less than or nearly-equal to the diameter of the vegetation 'element' (in most cases, the diameter of the dominant vegetation type or vegetation patch). Thus, knowledge of the surface heterogeneity is essential for minimizing error in aggregation of H and lambda E. Two schemes are presented for quantifying surface heterogeneity as a first step in data aggregation. These results emphasized the need for caution in aggregation of energy balance components over heterogeneous landscapes with sparse or mixed vegetation types. 3arangelands 3asemiarid zones 3avegetation 3aremote sensing 3aenergy balance 3asurface temperature 3areflectance 3aenergy transfer 3alandscapes 3amathematics and statistics 3aArizona1 aHumes, K.S.1 aPinter, P.J.

Complete genome sequencing of a flavivirus isolated from the brain of a dead Chilean flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis), together with partial sequence analysis of envelope glycoprotein (E-glycoprotein) genes amplified from several other species including mosquitoes and two fatal human cases, revealed that West Nile (WN) virus circulated in natural transmission cycles and was responsible for the human disease. Antigenic mapping with E-glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies and E-glycoprotein phylogenetic analysis confirmed these viruses as WN. This North American WN virus was most closely related to a WN virus isolated from a dead goose in Israel in 1998. 3aWest Nile virus 3aencephalitis 3adisease transmission 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aAntibodies, Viralximmunology 2aBase Sequence 2aBird Diseasesxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aBirdsxvirology 2aDisease Outbreaks 2aEncephalitis Viruses, Japanesexclassificationxgenetics. 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aGenome, Viral 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aSongbirdsxvirology 2aViral Envelope Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aWest Nile Feverxepidemiologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aWest Nile virusxclassificationxgeneticsximmunologyxisolation & purification. 3aNortheastern United States 0aNew Englandxepidemiology. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xepidemiology.1 aRoehrig, J.T.1 aDeubel, V.1 aSmith, J.1 aParker, M.1 aSteele, K.1 aCrise, B.1 aVolpe, K.E.1 aCrabtree, M.B.1 aSchereet, J.H.1 aMacKenzie, J.S.1 aCropp, C.B.1 aPanigrahy, B.1 aOstlund, E.1 aSchmitt, B.1 aMalkinson, M.1 aBanet, C.1 aWeissman, J.1 aKomar, N.1 aSavage, H.M.1 aStone, W.1 aMcNamara, T.1 aGubler, D.J.0 tScience.g1999 Dec. 17, v.  286, no.  5448 p.2333-2337aScience (Weekly)x0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/268623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.286.5448.23333Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03374naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092024002100149040001800170072000900188072000900197100002300206245005400229300001600283500002400299500001500323520178900338592002802127650002302155650001602178650001902194650002902213650001902242650002502261650002202286650001502308653001502323653002302338653001102361700002402372700002702396700002502423773010402448852000902552856011102561856011202672930003302784945002502817946001302842961001302855655001202868IND4451255420221118032101.0110323e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445125542DNAL7 a10.1614/0043-1745(2003)051[0472:PMIPAM]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/486382hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aF6001 aVan Eerd, Laura L.10aPesticide metabolism in plants and microorganisms  ap. 472-495.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUnderstanding pesticide metabolism in plants and microorganisms is necessary for pesticide development, for safe and efficient use, as well as for developing pesticide bioremediation strategies for contaminated soil and water. Pesticide biotransformation may occur via multistep processes known as metabolism or cometabolism. Cometabolism is the biotransformation of an organic compound that is not used as an energy source or as a constitutive element of the organism. Individual reactions of degradation––detoxification pathways include oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and conjugation. Metabolic pathway diversity depends on the chemical structure of the xenobiotic compound, the organism, environmental conditions, metabolic factors, and the regulating expression of these biochemical pathways. Knowledge of these enzymatic processes, especially concepts related to pesticide mechanism of action, resistance, selectivity, tolerance, and environmental fate, has advanced our understanding of pesticide science, and of plant and microbial biochemistry and physiology. There are some fundamental similarities and differences between plant and microbial pesticide metabolism. In this review, directed to researchers in weed science, we present concepts that were discussed at a symposium of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in 1999 and in the subsequent book Pesticide Biotransformation in Plants and Microorganism: Similarities and Divergences, edited by J.

AGR and PAS both received low-input fertilization and SEC received no fertilization. We found that earthworm casts had higher levels of organic hydroxide P than surrounding soils, whereas fertilization increased inorganic hydroxide P. Inorganic P was increased by fertilization, and organic P was increased by earthworm gut passage and/or selection of ingested materials, which increased available P (sum of resin and bicarbonate fractions) and moderately available P (sum of hydroxide and dilute acid fractions), and P fertilizer application and land-use increased available P. The use of a modified sequential P fractionation produced fewer differences between earthworm casts and soils than were expected. We suggest the use of a condensed extraction procedure with three fractions (Available P, Moderately Available P, and Resistant P) that provide an ecologically based understanding of the P availability in soil. Earthworm casts were estimated to constitute 41.0, 38.2, and 26.0 kg ha-1 of total available P stocks (sum of resin and bicarbonate fractions) in the agroforestry system, pasture, and secondary forest, respectively. 3aphosphorus 3asoil nutrients 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3aOxisols 3asecondary forests 3aforest soils 3aearthworms 3aworm casts 3atropical rain forests 3afractionation 3aland use 3aBrazil 3aAmazonia1 aFernandes, E.C.M.1 aLehman, J.1 aRondon, M.A.1 aLuizao, F.J.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 Mar., v.  38, no.  3 p.553-560x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/68743Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2005.06.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20071121b20071210c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/11/08  aNon-US  aUSDA/CSREES 7aarticle03109naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001700140245007700157300001400234500007000248500002400318520153400342650003501876650001601911650001301927650001101940650002201951650001201973650001901985650002302004650002502027650001302052650002602065650002402091653002302115653002602138653003402164653002202198653002402220773006302244852000902307856011202316856009302428930003302521945002502554946001102579961001302590655001202603IND4361393720221118112700.0040226s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436139372DNAL7 a10113/143902hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aJauhar, P.P.10aFormation of 2n gametes in durum wheat haploids: sexual polyploidization  ap. 81-94.  aIn the special issue: Relevance of 2n gametes for plant breeding.  aIncludes references  aAllopolyploidy, resulting from interspecific and intergeneric hybridization accompanied by sexual-doubling of chromosomes, has played a major role in the evolution of crop plants that sustain humankind. The allopolyploid species, including durum wheat, bread wheat, and oat, have developed a genetic control of chromosome pairing that confers on them meiotic regularity (diploid-like chromosome pairing), and hence reproductive stability, and disomic inheritance. Being natural hybrids, they enjoy the benefits of hybridity as well as polyploidy that make them highly adaptable to diverse environments. Despite the complexities of sexual reproduction, it is widespread among plants and animals. Sexual polyploids are highly successful in nature. Sexual polyploidization is far more efficient than somatic chromosome doubling. Sexual polyploidization effected by functioning of unreduced (2n) gametes in the parental species or in their hybrids has been instrumental in producing our grain, fiber, and oilseed crops. Evidence is presented for the occurrence of sexual polyploidization in durum haploids. The Ph1-induced failure of homoeologous pairing is an important factor in the formation of first division restitution (FDR) nuclei and 2n gametes. The evolutionary and breeding significance of sexual polyploidization is discussed. It is emphasized that three factors, viz., sexual reproduction, allopolyploidy, and genetic control of chromosome pairing, jointly constitute a perfect recipe for cataclysmic evolution in nature. 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3adurum wheat 3ahaploidy 3apollen 3achromosome number 3ameiosis 3aallopolyploidy 3achromosome pairing 3acytogenetic analysis 3aseed set 3ain situ hybridization 3asexual reproduction 0aliterature reviews 0ameiotic non-reduction 0agenomic in situ hybridization 0aunreduced gametes 0apollen mother cells0 tEuphytica.g2003, v.  133, no.  1 p.81-94x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143903Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0014-2336/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/03/05  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03228naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170100002200179245011700201300001800318500002400336520168700360650002702047650001202074650001902086650003002105650003502135650003002170650002002200650001402220650002802234650002002262650002802282700002002310700001402330700002002344700002102364773006702385852000902452856011202461856008902573930003302662945002502695946001302720961001302733655001202746IND4451255520221118031946.0110323e200309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445125552DNAL7 a10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00251-32doi7 a10113/486392hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aHiggins, James A.10aRecovery and detection of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts from water samples using continuous flow centrifugation  ap. 3551-3560.  aIncludes references  aContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) was used in conjunction with immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA) and nested PCR to recover and detect oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum and cysts of Giardia intestinalis from 10 L volumes of source water samples. Using a spiking dose of 100 oocysts, nine of 10 runs were positive by IFA, with a mean recovery of 4.4±2.27 oocysts; when another 10 runs were analyzed using nested PCR to the TRAP C-1 and Cp41 genes, nine of 10 were positive with both PCR assays. When the spiking dose was reduced to 10 oocysts in 10 L, 10 of 12 runs were positive by IFA, with a mean oocyst recovery of 3.25±3.25 oocysts. When 10 cysts of Giardia intestinalis were co-spiked with oocysts into 10 L of source water, five of seven runs were positive, with a mean cyst recovery of x=0.85±0.7. When 10 oocysts (enumerated using a fluorescence activated cell sorter) were spiked into 10 L volumes of tap water, one of 10 runs was positive, with one oocyst detected. For the majority of the source water samples, turbidities of the source water samples ranged from 1.1 to 22 NTU, but exceeded 100 NTU for some samples collected when sediment was disturbed. The turbidities of pellets recovered using CFC and resuspended in 10 mL of water were very high (exceeding 500 NTU for the source water-derived pellets and 100 NTU for the tap water-derived pellets). While not as efficient as existing capsule-filtration based methods (i.e., US EPA methods 1622/1623), CFC and IMS may provide a more rapid and economical alternative for isolation of C. parvum oocysts from highly turbid water samples containing small quantities of oocysts. 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aoocysts 3acentrifugation 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3afluorescent antibody technique 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aGiardia lamblia 3aturbidity 3amicrobial contamination 3awater treatment 3apathogen identification1 aTrout, James M.1 aFayer, R.1 aShelton, Daniel1 aJenkins, Mark C.0 tWater research.g2003 Sept., v.  37, no.  15 p.3551-35607nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/486393Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0043-1354(03)00251-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20110408b20110507c00000000  aINDdYLPe2011/04/08  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03551naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131072000900149100001300158245011500171300001600286500002400302500001500326520174600341650004302087650001902130650001102149650001902160650001902179650002102198650002302219650002102242650002002263650002302283650003302306650002102339650002102360650001702381650002002398650002002418650001802438650002602456650002802482650004702510653002602557653002302583700001302606700001902619700001602638773009302654852000902747856011102756930003302867945002502900946001102925961001302936655001202949IND4378087820221121083549.0060224e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437808782DNAL7 a155653792pmid7 a10113/62192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aIpek, M.10aDemonstration of linkage and development of the first low-density genetic map of garlic, based on AFLP markers  ap. 228-236.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGarlic (Allium sativum L.) is a long-cultivated, clonally propagated diploid plant (2n=2x=16). With routine seed production now underway, we used populations (MP1 and MP2) generated by self-pollination of unrelated plants to generate two low-density genetic maps of garlic, consisting of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and gene-specific markers. We did not observe any two plants with identical marker patterns in either population, indicating that they were the result of amphimixis rather than apomixis. This is an important finding, since several Alliums are facultative apomicts. A total of 360 markers segregated in MP1 (12.8 AFLP markers per primer combination) and 321 markers segregated in MP2 (13.9 per primer combination) to indicate a fairly high level of genetic heterozygosity in the garlic nuclear genome. Of these markers, 15.3% in MP1 and 24.3% in MP2 had segregation ratios distorted from the expected 3:1. Interestingly, 94.7% of those distorted segregations fit a 15:1 segregation ratio for duplicated loci, suggesting extensive levels of duplication in the garlic genome and supporting similar observations for onion. The genetic map for the MP1 family with 216 markers spanned 1,166 cM of the garlic genome (5.4 cM average), while 143 markers of MP2 spanned 862 cM (6.0 cM average). Gene-specific markers for alliinase, chitinase, sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (SST-1), and chalcone synthase (CHS) were mapped, demonstrating the immediate utility of the garlic genetic map. These two garlic families had relatively few segregating AFLP markers in common, which supports their relatively distant relationship based on diversity analysis. Of those markers that were conserved, linkages were also conserved. 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3alinkage groups 3agarlic 3aAllium sativum 3aheterozygosity 3agene duplication 3achromosome mapping 3agene segregation 3agenetic markers 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGarlicxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenome, Plant 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 0agene-specific markers 0alinkage (genetics)1 aIpek, A.1 aAlmquist, S.G.1 aSimon, P.W.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2005 Jan., v.  110, no.  2 p.228-236x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/62193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20071107b20071210c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/03/10  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02941naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092024002100133040001800154072000900172072000900181100001600190245005900206300001600265500002400281520158900305650002001894650002101914650003101935650001901966650001301985650002301998650001702021650001102038650001402049653001302063700002102076700002002097773007202117852000902189856011202198856009102310930003302401945002502434946001102459961001302470655001202483IND4433411320221123014513.0100301e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443341132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.04.0082doi7 a10113/393652hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aX1001 aGuber, A.K.10aFractal mass–size scaling of wetting soil aggregates  ap. 317-322.  aIncludes references  aStructure is an important factor of soil functioning in ecosystems. Soil aggregate size distributions are commonly used to characterize soil structure. Relationships between density of dry soil aggregates and aggregate size present a different way to use aggregate-related information in soil structure characterization. Those relationships have been simulated assuming soils to be mass fractals. Aggregates in field soil are not air-dry. The relationships between mass and size differ between dry aggregates and wet aggregates because aggregates shrink as water content decreases. Our objective was to find out whether the mass fractal model can be applied to wet aggregates. Aggregates from the plow layer of Greyzem soil were brought to four different levels of water contents, and the kerosene method was used to measure volume of aggregates within diameter ranges of 3–5, 5–7, and 7–10 mm. It appeared that the wetter aggregates were less prone to loosening as the water increased. The mass fractal model was applicable to wet aggregates under the assumption of linear dependence of the fractal dimension Dm and the unit size aggregate mass a on the gravimetric water content w (g g−1). Dependencies Dm=2.925+0.284w and a=0.808−0.123w resulted in R2=0.9999 for the regression line of simulated versus measured aggregate mass. Fractal modeling of mass–size scaling in wet soil aggregates presents a set of aggregate-based parameters for soil structure that may reflect soil properties and can be explored as an index of soil ability to support functions of ecosystems. 3asoil aggregates 3asoil aggregation 3aparticle size distribution 3asoil structure 3aporosity 3asoil water content 3asoil density 3amodels 3aequations 0afractals1 aPachepsky, Ya.A.1 aLevkovsky, E.V.0 tEcological modelling.g2005 Mar., v.  182, no.  3-4 p.317-3227nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393653Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100316b20100403c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/03/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02964naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002100119040001800140072000900158072000900167072000900176100001300185245012200198300001800320500002400338520139800362650001501760650002501775650001101800650001801811650001101829650001901840650002001859650001301879650001301892650002201905650002501927650002201952650002201974650001501996653002402011700001702035700001502052773008502067852000902152856007702161856011202238930003302350945002502383946001302408961001302421655001202434IND4404518720221123034205.0080418e20070515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440451872DNAL7 a10.1021/ac070202e2doi7 a10113/136292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF831 0aL6001 aFeng, J.10aProbability Model for Assessing Proteins Assembled from Peptide Sequences Inferred from Tandem Mass Spectrometry Data  ap. 3901-3911.  aIncludes references  aIn shotgun proteomics, tandem mass spectrometry is used to identify peptides derived from proteins. After the peptides are detected, proteins are reassembled via a reference database of protein or gene information. Redundancy and homology between protein records in databases make it challenging to assign peptides to proteins that may or may not be in an experimental sample. Here, a probability model is introduced for determining the likelihood that peptides are correctly assigned to proteins. This model derives consistent probability estimates for assembled proteins. The probability scores make it easier to confidently identify proteins in complex samples and to accurately estimate false-positive rates. The algorithm based on this model is robust in creating protein complements from peptides from bovine protein standards, yeast, Ustilago maydis cell lysates, and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. It also eliminates the side effects of redundancy and homology from the reference databases by employing a new concept of peptide grouping and by coherently distinguishing distinct peptides from unique records and shared peptides from homologous proteins. The software that runs the algorithm, called PANORAMICS, provides a tool to help analyze the data based on a researcher's knowledge about the sample. The software operates efficiently and quickly compared to other software platforms. 3aproteomics 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aleaves 3aUstilago zeae 3acattle 3aplant proteins 3aanimal proteins 3aproteome 3apeptides 3amass spectrometry 3aprobability analysis 3acomputer analysis 3acomputer software 3aalgorithms 0aPANORAMICS software1 aNaiman, D.Q.1 aCooper, B.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2007 May 15, v.  79, no.  10 p.3901-3911x1520-68827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac070202e3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/136293Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03891naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194100001900203245017200222300001600394500002400410520172100434650001702155650000902172650001802181650002202199650001502221650001402236650002302250650002802273650001202301650002302313650001902336650003502355650003302390650002302423650003302446650002102479650002002500650002202520650003102542650001402573650004402587650003002631650004602661650003802707653001502745700001702760700001302777700001102790700001802801773011002819852000902929856011202938856008503050930003303135945002503168946001103193961001303204655001203217IND4402154420221118083002.0080302e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440215442DNAL7 a181931882pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-007-0687-x2doi7 a10113/306012hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF8311 aJackson, E.

For crown rust of oat, disease severity is commonly assessed based on visual ratings of infection types (IT) and/or diseased leaf area (DLA) of infected plants in the greenhouse or field. These data can be affected by several variables including; (i) non-uniform disease development in the field; (ii) atypical symptom development in the greenhouse; (iii) the presence of multiple pathogenic races or pathotypes in the field, and (iv) rating bias. To overcome these limitations, we mapped crown rust resistance to single isolates in the Ogle/TAM O-301 (OT) recombinant inbred line (RIL) population using detailed measurements of IT, uredinia length (UL) and relative fungal DNA (FDNA) estimates determined by q-PCR. Measurements were taken on OT parents and recombinant inbred lines (RIL) inoculated with Puccinia coronata pathotypes NQMG and LGCG in separate greenhouse and field tests. Qualitative mapping identified an allele conferred by TAM O-301 on linkage group (LG) OT-11, which produced a bleached fleck phenotype to both NQMG and LGCG. Quantitative mapping identified two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) originating from TAM O-301 on LGs OT-11 and OT-32 which reduced UL and FDNA of both isolates in all experiments. Additionally, minor QTLs that reduced UL and FDNA were detected on LGs OT-15 and OT-8, originating from TAM O-301, and on LG OT-27, originating from Ogle. Detailed assessments of the OT population using two pathotypes in both the greenhouse and field provided comprehensive information to effectively map the genes responsible for crown rust resistance in Ogle and TAM O-301 to NQMG and LGCG. 3aAvena sativa 3aoats 3arust diseases 3aPuccinia coronata 3apathotypes 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3aquantitative trait loci 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3alinkage groups 2aAvenaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aBasidiomycotaxpathogenicity 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 0acrown rust1 aObert, D.

Therefore, discovery of novel germplasm with significant variability or higher micronutrients content in crop seeds is critical. Currently, there is no information available on the effects of chromosome or chromosome arm substitution in cotton on cottonseed micronutrients. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of chromosome or chromosome arm substitution on the variability and levels of micronutrients B, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Ni in cottonseed in chromosome substitution (CS) cotton lines. Nine CS lines were grown in two-field experiments at two locations (in 2013 in South Carolina, USA; and in 2014 in Mississippi, USA). TM-1 (the recurrent parent of the CS line) and AM UA48 (cultivar) were used as control. The results showed significant variability among CS lines compared to the controls AM UA48 and TM-1. For example, in South Carolina, B concentration in cottonseed ranged from 10.35 mg kg-1 in CS-M02 to 13.67 mg kg-1 in CS-T04. The concentration of Cu ranged from 4.81 mg kg-1 in CS-B08sh to 7.65 mg kg-1 in CS-T02, and CS-T02 was higher than both controls. The concentration of Fe ranged from 36.09 mg kg-1 to 56.69 mg kg-1 (an increase up to 57%), and six CS lines CS-B02, CS-B08sh, CS-M02, CS-M04, CS-T02, and CS-T04 had higher concentration than both controls in 2013. In 2014 at Mississippi location, similar observation was found with CS lines for micronutrients content. The CS lines with higher concentrations of these micronutrients can be used as a genetic tool towards QTL identification for desired seed traits because these lines are genetically similar with TM-1, except the substituted chromosome or chromosome segment pairs from the alien species. The CS lines provide an effective way of upland cotton improvement by targeted interspecific introgression of valuable seed traits such as cottonseed micronutritional qualities for B, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mn with reduced genetic drag effects of undesirable traits from the alien species. The positive correlation between B, Cu, and Fe at both locations and between Ni and Mn; between Zn and Cu; and between Zn and Ni at both locations signify the importance of a good agricultural and fertilizer management of these nutrients to maintain higher cottonseed nutrients content.  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aboron 3achromosome substitution 3achromosomes 3acopper 3acotton 3acottonseed 3acultivars 3afertilizer application 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic lines 3agenetic similarity 3agood agricultural practices 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aintrogression 3airon 3amanganese 3anickel 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aplant improvement 3aplant micronutrients 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseed characteristics 3azinc 3aMississippi 3aSouth Carolina1 aSaha, Sukumar1 aTonos, Jennifer L.1 aScheffler, Jodi A.1 aJenkins, Johnie Norton1 aMcCarty, Jack C.1 aStelly, David M.0 tPlants.g2020 Aug. 23, v. 9, no. 9 p.1081-wJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90910813Available from publisher's Web site  aUSDAbUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131072000900149100001800158245011200176300001600288500002500304500001500329520031500344650001700659650001800676650001600694650003100710650001800741650001200759650003200771650003100803650002200834650001100856650001900867650000900886650001600895650002700911650002500938650001700963653001600980700001900996700001601015700001701031773006701048852000901115856011201124930003301236946001101269961001301280655001201293IND9301660520221120235301.0930324e197410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930166052DNAL7 a44602872pmid7 a10113/302292hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL1101 aSansing, G.A.10aLethality in mice of double-stranded ribonucleic acid from virus-like particles of Penicillium stoloniferum  ap. 513-521.  aIncludes references.  a2019-12-05  aThe LD50 in mice of intact virus-like particles (VLP) from P. stoloniferum was >240 mg/kg and their component double-stranded RNA was 34 mg/kg.

Total antioxidant metabolism, antioxidant enzyme activity, and antioxidant transcript abundance were characterized before, immediately after, and during recovery from the acute O₃ treatment. Growth at chronic elevated [O₃] increased the total antioxidant capacity of plants, while growth at elevated [CO₂] decreased the total antioxidant capacity. Changes in total antioxidant capacity were matched by changes in ascorbate content, but not phenolic content. The growth environment significantly altered the pattern of antioxidant transcript and enzyme response to the acute O₃ stress. Following the acute oxidative stress, there was an immediate transcriptional reprogramming that allowed for maintained or increased antioxidant enzyme activities in plants grown at elevated [O₃]. Growth at elevated [CO₂] appeared to increase the response of antioxidant enzymes to acute oxidative stress, but dampened and delayed the transcriptional response. These results provide evidence that the growth environment alters the antioxidant system, the immediate response to an acute oxidative stress, and the timing over which plants return to initial antioxidant levels. The results also indicate that future elevated [CO₂] and [O₃] will differentially affect the antioxidant system. 3acarbon dioxide 3amessenger RNA 3aGlycine max 3ametabolism 3aenzymes 3aenzyme activity 3asoybeans 3aozone 3agene expression 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aascorbic acid 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aAtmosphere 2aCarbon Dioxidexpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aOzonexpharmacology 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSoybeansxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 0aplants1 aRogers, Alistair1 aAinsworth, Elizabeth A.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 May, v. 62, no. 8 p.2667-2678dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq4353Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/543943Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/111884_253829l.pdf  aUSDA 7aarticle03921naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100001400191245016000205300001400365500002400379520201900403650003802422650001902460650002502479650002202504650002102526650002002547650002802567650001502595650002002610650001202630650002602642650002902668650001902697650002602716650002102742650002602763650001702789650001502806650002502821650001602846650001602862651001202878700002402890700001702914773008802931856011203019856008303131930003303214945002503247946001303272961001303285852000903298655001203307IND4441701320221121055427.0100824s2009    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND444170132DNAL7 a10.3923/ajpp.2009.58.692doi7 a10113/449472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aQ5041 aNaeem, M.10aAgrobotanical Attributes, Nitrogen-Fixation, Enzyme Activities and Nutraceuticals of Hyacinth Bean (Lahlob purpureus L.): A Bio-Functional Medicinal Legume  ap. 58-69.  aIncludes references  aHyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus L.) accessions of different origins received from USDA, ARS, Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit, Griffin, GA, USA were evaluated for agrobotanical attributes, enzyme activities, nutraceuticals and quality in calcium deficient soil of Aligarh, Western Uttar Pradesh, India.

One facet of such host specialization is likely to be penetration of the host cell wall, a major barrier to infection. A mutation in the pmr5 gene rendered Arabidopsis resistant to the powdery mildew species Erysiphe cichoracearum and Erysiphe orontii, but not to the unrelated pathogens Pseudomonas syringae or Peronospora parasitica. PMR5 belongs to a large family of plant-specific genes of unknown function. pmr5-mediated resistance did not require signaling through either the salicylic acid or jasmonic acid/ethylene defense pathways, suggesting resistance in this mutant may be due either to the loss of a susceptibility factor or to the activation of a novel form of defense. Based on Fourier transform infrared analysis, the pmr5 cell walls were enriched in pectin and exhibited a reduced degree of pectin modification relative to wild-type cell walls. In addition, the mutant had smaller cells, suggesting a defect in cell expansion. A double mutant with pmr6 (defective in a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored pectate lyase-like gene) exhibited a strong increase in total uronic acid content and a more severe reduction in size, relative to the single mutants, suggesting that the two genes affect pectin composition, either directly or indirectly, via different mechanisms. These two mutants highlight the importance of the host cell wall in plant-microbe interactions. 3aethylene 3asignal transduction 3aPseudomonas syringae 3aPeronospora parasitica 3asalicylic acid 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3auronic acids 3aplant proteins 3acell walls 3ajasmonic acid 3apowdery mildew 3adisease resistance 3acell wall components 3aphenotypic variation 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aErysiphe cichoracearum 3acomplementary DNA 3apectins 3amutation 3aplant morphology 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aCell Wallxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFungixpathogenicity 2aMutation 2aPectinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxgenetics 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 0aErysiphe 0aErysiphe orontii1 aRaab, T.K.1 aSomerville, C.R.1 aSomerville, S.C.0 tPlant journal.g2004 Dec., v.  40, no.  6 p.968-978x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/204123Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081014b20081101c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/01/18  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02505naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002100120040001800141072000900159100001700168245009400185300001600279500002400295500001500319520101100334650004401345650004301389650002201432650001501454650002201469650002301491650001501514650001401529653002201543653001801565653002001583653004001603700001601643773010501659852000901764856011201773856007801885930003301963945001301996946001302009961001302022655001202035IND2039743520221122010708.0940523e199404  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203974352DNAL7 a10.1007/BF025405172doi7 a10113/246092hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX5001 aIsbell, T.A.10aCharacterization of estolides produced from the acid-catalyzed condensation of oleic acid  ap. 379-383.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aEstolides produced from an acid-catalyzed condensation of oleic acid were characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). C-8 reverse-phase HPLC provided a clean resolution of the estolide oligomers present in the reaction mixtures, allowing an average oligomier distribution to be calculated. Corroboration of HPLC results were obtained either through hydrolysis of the estolide mixture and quantitation of the hydroxy fatty acid content by GC, through the integration of the α-methylene protons adjacent to the carbonyl of the acids vs. the esterns in the1H NMR spectrum, or by titration of the carboxylic acid with standardized base. GC and GC-MS analysis of the hydrolyzed estolide mixture indicated that the ester position were centered around the original double-bond position, with linkages ranging from positions 5-13. Likewise, the unsaturation was distributed along the fatty acid backbone. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3afatty acid esters 3ahydrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3aoleic acid 3atitration 0achemical analysis 0apolyestolides 0aoligomerization 0agas chromatograph-mass spectrometry1 aKleiman, R.0 tJournal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g1994 Apr., v.  71, no.  4 p.379-383x0003-021X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246093Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF025405173Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02858naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170100001800179245014100197300001600338500002400354520155500378650002301933650001401956650001701970650002101987650001702008650001702025653001602042700001702058773010502075852000902180856011202189856008902301930003302390945001302423946001102436961001302447655001202460IND2332668220221122005013.0030520e20020505ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233266822DNAL7 a10.1016/S0168-1605(02)00003-X2doi7 a10113/393512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2001 aWhiting, R.C.10aVariation among Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains relative to their growth, survival, thermal inactivation, and toxin production in broth  ap. 127-133.  aIncludes references  aTo estimate the potential outcomes of food processing on the fate of foodborne pathogens, variations in microbial parameters such as growth rate, survival time, thermal inactivation time, and toxin production must be known. Previous microbial studies using single strains or cocktails provide error estimates for the uncertainty of the experimental and statistical procedures, but not for variations among strains. In this study, the behavior of 17 strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 were followed when placed in synthetic media that permitted growth, survival, or thermal inactivation. The parameter values were not rejected as being normal, lognormal, gamma, or Weibull distributions. The ratio of the standard deviation to mean (normal distribution) for the exponential growth rate was 0.16 and for the lag phase duration, it was 0.38. The ratios of times to achieve a 4-log10 reduction at two survival conditions were 0.39 and 0.46; ratios of thermal D values at 55 and 60 degrees C were 0.42 and 0.33, respectively. The ratio of the negative log10 of toxin production was 0.24. These distributions are larger than the coefficient of variations observed for experimental errors in single strain and cocktail experiments. This indicates the limitations in precision that predictions of future population numbers can have when the potential presence of all strains needs to be considered. This variation among strains is applicable whether predictions are made by traditional subjective and point estimates or by using models and risk assessments. 3astrain differences 3amortality 3ainactivation 3abacterial toxins 3abiosynthesis 3acell culture 0agrowth rate1 aGolden, M.H.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2002 May 5, v.  75, no.  1/2 p.127-133x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393513Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1605(02)00003-X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100315b20100403c00000000  aINDdPNN  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02764naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133024002100160040001800181100001500199245009300214300001800307500002400325500001500349506007600364520067400440506003701114650001301151650001501164650002201179650000901201650002301210650001401233650004901247650002601296650002801322650002001350650001301370650004101383650002301424653003701447700001901484700001301503700001601516700001401532700001901546700001801565700002401583700001301607700002001620700002001640773011401660852000901774856011201783856007001895856007701965930003302042945001302075946001302088961001302101655001202114IND2332984320221207130410.0030610e200212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233298432DNAL7 a124810432pmid7 aPMC15402652pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.0122452doi7 a10113/143802hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCone, K.C.10aGenetic, physical, and informatics resources for maize.

The third is a set of informatics tools (such as iMap, cMap, WebFPC, WebChrom and MSL) designed to analyse, search and display the mapping data. Future projections for integrating the maize map are briefly discussed.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3afood crops 3aresearch projects 3acorn 3achromosome mapping 3adatabases 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aComputational Biology 2aContig Mappingxmethods 2aGenetic Markers 2aInternet 2aPhysical Chromosome Mappingxmethods 2aZea maysxgenetics 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aMcMullen, M.D.1 aBi, I.V.1 aDavis, G.L.1 aYim, Y.S.1 aGardiner, J.M.1 aPolacco, M.L.1 aSanchez-Villeda, H.1 aFang, Z.1 aSchroeder, S.G.1 aHavermann, S.A.0 tPlant physiology.g2002 Dec., v.  130, no.  4 p.1598-1605aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143803Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.0122453Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdRSC  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02425naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002000131040001800151072000900169072000900178100001900187245010400206300001800310500002400328500001500352520089900367650002301266650000901289650001001298650001601308650001001324650001901334650002501353650001601378650001601394650002001410650002601430650002101456653002001477653002001497700001601517700002101533773006201554852000901616856011101625856008901736930003301825945002501858946001101883961001301894655001201907IND4394342520221119085352.0070822e20070810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439434252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.05.0282doi7 a10113/26122hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aRegister, K.B.10aImmune response in mice and swine to DNA vaccines derived from the Pasteurella multocida toxin gene  ap. 6118-6128.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aDNA vaccines were constructed with either a 5'-truncated or full-length, genetically detoxified toxin gene from Pasteurella multocida and two different DNA vaccine vectors, distinguished by the presence or absence of a secretion signal sequence. Optimal PMT-specific antibody responses and spleen cell secretion of interferon-γ following immunization of mice were achieved with pMM4, the construct containing a signal sequence and encoding the entire toxin. Antibody responses were also induced in pigs immunized with pMM4 and levels increased significantly following booster injections and experimental infection with P. multocida. Significantly increased expression of interferon-γ was detected in only a small subset of pMM4-immunized pigs.

Low levels of 20-hydroxyecdysone (1 μg/g live weight) stimulated exo-splitting β-N-acetylglucosaminidase about four-fold in integument while higher hormonal levels (15 μg/g) which were less effective for β-N-acetylglucosaminidase induced endo-splitting chitinase about 50-fold. Chitinase activity was increased by about ten-fold over the control level in response to injection of 7.5 μg of 20-hydroxyecdysone/g live weight into abdomens, while β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was elevated only about 1.5-fold over control. Apparently, ecdysteroid causes synthesis or activation of chitinolytic enzymes in vivo and the major regulatory effect is on the level of the endo-splitting chitinase. 3aManduca sexta 3alarvae 3apupae 3amolting 3aecdysteroids 3achitin 3achitinase 3aenzyme activity 3aintegument 3aabdomen1 aKramer, K.J.0 tInsect biochemistry.g1987, v.  17, no.  4 p.547-550x0020-17907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/116783Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0020-1790(87)90053-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04126naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003100132024002100163040001800184100001400202245014600216300001800362500002400380500001500404506007600419520166200495506003702157650002702194650001502221650002002236650001202256650002002268650002202288650002402310650002402334650001502358650002502373650001802398650003002416650002102446650001902467650002202486650002702508650002802535650004902563650002002612650004902632650003302681650004002714653001502754653001502769653002802784653003102812653001202843653002802855700001602883700001902899700001602918773011402934852000903048856008103057856011203138856007003250930003303320945001303353946001303366961001303379655001203392IND2334482420221207103838.0031106e200308  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233448242DNAL7 a129131722pmid7 aPMC1813012pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.103.0239452doi7 a10113/143832hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, H.10aOverproduction of cytokinins in petunia flowers transformed with P(SAG12)-IPT delays corolla senescence and decreases sensitivity to ethylene  ap. 2174-2183.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPlant senescence is regulated by a coordinated genetic program mediated in part by changes in ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and cytokinin content. Transgenic plants with delayed senescence are useful for studying interactions between these signaling mechanisms. Expression of ipt, a cytokinin biosynthetic gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, under the control of the promoter from a senescence-associated gene (SAG12) has been one approach used to delay senescence. We transformed petunia (Petunia x hybrida cv V26) with P(SAG12)-IPT. Two independently transformed lines with extended flower longevity (I-1-7-22 and I-3-18-34) were used to study the effects of elevated cytokinin content on ethylene synthesis and sensitivity and ABA accumulation in petunia corollas. Floral senescence in these lines was delayed 6 to 10 d relative to wild-type (WT) flowers. Ipt transcripts increased in abundance after pollination and were accompanied by increased cytokinin accumulation. Endogenous ethylene production was induced by pollination in both WT and IPT corollas, but this increase was delayed in IPT flowers. Flowers from IPT plants were less sensitive to exogenous ethylene and required longer treatment times to induce endogenous ethylene production, corolla senescence, and up-regulation of the senescence-related Cys protease phcp1. Accumulation of ABA, another hormone regulating flower senescence, was significantly greater in WT corollas, confirming that floral senescence was delayed in IPT plants. These results extend our understanding of the hormone interactions that regulate flower senescence and provide a means of increasing flower longevity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agenetic transformation 3atransgenes 3aPetunia hybrida 3acorolla 3abioaccumulation 3atransgenic plants 3asignal transduction 3aethylene production 3acytokinins 3anucleotide sequences 3aabscisic acid 3aalkyl (aryl) transferases 3aplant morphology 3aplant proteins 2aAgingxphysiology 2aCytokininsxmetabolism 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aFlowersxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression 2aPetuniaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 0asag12 gene 0asenescence 0aisopentenyl transferase 0asenescence-associated gene 0aflowers 0amolecular sequence data1 aJones, M.L.1 aBanowetz, G.M.1 aClark, D.G.0 tPlant physiology.g2003 Aug., v.  132, no.  4 p.2174-2183aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.103.0239453Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/143833Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080509b20080606c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02312naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146072000900164100002200173245011300195300001600308500002800324520117300352650001901525650002301544650001601567650002501583773010501608852000901713856011201722856008301834930003301917946001101950961001301961655001201974IND8600202520221120194304.0860106e198505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860020252DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.27403605042doi7 a10113/430412hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aChapman, G.W.

By using a gas sampling valve fitted with a 0.5ml sample loop, head-space sampling is eliminated. The system is reliable, reproducible, and the data can be obtained in short time periods, as O2 and C02 can be measured simultaneously. With this procedure, a 10°C increase in temperature produced about a two-fold increase in respiration rates &I C02 h-' g-' DM) in seed samples at the same moisture level (13%); while a three-fold increase in seed moisture (7% vs 20%) produced a 148-fold increase in respiration rates at 42°C. High RQ values indicated that high temperatures and low seed moisture may have limited O2 uptake by sunflower seed. Under other conditions, the seed respired aerobically and used carbohydrates as an energy source (RQ= 1). Germination test indicated that exposure of sunflower seed to very low O2 and high C02 levels for 24 h did not adversely affect seed viability.

Three practical diets were formulated to contain 25, 35, or 45% crude protein with digestible energy/protein ratio of 10.0, 8.1, or 6.8 Kcal/g, respectively. Juvenile channel catfish (mean initial weight: 15.1 g/fish) were fed the experimental diets twice daily to approximate satiation for 8 wk. Regardless of dietary protein concentration, the USDA 103 strain consumed more feed, gained more weight, and converted feed more efficiently than other two strains. The MN strain consumed less feed and gained less weight than the other strains. Regardless of the strain of channel catfish, differences in weight gain, feed consumption, and feed conversion ratio were observed among fish fed diets containing various levels of protein with the 35% protein diet being the best. Neither dietary protein concentration nor strain had significant effect on fillet protein level. Data pooled by fish strain showed that fish of MN strain had lower fillet fat and higher moisture than fish of other two strains. Data pooled by dietary protein showed that fish fed the 45% protein diet had a lower level of fillet fat than fish fed the 35% protein diet, but this did not appear to be a strain effect, rather it was a result of decreased feed consumption. Results from this study clearly demonstrate that per formance of the USDA103 strain of channel catfish was superior to other strains tested. The growth characteristics of the USDA103 strain of channel catfish make the strain a promising candidate for commercialization. However, data are needed on performance of the strain from fingerling to marketable size under conditions similar to those used for the commercial culture of channel catfish prior to their release to the catfish industry. 3adietary protein 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3astrain differences 3afish products 3aliveweight gain 3acrude protein 3awater content 3afeed intake 3aIctalurus punctatus 3adigestible energy 3afish feeding 0aevaluation 0aprotein content 0aratios1 aRobinson, E.H.1 aWolters, W.R.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g1998 June, v.  29, no.  2 p.155-160x0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.1998.tb00974.x3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100315b20100403c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02440naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002100130040001800151100001700169245008300186300001600269500002500285520095800310650002601268650002701294650002201321650002401343650001301367650001001380650001101390650001401401650004401415650002001459653002101479653002501500700002201525700001701547700001701564700001701581700001801598773007401616852000901690856011201699856008801811930003301899946001301932961001301945655001201958IND9102816920221118094639.0910711s1991    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND910281692DNAL7 a10.1016/0020-1790(91)90045-G2doi7 a10113/116812hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, K.J.10aAnalysis of cockroach oothecae and exuviae by solid-state 13C-NMR spectroscopy  ap. 149-156.  aIncludes references.  aSclerotized oothecae from four species of cockroaches, Periplaneta americana, P. fuliginosa, Blatta orientalis and Blattella germanica, were examined by solid-state 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance and chemical analyses. The oothecae were composed of protein, water, calcium oxalate, diphenolic compounds, lipid, and uric acid. Calcium oxalate was the major soluble component in egg cases of P. americana, P. fuliginosa, and B. orientalis. Oothecae of B. germanica had approx. 10-fold less calcium oxalate and extractable diphenols than the other species. The major diphenolic compound extracted in cold dilute perchloric acid was 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Exuviae from P. americana, B. germanica, Gromphadorhina portentosa, Blaberus craniifer, and Leucophaea maderae also were examined by solid-state 13C-NMR. They contained protein, diphenols, and lipid, as well as chitin, which accounted for 3O-42% of the organic content, depending upon the species. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3aPeriplaneta fuliginosa 3aBlatta orientalis 3aBlattella germanica 3aproteins 3awater 3alipids 3auric acid 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3acalcium oxalate 0ainsect egg cases 0adiphenolic compounds1 aChristensen, A.M.1 aMorgan, T.D.1 aSchaefer, J.1 aCzapla, T.H.1 aHopkins, T.L.0 tInsect biochemistry.g1991, v.  21, no.  2 p.149-156x0020-17907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/116813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0020-1790(91)90045-G3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03080naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024004200113040001800155100002200173245009400195300001400289500002400303500001500327506017300342520150100515650001602016650002302032650001202055650002402067650001802091650001102109650001102120650001002131650001602141653001202157700001702169700001802186700001702204700001702221773012302238852000902361856011202370856005502482956007602537961000902613655001202622IND4449204220221119191204.0110211e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444920422DNAL7 a10113/543842hdl7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.2010.00362.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBett-Garber, K.L.10aEffect of storage temperature variations on sensory quality of fresh-cut cantaloupe melon  ap. 19-29.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aConsistent storage temperature of 2-5C for fresh-cut produce is difficult to maintain throughout distribution. This study determined the effects of temperature changes on the sensory quality of fresh-cut cantaloupe. Cantaloupe was processed, packaged and stored for 7 days. Samples were maintained at 4 and 10C (controls) or transferred from 4 to 10C after 24 or 48 h. Descriptive sensory analysis was used to evaluate aroma, flavor and texture after days 2, 5 and 7 of storage. Respiration and weight loss were monitored. Aroma and flavor were affected by temperature treatments. Texture was affected a little by temperature changes. Fruity/melon aroma and flavor, citrus aroma and sweet aromatic flavor were negatively affected by temperature changes compared to control treatments. Musty and rancid/painty flavors and bitter increased due to temperature changes. Respiration and moisture loss were affected more by storage at 10C than temperature change. Temperature increases during storage of fresh-cut fruit decreases product quality. Practical Applications: Ideally, fresh-cut cantaloupe should be stored at 2-5C until consumption. In the real world, this does not always happen. The purpose of this manuscript is to determine the effect on sensory quality when the storage temperature is increased slightly after 24 or 48 h after processing. Slight changes in storage temperature result in sensory quality problems that were not observed at constant storage temperatures of 4 or even 10C. 3acantaloupes 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3astorage temperature 3afruit quality 3aflavor 3aCitrus 3aodors 3aweight loss 0aproduce1 aGreene, J.L.1 aLamikanra, O.1 aIngram, D.A.1 aWatson, M.A.0 tJournal of food quality.g2011 Feb., v. 34, no. 1 p.19-29dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/543843Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2010.00362.x  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/112588_10465.pdf  aUSDA 7aarticle03456naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111024002100144040001800165072000900183100002200192245012500214300001400339500002400353500001500377520159800392650001401990650002002004650002802024650001102052650001002063650001402073650001302087650001802100650002202118650001102140650001102151650001802162650001102180650002402191650001702215650002502232650004102257650001202298650002202310650002302332651002402355651001002379653001502389700002102404700002002425773009702445852000902542856008302551856011202634930003302746945002502779946001302804961001302817655001202830IND4369773020221121134811.0050511e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436977302DNAL7 a147197002pmid7 a10.2460/ajvr.2004.65.402doi7 a10113/471242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aPurdy, Charles W.10aDiversity of Salmonella serovars in feedyard and nonfeedyard playas of the Southern High Plains in the summer and winter  ap. 40-44.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective-To compare Salmonella isolates cultured from feedyard and nonfeedyard (control) playas (ie, temporary shallow lakes) of the Southern High Plains. Sample Population-Water and muck (sediment) samples were obtained from 7 feedyard playas and 3 nonfeedyard playas in the winter and summer. Procedure-Each water and muck sample was enriched with sulfur-brilliant-green broth and incubated in a shaker at 37°C for 24 hours. A sample (100 mL) of the incubated bacterial-enriched broth was then mixed with 100 mL of fresh sulfur-brilliant-green enrichment broth and incubated in a shaker at 37°C for 24 hours. After the second incubation, a swab sample was streaked on differential media. Suspect Salmonella isolates were further identified by use of biochemical tests, and Salmonella isolates were confirmed and serovar determinations made. Results-Salmonella isolates were not recovered from the 3 control playas. Seven Salmonella enterica serovars were isolated from 5 of 7 feedyard playas in the summer, and 13 S enterica serovars were isolated from 7 of 7 feedyard playas in the winter. In the summer, 296 isolates were cultured, and 47 were Salmonella organisms. In the winter, 288 isolates were cultured, and 171 were Salmonella organisms. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that feedyard playas are frequently contaminated with many Salmonella serovars.

The Grande River Basin (GRB), located in Minas Gerais State, is one of the Planning Units for Management of Water Resources (UPGRH) and is divided into seven smaller units of UPGRH. GD1 is one of them that is essential for the future development of Minas Gerais State due to its high water yield capacity and potential for electric energy production. The objective of this study is to apply the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) with GIS PCRaster in order to estimate potential soil loss from the Grande River Basin upstream from the Itutinga/Camargos Hydroelectric Plant Reservoir (GD1), allowing identification of the susceptible areas to water erosion and estimate of the sediment delivery ratio for the adoption of land management so that further soil loss can be minimized. For the USLE model, the following factors were used: rainfall–runoff erosivity (R), erodibility (K), topographic (LS), cover-management (C) and support practice (P). The Fournier Index was applied to estimate R for the basin using six pluviometric stations. Maps of the K, C, LS and P factors were derived from the digital elevation model (DEM), and soil and land-use maps, taking into account information available in the literature. In order to validate the simulation process, Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) was estimated, which is based on transported sediment (TS) to basin outlet and mean soil loss in the basin (MSL). The SDR calculation included data (total solids in the water and respective discharge) between 1996 and 2003 which were measured at a gauging station located on the Grande River and a daily flow data set was obtained from the Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA). It was possible to validate the erosion process based on the USLE and SDR application for the basin conditions, since absolute errors of estimate were low. The major area of the basin (about 53%) had an average annual soil loss of less than 5 t ha− 1 yr− 1. With the results obtained we were able to conclude that 49% of the overall basin presently has soil loss greater than the tolerable rate, thus indicating that there are zones where the erosion process is critical, meaning that both management and land-use have not been used appropriately in these areas of the basin. The methodology applied showed acceptable precision and allowed identification of the most susceptible areas to water erosion, constituting an important predictive tool for soil and environmental management in this region, which is highly relevant for prediction of varying development scenarios for Minas Gerais State due to its hydroelectric energy potential. This approach can be applied to other areas for simple, reliable identification of critical areas of soil erosion in watersheds. 3asediment yield 3asimulation models 3arivers 3athematic maps 3arisk assessment 3aUniversal Soil Loss Equation 3awater erosion 3aBrazil 0amathematical models 0aequations1 aMello, C.R.1 aNorton, L.D.1 aCuri, N.1 aViola, M.R.1 aAvanzi, J.C.0 tCatena.g2009 Oct. 15, v.  79, no.  1 p.49–59-49–597nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/471253Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2009.05.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2011/01/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02507naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001500140245012900155300001800284500002400302520129200326650002301618650002201641650000801663650002501671650002501696653002801721653001901749653001901768700001801787700002001805773009301825852000901918856011201927930003302039945001302072946001102085961001302096655001202109IND2038150420221118050251.0940323e199311  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203815042DNAL7 a10113/341862hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aSeal, B.S.10aAnalysis of feline calicivirus capsid protein genes: identification of variable antigenic determinant regions of the protein  ap. 2519-2524.  aIncludes references  aThree isolates of feline calicivirus (FCV) designated NADC, KCD and CFI/68 were compared for biochemical, serological and genetic variation within the capsid protein gene. The Mr of the capsid protein from purified virions was approximately 66 000 for the NADC virus isolate, which differed slightly from the relative mobilities of the purified capsid proteins of the KCD and CFI/68 isolates. Polyclonal antisera from either cats infected or rabbits hyperimmunized with the CFI/68 isolate cross-reacted with all three isolates by Western blot analysis. However, these polyclonal antisera to CFI/68 varied considerably in their virus-neutralization titres to the KCD and NADC isolates. Nucleotide sequence data confirmed the genetic variability among these FCV isolates. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the capsid protein among isolates revealed two regions of sequence divergence that probably contain the antigenically variable determinants. These hypervariable regions may vary by as much as 55% among isolates of FCV. The amino acid sequence diversity in the hypervariable regions of the KCD and NADC isolates correlated well with the virus-neutralization data and suggests that polyvalent vaccines may be more protective than the commonly used monovalent vaccines. 3aFeline calicivirus 3agenetic variation 3aDNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l09718 0agenbank/l097191 aRidpath, J.F.1 aMengeling, W.L.0 tJournal of general virology.g1993 Nov., v.  74, no.  pt.11 p.2519-2524x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/341863Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aINDdTLX  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02338naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002000123040001800143072000900161072000900170100002100179245008900200300001600289500002400305500001500329520084700344650001901191650002001210650002401230650001501254650002101269650003901290650002101329650001401350650002201364650002301386653001601409653001701425700001701442700002001459700001501479773005501494852000901549856011101558856008101669930003301750945002501783946001101808961001301819655001201832IND4393889220221123020616.0070809e200111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439388922DNAL7 a10.1051/apido:20011002doi7 a10113/23152hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL0021 aFeldlaufer, M.F.10aLincomycin hydrochloride for the control of American foulbrood disease of honey bees  ap. 547-554.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe antibiotic lincomycin hydrochloride was evaluated for toxicity to larval and adult honey bees and for efficacy in controlling American foulbrood disease (AFB).

Recent findings that highly creative workers are drawn to amenity-rich rural areas provide the empiri-cal leverage for testing anecdotal claims that these areas tend to contain small manufacturing bases that are more reliant on innovation. This contrasts with the cost advantage rationale of traditional rural manufacturing, an advantage that is eroding with increased globalization. The analysis provides the first empirical evidence that the start of entrepreneurial manufacturing plants and the adoption of advanced technologies and management practices are strongly asso-ciated with the local employment share in highly creative occupations. 3arural population 3aglobalization 3abusiness enterprises 3amanufacturing 3asurveys 3arural development 3aquality of life 3arural areas 3acost effectiveness 3aeducational status 3acapital 3aFlorida 0arural society 0aliterature reviews1 aMcGranahan, D.A.0 tAgricultural and resource economics review.g2007 Apr., v.  36, no.  1 p.133-148wJournal:22623x1068-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/136263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/04/22  aOther US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle03993naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024001900122024002200141024001900163040001800182072000900200072000900209072000900218100001500227245007900242300001800321500002400339500001500363506007600378520189800454506003702352650003602389650001902425650001002444650002502454650002402479650001202503650002402515650001802539650001302557650002702570650002802597650002402625650001402649650002302663650002702686650004202713653001102755653002802766653002502794700001702819700001702836700001102853700001702864700001602881700001702897700001502914773008302929852000903012856011003021856008003131930003303211945002503244946001303269961001303282655001203295IND4392152720221207124922.0070606e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439215272DNAL7 a10.1128/JVI.00464-062doi7 a169122942pmid7 aPMC15638752pmcid7 a10113/2762hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL833 0aL0011 aDelhon, G.10aGenome of Invertebrate Iridescent Virus Type 3 (Mosquito Iridescent Virus)  ap. 8439-8449.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIridoviruses (IVs) are classified into five genera: Iridovirus and Chloriridovirus, whose members infect invertebrates, and Ranavirus, Lymphocystivirus, and Megalocytivirus, whose members infect vertebrates. Until now, Chloriridovirus was the only IV genus for which a representative and complete genomic sequence was not available. Here, we report the genome sequence and comparative analysis of a field isolate of Invertebrate iridescent virus type 3 (IIV-3), also known as mosquito iridescent virus, currently the sole member of the genus Chloriridovirus. Approximately 20% of the 190-kbp IIV-3 genome was repetitive DNA, with DNA repeats localized in 15 apparently noncoding regions. Of the 126 predicted IIV-3 genes, 27 had homologues in all currently sequenced IVs, suggesting a genetic core for the family Iridoviridae. Fifty-two IIV-3 genes, including those encoding DNA topoisomerase II, NAD-dependent DNA ligase, SF1 helicase, IAP, and BRO protein, are present in IIV-6 (Chilo iridescent virus, prototype species of the genus Iridovirus) but not in vertebrate IVs, likely reflecting distinct evolutionary histories for vertebrate and invertebrate IVs and potentially indicative of genes that function in aspects of virus-invertebrate host interactions. Thirty-three IIV-3 genes lack homologues in other IVs. Most of these encode proteins of unknown function but also encode IIV3-053L, a protein with similarity to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit 7; IIV3-044L, a putative serine/threonine protein kinase; and IIV3-080R, a protein with similarity to poxvirus MutT-like proteins. The absence of genes present in other IVs, including IIV-6; the lack of obvious colinearity with any sequenced IV; the low levels of amino acid identity of predicted proteins to IV homologues; and phylogenetic analyses of conserved proteins indicate that IIV-3 is distantly related to other IV genera.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInvertebrate iridescent virus 3 3aviral proteins 3agenes 3arepetitive sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCulicidaexvirology 2aGenome, Viral 2aGenomics 2aIridoviridaexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0agenome 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aTulman, E.R.1 aAfonso, C.L.1 aLu, Z.1 aBecnel, J.J.1 aMoser, B.A.1 aKutish, G.F.1 aRock, D.L.0 tJournal of virology.g2006 Sept., v.  80, no.  17 p.8439-8449x1098-55147nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/2763Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00464-063Available from publisher's Web site  a20070607b20070702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/06/07  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02327naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092024002100117040001800138072000900156072000900165100001700174245009000191300001400281500002500295500002400320520107100344650001901415650001901434650001901453650002001472650002101492651001201513651001201525700002001537700001601557773007701573852000901650856011201659856007501771930003301846946001301879961001301892655001201905IND8800138220221122020343.0880426e198803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880013822DNAL7 a10.2307/34948912doi7 a10113/231512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL8211 aMorgan, P.B.10aManure management as a means of controlling filth flies at agricultural installations  ap. 44-49.  aIncludes references.  aSummary in Spanish.  aA survey of houseflies (Musca domestica) and parasitoids was conducted at 3 poultry installations which practiced different types of manure management in Georgia and Florida. This study demonstrated that parasitoid production and filth fly control at the installation that practiced manure management whereby droppings were removed every 12 months, leaving a thin pad of droppings which provided protection for the indigenous parasitoids and predators until the manure accumulated again, was equal to the control that was obtained at an environmental house, in which mechanical scrapers and augurs continuously moved the manure to an outside holding tank, as well as the control that was achieved at an installation that had been modified to scrape and flush the poultry manure on a daily basis. 495 parasitoids (63% Muscidifurax raptor, 12% Spalangia endius, 7% S. cameroni and 18% S. nigroaenea) emerged from the 2239 pupae collected from the installation that allowed the manure to accumulate.

Our data suggest that calcium not only acts as an important second messenger in the activation of resistance responses but may also be a downstream mediator of later cell death acceleration and completion of the defense reaction. Accordingly, we propose that the existing model of HR should be amended to include a PM Ca²⁺ ATP pump as an important component of the HR to pathogens in plants. 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3atobacco 3aplant response 3aphysiological response 3ahypersensitive response 3acalcium 3aCa2-transporting ATPase 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCalcium Channel Blockersxpharmacology 2aCalcium Signalingxphysiology 2aCalcium-Transporting ATPasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPseudomonas syringaexphysiology 2aTime Factors 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology.1 aShabala, Lana1 aShabala, Sergey0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2008 Jan., v.  49, no.  1 p.40-46x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcm1633Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/03/11  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03194naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001600149245010300165300001600268500002400284500001500308520171600323650001202039650001602051650001602067650002502083650001302108650002102121650001502142650002002157650002002177650001802197650001302215650002502228651001202253653002202265653001902287653001002306653002902316653002902345773009702374852000902471856011202480930003302592945002502625946001302650961001302663655001202676IND4364197320221119135354.0040831s2003    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND436419732DNAL7 a10113/123082hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF1201 aPercy, R.G.10aComparison of bulk F2 performance testing and pedigree selection in thirty pima cotton populations  ap. 123-130.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of early generation testing is to increase breeding efficiency through early identification of superior heterogeneous populations. Bulk F2 testing has gained adherents among the cotton breeding community with little data to support its efficacy. The goal of this study was to compare bulk F2 performance with historical pedigree selection records to determine the degree of correspondence between the two methods in identifying superior hybrid pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense L.) populations. Thirty hybrid populations, originally created in the USDA-ARS Pima breeding project in 1983 and 1984, were recreated. The F2 populations of 1983 and 1984 crosses were tested for yield and fiber performance in randomized complete block tests at Maricopa and Safford, AZ in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Pedigree selection records of the 30 populations were summed across F2, F3, and F4 generations, and correlations were run between the summed selection records and F2 population performance data. Comparisons also were made between F2 performance of populations and the number of lines each contributed to advanced, replicated testing. Significant correlations were almost entirely lacking between selection records of 1983 crosses and the yield and fiber data of their F2 populations. A greater number of correlations were observed between field and fiber lab selection numbers of 1984 crosses and the yield and fiber performance of the F2 populations. These correlations were not consistent between the Maricopa and Safford locations. Weak correspondences were observed between F2 generation performance of the 30 populations and the number of progeny each contributed to advanced, replicated testing. 3ahybrids 3acorrelation 3alint cotton 3aGossypium barbadense 3acrossing 3aagronomic traits 3acrop yield 3aprogeny testing 3aearly selection 3afiber quality 3apedigree 3aartificial selection 3aArizona 0aselection methods 0aplant breeding 0alines 0aearly generation testing 0apedigree selection lines0 tJournal of cotton science.g2003, v.  7, no.  4 p.123-130wJournal:jnl57674x1524-33037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123083Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/09/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01900naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149072000900158100001500167245007000182300001600252500002400268500001500292520060500307650001400912650002200926650002300948650002100971650001800992650001501010650002601025650002301051650001701074650002501091653001501116700002001131773007401151852000901225856011201234930003301346945002501379946001301404961001301417655001201430IND4405146720221116142007.0080502e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440514672DNAL7 a10113/150302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aP200 0aE100 0aX7001 aHansen, L.14aThe value of the reservoir services gained with soil conservation  ap. 285-301.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  a
To evaluate the impact of soil conservation on reservoir services, we extend replacement cost theory to cases where reservoir benefits are restored or preserved for multiple years. The framework is used to value the effect that a marginal change in soil erosion has on current and future reservoir benefits. Results show that, across the 2,111 U.S watersheds, a one-ton reduction in soil erosion provides benefits ranging from zero to $1.38. Furthermore, in a policy application, the lower soil erosion level in 1997, relative to 1982, was shown to have conserved $154 million in reservoir benefits. 3asediments 3asoil conservation 3asediment transport 3awater management 3acost analysis 3awatersheds 3acost benefit analysis 3aeconometric models 3asoil erosion 3aenvironmental policy 0areservoirs1 aHellerstein, D.0 tLand economics.g2007 Aug., v.  83, no.  3 p.285-301x0023-76397nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/05/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle03580naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092024001800126024002100144040001800165072000900183100001500192245010500207300001600312500002400328520165900352650002302011650002102034650001702055650001902072650001002091650003002101650002502131650001802156650001302174650000902187650001302196650000902209650001202218650003102230650002702261650006302288650003002351650002202381650001102403650002702414650003002441650003202471653002302503700001702526700001402543700002002557773010202577852000902679856011202688856008402800930003302884945001302917946001102930961001302941655001202954IND2053582920221122042503.0961017e199607  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205358292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2006.11.0132doi7 a88541762pmid7 a10113/393472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ2001 aDeng, M.Y.10aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli detected in foods by PCR and an enzyme-linked oligonucleotide probe  ap. 217-229.  aIncludes references  aA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and an enzyme-linked oligonucleotide probe hybridization assay were developed for the detection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in ground beef, chicken, pork and raw milk. Two synthetic primers, one of which was biotinylated, were used in the PCR to amplify a fragment of the E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) gene. The identity of the amplified products was confirmed by liquid hybridization using a horseradish peroxidase-linked internal oligonucleotide probe in a 96-well microplate coated with streptavidin. The final quantitation of the PCR products was performed by a colorimetric reaction. Under established conditions (including I min at 60 degrees C for primer annealing and extension in PCR cycles), this method detected all 7 LT-producing E. coli pathogenic for humans, but did not detect all 7 LT-positive E. coli of animal origin. 3 E. coli strains that do not produce LT, and 9 other bacteria. Under less stringent PCR conditions (55 degrees C for annealing and extension), 2 strains of LT-producing E. coli of porcine origin were detected while the results of other bacterial strains remained unchanged. In pure cultures, the detection limit of the method was 1.4 colony forming units (CFU). Prior to PCR amplification, all food samples inoculated with an LT-producing ETEC, were subjected to enrichment in brain heart infusion broth for 8 h at 37 degrees C. From these cultures, 10 microliter was heated at 95 degrees C for 10 min and directly used in the PCR.

Modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), microfibril angle (MFA), wood density, latewood proportion, and sapwood moisture content were examined in 20- to 28-year-old trees from 15 stands that were infected with varying intensities of SNC. SNC severity was quantified by measuring needle retention, the number of needle cohorts retained at three crown levels. Correlations between disease severity and wood properties were examined at both the stand and within-stand levels. Trees from heavily infected stands (needle retention <2 years) had higher MOE, wood density, and latewood proportion and lower sapwood moisture content than trees from healthier stands. Breast-height age (BHage) was also correlated with these properties, but age alone did not explain all of the increases. MFA was not associated with SNC severity. Within stands, needle retention was not associated with MOE or MOR. The increase in latewood proportion in diseased stands appears to be the driving factor behind their increase in stiffness (MOE). Ring width decreased with decreased needle retention, and the examined wood properties generally showed stronger correlations with ring width than with needle retention. 3aplant pathogens 3awood quality 3awood physical properties 3afoliar diseases 3afungal diseases of plants 3amodulus of elasticity 3aforest stands 3awidth 3aforest trees 3alatewood 3aconifer needles 3aPhaeocryptopus 3amodulus of rupture 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3asapwood 3atree damage 3awood strength 3aOregon 0aNorthwestern States. 0aWashington 0aleaves 0awood properties 0amechanical properties 0agrowth rings 0aPhaeocryptopus gaeumannii 0aneedle retention1 aGrotta, A.T.1 aGartner, B.L.1 aDownes, G.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2005 Feb., v.  35, no.  2 p.331-339x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x04-1703Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/12313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdLYNe2006/03/24  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02217naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003800099024001700137024002100154040001800175072000900193072000900202072000900211072000900220100001700229245008300246300001600329500002500345520050500370650001900875650001500894650001600909650001200925650001300937650002000950650001800970650001200988650003201000650002101032650003001053650002001083650003401103650002401137650006601161700001601227700001701243700001701260773008301277852000901360856011201369856008801481930003301569945002501602946001101627961001301638655001201651991586147670742620221119070014.0770801s1977    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790665772DNAL7 a10.1016/0022-1910(77)90044-02doi7 a8532422pmid7 a10113/116732hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS100 0aL001 0aL002 0aL6001 aKramer, K.J.10aInsulin-like hypoglycemic and immunological activities in honeybee royal jelly  ap. 293-295.  aIncludes references.  aAn aqueous extract of royal jelly from Apis mellifera produced hypoglycemia when injected into larvae of Manduca sexta.

Because many of the survival curves were concave, values for two parameters: the asymptotic D-value and the "lag" times were estimated and used to develop secondary models for estimating the time needed to obtain a 7 log10 relative reduction as a function of fat level and temperature. To compute the necessary time, at a given temperature and fat level, the estimated lag time should be added to the product of 7 and the estimated asymptotic D-value. A model was also developed for estimating the standard error of the estimated times, so that upper confidence bounds for the necessary times can be computed. It was found that lag times increase with higher fat levels. The effect of fat on D-values depended on the species; it is estimated that, for a given increase of fat level, the increase of the D-value would be greater for ground chicken than that for ground turkey. In addition, there was a statistically significant species effect on D-values, with higher D-values for ground turkey than for ground chicken at the higher temperatures studied. The thermal death curves displayed a non-linear tendency, however, for estimation purposes, a linear curve was assumed. There was not a statistically significant interaction effect of fat levels and temperatures on D-values, thus, for modeling, it was assumed that z-values were not dependent on the fat levels. The z-values for ground chicken and turkey were estimated to be 5.5 degrees C and 6.1 degrees C, respectively, and are statistically significantly different. These findings should have substantial practical importance to food processors of cooked poultry, allowing them to vary their thermal treatment of ready-to-eat poultry products in a safe manner. 3atemperature 3amathematical models 3aSalmonella 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3ainactivation 3aregression analysis 3aground turkey meat 3aheat treatment 3aground chicken meat 3amortality 0aturkey meat 0achicken meat 0aheat resistance 0apoultry fat1 aEblen, B.S.1 aMarks, H.M.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2001 Oct. 22, v.  70, no.  1/2 p.37-51x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393493Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1605(01)00518-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100315b20100403c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03198naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072000900129072000900138072000900147072000900156100001400165245013700179500005200316500002400368520148900392650002301881650001401904650002601918650001501944650001501959650001401974650002201988650002002010650001902030650001302049650000902062650002002071650001802091650001602109650001302125650001402138651001002152653004902162653003202211653001902243700001702262700001702279700001402296700001502310773006802325852000902393856011002402930003302512945002502545946001302570961001302583655001202596IND4392411920221119233744.0070615s2006    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND439241192DNAL7 a10113/3752hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aJ200 0aF120 0aP2101 aMarek, T.10aEstimating seasonal crop ET using calendar and heat unit based crop coefficients in the Texas High Plains Evapotranspiration Network  aMeeting held July 9-12, 2006, Portland, Oregon.  aIncludes references  aThe Texas High Plains Evapotranspiration (TXHPET) network utilizes a heat unit-based approach (growing degree day concept) in the timing of various crop growth stages along with crop coefficients for computation of crop water use with the newly standardized ASCE/EWRI reference evapotranspiration (ET) equation. Mean crop coefficients of the TXHPET network are empirically derived from measurements using the large, monolithic lysimeters located at the USDA-ARS at Bushland, TX. Average regional crop growth stages are adjusted using multi-year, in-season, recorded data from irrigated producers through the Texas Cooperative Extension's Agri-Partner program. A comparison of the seasonal and crop stages of the TXHPET network as compared with the FAO-56 method, which utilizes date based timing for the crop growth stages, for the major crops of corn, grain sorghum and soybeans is presented. This analysis was conducted to determine if additional, producer requested crops not evaluated with weighing lysimeters would have adequate accuracy based on previously measured crops using the FAO-56 method for irrigation scheduling purposes through the TXHPET network. While there were substantial ET differences in several growth stages of the crops evaluated, the total seasonal crop ET difference as evaluated indicated that use of the calendar based FAO-56 method could provide some degree of guidance to producers irrigating crops not yet evaluated with regional weighing lysimeters. 3aevapotranspiration 3aheat sums 3aplant-water relations 3alysimeters 3asoil water 3aequations 3airrigated farming 3airrigated soils 3amaturity stage 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aSorghum bicolor 3agrain sorghum 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aphenology 3aTexas 0aTexas High Plains Evapotranspiration network 0aevapotranspiration equation 0acrop water use1 aColaizzi, P.1 aHowell, T.A.1 aDusek, D.1 aPorter, D.0 tASABE Annual International Meeting [proceedings].g2006, 7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/3753Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20070620b20070702c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/06/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01682naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092040001800112072000900130072000900139072000900148100001600157245005500173500002400228500001500252520051100267650001200778650002600790650000900816650001100825650001300836651001800849653001800867653002000885700001800905700001500923700001700938773009700955852000901052856011101061930003301172945002501205946000901230961000901239655001201248IND4397073620221120075316.0071026e20031230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439707362DNAL7 a10113/70882hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX300 0aD5001 aFanta, G.F.10aStarch microcapsules for delivery of active agents  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPolysaccharide-based shells are provided having use for forming water-dispersible microcapsular delivery systems for both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and other active agents.

The objectives of this study were to use output data from the Video Image Analysis-Computer Vision System (VIA-CVS, Research Management Systems Inc., Fort Collins, CO) to develop an appropriate method by which performance of video image analysis MS output could be evaluated for accuracy, precision, and repeatability for purposes of seeking official USDA approval for using an instrument in commerce to augment assessment of quality grade, and to use the developed standards to gain approval for VIA-CVS to assist USDA personnel in assigning official beef carcass MS. An initial MS output algorithm was developed (phase I) for the VIA-CVS before 2 separate preliminary instrument evaluation trials (phases II and III) were conducted. During phases II and III, a 3-member panel of USDA expert graders independently assigned MS to 1,068 and 1,242 stationary carcasses, respectively. Mean expert MS was calculated for each carcass. Additionally, a separate 3-member USDA expert panel developed a consensus MS for each carcass in phase III. In phase II, VIA-CVS stationary triple-placement and triple-trigger instrument repeatability values (n = 262 and 260, respectively), measured as the percentage of total variance explained by carcasses, were 99.9 and 99.8%, respectively. In phases II and III, 95% of carcasses were assigned expert MS for which differences between individual expert MS, and for which the consensus MS in phase III only, was [less-than or equal to]96 MS units. Two differing approaches to simple regression analysis, as well as a separate method-comparability analysis that accommodates error in both dependent and independent variables, were used to assess accuracy and precision of instrument MS predictions vs. mean expert MS. Method-comparability analysis was more appropriate in assessing the bias and precision of instrument MS predictions. Ether-extractable fat percentages (n = 257; phase II) differed among MS (P < 0.05) but were not suitable to predict or validate assigned MS. The performance and reproducibility of expert MS assignment in future evaluations was considered, and an official USDA performance standard was established, to which an instrument must conform to be approved for official on-line MS assessment. The VIA-CVS subsequently was approved to assign MS to carcasses on-line after completion of a 2006 USDA instrument approval trial conducted according to methods developed during completion of this study. 3abeef carcasses 3acarcass quality 3abeef quality 3amarbling 3acarcass grading 3ameasuring devices 3aimage analysis 3avideo cameras 3avalidity 3aaccuracy 3arepeatability 3aprecision 3aprediction 3ameat grades 3ameat inspection 3aUSDA 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aFatsxanalysis 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aMeatxanalysisxstandards. 2aMeat-Packing Industryxmethods 2aReproducibility of Results 3aUnited States1 aBass, P.D.1 aGreen, M.D.1 aChapman, P.L.1 aO'Connor, M.E.1 aYates, L.D.1 aScanga, J.A.1 aTatum, J.D.1 aSmith, G.C.1 aBelk, K.E.0 tJournal of animal science.g2010 July, v.  88, no.  7 p.2464-2475dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2009-25933Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/458333Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101124b20101204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/08/04  aOther US  aUSDA/AMS 7aarticle03788naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001500140245011300155300001800268500002400286520232500310650002802635650002002663650001302683650002302696650004402719650004102763650002202804650003002826650002102856650001302877650001902890650001802909650001502927651001302942651001302955700001602968700001602984700001703000773007203017852000903089856011203098930003303210945002503243946001303268961001303281655001203294IND4445262320221122090905.0101119e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444526232DNAL7 a10113/466682hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aChiang, L.10aDifferentiating Impacts of Land Use Changes from Pasture Management in a CEAP Watershed Using the SWAT Model  ap. 1569-1584.  aIncludes references  aDue to intensive farm practices, nonpoint-source (NPS) pollution has become one of the most challenging environmental problems in agricultural and mixed land use watersheds. Usually, various conservation practices are implemented in the watershed to control the NPS pollution problem. However, land use changes can mask the water quality improvements from the conservation practices implemented in the watershed. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the linkage between nutrient input from various pasture management practices and water quality, and to quantify the impacts of land use changes and pasture management on water quality in a pasture-dominated watershed. Land use data from 1992, 1994, 1996, 1999, 2001, and 2004 were evaluated for the land use changes in the watershed, and the corresponding implemented management practices were also incorporated into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The individual impacts of land use change and pasture management were quantified by comparing the SWAT simulation results for different land use change and pasture management scenarios. The results indicated that land use changes resulted in greater total sediment (499 kg ha -1 ) and nitrogen losses (3.8 kg ha -1 ) in the Moores Creek subwatershed, whereas pasture management resulted in greater total nitrogen losses (4.3 kg ha -1 ) in the Beatty Branch subwatershed. Overall, the combined impacts of land use changes and pasture management resulted in greater total sediment (28 to 764 kg ha -1 of cumulative combined impacts between 1992 and 2007) and nitrogen losses (5.1 to 6.1 kg ha -1 ) and less total phosphorus losses (1.5 to 2.1 kg ha -1 ) in the Beatty Branch, Upper Moores Creek, and Moores Creek subwatersheds. By quantifying the individual impacts of land use changes and pasture management, we found that an increase in total nitrogen losses in the Beatty Branch subwatershed was mainly due to an increase in nutrient inputs in the pasture areas, and total sediment and nitrogen losses in the Moores Creek subwatershed were mainly due to an increase in urban lands. Therefore, the individual impacts of land use changes and conservation practices should be quantified to get a true picture of the success of CEAP programs in watersheds experiencing significant land use changes. 3aagricultural watersheds 3aland use change 3apastures 3apasture management 3aConservation Effects Assessment Project 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3apollution control 3anonpoint source pollution 3alosses from soil 3anitrogen 3asediment yield 3awater quality 3aphosphorus 3aArkansas 3aOklahoma1 aChaubey, I.1 aGitau, M.W.1 aArnold, J.G.0 tTransactions of the ASABE.g2010 , v.  53, no.  5 p.1569-15847nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/466683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20101227b20110101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/12/27  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03926naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194100002100203245014300224300001800367500002400385500001500409520169000424650001302114650002602127650001302153650001602166650001002182650001102192650002602203650002702229650002102256650001202277650002502289650002102314650004102335650006202376650002402438650002902462650000902491650004402500650002402544650004402568653001602612653001902628653001902647653002502666653002002691700002202711700003802733700002002771700002202791700002102813773010202834852000902936856008502945856011203030930003303142945002503175946001303200961001503213655001203228IND4415523620221121230926.0090129e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441552362DNAL7 a124922802pmid7 a10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.16622doi7 a10113/231442hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aL8101 aWagner, Bruce A.10aComparison of sampling techniques for measuring the antimicrobial susceptibility of enteric Escherichia coli recovered from feedlot cattle  ap. 1662-1670.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aObjective - To evaluate the effectiveness of various sampling techniques for determining antimicrobial resistance patterns in Escherichia coli isolated from feces of feedlot cattle. Sample Population - Fecal samples obtained from 328 beef steers and 6 feedlot pens in which the cattle resided. Procedure - Single fecal samples were collected from the rectum of each steer and from floors of pens in which the cattle resided. Fecal material from each single sample was combined into pools containing 5 and 10 samples. Five isolates of Escherichia coli from each single sample and each pooled sample were tested for susceptibility to 17 antimicrobials. Results - Patterns of antimicrobial resistance for fecal samples obtained from the rectum of cattle did not differ from fecal samples obtained from pen floors. Resistance patterns from pooled samples differed from patterns observed for single fecal samples. Little pen-to-pen variation in resistance prevalence was observed. Clustering of resistance phenotypes within samples was detected. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Studies of antimicrobial resistance in feedlot cattle can rely on fecal samples obtained from pen floors, thus avoiding the cost and effort of obtaining fecal samples from the rectum of cattle. Pooled fecal samples yielded resistance patterns that were consistent with those of single fecal samples when the prevalence of resistance to an antimicrobial was > 2%. Pooling may be a practical alternative when investigating patterns of resistance that are not rare. Apparent clustering of resistance phenotypes within samples argues for examining fewer isolates per fecal sample and more fecal samples per pen. 3asampling 3aantibiotic resistance 3afeedlots 3abeef cattle 3afeces 3asteers 3aanti-infective agents 3aEscherichia infections 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aCattlexmicrobiology 2aCluster Analysis 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aMale 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Testsxveterinary 2aRegression Analysis 2aSpecimen Handlingxmethodsxveterinary. 0amethodology 0apooled samples 0asingle samples 0aantimicrobial agents 0adrug resistance1 aDargatz, David A.1 aSalmān, Muḥammad,cḌākṭar1 aMorley, Paul S.1 aWittum, Thomas E.1 aKeefe, Thomas J.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g2002 Dec., v.  63, no.  12 p.1662-1670x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.2002.63.16623Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231443Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090202b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/02  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03259naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110024002100132040001800153072000900171100001600180245011500196300001600311500002400327500002300351500001500374506007600389520124700465506003701712650005001749650001801799650001001817650002001827650001701847650002601864650003201890650002201922650001401944650001001958650001201968650007101980650001102051650004202062650002002104650004602124650001402170650001002184650004402194653002802238653000802266653001902274653001802293700002002311773009902331852000902430856011202439930003302551945001302584946001102597961001302608655001202621IND2055993720221207124655.0970318e199507  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205599372DNAL7 a85213512pmid7 aPMC12637642pmcid7 a10113/341812hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aLager, K.M.10aPathogenesis of in utero infection in porcine fetuses with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  ap. 187-192.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorcine fetuses were exposed in utero to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) at stages of gestation ranging from 34 to 85 days and examined 17 to 31 days later to determine the effect of gestational age on fetal susceptibility. For each of the 8 litters tested during the study, all of the fetuses of 1 horn of the uterus were exposed to virus by intraamniotic injection; those of the other horn were exposed similarly to a sham inoculum that consisted of sterile cell culture medium. Viral infectivity titers associated with fetal tissues collected at necropsy indicated that, regardless of gestational age, the virus had replicated in fetuses exposed intraamniotically. In addition, virus had also spread and replicated in sham-inoculated littermates in 3 litters. On the basis of these findings it appears that there may be little or no temporal difference in fetal susceptibility to infection with PRRSV. If so, the lack of early fetal death as a commonly recognized feature of naturally occurring cases of PRRS may be due to a greater resistance of early gestational fetuses to the lethal effects of PRRSV, as suggested by this study, and/or a greater likelihood of transplacental infection during late gestation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apathogenicity 3afetus 3agestational age 3apathogenesis 3abiological resistance 3atransplacental transmission 3avirus replication 3ainfection 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aArterivirus Infectionsxphysiopathologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFetal Diseasesxveterinaryxvirology. 2aGestational Age 2aInfectious Disease Transmission, Vertical 2aPregnancy 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxtransmissionxvirology. 0aintraamniotic infection 0aage 0aanimal viruses 0asow pregnancy1 aMengeling, W.L.0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g1995 July, v.  59, no.  3 p.187-192x0830-90007nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/341813Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03212naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146024002100165040001800186072000900204072000900213100002100222245004100243300001800284500002400302506007600326520101100402506003701413650001801450650001701468650002201485650001901507650002301526650002701549650002801576650002001604650001401624650002301638650001901661650001401680650002001694651001801714653002701732653002101759653001901780653002001799700002201819700002301841700002201864700002301886700002301909700002101932700002101953700001601974700002201990700002002012700001802032700002202050700002202072773009502094852000902189856011202198856008202310930003302392945002502425946001302450961001502463655001202478IND4415535820221207073033.0090130e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441553582DNAL7 a10.3201/eid1412.0713712doi7 aPMC26346122pmcid7 a190465052pmid7 a10113/231452hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aHall, Jeffrey S.10aInfluenza Infection in Wild Raccoons  ap. 1842-1848.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRaccoons (Procyon lotor) are common, widely distributed animals that frequently come into contact with wild waterfowl, agricultural operations, and humans. Serosurveys showed that raccoons are exposed to avian influenza virus. We found antibodies to a variety of influenza virus subtypes (H10N7, H4N6, H4N2, H3, and H1) with wide geographic variation in seroprevalence. Experimental infection studies showed that raccoons become infected with avian and human influenza A viruses, shed and transmit virus to virus-free animals, and seroconvert. Analyses of cellular receptors showed that raccoons have avian and human type receptors with a similar distribution as found in human respiratory tracts. The potential exists for co-infection of multiple subtypes of influenza virus with genetic reassortment and creation of novel strains of influenza virus. Experimental and field data indicate that raccoons may play an important role in influenza disease ecology and pose risks to agriculture and human health.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aProcyon lotor 3awild animals 3aInfluenza A virus 3aseroprevalence 3aantibody detection 3ageographical variation 3aepidemiological studies 3aavian influenza 3ainfection 3avirus transmission 3aseroconversion 3areceptors 3aimmune response 3aUnited States 0aexperimental infection 0ahuman infl uenza 0avirus shedding 0avirus receptors1 aBentler, Kevin T.1 aLandolt, Gabrielle1 aElmore, Stacey A.1 aMinnis, Richard B.1 aCampbell, Tyler A.1 aBarras, Scott C.1 aRoot, J.

The USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference contains data for about 6040 foods for over 100 compounds. To develop a full nutrient profile for each food costs approximately $12000 (six analytical samples x $2000 per sample). To determine food sampling priorities, the Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) has used the Key Foods approach to generate a list of 666 foods. This method utilizes existing nutrient profiles and nationally representative food consumption survey data collected by USDA in the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals 1994-1996 (CSFII) and by The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). One premise of the project is that more samples will be collected and prepared for those foods which provide important amounts of nutrients of public health significance to the diet and not every sample will be analyzed for all the nutrients currently in NDL's nutrient databases. Even though the list of 666 Key Foods is much more manageable, procedures to set priorities for analysis are still needed. To accomplish this, two approaches were developed. One is based on a point system, and the other on nutrient consumption data. Based on an analysis of the two approaches, the nutrient consumption approach was chosen to be the primary method of selecting foods for analysis. This paper reports details of the two methods to modify the existing Key Foods list to determine new and specific priorities for NFNAP efforts. This program represents a comprehensive approach to collect baseline nationally representative data. Results will be used to update the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference and to establish future priorities for frequency of updates. 3afood research 3afood analysis 3afood consumption 3anutrient intake 3anutrient databanks 3anutrient content 3afood composition 3afoods 3astandards of identity 3aUSDA 0anational food survey1 aPehrsson, P.R.1 aHolden, J.M.0 tJournal of food composition and analysis.g2002 Apr., v.  15, no.  2 p.183-194wJournal:jnl42192x0889-15757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/123023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jfca.2001.10463Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdPNN  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03287naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111024002100144040001800165072000900183072000900192072000900201100001800210245009000228300001600318500002400334500001500358520141800373650003201791650001601823650002701839650001401866650002201880650002301902650002301925650001401948650001101962650001901973650003501992650001802027650002702045650001602072650002202088650002102110651001402131651001802145651001102163651001002174651001102184651001002195651001302205653001002218653001802228700001702246773007402263852000902337856008302346856011202429930003302541945002502574946001302599961001302612655001202625IND4390132520221123032726.0070405e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439013252DNAL7 a189436552pmid7 a10.1094/PHYTO-97-3-03442doi7 a10113/430262hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF200 0aF4001 aOrdonez, M.E.10aVirulence Phenotypes of a Worldwide Collection of Puccinia triticina from Durum Wheat  ap. 344-351.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA total of 78 isolates of Puccinia triticina from durum wheat from Argentina, Chile, Ethiopia, France, Mexico, Spain and the United States and 10 representative isolates of P. triticina from common wheat from the United States were tested for virulence phenotypes on seedling plants of 35 near-isogenic lines of Thatcher wheat. Isolates with virulence on lines with leaf rust resistance genes Lr10, Lr14b, Lr20, Lr22a, Lr23, Lr33, Lr34, Lr41, and Lr44 represented the most frequent phenotype. Cluster analysis showed that P. triticina from durum wheat from South America, North America, and Europe had an average similarity in virulence of 90%, whereas isolates from Ethiopia were <70% similar to the other leaf rust isolates collected from durum wheat. Of the 11 isolates from Ethiopia, 7 were avirulent to Thatcher and all near-isogenic lines of Thatcher. The isolates from common wheat had an average similarity in virulence of 60% to all leaf rust isolates from durum wheat. P. triticina from durum wheat was avirulent to many Lr genes frequently found in common wheat. It is possible that P. triticina currently found on durum wheat worldwide had a single origin, and then spread to cultivated durum wheat in North America, South America, and Europe, whereas P. triticina from Ethiopia evolved on landraces of durum wheat genetically distinct from the cultivated durum lines grown in Europe and the Americas. 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3adurum wheat 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aphenotype 3aTriticum aestivum 3adisease resistance 3aPuccinia recondita 3avirulence 3aleaves 3aisogenic lines 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3arust diseases 3ageographical variation 3atetraploidy 3agenetic variation 3aplant morphology 3aArgentina 3aUnited States 3aMexico 3aChile 3aFrance 3aSpain 3aEthiopia 0awheat 0apathogenicity1 aKolmer, J.A.0 tPhytopathology.g2007 Mar., v.  97, no.  3 p.344-351x0031-949X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-97-3-03443Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/430263Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDdMKSe2007/05/03  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03212naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092024002100135040001800156072000900174072000900183100001600192245011600208300001600324500002400340520163200364650001501996650002402011650000702035650001702042650002402059650001702083650002002100650001102120650001302131650002302144650002802167650001902195650002702214650002302241650002202264700001802286773010602304852000902410856011202419856009302531930003302624945002502657946001102682961001302693655001202706IND4373245620221122042505.0050812e20050725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437324562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2004.11.0192doi7 a10113/393412hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ406 0aQ2061 aHwang, C.A.14aThe influence of mayonnaise pH and storage temperature on the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in seafood salad  ap. 277-285.  aIncludes references  aSeafood salad has been identified as a ready-to-eat food with a relatively high incidence of contamination by Listeria monocytogenes; however, little is known about the behavior of this pathogen in seafood salad as a function of product pH and storage temperature. To produce data towards the development of a predictive growth model, a 6-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes was inoculated onto the surface of a shrimp-crabmeat product, mixed with mayonnaise that was previously adjusted with NaOH to pH 3.7, 4.0, 4.4, 4.7 or 5.1, and then stored at 4 degrees, 8 degrees or 12 degrees C under both aerobic and vacuum conditions. At each storage temperature, L. monocytogenes was able to grow in the seafood salad under both aerobic and vacuum conditions. The slowest growth of L. monocytogenes was observed in seafood salad with a mayonnaise pH of 3.7 and a storage temperature of 4 degrees C under vacuum condition. In salad with the same mayonnaise pH, the growth rate (GR, log10 cfu/h) of L. monocytogenes increased as a function of storage temperature. At the same storage temperature, the lag phase duration (LPD, h) of L. monocytogenes decreased as mayonnaise pH increased. At the same mayonnaise pH and temperature, LPD of L. monocytogenes was greater under aerobic than under vacuum conditions. Regression analyses indicated that mayonnaise pH is the main effector on the LPD of L. monocytogenes in seafood salad, and storage temperature was the main effector on the GR. Secondary models that describe LPD and GR of L. monocytogenes in seafood salad as a function of mayonnaise pH and storage temperature were produced. 3amayonnaise 3aplant fats and oils 3apH 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3asalad dressings 3asalads 3aseafoods 3afood contamination 3abacterial contamination 3afood pathogens 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aaerobic conditions 3avacuum processing1 aTamplin, M.L.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2005 July 25, v.  102, no.  3 p.277-285x0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393413Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2004.11.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20100315b20100403c00000000  aINDdPNNe2005/09/01  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02453naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002100134040001800155072000900173100001900182245010000201300001500301500002400316520096500340650002201305650001701327650002301344650002301367650002801390650001501418650004301433700001301476700001501489700001701504700001501521700001701536700001701553700001801570773010001588852000901688856011201697856009201809930003301901945002501934946001101959961001301970655001201983IND4400245820221121164541.0080120e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440024582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2007.01430.x2doi7 a10113/110112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aWeebadde, C.K.10aUsing a linkage mapping approach to identify QTL for day-neutrality in the octoploid strawberry  ap. 94-101.  aIncludes references  aA linkage mapping approach was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with day-neutrality in the commercial strawberry, Fragaria x ananassa (Duch ex Rozier). Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to build a genetic map with a population of 127 lines developed by crossing the day-neutral (DN) 'Tribute' with the short-day (SD) 'Honeoye'. The population was genotyped with AFLP markers and 429 single dose restriction fragments (SDRF) were placed on a consensus map of 1541 cM with 43 linkage groups. Individuals from the mapping population were observed for their flowering habit throughout the growing season in Michigan (MI), Minnesota (MN), Maryland (MD), Oregon (OR) and California (CA). Eight QTL were found that were either location specific or shared among locations. None of these QTL explained >36% of the phenotypic variation, indicating that the inheritance of day-neutrality is likely a polygenic trait. 3aFragaria ananassa 3astrawberries 3alinkage (genetics) 3achromosome mapping 3aquantitative trait loci 3apolyploidy 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism1 aWang, D.1 aFinn, C.E.1 aLewers, K.S.1 aLuby, J.J.1 aBushakra, J.1 aSjulin, T.M.1 aHancock, J.F.0 tPlant breeding.g2008 Feb., v.  127, no.  1 p.94-101dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110113Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2007.01430.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/03/11  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02726naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140072000900149100001800158245008700176300001800263500001500281520086100296650002501157650001801182650001601200650001001216650001901226650002101245650002001266650001701286650001701303650001701320650001301337650001101350650001301361650001001374650001301384650001901397650002601416650001301442650002401455650001701479651001501496653003201511653001501543653002001558653001601578653001401594700001301608700002801621700001801649700001701667700001901684773014401703852000901847856011201856930003301968945002502001946001302026961001302039655001202052IND4425441220221120180058.0090901s2008    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND442544122DNAL7 a10113/357672hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aF820 0aF9001 aFennimore, S.10aFacilitating Adoption of Alternatives to Methyl Bromide in California Strawberries  ap. 1248-1253.  a2019-12-05  aThe objective is to increase adoption of alternatives to methyl bromide (MB) for strawberries. This project will demonstrate which combinations of fumigants applied at reduced rates under impermeable and semi-permeable tarps can sustain strawberry production in commercial fields. The combined strategy of reduced fumigant rates and increased retention may allow for continued use of alternative fumigants despite increasingly stringent regulations on fumigant use. This project will test and demonstrate non-fumigant methods to control key soil pests by steam, non-fumigant chemicals, and natural products such as mustard seed meal. The ultimate goal of this research is to optimize and demonstrate cost-effective treatments that control soil pests and allow profitable California strawberry production to continue without pre-plant soil fumigation by MB. 3aplastic film mulches 3amethyl iodide 3amethodology 3ametam 3adisinfestation 3aapplication rate 3asoil fumigation 3aweed control 3astrawberries 3achloropicrin 3asteaming 3ayields 3aFragaria 3aweeds 3amixtures 3amethyl bromide 3apesticide application 3afurfural 3a1,3-dichloropropene 3apermeability 3aCalifornia 0amethyl bromide alternatives 0apesticides 0apest management 0anew methods 0afumigants1 aAjwa, H.1 aSubbarāv, Kr̥ṣṇa.1 aMartin, Frank1 aBrowne, Greg1 aKlose, Susanne0 tAnnual International Research Conference on Methyl Bromide Alternatives and Emissions Reductions : [proceedings].g2008,  p.1248-12537nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/357673Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091118b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/11/17  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02758naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150100001600159245010500175300001800280500002400298520122400322650001301546650001901559650002501578650002301603650002501626650002301651650001401674650001201688650002401700650001101724650004101735650002701776650002401803650002701827650003101854650001901885700001801904700001601922700001901938773009001957852000902047856011202056930003302168945001302201946001302214961001302227655001202240IND2329002220221121234114.0020920e200109  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232900222DNAL7 a115453742pmid7 a10113/246002hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aCosse, A.A.10aIdentification of a female-specific, antennally active volatile compound of the currant stem girdler  ap. 1841-1853.  aIncludes references  aWe identified (Z)-9-octadecen-4-olide as a female-specific, antennally active compound from the currant stem girdler Janus integer Norton. Female specificity was demonstrated by gas chromatographic comparison of liquid chromatography fractions of male and female volatile emissions and whole body extracts. The gamma-lactone was identified by coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), coupled gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis, microchemical reactions, and GC and MS comparison with authentic standards. GC-EAD analysis of female volatile emissions and cuticular extracts showed a single peak of activity on male antennae, which was not present in male-derived materials. Female antennae did not respond to any of the tested materials. The hydrogenation product of the natural EAD-active material was a known saturated gamma-lactone. The mass spectrum of the dimethyl disulfide derivative of the natural gamma-lactone was consistent with a double bond present in the 9 position. Comparison of the natural gamma-lactone and a synthesized racemic mixture of (Z)-9-octadecen-4-olide on a chiral GC column showed the presence of a single enantiomer in the natural material. 3aCephidae 3asex pheromones 3achemical composition 3avolatile compounds 3aelectroantennography 3achemical structure 3asynthesis 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gas 2aFemale 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHymenopteraxchemistry 2aLactonesxchemistry 2aOleic Acidsxchemistry 2aSex Attractantsxchemistry 2aVolatilization1 aBartelt, R.J.1 aJames, D.G.1 aPetroski, R.J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2001 Sept., v.  27, no.  9 p.1841-1853x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/246003Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20120206b20120302c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02567naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092024002100142040001800163072000900181072000900190072000900199100002100208245007800229300001600307500002400323520098800347650001501335650002301350650002101373650002401394650001701418650001901435650001201454650001101466650002501477653002301502700002501525700001901550700002001569700001801589700002101607700001801628773009901646852000901745856011201754856010001866930003301966945002501999946001302024961001202037655001202049IND4413533620221118191753.0081209s2008    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND441353362DNAL7 a10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.1734262doi7 a10113/268472hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP010 0aJ100 0aL3001 aHendrix, Paul F.10aPandora's Box Contained Bait: The Global Problem of Introduced Earthworms  ap. 593-613.  aIncludes references  aIntroduced exotic earthworms now occur in every biogeographic region in all but the driest or coldest habitat types on Earth. The global distribution of a few species (e.g., Pontoscolex corethrurus) was noted by early naturalists, but now approximately 120 such peregrine species are recognized to be widespread from regional to global scales, mainly via human activities. Species adapted to human transport and to colonization of disturbed habitats are most widespread and are the principal invasive species.We identify a number of endogenous and exogenous factors that may contribute to the successful establishment and spread of peregrine species. Quantification of these factors may help to determine why certain species become invasive while others do not. Recent advances in theory and modeling of biological invasions and in molecular techniques should prove fruitful in improving our understanding of invasive earthworms, as well as in predicting their impacts on ecosystems. 3aearthworms 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3abiogeography 3aanimal ecology 3ahistory 3amodels 3aenvironmental impact 0aliterature reviews1 aCallaham, Mac A.

This paper shows how fundamental chemistry underlying three forms of hydrogels--physical hydrogels, chemical hydrogels, and interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN)--can be integrated to produce a new family of food packaging materials from biopolymers, illustrated here using gelatin and low-methoxyl pectin as examples. Application of this technique to create hydrogels from bio-based materials offers the potential for developing novel, biodegradable packaging applications, particularly for foods, that meet the ever-increasing demands for natural and environmentally compatible materials. 3abiopolymers 3afood packaging 3apackaging materials 3aproduct development 3anew products 3ahydrocolloids 3aelectrostatic interactions 3acrosslinking 3aphysicochemical properties1 aSchaich, Karen M.1 aLiu, LinShu1 aPiergiovanni, Luciano1 aYam, Kit L.0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2009 Aug., v.  20, no.  8 p.316-332x0924-22447nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/330773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2009.04.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20090914b20091106c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/09/11  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03240naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002100149245008200170300001600252500002400268500001500292520135700307650002501664650003201689650001601721650001301737650002701750650002201777650001601799650002601815650002301841650001501864650001201879650001601891650002601907650001501933650003301948650001001981650002401991650002302015650001502038653003202053653001702085653003002102653001602132653001802148700001902166700002502185700002502210700002402235700002802259773009802287852000902385856011202394930003302506945002502539946001302564961001302577655001202590IND4436121920221120172633.0100428s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443612192DNAL7 a10113/471072hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aH0001 aTakemoto, Jon Y.10aInhibition of fungi from diseased grape by syringomycin E-rhamnolipid mixture  ap. 120-124.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFungal infections of vineyard grapes compromise the yield and sensory properties of wines. Consequently, there is a need for more effective fungal control measures. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of a novel lipopeptide fungicidal formulation to control these diseases. A mixture of rhamnolipids (RLs) and the lipodepsinonapeptide syringomycin E (SRE) showed greater inhibitory activities than SRE alone against fungi isolated from grape berries and stems of a heavily infected vineyard in Louisiana. The fungal species tested were Aspergillus japonicus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Curvularia brachyspora, Greeneria uvicola, Nigrospora sphaerica, Trichoderma sp., Penicillium sclerotiorum, and P. thomii. Exposure to SRE resulted in 50% killing of germinating conidia of all these fungal species at concentrations between 0.75 and 3 µM and the SRE + RL mixture gave 50% killing between 0.75 and 1 µM SRE. Nongerminated conidia of only C. brachyspora were killed by SRE alone or SRE + RLs (both giving 50% killing at <1 µM SRE). The RLs alone did not affect the growth of either germinating or nongerminating conidia of these fungi. Results demonstrate the potent and broad fungicidal properties of SRE and show that when mixed with RLs, it is even more lethal to a wide range of grape-associated fungi in the germination stage. 3apesticide synergists 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3aTrichoderma 3apeptides 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aspore germination 3aPenicillium 3aAspergillus japonicus 3afungal antagonists 3aNigrospora 3aconidia 3aviticulture 3aantifungal properties 3aCurvularia 3aCladosporium cladosporioides 3aVitis 3aantifungal proteins 3abiological control 3afungicides 0anovel lipopeptide fungicide 0asyringomycin 0abiological control agents 0arhamnolipid 0afungal spores1 aBensaci, Mekki1 aDe Lucca, Anthony J.1 aCleveland, Thomas E.1 aGandhi, Niranjan R.1 aSkebba, Victoria Palmer0 tAmerican journal of enology and viticulture.g2010, v.  61, no.  1 p.120-124x0002-92547nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/471073Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20110112b20110205c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/05/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03185naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002100124040001800145072000900163072000900172100002300181245008300204300001600287500002400303520143600327650002001763650001401783650001601797650002801813650002701841650001401868650001301882650002801895650002201923650002301945650003301968650001202001650001802013650001502031650002902046650002102075651001502096653002802111700001802139700001702157700001602174700002102190700002402211773007302235852000902308856008202317856011202399930003302511945002502544946001302569961001302582655001202595IND4410800320221118022042.0080930e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441080032DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-92-6-09172doi7 a10113/211512hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aNjambere, Evans N.10aStem and Crown Rot of Chickpea in California Caused by Sclerotinia trifoliorum  ap. 917-922.  aIncludes references  aThe identities of Sclerotinia isolates obtained from chickpea plants showing stem and crown rot were determined using morphological characteristics, variations in group I introns, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Isolates could be separated into two groups based on growth rates at 22°C, fast growing (about 40 mm per day) versus slow growing (about 20 mm per day). All fast-growing isolates induced stronger color change of a pH-indicating medium than did slow-growing isolates at 22°C. The slow-growing isolates contained at least one group I intron in the nuclear small subunit rDNA, whereas all fast-growing isolates lacked group I introns in the same DNA region. ITS sequences of the slow-growing isolates were identical to sequences of Sclerotinia trifoliorum. Those of the fast-growing isolates were identical to sequences of S. sclerotiorum. Finally, the slow-growing isolates showed ascospore dimorphism, a definitive character of S. trifoliorum, whereas the fast-growing isolates showed no ascospore dimorphism. Isolates of both species were pathogenic on chickpea and caused symptoms similar to those observed in the field.

Oxidative damage in liver and kidney (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls) and erythrocytes (erythrocyte resistance to peroxidative lysis, ERPL) was determined after feeding experimental diets for 16 (early December) and 28 (early March) weeks. Only TOCAA influenced oxidative stress in this study, with most measures of oxidative damage decreasing (liver lipid peroxidation in December and March; ERPL in December; liver protein carbonyl in March) with increasing levels of TOCAA. We also observed a TOCAA-stimulated increase in susceptibility of erythrocytes to peroxidative lysis in March at the highest levels of TOCAA. The data suggest that under most circumstances a progressive decrease in oxidative stress occurs as dietary TOCAA increases, but higher TOCAA concentrations can stimulate oxidative damage in some situations. Higher levels of TOCAA in the diet were required in March than in December to achieve comparable levels of protection against oxidative damage, which may have been due to physiological changes associated with the parr-smolt transformation. Erythrocytes appeared to be more sensitive to variation in dietary levels of TOCAA than liver and kidney tissues. Using the March ERPL assay results as a baseline, a TOCAA level of approximately 350-600 mg/kg diet would provide adequate protection against lipid peroxidation under most circumstances in juvenile Chinook salmon. 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3asalmon 3ajuveniles 3avitamin supplements 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aascorbic acid 3adietary mineral supplements 3aselenium 3airon 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3alipid peroxidation 3aexperimental diets 3adose response 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3asynergism 0apro-oxidants1 aCongleton, J.L.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2009 Feb., v.  93, no.  1 p.15-25dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/231363Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00773.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090202b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/02  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03607naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150100001600159245016000175300001600335500002400351500001500375520159500390650000901985650001601994650003702010650002302047650001702070650002402087650002002111650001302131650002502144650003202169650002302201650002602224650001802250650003302268650003302301650002502334650002802359650002502387650001702412650003002429650001802459650002102477650003202498650002202530650002302552653001602575653002802591700001602619700001702635700001702652773007302669852000902742856011202751930003302863945002502896946001102921961001302932655001202945IND4361690120221122223607.0040320e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436169012DNAL7 a127872432pmid7 a10113/203932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aKlein, P.E.10aSequence-based alignment of sorghum chromosome 3 and rice chromosome 1 reveals extensive conservation of gene order and one major chromosomal rearrangement  ap. 605-621.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aThe completed rice genome sequence will accelerate progress on the identification and functional classification of biologically important genes and serve as an invaluable resource for the comparative analysis of grass genomes. In this study, methods were developed for sequence-based alignment of sorghum and rice chromosomes and for refining the sorghum genetic/physical map based on the rice genome sequence. A framework of 135 BAC contigs spanning approximately 33 Mbp was anchored to sorghum chromosome 3. A limited number of sequences were collected from 118 of the BACs and subjected to blastx analysis to identify putative genes and blastn analysis to identify sequence matches to the rice genome. Extensive conservation of gene content and order between sorghum chromosome 3 and the homeologous rice chromosome 1 was observed. One large-scale rearrangement was detected involving the inversion of an approximately 59 cM block of the short arm of sorghum chromosome 3. Several small-scale changes in gene collinearity were detected, indicating that single genes and/or small clusters of genes have moved since the divergence of sorghum and rice. Additionally, the alignment of the sorghum physical map to the rice genome sequence allowed sequence-assisted assembly of an approximately 1.6 Mbp sorghum BAC contig. This streamlined approach to high-resolution genome alignment and map building will yield important information about the relationships between rice and sorghum genes and genomic segments and ultimately enhance our understanding of cereal genome structure and evolution. 3arice 3agrain crops 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3asequence alignment 3aOryza sativa 3aconserved sequences 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3aphysical chromosome mapping 3aSorghastrum nutans 3agenetic recombination 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aConserved Sequencexgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Orderxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenome, Plant 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aPoaceaexgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 0achromosomes 0amolecular sequence data1 aKlein, R.R.1 aVrebalov, J.1 aMullet, J.E.0 tPlant journal.g2003 June, v.  34, no.  5 p.605-621x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/203933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20081014b20081101c00000000  aINDdRSCe2004/03/25  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03788naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111024002100144040001800165072001700183100001500200245010500215300001800320500002400338500001500362520143500377650003001812650001801842650002501860650001701885650001401902650002901916650002001945650002801965650003001993650002302023650002502046650001002071650003102081650002302112650002102135650004602156650004402202650005402246650007502300650004202375653002102417653003802438653002802476653001502504653003302519653003002552653003202582653000802614700002002622700002202642700002102664773011702685852000902802856008302811856011202894930003303006945002503039946001303064961001303077655001203090IND4443373320221120152122.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444337332DNAL7 a208314112pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-03-10-00632doi7 a10113/471112hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aZeng, Quan10aRegulatory Mechanisms of Exoribonuclease PNPase and Regulatory Small RNA on T3SS of Dickeya dadantii  ap. 1345-1355.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe type III secretion system (T3SS) is an essential virulence factor for many bacterial pathogens. Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is one of the major exoribonucleases in bacteria and plays important roles in mRNA degradation, tRNA processing, and small RNA (sRNA) turnover. In this study, we showed that PNPase downregulates the transcription of T3SS structural and effector genes of the phytopathogenic bacterium Dickeya dadantii. This negative regulation of T3SS by PNPase occurs by repressing the expression of hrpL, encoding a master regulator of T3SS in D. dadantii. By reducing rpoN mRNA stability, PNPase downregulates the transcription of hrpL, which leads to a reduction in T3SS gene expression. Moreover, we have found that PNPase downregulates T3SS by decreasing hrpL mRNA stability. RsmB, a regulatory sRNA, enhances hrpL mRNA stability in D. dadantii. Our results suggest that PNPase decreases the amount of functional RsmB transcripts that could result in reduction of hrpL mRNA stability. In addition, bistable gene expression (differential expression of a single gene that creates two distinct subpopulations) of hrpA, hrpN, and dspE was observed in D. dadantii under in vitro conditions. Although PNPase regulates the proportion of cells in the high state and the low state of T3SS gene expression, it appears that PNPase is not the key switch that triggers the bistable expression patterns of T3SS genes. 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3amessenger RNA 3aregulatory sequences 3atransfer RNA 3avirulence 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3anucleotidyltransferases 3atype III secretion system 3abacterial proteins 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3agenes 3agene expression regulation 3amicrobial genetics 3aexoribonucleases 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aExoribonucleasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxphysiology 2aDickeya chrysanthemixenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aRNA, Bacterialxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aDickeya dadantii 0abistable gene expression patterns 0amolecular sequence data 0asmall RNAs 0apolynucleotide phosphorylase 0aType III secretion system 0aPectobacterium chrysanthemi 0aRNA1 aIbekwe, A.

To ameliorate the impact of bacterial root rot on sucrose loss in the field, storage piles, and factories, studies were conducted to establish an assay for identifying host resistance. In 2006 and 2007, 21 commercial cultivars were evaluated in a petri dish laboratory assay. Root slices were inoculated with L. mesenteroides and the diameter of the rotted area was measured after 72 and 96 h. The cultivars were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 4 replications. With 2006 roots after 96 h, the average rot diameter ranged from 16 to 34 mm (LSD=5) depending on cultivar. With 2007 roots after 96 h, the average rot diameter ranged from 10 to 48 mm (LSD=7) depending on cultivar. The cultivar ranking between years was correlated at 72 (r=0.47, P=0.03) and 96 (r=0.43, P=0.05) h. The assay allowed for reliable cultivar separation regardless of whether one, two, three, or four roots were used per replication. The laboratory assay has the potential to allow host resistance to bacterial root rot caused by L. mesenteroides to be improved in sugarbeet. 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3asugar beet 3abacterial diseases of plants 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apathogenicity 3aroot rot 3adisease resistance 3acultivars 3agermplasm evaluation 3agenetic variation 3aIntermountain West region 3aIdaho1 aEujayl, Imad A.1 aFoote, I.

Pore-scale dispersion (PSD), aquifer heterogeneity, sampling volume, and source size influence solute concentrations of conservative tracers transported in heterogeneous porous formations. In this work, we developed a new set of analytical solutions for the concentration ensemble mean, variance, and coefficient of variation (CV), which consider the effects of all these factors. We developed these models as generalizations of the first-order solutions in the log-conductivity variance of point concentration proposed by [Fiori A, Dagan G. Concentration fluctuations in aquifer transport: a rigorous first-order solution and applications. J Contam Hydrol 2000;45(1-2):139-163]. Our first-order solutions compare well with numerical simulations for small and moderate formation heterogeneity and from small to large sampling and source volumes. However, their performance deteriorates for highly heterogeneous formations. Successively, we used our models to study the interplay among sampler size, source volume, and PSD. Our analysis shows a complex and important interaction among these factors. Additionally, we show that the relative importance of these factors is also a function of plume age, of aquifer heterogeneity, and of the measurement location with respect to the mean plume center of gravity. We found that the concentration moments are chiefly controlled by the sampling volume with pore-scale dispersion playing a minor role at short times and for small source volumes. However, the effect of the source volume cannot be neglected when it is larger than the sampling volume. A different behavior occurs for long periods, which may be relevant for old contaminations, or for small injection volumes. In these cases, PSD causes a significant dilution, which is reflected in the concentration statistics. Additionally, at the center of the mean plume, where high concentrations are most likely to occur, we found that sampling volume and PSD are attenuating mechanisms for both concentration ensemble mean and coefficient of variation, except at very large source and sampler sizes, where the coefficient of variation increases with sampler size and PSD. Formation heterogeneity causes a faster reduction of the ensemble mean concentrations and a larger uncertainty at the center of the mean plume. Therefore, our results highlight the importance of considering the combined effect of formation heterogeneity, exposure volume, PSD, source size, and measurement location in performing risk assessment. 3asimulation models 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater flow 3asolutes 3aaquifers 3apollutants 3aporous media 3aspatial variation 3astochastic processes 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models 0apore scale dispersion 0aheterogeneous porous formations 0aaquifer heterogeneity1 aBellin, A.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2008 Feb., v.  31, no.  2 p.339-354x0309-17087nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/302103Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2007.08.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090618b20090703c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/06/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle02083naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002000123040001800143072001700161072001700178100002300195245007500218300001600293500002400309520067000333650001901003650002301022650001801045650001401063650002001077650002201097650002101119650002301140650001601163650001801179650001601197650002301213650001201236653001501248700002201263700001801285700002401303773008201327852000901409856008101418930003301499945002501532946001101557961000901568655001201577IND4393889020221123004303.0070809e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439388902DNAL7 a10.1051/apido:20040562doi7 a10113/23142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

All queens failed to develop at 1000 mg/kg, and greater than 50% of the queen cells were rejected at the 100 mg/kg concentration. Additionally, queens that survived exposure to100 mg/kg coumaphos weighed significantly less than control queens.

This paper provides an overview of the analytical approach being used in the CEAP national assessment to estimate off-site water quality benefits. For the assessment, a sampling and modeling approach is used. The farm-scale model Agricultural Policy/Environmental EXtender (APEX) is used to simulate conservation practices for cultivated cropland. Farmer surveys conducted on a subset of National Resource Inventory sample points provide information on current farming activities and conservation practices for APEX. Output from APEX will be input into the watershed scale model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in the HUMUS (Hydrologic Unit Modeling for the United States) system for routing the pollutants to the 8-digit watershed outlet. SWAT will be calibrated and validated using the United States Geological Survey's SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model output, streamflow and pollutant data. The HUMUS system simulates in-stream effects for (a) a baseline scenario with conservation practices and (b) an alternative scenario without conservation practices. The off-site water quality benefits of conservation practices currently in use will be determined by comparing outputs for the alternative scenario to the baseline outputs at each 8-digit watershed. Benefits will be reported as reductions in in-stream concentrations and loadings of sediment, nutrients and pesticides, and reductions in the number of days that concentrations exceed human health and ecological thresholds. 3awater pollution 3asoil conservation 3astream flow 3awater quality 3apollutants 3aagricultural management models 3anonpoint source pollution 3awatershed hydrology 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aConservation Effects Assessment Project 3aagricultural watersheds 3aUnited States 0awater flow 0aHydrologic Unit Modeling for the United States model 0ahydrologic models1 aKannan, N.1 aDi Luzio, M.1 aPotter, S.R.1 aArnold, Jeffrey G.1 aAtwood, Jay D.1 aKellogg, R.L.0 tPaper.g2005, , no.  052043aAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineers.x0149-98907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/290273Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/05/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03975naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024001900130024002100149040001800170072000900188072000900197100001900206245009200225300001600317500002400333520209000357650001602447650001302463650001902476650001402495650003102509650001902540650000902559650002602568650004002594650002502634650003102659650003802690650002302728650004502751650002902796650003102825650002002856650003602876700001702912700001502929700001902944700001802963700002002981773008103001852000903082856011203091856008803203930003303291945002503324946001103349961001303360655001203373IND4402719420221118094657.0080312e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440271942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.03.0082doi7 a174665272pmid7 a10113/116552hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF2001 aO'Rourke, J.A.10aRecovering from iron deficiency chlorosis in near-isogenic soybeans: A microarray study  ap. 287-292.  aIncludes references  aIron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) in soybeans has proven to be a perennial problem in the calcareous soils of the U.S. upper Midwest. A historically difficult trait to study in fields, the use of hydroponics in a controlled greenhouse environment has provided a mechanism to study genetic variation while limiting environmental complications. IDC susceptible plants growing in calcareous soils and in iron-controlled hydroponic experiments often exhibit a characteristic chlorotic phenotype early in the growing season but are able to re-green later in the season. To examine the changes in gene expression of these plants, near-isogenic lines, iron efficient PI548553 (Clark) and iron inefficient PI547430 (IsoClark), developed for their response to iron deficiency stress [USDA, ARS, National Genetic Resources Program, Germplasm Resources Information Network - GRIN. (Online Database) National Germplasm Resources Laboratory, Beltsville, MD, 2004. Available: http://www.ars.grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/acc_search.pl?accid=PI+547430. [22] were grown in iron-deficient hydroponic conditions for one week, then transferred to iron sufficient conditions for another week. This induced a phenotypic response mimicking the growth of the plants in the field; initial chlorosis followed by re-greening. RNA was isolated from root tissue and transcript profiles were examined between the two near-isogenic lines using publicly available cDNA microarrays. By alleviating the iron deficiency stress our expectation was that plants would return to baseline expression levels. However, the microarray comparison identified four cDNAs that were under-expressed by a two-fold or greater difference in the iron inefficient plant compared to the iron efficient plant. This differential expression was re-examined and confirmed by real time PCR experimentation. Control experiments showed that these genes are not differentially expressed in plants grown continually under iron rich hydroponic conditions. The expression differences suggest potential residual effects of iron deficiency on plant health. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aisogenic lines 3achlorosis 3agene expression regulation 3asoil nutrients 3airon 3amicroarray technology 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aIron Deficiencies. 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPlant Diseasesxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoybeansxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aGraham, M.A.1 aVodkin, L.1 aGonzalez, D.O.1 aCianzio, S.R.1 aShoemaker, R.C.0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2007 May, v.  45, no.  5 p.287-2927nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/116553Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.03.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080318b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/03/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03038naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131100001700140245008600157300001600243500002400259500002400283520181800307650003102125650003902156650002102195650001802216651001202234700001702246700001702263773008702280852000902367856011202376856008002488930003302568945002502601946001302626961001302639655001202652IND4365640020221121095020.0041118e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436564002DNAL7 a10113/110012hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF9001 aSheley, R.L.10aIntegrating 2,4-D and sheep grazing to rehabilitate spotted knapweed infestations  ap. 371-375.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aEffective integrated weed management requires understanding the impacts of management strategies applied alone and in combination. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of 2,4-D and repeated sheep (Ovis aries) grazing applied alone and in combination on spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.) and perennial grasses. We hypothesized that integrating a single spring 2,4-D application would remove the adult plants, repeated sheep grazing would control rosettes, and spotted knapweed density, cover and biomass would decrease, allowing residual grasses to reoccupy the sites. A single spring 2,4-D application at 2.1 kg a.i. ha-1, repeated annual sheep grazing of 95% spotted knapweed or 60% grass utilization, and repeated sheep grazing and 2,4-D combined were applied to small pastures at 2 sites in western Montana beginning in 1997 and continued through 2001. Spotted knapweed rosette and flowering plant density, and spotted knapweed and perennial grass cover and biomass were sampled from 1998 through 2001. Spotted knapweed rosette density was 61.7, 34.3, 44.3, and 0.3 m-2 in the control, sheep grazing, 2,4-D, and combined sheep grazing and 2,4-D treatments, respectively, at 1 site in 2001. Spotted knapweed flowering plant density increased from 3.7 in 1998 to 10.7 m-2 in 2002 in the 2,4-D treatment whereas there was no increase in the 2,4-D combined with sheep grazing treatment from 1998 to 2002. Perennial grass biomass was 6.9, 8.4, 25.7, and 19.7 in the control, sheep grazing, 2,4-D, and combined sheep grazing and 2,4-D treatments, respectively, averaged for both sites and 4 years of sampling. Herbicides released perennial grasses from weed competition and changed the weed population from mature, less palatable plants to juvenile plants that were preferred by sheep. 3aintegrated weed management 3aCentaurea stoebe subsp. micranthos 3ainvasive species 3anoxious weeds 3aMontana1 aJacobs, J.S.1 aMartin, J.M.0 tJournal of range management.g2004 July, v.  57, no.  4 p.371-375x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110013Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://uvalde.tamu.edu/jrm/jrmhome.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/12/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02488naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111024002100146040001800167072000900185072000900194100002000203245008400223300001600307500002400323500001500347520083500362650001901197650001701216650002601233650002101259650001001280650001301290650002401303650004001327650001701367650001301384650002401397650003401421650002001455653001101475653002301486653002501509700002301534773010201557852000901659856011201668856008501780930003301865945002501898946001101923961001201934655001201946IND4404098520120607163611.0080405e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440409852DNAL7 a182628302pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2007.12.0042doi7 a10113/150142hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aK0011 aNeale, David B.10aPopulation, quantitative and comparative genomics of adaptation in forest trees  ap. 149-155.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-04  aHigh-throughput DNA sequencing and genotyping technologies have enabled a new generation of research in plant genetics where combined quantitative and population genetic approaches can be used to better understand the relationship between naturally occurring genotypic and phenotypic diversity. Forest trees are highly amenable to such studies because of their combined undomesticated and partially domesticated state. Forest geneticists are using association genetics to dissect complex adaptive traits and discover the underlying genes. In parallel, they are using resequencing of candidate genes and modern population genetics methods to discover genes under natural selection. This combined approach is identifying the most important genes that determine patterns of complex trait adaptation observed in many tree populations. 3aplant genetics 3aforest trees 3aquantitative genetics 3aplant adaptation 3agenes 3agenomics 3apopulation genetics 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenomics 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aTreesxgenetics 0agenome 0aliterature reviews 0acomparative genomics1 aIngvarsson, Pär K0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2008 Apr., v.  11, no.  2 p.149-155dPergamonx1369-52667nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150143Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2007.12.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/05/23  aNon-US  aUSDA/FS 7aarticle03047naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092024001900136024002100155040001800176072000900194072000900203100002000212245008500232300001600317500002400333500001500357520069600372650002101068650002201089650002201111650002001133650001801153650001101171650001401182650003301196650002601229650001901255650001601274650001901290650002201309650002701331650002901358650003601387650005801423650002801481650003401509650001401543650004601557650003401603650002701637650002401664650002201688650009701710653003601807653002201843653001701865700002501882700002901907773010401936852000902040856011202049856009402161930003302255945002502288946001102313961001302324655001202337IND4400571020221120193956.0080127e200107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440057102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2001.tb00024.x2doi7 a127023582pmid7 a10113/260992hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ125 0aQ1051 aKurtzman, C.

Volume 1, held September 1-5, 2008, Dresden, Germany.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWe have developed an improved Agrobacterium-mediated protocol in plum (Prunus domestica L.) through the addition of 2,4-D to the regeneration media. This method has increased the regeneration efficiency of independent transgenic plants up to 10 fold over previous reports. DNA blot analysis of putative transgenic shoots revealed transformation efficiencies of up to 42% with an average of 25% over all trials. The method as described produces self-rooted transgenic plants in approximately 6 months. The high transformation rates coupled with the rapid plant establishment methodology makes it possible to utilize plum transformation both for the introduction of agronomically useful genes into this species, and as a model plant for functional genomics studies in Prunus spp., rosaceaous species, and woody plants in general. 3agenetic transformation 3aPrunus domestica 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aplums 3agenomics 3agenetic vectors 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aWebb, Keith,d1943-1 aDardick, Ch.1 aScorza, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2009 July, , no. 839 p.375-379wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393323Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aINDdARSe2010/03/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04494naa a2200889 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100002600186245013100212300001600343500002400359500001500383520175800398650002802156650001102184650002002195650001602215650002102231650002802252650002702280650001702307650001002324650001802334650001102352650002102363650002002384650003102404650001602435650000902451650001902460650002902479650001002508650002002518650001902538650001102557650001602568650001202584650004002596650002902636650001802665650002402683650001302707650002102720650003702741650003302778650004402811650005802855650005602913650004102969653002703010700003103037700002303068700003403091700002203125700002003147700002403167700002403191700002303215700002103238700002803259773010003287852000903387856011203396930003303508945002503541946001303566961001303579655001203592IND4419689420221119033754.0090427e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441968942DNAL7 a194352182pmid7 a10113/290282hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL832 0aQ2031 aJohny, Anup Kollanoor10aProphylactic Supplementation of Caprylic Acid in Feed Reduces Salmonella Enteritidis Colonization in Commercial Broiler Chicks  ap. 722-727.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aSalmonella Enteritidis is a major foodborne pathogen for which chickens serve as reservoir hosts. Reducing Salmonella Enteritidis carriage in chickens would reduce contamination of poultry meat and eggs with this pathogen. We investigated the prophylactic efficacy of feed supplemented with caprylic acid (CA), a natural, generally recognized as safe eight-carbon fatty acid, for reducing Salmonella Enteritidis colonization in chicks. One hundred commercial day-old chicks were randomly divided into five groups of 20 birds each: CA control (no Salmonella Enteritidis, CA), positive control (Salmonella Enteritidis, no CA), negative control (no Salmonella Enteritidis, no CA), and 0.7 or 1% CA. Water and feed were provided ad libitum. On day 8, birds were inoculated with 5.0 log CFU of Salmonella Enteritidis by crop gavage. Six birds from each group were euthanized on days 1, 7, and 10 after challenge, and Salmonella Enteritidis populations in the cecum, small intestine, cloaca, crop, liver, and spleen were enumerated. The study was replicated three times. CA supplementation at 0.7 and 1% consistently decreased Salmonella Enteritidis populations recovered from the treated birds. Salmonella Enteritidis counts in the tissue samples of CA-treated chicks were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of control birds on days 7 and 10 after challenge. Feed intake and body weight did not differ between the groups. Histological examination revealed no pathological changes in the cecum and liver of CA-supplemented birds. The results suggest that prophylactic CA supplementation through feed can reduce Salmonella Enteritidis colonization in day-old chicks and may be a useful treatment for reducing Salmonella Enteritidis carriage in chickens. 3acrop (digestive system) 3achicks 3asmall intestine 3alactic acid 3abroiler chickens 3abacterial contamination 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3achicken meat 3acecum 3aoctanoic acid 3aspleen 3afeed supplements 3abroiler feeding 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aplate count 3aeggs 3ahistopathology 3aantibacterial properties 3aliver 3aGRAS substances 3afood pathogens 3acloaca 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aCaprylatesxpharmacology 2aCarrier State 2aCecumxmicrobiology 2aChickens 2aDietxveterinary 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Administration Schedule 2aGastrointestinal Contentsxmicrobiology 2aPoultry Diseasesxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxprevention & control 2aSalmonella enteritidisxdrug effects 0aSalmonella enteritidis1 aBaskaran, Sangeetha Ananda1 aCharles, Anu Susan1 aAmalaradjou, Mary Anne Roshni1 aDarre, Michael J.1 aKhan, Mazhar I.1 aHoagland, Thomas A.1 aSchreiber, David T.1 aDonoghue, Annie M.1 aDonoghue, Dan J.1 aVenkitanarayanan, Kumar0 tJournal of food protection.g2009 Apr., v.  72, no.  4 p.722-727wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/290283Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/05/15  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle04465naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100002000188245011600208300001600324500002400340520275200364650001003116650002703126650001903153650002003172650001903192650002003211650001803231650001903249650001003268650001003278650001003288650001103298650002603309653002903335653001903364700001903383700001903402700001903421700001503440700002103455700001903476700001703495773008303512852000903595856011203604856008903716930003303805945002503838946001103863961001303874655001203887IND4402719720221118094705.0080312e200308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440271972DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00099-32doi7 a10113/116562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL832 0aR3001 aEdrington, T.S.10aReduction of E. coli O157:H7 populations in sheep by supplementation of an experimental sodium chlorate product  ap. 173-181.  aIncludes references  aRuminant animals are naturally infected with the pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7, annually responsible for numerous meat recalls, foodborne illnesses and deaths. E. coli are equipped with the enzyme nitrate reductase, which not only enables this bacteria to respire anaerobically, but also converts chlorate to the toxic metabolite chlorite. This enzyme system is particular to only a few intestinal bacteria, therefore the vast majority are not affected by chlorate. Sodium chlorate has been shown to effectively decrease foodborne pathogens in several livestock species, including ruminants. However, because infection and proliferation of E. coli occurs primarily in the lower intestine, there is interest in “by-passing” the rumen, thereby, delivering chlorate directly to the largest population of pathogens. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the ability of an experimental sodium chlorate product (ECP II), designed to by-pass the rumen, in reducing fecal shedding and gut concentrations of E. coli O157:H7. Twenty crossbred mature ewes were adapted to a high grain ration and experimentally inoculated with E. coli O157:H7. Thirty-six hours following inoculation, sheep received in their feed one of the following ECP treatments: (1) control (CON), no chlorate; (2) 1X (LOW); (3) 2X (MED); and (4) 4X (HIGH) where X=1.1 g chlorate ion equivalents/kg BW (five sheep per treatment). Fecal samples were collected every 12 h following inoculation and 24 h following the feeding of chlorate, all animals were euthanized and tissue samples and their respective contents collected from the rumen, cecum and rectum. The MED and HIGH chlorate treatments significantly reduced fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 compared to the CON treatment [1.53, 1.11, and 3.89 CFU/g feces (log10), respectively]. Ruminal contents were similar among treatments, while chlorate tended to decrease (P=0.08) and reduced (P<0.05) E. coli O157:H7 populations in the cecum and rectum, respectively. Populations of generic E. coli in the cecal contents were numerically lower (P=0.11) in the LOW treatment and tended to decrease (P=0.06) in the MED and HIGH chlorate treatments, respectively. Fermentation profiles through the gastrointestinal tract were unaffected as indicated by slight, but not significant, changes in volatile fatty acids (VFA) profiles in sheep fed chlorate. Results from this study indicate that this experimental chlorate product, administered in the feed, was effective in reducing E. coli O157:H7 from the lower gut of sheep as evidenced by the lower cecal and rectal but not ruminal concentrations. Feeding chlorate may be an effective method to decrease E. coli O157:H7 populations in ruminant animals prior to slaughter. 3asheep 3aEscherichia infections 3afood pathogens 3adisease control 3afeed additives 3asodium chlorate 3adose response 3amicrobial load 3afeces 3arumen 3acecum 3arectum 3aEscherichia coli O157 0achlorate supplementation 0afecal shedding1 aCallaway, T.R.1 aAnderson, R.C.1 aGenovese, K.J.1 aJung, Y.S.1 aMcReynolds, J.L.1 aBischoff, K.M.1 aNisbet, D.J.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2003 Aug., v.  49, no.  2 p.173-181x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/116563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00099-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20140220b20140307c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/03/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03329naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002100125040001800146100001400164245005200178300001600230500014600246500002400392520188600416650001402302650002202316650001902338650001302357650000702370650001402377650002302391650001602414650001002430650001302440653001402453700001602467700001702483700002002500773006502520852000902585856011202594856008302706930003302789945001302822946001102835961001302846655001202859IND2324139420221119141237.0011120s2001    ne |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND232413942DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10175982190542doi7 a10113/122962hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, B.Y.10aAluminum tolerance in triticale, wheat, and rye  ap. 329-337.  aIn the special issue: Mutation, in vitro and molecular techniques for sustainable crop improvement / edited by M. Maluszynski and K.J. Kasha.  aIncludes references  aAcid soils containing high levels of aluminum (Al) are known to severely limit plant growth on over 1.6 billion hectares worldwide. In the United States, a gradual decline in the pH of many soils both in the Great Plains as well as the Southeast, has caused many soils to become high in levels of free Al. This worldwide condition encouraged the analysis of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell.), triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack), and rye (Secale cereale L.) germplasm from one of the major acid soil regions of the world (Brazil) in order to evaluate and compare the genetic potential of Al genes for cereal improvement. The objectives were to compare Al-tolerance levels in wheats, triticales, and ryes by measuring root elongation responses in Al-containing hydroponic nutrient solutions. Root elongation was impaired for all species grown in 1 mg/L concentrations of Al. Rye had the longest root regrowth and Al-sensitive wheats had the shortest root regrowth. The triticales containing a 2D(2R) substitution developed in the mid-1970s had the poorest root regrowth of all triticale types. The newly developed advanced triticale lines (AABBRR) yet to be released for commercial production showed the highest degree of Al tolerance of all the triticale types and approached or exceeded the levels observed in rye. This indicated that progress is being made in improving Al-tolerance of triticale in Brazil. Of all the old and new wheat varieties showing the highest degree of Al-tolerance, none of them were better than 'BH 1146' a variety that is at least 50 years old. This indicated that over the past 50 years, although Brazilian wheat breeders have made yield improvements in wheat production, they have not improved Al-tolerance. Rye showed a higher degree of Al-tolerance than the other cereals when tested in 1 mg/L of Al, but as expected, some variation was noted. 3atriticale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aSecale cereale 3aaluminum 3apH 3agermplasm 3anutrient solutions 3ahydroponics 3aroots 3aregrowth 0atolerance1 aBaier, A.C.1 aSomers, D.J.1 aGustafson, J.P.0 tEuphytica.g2001, v.  120, no.  3 p.329-337x0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/122963Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10175982190543Available from publisher's Web site  a20080331b20080404c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03508naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002100124040001800145072000900163072000900172100001700181245022400198300001600422500002400438520153500462650001801997650001702015650002002032650001702052650002302069650002202092650001902114650002802133650001202161650001802173650002102191650003302212650002002245650002202265650001902287650001602306650002402322650002202346650000702368650003802375650002502413653002402438653002202462700001802484700001802502773008902520852000902609856011202618856008202730930003302812945002502845946001102870961001302881655001202894IND4404362020120607163627.0080412e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440436202DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2007006692doi7 a10113/150192hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aKweon, Meera10aEffect of Sodium Chloride on Glassy and Crystalline Melting Transitions of Wheat Starch Treated with High Hydrostatic Pressure: Prediction of Solute-induced Barostability from Nonmonotonic Solute-induced Thermostability  ap. 127-133.  aIncludes references  aWheat starch was high hydrostatic pressure (HHP)-treated in aqueous solutions with various sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations (0 to near-saturation), in order to explore the effects of salt on glassy and crystalline transitions of starch during the treatment, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For wheat starch at atmospheric pressure, glass and crystalline melting transitions of amylopectin (reported as gelatinization peak temperature) increased up to 2 M NaCl, and then decreased with further increase in NaCl concentration, but the gelatinization peak temperature was higher in all NaCl solutions than in water alone. In contrast, the melting transition for the amylose-lipid complex (reported as peak temperature) increased continuously with increasing NaCl concentration. When 50% (w/w) starch slurries were HHP-treated in water and various NaCl concentrations (0.1, 2 and 5 M) for 15 min at 25°C, the presence of salt significantly protected glass and crystalline transitions of starch during the HHP treatment. Although the baroprotective effect was maximal near the lyotropic 2 M NaCl concentration [1-5], all NaCl concentrations were more baroprotective than was water alone for HHP-treated wheat starch. As reported previously [6] for corn starches in a lyotropic concentration of NaCl (ionic solvent) or a non-equilibrium concentration of sucrose (glass-forming solvent) [7], solute-induced thermostabilization of the wheat starch gelatinization transition predicted solute-induced barostabilization. 3awater content 3awheat starch 3asodium chloride 3asalt content 3asalt concentration 3aaqueous solutions 3awater activity 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aamylose 3amelting point 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3acrystallization 3acrystal structure 3agelatinization 3aamylopectin 3aambient temperature 3athermal stability 3apH 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aatmospheric pressure 0athermostabilization 0abarostabilization1 aSlade, Louise1 aLevine, Harry0 tStärke =.g2008 Mar., v.  60, no.  3-4 p.127-133dWiley-VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/150193Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2007006693Available from publisher's Web site  a20080522b20080606c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/05/22  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02366naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179100001600188245007400204300001600278500011600294500002400410520111600434650001701550650002301567650004301590773009101633852000901724856011201733856008901845930003301934945001301967946001101980961001301991655001202004IND2328348020221121211805.0020802e20011123ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232834802DNAL7 a10.1016/S0021-9673(01)00946-32doi7 a10113/245922hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ5051 aAbidi, S.L.10aChromatographic analysis of plant sterols in foods and vegetable oils  ap. 173-201.  aIn the special issue: Gas and liquid chromatography of non-saponifiable lipids, part I / edited by E.

Pertinent gas chromatographic and high-performance liquid chromatographic methods from the literature are tabulated to illustrate common trends and methodological variability. The review also covers specific analyses of natural/synthetic standard mixtures to shed light on potential applicability in plant sample assays. Examples of combined chromatographic techniques linked in tandem for the analysis of complex samples are included. Elution characteristics of sterol components are discussed in the context of analyte substituent effects, structural factors and stationary/mobile phase considerations. 3aphytosterols 3agas chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography0 tJournal of chromatography.g2001 Nov. 23, v.  935, no.  1/2 p.173-201x0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/245923Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9673(01)00946-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02449naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002400149245012500173300001600298500002400314500001500338520112700353650001101480650001501491650001501506650002401521650002601545650001601571650002401587653001201611653002901623653002801652653001301680700001601693773008901709852000901798856011201807930003301919945002501952946001301977961001301990655001202003IND4437607420221120112633.0100525s2010    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND443760742DNAL7 a10113/430182hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aP2101 aO'Shaughnessy, S.A.10aDeveloping Wireless Sensor Networks for Monitoring Crop Canopy Temperature Using a Moving Sprinkler System as a Platform  ap. 331-341.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objectives of this study were to characterize wireless sensor nodes that we developed in terms of power consumption and functionality, and compare the performance of mesh and non-mesh wireless sensor networks (WSNs) comprised mainly of infrared thermometer thermocouples located on a center pivot lateral and in the field below. The sensor nodes mounted on masts fixed to the lateral arm of a center pivot irrigation system functioned to monitor crop canopy temperatures while the system moved; the sensor nodes established in the field below the pivot were to provide stationary reference canopy temperatures. The WSNs located in cropped fields independent of the irrigation system functioned in a highly reliable manner [packet reception percentage (PRP) > 94]. Mesh-networking was the single communication protocol that provided functionality for the WSN located on the center pivot lateral. Its PRP was 84 and 87 during the 2007 and 2008 growing seasons, respectively. Future research is required for thorough testing and optimizing of WSNs for automatic control and irrigation scheduling of a center pivot system. 3acanopy 3amonitoring 3asprinklers 3awireless technology 3aequipment performance 3atemperature 3aproduct development 0asensors 0awireless sensor Networks 0amoving sprinkler system 0anetworks1 aEvett, S.R.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2010, v.  26, no.  2 p.331-341x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/430183Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/01  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03062naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100001700149245005500166300001600221500002400237500002400261520182100285650001602106650002002122650002202142650002402164650002402188650001202212650002102224651001002245700001302255773008702268852000902355856011202364856008002476930003302556945002502589946001302614961001302627655001202640IND4365641620221121095011.0041118e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436564162DNAL7 a10113/110032hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF130 0aF3001 aDerner, J.D.10aSpatial patterns of light gaps in mesic grasslands  ap. 393-398.  aIncludes references  aSummary in Spanish.  aThe spatial pattern of light gaps in mesic grasslands in central Texas with contrasting disturbance histories was assessed using patch-based landscape metrics determined from a threshold level (25% of full sunlight), as light intensities below this threshold substantially decrease survival of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa Torr.) seedlings. The spatial pattern of light gaps, with the exception of edge density, were significantly different between annually-disturbed and non-disturbed grasslands on all sample dates (2 April, 30 April, 29 May, and 26 June 1998). Differences in patch metrics did not occur between non-disturbed grasslands despite contrasting vegetation composition [perennial forbs and perennial bunch (tussock) grasses]. Patch-based landscape metrics of light gaps did vary temporally in both annually-disturbed and non-disturbed grasslands. The structure and spatial configuration of light gaps were distinctly different between annually-disturbed and non-disturbed grasslands: a low density of large patches characterized light gaps in annually-disturbed grassland, whereas non-disturbed grasslands had a high density of small patches. Our findings demonstrate that the current disturbance regime is the principal environmental driver influencing species dominance and composition, and indirectly vegetation structure, which collectively contribute to the observed dynamics of light gap patches in these mesic grasslands. Incorporating spatially explicit consideration of light gap structure and dynamics into experimental studies addressing invasion of weedy plant species such as honey mesquite may be an effective approach to address mechanisms and the ecological significance of disturbance operating as a driver facilitating woody plant invasions in mesic grasslands. 3acanopy gaps 3alight intensity 3aspatial variation 3aecological invasion 3aProsopis glandulosa 3acutting 3arange management 3aTexas1 aWu, X.B.0 tJournal of range management.g2004 July, v.  57, no.  4 p.393-398x0022-409X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/110033Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://uvalde.tamu.edu/jrm/jrmhome.htm3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdJITe2004/12/20  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03442naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001800197245011800215300001600333500002400349520187000373650001002243650000802253650001902261650002302280650001902303650002202322650001502344650001802359650001402377650001202391650002302403650002402426650001402450650001502464653002702479700001502506700001402521773008502535852000902620856011202629856008902741930003302830945002502863946001102888961001302899655001202912IND4402719820221118094722.0080312e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440271982DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00116-02doi7 a10113/116572hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aX1501 aColeman, S.W.10aRelationships among forage chemistry, rumination and retention time with intake and digestibility of hay by goats  ap. 129-140.  aIncludes references  aEight species of forage, a cool-season perennial (tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea)) and annual grass (winter wheat (Triticum aestivum)), four warm-season perennial grasses (caucasian (Bothriochloa caucasica), plains (B. ischaemum), old world bluestem, bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), and eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides)), a warm season annual (crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis)) and a perennial legume (alfalfa (Medicago sativa)), were each cut at two or three maturities to provide a wide array of quality difference (n=20). Twenty wether goats (Capra hicus) were fed the hays in four different trials using an incomplete block design so that four different goats received each hay. Alfalfa produced the highest (25 g kg-1 body weight (BW)) and wheat the lowest (13.6 g kg-1 BW) organic matter (OM) intake. A number of the grasses provided less than 20 g kg-1 BW OM intake. Digestion of OM was also highest for alfalfa (>715 g kg-1) and lowest for bermudagrass (508 g kg-1). All measures and expressions of intake and digestibility were better related to ruminating and retention time than to forage chemistry, with the exception of crude protein digestibility. The best equations for predicting intake included a combination of mean retention time and forage acid detergent fiber (ADF) content (reciprocal and quadratic); that for digestibility included permanganate lignin (reciprocal), and the quadratic for ruminating and retention time. Equations for predicting the constraint on intake and digestible organic matter intake produced higher r2 than those for either intake or digestibility. Digestibility of ADF and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were poorly predicted with either chemistry (r2<=0.20), or ruminating time (r2=0.43), but combinations of permanganate lignin content of NDF, retention and ruminating time produced reasonable equations. 3agoats 3ahay 3amaturity stage 3aforage composition 3aorganic matter 3adry matter intake 3arumination 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3adigesta 3aruminant nutrition 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aprediction 0adigesta retention time1 aHart, S.P.1 aSahlu, T.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2003 Oct., v.  50, no.  1-2 p.129-140x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/116573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00116-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20140225b20140307c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/03/17  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02353naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092024002100131040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188072000900197100001500206245008700221300001600308500011700324500002400441520089800465650001601363650001601379650001501395650001301410650000901423650001901432650003901451700001501490700001901505773009101524852000901615856011201624856008901736930003301825945001301858946001101871961001301882655001201895IND2328395920221121171246.0020807e20011130ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232839592DNAL7 a10.1016/S0021-9673(01)01082-22doi7 a10113/245932hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aQ504 0aQ501 0aQ5021 aTurner, C.10aSupercritical fluid extraction and chromatography for fat-soluble vitamin analysis  ap. 215-237.  aIn the special issue: Gas and liquid chromatography of non-saponifiable lipids, part II / edited by E. Heftmann.  aIncludes references  aExtraction and chromatographic separation of fat-soluble vitamins is a challenging task, due to the sensitivity of these compounds towards light, oxygen, heat and pH. In light of this, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) are attractive techniques as they function at considerably milder conditions than conventional solvent-based analytical techniques. Moreover, supercritical techniques consume much less amounts of organic solvents than conventional ones. This review gives a brief description of suitable supercritical media as well as basic theory on SFE and SFC processes. Furthermore, guidelines are provided for optimizing the important extraction and separation parameters to facilitate a successful method development. Finally, applications employing SFE and/or SFC for fat-soluble vitamin enrichment and final determination are reviewed. 3atocopherols 3acarotenoids 3avegetables 3aoilseeds 3ameat 3adairy products 3asupercritical fluid chromatography1 aKing, J.W.1 aMathiasson, L.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2001 Nov. 30, v.  936, no.  1/2 p.215-237x0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/245933Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9673(01)01082-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090220b20090301c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03474naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092024002100132040001800153072000900171100002100180245012600201300001600327500002400343520191700367650001302284650001702297650002302314650002402337650002102361650002902382650002102411650001702432650001902449650002602468651001102494700002502505700002602530700002602556700001802582700002502600773006202625852000902687856011202696856009002808930003302898945002502931946001102956961001302967655001202980IND4417527720090522155346.0090312e20061201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441752772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2006.03.0262doi7 a10113/268392hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aMadari, Beata E.10aMid- and near-infrared spectroscopic assessment of soil compositional parameters and structural indices in two Ferralsols  ap. 245-259.  aIncludes references  aBulk soil samples (BS) (n = 120) from long-term tillage experiments and areas covered by secondary natural forest were collected in the Brazilian savanna region (Cerrado) at Santo Antônio de Goiás, and southern Atlantic forest region at Londrina. Bulk soils were separated into 8 aggregate size fractions (ASF) by wet sieving (n = 700). Bulk soil samples (BS) and ASF were analyzed for total C, N by dry combustion. BS were also analyzed for sand, silt, and clay by densitometry, and several measures of soil aggregation were determined. All samples were scanned in the mid- and near-infrared (Mid-IR, NIR) by diffuse reflectance of ground, non-KBr diluted samples using a Digilab FTS-7000 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a Pike Auto-Diff auto-sampler. Quantitative calibrations for the various analytes were performed separately for the original set of 120 BS samples and the set of 700 ASF samples using partial least squares regression (PLSR). Results for the set of 120 BS for total C and N were excellent using either spectral range with R2 > 0.97, except for C by Mid-IR (R2 = 0.93). Similar results were obtained for determinations of sand and clay (R2 > 0.94). Silt, determined by difference (100% - %sand - %clay), gave much lower R2 (0.80 and 0.63 for Mid-IR and NIR, respectively). For aggregation indices, R2 of approximately 0.80 were achieved in the Mid-IR, NIR results were not as good (R2 < 0.67). Efforts with the 700 ASF samples resulted in R2 of 0.98 and 0.96 for C, and 0.96 and 0.97 for N, for Mid-IR and NIR calibrations, respectively. Calibration efforts to determine the values for the set of 700 ASF samples using set of 120 BS from which they were fractionated gave R2 = 0.90 and 0.87 in the Mid-IR and NIR, respectively, when 5% of the ASF were added to the set of 120 BS. Spectral discrimination of sample source was easily and very accurately determined for all data sets examined. 3asavannas 3aforest soils 3agenetic soil types 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil aggregation 3asoil chemical properties 3anitrogen content 3asoil texture 3asoil structure 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3aBrazil1 aReeves, James B.

Biotechfruit 2008. Volume 1, held September 1-5, 2008, Dresden, Germany.  aIncludes references  aOriginally identified in Bulgaria in 1915, Plum pox virus (PPV) is the most damaging virus of stone fruit trees, including apricot, plum, peach and cherry. PPV steadily spread throughout Europe over the years since its discovery and at the turn of the century (1999-2000) it reached North America (USA and Canada). While many strategies to control the spread of PPV have been undertaken over the decades and many studies have contributed to the characterization of the virus isolates there has been relatively little progress in the development of resistant varieties. With the paucity of natural resistance, transgenic technology, based on the engineering of the virus capsid gene, was investigated as a useful source of resistance. This work identified the C5 plum clone as highly resistant to PPV infection. These findings were supported by detailed molecular studies indicating that post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is the resistance mechanism with resistance being mediated through the production of small interfering RNA (siRNA). The durability of PPV resistance in C5 (named ‘HoneySweet’) is reflected through more than 10 years of field tests. In total, over 15 years of research with ‘HoneySweet’ have demonstrated that this clone and the resistance mechanism that it represents is: i) an important tool to demonstrate the successful deployment of biotechnology against a quarantine pest; ii) a safe product of biotechnology; and iii) a useful strategy for avoiding the use of pesticides to control natural aphid vectors of PPV. The deregulation of ‘HoneySweet’ in the USA by USDA/APHIS (Federal Register Doc. E7-13649, July 12 2007) and clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) corroborate these findings. 3aPrunus domestica 3aplums 3acultivars 3aPlum pox virus 3adisease resistance 3agene silencing 3abiosafety1 aScorza, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2009 July, , no. 839 p.397-402wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/393353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100313b20100403c00000000  aINDdARSe2010/03/12  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03922naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092024002000130040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001700204245011300221300001600334500002400350520234400374650002202718650001002740650002102750650001702771650001702788650001102805650001702816650001102833650002802844650001602872650001502888650001602903653002302919653002302942653002302965700001902988773009503007852000903102856011103111856008803222930003303310945002503343946001103368961001303379655001203392IND4393453320221119080116.0070725e20070731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439345332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2007.04.0322doi7 a10113/12302hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aJ200 0aP2001 aSnyder, K.A.10aRoot allocation and water uptake patterns in riparian tree saplings: Responses to irrigation and defoliation  ap. 222-231.  aIncludes references  aThe genus Populus relies on shallow groundwater for successful recruitment and is often the focus of riparian restoration efforts. Under some circumstances mature trees take up a substantial proportion of their water from unsaturated soil water derived from growing season rainfall, but it is unknown how Populus saplings may alter root allocation patterns and water use in response to water availability and carbon limitations. Although it has been inferred that root allocation differs with changes in water uptake patterns as determined with stable isotope studies, this notion has rarely been tested. We conducted a glasshouse experiment with Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) saplings to determine how allocation to fine and coarse roots, leaf gas exchange, root respiration and water uptake from hydrologically isolated upper and lower soil compartments would be altered by above- and belowground resource limitations. Aboveground carbon limitations were imposed with defoliation. Belowground resource limitations were imposed by maintaining high or low soil water availability in lower soil compartment. Isotopically labeled water was supplied in pulses to upper soil compartments to determine the proportion of transpiration water derived from each compartment. Above- and belowground resource limitations differentially altered use of surface water pulses and affected patterns of fine root allocation. Proportional use of water sources was plastic and changed in response to water availability and defoliation. Changes in fine root biomass allocation were associated with changes in water-source use for water-stressed plants. Defoliated plants in both watering treatments used proportionally less of the surface pulse than undefoliated plants. In contrast, plants that were water limited, but not carbon limited had a higher ratio of shallow fine roots to deep fine roots and took up proportionally more water from the surface pulse. These data suggest that carbon limited saplings take up less water with shallow roots. Thus, P. fremontii exhibited belowground allocation tradeoffs in response to spatial heterogeneity of soil water and carbon limitations. Furthermore, our data suggest that successful recruitment events may be influenced by the occurrence of summer rainfall, and by factors affecting canopy carbon gain. 3aPopulus fremontii 3aroots 3acell respiration 3aforest trees 3awater uptake 3aleaves 3agas exchange 3acarbon 3adry matter partitioning 3aroot growth 3asoil water 3awater table 0awater-use patterns 0awater availability 0ashallow soil water1 aWilliams, D.G.0 tForest ecology and management.g2007 July 31, v.  246, no.  2-3 p.222-231x0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/12303Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2007.04.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20070728b20070802c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/07/28  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02806naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005600092024002100148040001800169072000900187100002000196245005900216300001600275500002400291520126500315650001501580650001301595650001601608650002001624650001001644650001801654650001001672650002301682650002201705650001201727651001701739651002701756653001301783653002201796653002401818700001501842700001701857700001601874773008101890852000901971856011201980856011002092930003302202945002502235946001302260961001502273655001202288IND4402723520221118094652.0080312e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440272352DNAL7 a10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[162:AUORRW]2.0.CO;22doi7 a10113/116602hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL3001 aSafratowich, B.10aAvian Use of Rural Roadsides with Cattail (Typha spp.)  ap. 162-171.  aIncludes references  aWe surveyed 30 roadsides in North Dakota's Prairie Pothole Region for birds and active nests between May and July 2001-2002. Each roadside transect was 1608 m and had 200 linear meters of standing cattail (Typha spp.). We recorded 45 bird species; four species of Icteridae dominated the avifauna. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were both the most abundant species and most abundant nester, averaging 53 birds/10 ha (se = 7.7) and 30 nests/10 ha (se = 9.7). Among non-icterid species, song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) and common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) ranked first and second consecutively in 2001 and 2002. Canonical correspondence analyses of species compositions indicated that species abundance was related to two roadside variables, length and water depth of cattail stands. Cattails added habitat diversity and acceptable conditions for wetland-dwelling avian species not typically found in rural roadsides outside of the Prairie Pothole Region. We documented use of roadsides by three species of grassland birds of national or regional conservation concern. Roadsides in North Dakota, although dominated mostly by generalist bird species with edge tolerance, may have some management potential for area-dependent grassland birds. 3awild birds 3ahabitats 3arural roads 3aroadside plants 3aTypha 3anesting sites 3anests 3apopulation density 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aNorth Dakota 3aPrairie Pothole region 0aavifauna 0aroadside habitats 0ahabitat utilization1 aLinz, G.M.1 aBleier, W.H.1 aHoman, H.J.0 tThe American midland naturalist.g2008 Jan., v.  159, no.  1 p.162-1717nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/116603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159%5B162:AUORRW%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080318b20080404c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/03/17  aOther US  aUSDA/APHIS 7aarticle03200naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092024002100132040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100001600198245012100214300001600335500002400351500001500375520132800390650002001718650001301738650001601751650001901767650001401786650002401800650003801824650001401862650002601876650002601902650002301928650001001951650001701961650003101978650002302009650001702032650003502049650001602084650001102100650001902111653002702130700002102157700001702178700001102195773007502206852000902281856011202290856009002402930003302492945002502525946001102550961001302561655001202574IND4374532920221122062532.0050920e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437453292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2003.11.0142doi7 a10113/261022hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ114 0aQ5041 aMohamed, A.10aEstimation of HRW wheat heat damage by DSC, capillary zone electrophoresis, photoacoustic spectroscopy and rheometry  ap. 195-203.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aHeat damage to wheat caused by post-harvest drying was evaluated.  3 cultivars of hard red winter wheat (2174, Jagger and 2137), cultivated in Oklahoma, USA, were analysed, looking specifically at isolated wheat starch, flour and kernels.  DSC was used for the analysis of starch, photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) was used to examine wheat kernels and DSC, capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and rheometry were used to analyse wheat flour.  Little variation in the temp. of starch gelatinization was observed from DSC results.  At a storage temp. of 50°C, ΔH values increased.  The 3 cultivars exhibited differences in heat sensitivity, according to PAS results.  Heat resistance of the pericarp of cv. Jagger was approx. 5× higher than those of cv. 2174 or 2137.  Storage for 60 days at 50°C affected gluten proteins in cv. 2137 more than in the other 2 cultivars, according to CZE maps.  It was demonstrated by non-linear steady shearing measurements that all 3 heat-damaged flours had reduced viscosities compared with unheated flours, indicating that the breadmaking quality of heat-damaged flour would be worse than that of untreated flour.  Linear and non-linear viscoelastic behaviours were less altered in heat-treated Jagger flour than in cv. 2174 and 2137, suggesting that Jagger has better protein quality. 3aviscoelasticity 3apericarp 3awheat flour 3aheat tolerance 3aviscosity 3astorage temperature 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3acultivars 3apostharvest treatment 3ahard red winter wheat 3agelling properties 3aseeds 3awheat gluten 3aphotoacoustic spectroscopy 3adrying temperature 3awheat starch 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3astarch gels 3adrying 3agelatinization 0arheological properties1 aRayas-Duarte, P.1 aGordon, S.H.1 aXu, J.0 tFood chemistry.g2004 Sept., v.  87, no.  2 p.195-203x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/261023Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2003.11.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090307b00000000c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/03/07  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03784naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002100127040001800148072000900166100001600175245010800191300001600299500002400315500001500339520208500354650001802439650004402457650002102501650002402522650003702546650002202583650001902605650002002624650001102644650004402655650002202699653002302721653001102744700001802755700002202773700001802795700001902813700002702832773010702859852000902966856008502975856011203060930003303172945002503205946001103230961001303241655001203254IND4422800920221121094222.0090703e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442280092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-009-0369-82doi7 a10113/357562hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aHe, Zhongqi10aCharacterization of plant-derived water extractable organic matter by multiple spectroscopic techniques  ap. 609-616.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aWater extractable organic matter (WEOM) derived from fresh- or early-stage decomposing soil amendment materials may play an important role in the process of organic matter accumulation. In this study, eight WEOM samples extracted with a 40:1 (v/w) water to sample ratio from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), corn (Zea mays L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.), lupin (Lupinus albus L.), soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and dairy manure were investigated using ultraviolet (UV)-visible, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), solution ³¹P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and solid state ¹³C NMR spectroscopies. UV-visible and FT-IR spectra of the plant-derived WEOM samples were typical for natural organic matter, but possessed less humic-like characteristics than dairy manure-derived WEOM. Solution ³¹P NMR spectra indicated that WEOM samples extracted from alfalfa, corn, and soybean shoots contained both orthophosphate and monoester P. Of the monoester P in WEOM from soybean shoot, 70% was phytate P. WEOM from crimson clover, hairy vetch, lupin, and wheat shoots contained orthophosphate only. The solid-state ¹³C NMR spectra of the seven plant-derived WEOM samples indicated that they all were primarily composed of sugars, amino acids or peptides, and low molecular mass carboxylic acids. Carbohydrates were dominant components with very few aromatics present in these samples. In addition, WEOM from crimson clover and lupin, but not other three leguminous plant WEOM samples, contained significant asparagine. On the other hand, WEOM from corn and wheat contained less amino acids or peptides. The spectra of WEOM of dairy manure revealed the presence of significant amounts of nonprotonated carbons and lignin residues, suggesting humification of the manure-derived WEOM. Significant carbohydrates as well as aromatics were present in this WEOM. The P and C bonding information for these WEOM samples may be useful for understanding the effects of WEOM on soil nutrient availability to plants. 3afractionation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahumic substances 3asoil organic matter 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3achemical analysis 3aplant extracts 3asoil amendments 3acarbon 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aspectral analysis 0aorganic amendments 0aplants1 aMao, Jingdong1 aHoneycutt, Wayne.1 aOhno, Tsutomu1 aHunt, James F.1 aCade-Menun, Barbara J.0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2009 July, v.  45, no.  6 p.609-616dSpringer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-009-0369-83Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/357563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20091117b20091204c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/11/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03888naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024004000134024002500174024004000199024002300239040001800262100002000280245006000300300001600360506002800376506003200404520213100436596007302567596008302640506003702723650001502760650002602775650002002801650001602821650001002837650003502847650002902882700001902911700001902930700002402949700006202973700002203035773007503057856011403132856009003246903002203336961001503358852000903373655001203382IND60736162920221214230213.0210504s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073616292DNAL7 a10113/73616292hdl7 a3821762aris7 a10.3390/agriengineering30200112doi7 a4383402aris_accn_no7 a5082-21000-001-00D2aris_project_no7 a3821762seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuino, Jannette10aRFID and Drones: The Next Generation of Plant Inventory  ap. 168-181.  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aCollection of plant inventory (i.e., count, grade, plant size, yield) data is time-consuming, can be inaccurate, and costly. There has been improvements to the involved processes; however, they still rely heavily on manual labor. In response to increasing labor costs and shortages, there is an increased need for adoption of more automated technologies by the nursery industry. Growers, small and large, are beginning to adopt technologies (e.g., plant spacing robots) that automate or augment certain operations, but greater strides must be taken to integrate next generation technologies into these challenging unstructured agricultural environments. The main objective of this work is to demonstrate merging specific ground and aerial-based technologies (Radio Frequency Identification [RFID], and small Unmanned Aircraft System [sUAS]) into a holistic systems approach to address the specific need of moving toward automated on-demand plant inventory. This preliminary work focuses on evaluating different RFID tags with respect to their distance and orientation to the RFID reader. Fourteen different RFID tags, five distances (1.5 m, 3.0 m, 4.5 m, 6.0 m, and 7.6 m), and four tag orientations [the front of the tag (UP), back of the tag (DN), tag at sideways-left (SL), and tag at sideways-right (SR)] were assessed. Results showed that the tag upward orientation resulted in the highest scanning rate for both the laboratory and field experiments. Two orientations (UP and SR) had significant effect on the scan rate of tags. The distance between the reader and the tags at 1.5 meter and 6.0 m did not significantly affect the scanning efficiency of the RFID system in horizontally fixed (p-value > 0.05) position regardless of tags. Different tag designs also produced different scan rates. Overall, since most of the tags were scanned at least once (except for Tag 6F), it is a very promising technology for using in nursery inventory data acquisition. Although these experiments are focused on inventory in plant nurseries, results for this work has potential for inventory management in other agricultural sectors.  cHorticultural Research Institutedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005888  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomation 3abotanical composition 3adata collection 3ainventories 3alabor 3aradio frequency identification 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aMaja, Joe Mari1 aRobbins, James1 aFernandez, R.Thomas1 aOwen, James S.

Fourteen flocks (2 465 sheep) were used. Five flocks (450 sheep) were considered MAP non-infected and 9 flocks (2 015 sheep) had sheep infected with MAP. Sheep were skin tested and blood was collected for AGID and ELISA testing. Results were analyzed using a Bayesian 3-test in 1-population model fitted in WinBUGS. The model allowed for dependence (correlation) between the two serologic tests, but these two tests were assumed to be conditionally independent of the skin test. The estimated specificity was 99.5% (95% PI of 98.9-99.9%) for the AGID; 99.3% (98.4-99.8%) for the ELISA using an optical density measured cutoff of 0.20; 99.2% (98.1-99.8%) using a cutoff of 0.15; 97.5% (95.8-98.7%) using a cutoff of 0.10; and 98.7% (97.3-99.5%) for the skin test. The estimated sensitivities were 8.3% (6.2-10.7%) for the AGID; 8.0% (6.0-10.4%), 10.6% (8.3-13.1%), and 16.3% (13.5-19.4%) for the ELISA using the cutoffs 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 respectively; and 73.3% (62.3-85.8%) for the skin test. The skin test was specific in non-infected populations and sensitive in infected populations, although in some cases a positive skin test might represent MAP exposure rather than infection. The AGID and ELISA were specific but lacked sensitivity. The AGID and ELISA consistently identified two different populations of infected sheep with only moderate overlap between positive test results. 3aimmunodiffusion tests 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease detection 3aserodiagnosis 3asheep 3aflocks 3aparatuberculosis 3aBayesian theory 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3askin tests 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3astatistical models 2aAnimals 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aImmunodiffusionxveterinary 2aParatuberculosisxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aSkin Testsxveterinary 3aMidwestern United States 0aMidwestern United Statesxepidemiology 0adisease diagnosis1 aGardner, Ian A.1 aThomsen, Bruce V.1 aMorrical, Daniel G.1 aMartin, Barbara M.1 aPalmer, Mitchell V.1 aThoen, Charles O.1 aEwing, Chad0 tVeterinary research.g2006 , v.  37, no.  4 p.553-5647nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/357573Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/vetres:20060183Available from publisher's Web site  a20091117b20091204c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/11/16  aNon-US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02484naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003100134024002500165024004000190024002300230040001800253100002200271245005100293520104800344650002701392650001101419650001201430650001901442650001001461650002501471650002501496700001901521700002701540700005701567700002801624700003301652700002801685700002701713773007901740856011401819856008101933961001502014852000902029655001202038IND60736163020221214230231.0210504e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073616302DNAL7 a10113/73616302hdl7 a3827762aris7 a10.3390/polym130813452doi7 a4381642aris_accn_no7 a6054-41000-108-00D2aris_project_no7 a3827762seq_no_115  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahamn, Md Saifur10aRecent developments of carboxymethyl cellulose  aCarboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is one of the most promising cellulose derivatives.

The combination of goat T1 used as primary (coating) and rabbit C3 as intermediate (detecting) rCP antibodies reacted efficiently, with optical density at 405 nm (OD405) values between 0.250 and 2.000 with samples from an international collection of diverse CTV isolates. The CTV isolates tested cause a broad spectrum of disease syndromes in different citrus hosts. The OD405 values for healthy tissue were less than 0.100. Likewise, the combination of goat T1 and rabbit C3 rCP antibodies gave consistent results for CTV-positive and -negative sample discrimination when directly compared with the Central California Tristeza Eradication Agency (CCTEA) antibodies used for large-scale CTV detection and a commercially available CTV serological detection kit. The combination of goat T1 and rabbit C3 rCP antibodies showed its suitability for large-scale indexing with samples collected in commercial groves as part of the CCTEA's regular monitoring program. The evaluation included 41,195 samples from 301 commercial groves from districts 1, 2, and 3. In total, 26 trees (0.063%) were found to be CTV positive using the T1/C3 rCP antibody combination. Results of this research provide evidence that rCP antibodies can be efficiently used for both capturing and detecting CTV antigens in double-antibody sandwich indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 3acoat proteins 3arecombinant antigens 3adisease detection 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aserodiagnosis 3aantibodies 3astrain differences 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aviral antigens 3aaccuracy 3adisease surveillance 0amethodology 0anew methods 0astrains1 aMetheney, P.1 aPolek, M.L.1 aManjunath, K.L.1 aLee, R.F.1 aRocha-Peña, M.A.0 tPlant disease.g2009 Jan., v.  93, no.  1 p.11-16wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-93-1-00113Available from publisher's Web site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/268313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/26  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02487naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072001700131072001700148100001500165245009500180300001600275500002400291500001500315520120700330650002001537650002701557650001101584650002301595650002501618650002901643653001701672700001901689700001201708700001601720773012401736852000901860856011201869930003301981945002502014946001302039961001302052655001202065IND4367427720221123015411.0050303e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436742772DNAL7 a10113/374772hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this paper, we construct indicators of water contamination from the use of agricultural chemicals. These environmental indicators are merged with data on marketed outputs and purchased inputs to form a state-by-year panel of relative levels of outputs and inputs, including environmental impacts. We do not have prices for these undesirable by products, since they are not marketed. Consequently, we calculate a series of Malmquist productivity indexes, which do not require price information. Our benchmark scenario is a conventional Malmquist productivity index based on marketed outputs and purchased inputs only. Our comparison scenarios consist of environmentally sensitive Malmquist productivity indexes that include indicators of risk to human health and to aquatic life from chronic exposure to pesticides. In addition, we derive a set of virtual prices of the undesirable by-products that can be used to calculate an environmentally sensitive Fisher index of productivity change. 3awater pollution 3aagricultural economics 3aprices 3aeconometric models 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental indicators 0aproductivity1 aLovell, C.A.K.1 aLuu, H.1 aNehring, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2004 Dec., v.  29, no.  3 p.436-460wJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/374773Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20100114b20100205c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/01/13  aOther US  aUSDA/ERS 7aarticle03102naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092040001800113072000900131072000900140100002900149245013700178500010300315500002400418500001500442520155200457650001602009650002402025650004102049650001502090650002802105651001102133653002902144653003102173653002302204653003302227653002602260653002202286700002202308773010902330852000902439856011202448930003302560945002502593946001302618961001302631655001202644IND4420383220221119033808.0090512s2006    xx |||||||||||||||||eng||7 aIND442038322DNAL7 a10113/290242hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aConfesor, Remegio B.

SWAT was calibrated in the Calapooia watershed, Oregon, USA, with two different pairs of objective functions in a cluster of 24 parallel computers. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), a fast MOEA, and SWAT were called from a parallel genetic algorithm library (PGAPACK) to determine the Pareto optimal set. One hundred fifty-five parameters were explicitly calibrated (9 for each 17 hydrologic response units [HRUs] and 2 for the whole watershed). With the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the daily flows as objective functions, the Pareto front converged to a narrow range of solution set. A wider Pareto optimal front was formed when the RMSE of high and low flows were used as objective functions. The calibrated SWAT model simulated well the daily streamflow of the Calapooia River for a 3-year period. The daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency was 0.85 at calibration and 0.80 at validation. Automatic multi-objective calibration of a complex process-based watershed model such as SWAT was successfully implemented using Pareto ordering optimization and an MOEA. Simultaneous automatic-calibration of flows and water quality parameters for the whole watershed and for different sub-basins, dynamic link with economic models, and integration of uncertainty and sensitivity methods are now explored. 3acalibration 3awatershed hydrology 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aalgorithms 3aagricultural watersheds 3aOregon 0aPareto optimal solutions 0amathematics and statistics 0agenetic algorithms 0aPareto ordering optimization 0aautomatic calibration 0ahydrologic models1 aWhittaker, Gerald0 tPaper.g2006, , no.  062128aAmerican Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.x0149-98907nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/290243Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/05/14  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03820naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092024002200124024001900146024002100165040001800186100001700204245011700221300001600338500002400354506007600378506017300454520206400627506003702691650003202728650001602760650001602776650002802792650001002820650001402830700001502844700001802859700002002877700001802897700001902915700001402934700001802948773008002966852000903046856011203055856008203167956007603249961001303325655001203338IND4462490120221207135240.0111219e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446249012DNAL7 a10.3114/sim.2011.70.042doi7 aPMC32339102pmcid7 a223080482pmid7 a10113/539222hdl  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamson, R.A.10aPhylogeny and nomenclature of the genus Talaromyces and taxa accommodated in Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium  ap. 159-184.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe taxonomic history of anamorphic species attributed to Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium is reviewed, along with evidence supporting their relationship with teleomorphic species classified in Talaromyces. To supplement previous conclusions based on ITS, SSU and/or LSU sequencing that Talaromyces and subgenus Biverticillium comprise a monophyletic group that is distinct from Penicillium at the generic level, the phylogenetic relationships of these two groups with other genera of Trichocomaceae was further studied by sequencing a part of the RPB1 (RNA polymerase II largest subunit) gene. Talaromyces species and most species of Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium sensu Pitt reside in a monophyletic clade distant from species of other subgenera of Penicillium. For detailed phylogenetic analysis of species relationships, the ITS region (incl. 5.8S nrDNA) was sequenced for the available type strains and/or representative isolates of Talaromyces and related biverticillate anamorphic species. Extrolite profiles were compiled for all type strains and many supplementary cultures. All evidence supports our conclusions that Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium is distinct from other subgenera in Penicillium and should be taxonomically unified with the Talaromyces species that reside in the same clade. Following the concepts of nomenclatural priority and single name nomenclature, we transfer all accepted species of Penicillium subgenus Biverticillium to Talaromyces. A holomorphic generic diagnosis for the expanded concept of Talaromyces, including teleomorph and anamorph characters, is provided. A list of accepted Talaromyces names and newly combined Penicillium names is given. Species of biotechnological and medical importance, such as P. funiculosum and P. marneffei, are now combined in Talaromyces. Excluded species and taxa that need further taxonomic study are discussed. An appendix lists other generic names, usually considered synonyms of Penicillium sensu lato that were considered prior to our adoption of the name Talaromyces.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aPenicillium 3aTalaromyces 3abiological nomenclature 3agenes 3aphylogeny1 aYilmaz, N.1 aHoubraken, J.1 aSpierenburg, H.1 aSeifert, K.A.1 aPeterson, S.W.1 aVarga, J.1 aFrisvad, J.C.0 tStudies in mycology.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 70, no. 1 p.159-184x1872-97977nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/539223Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3114/sim.2011.70.043Available from publisher's Web site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/111897_10362.pdf  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03542naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024001900110040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165100001500174245007000189300001600259500002400275520155700299650001701856650001901873650002801892650002101920650002901941650001601970650001701986650001802003650002202021650001702043650001002060650003302070650002702103650002902130650002802159650002802187650001102215650001802226650004102244650000902285650001602294650001802310650002102328650002502349653003802374700002102412700001902433700001902452700001702471700001802488700001702506700001902523773009902542856011002641930003302751945002502784946001302809961001302822852000902835655001202844IND4388116220221117222924.0070221e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438811622DNAL7 a15436922pmid7 a10113/1102hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL840 0aX3801 aCampos, H.10aLow density lipoprotein particle size and coronary artery disease  ap. 187-195.  aIncludes references  aDecreased plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size has been associated with premature coronary artery disease (CAD). We examined LDL particle size by 2-16% gradient gel electrophoresis in 275 men with CAD (greater than 75% cross-sectional-area stenosis) and 822 controls. Seven major LDL size bands (with LDL-1 [d = 1.025-1.033 g/ml] being the largest and LDL-7 [d = 1.050-1.063 g/ml, the smallest]) were identified. Because most subjects had two or more adjacent LDL bands, an LDL score was calculated for each subject, with the relative area in each band taken into consideration. Four major LDL particle size groups were classified in the present studies: large LDL, intermediate LDL, small LDL, and very small LDL. The use of beta-blockers was significantly associated with smaller LDL particles. After adjusting for use of this medication, small LDL particles were still more prevalent in CAD patients (39%) compared with controls (27%). The prevalence of large LDL particles was lower in CAD patients (3%) than in controls (24%). Intermediate LDL particles were the most prevalent in both groups, 49% in CAD patients and 46% in controls. The difference in LDL particle size between CAD patients and controls was not independent but was highly associated (p less than 0.0001) with elevated triglyceride levels and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Significantly higher LDL cholesterol levels were found in subjects with intermediate and small LDL particles than in those with large or very small LDL particles. 3ablood plasma 3ablood proteins 3alow density lipoprotein 3atriacylglycerols 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3acholesterol 3arisk factors 3aparticle size 3avascular diseases 3ahuman health 2aAdult 2aApolipoprotein A-Ixanalysis 2aApolipoproteinsxblood 2aApolipoproteins Bxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCoronary Diseasexblood 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoproteins, LDLxbloodxchemistry. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aParticle Size 2aReference Values 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0apremature coronary artery disease1 aGenest, J.J.

The presence of Ampelomyces spp. was quantified in naturally occurring powdery mildew fungi collected in Hungary and Romania between 1992 and 1995. A total of 570 samples was studied representing 27 species (nine genera) of the Erysiphaceae infecting 41 host plant genera. The incidence of Ampelomyces spp., determined as the proportion of samples in which intracellular pycnidia were present, varied between 4.3 and 68.8% in the host fungal genera studied. The intensity of mycoparasitism, defined as a percentage of the powdery mildew mycelia parasitized by Ampelomyces, ranged from 0.15 to 65%. Both the incidence and the intensity of mycoparasitism showed the lowest values in Blumeria graminis (DC.) Speer collected from wild and cultivated monocotyledons, while the highest values were found in Arthrocladiella mougeotii (Lév.) Vassilkov infecting Lycium halimifolium Mill. plants. The paper reports for the first time the natural occurrence of Ampelomyces in Sawadaea bicornis (Wallr.∶Fr.) Homma on maple.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahost range 3aLycium barbarum 3aBlumeria graminis 3ahyperparasitism 3afrequency 3aAmpelomyces 3amycelium 3amildews 3aleaves 3aRomania 3aHungary0 tnew phytologist.g1998 Dec., v. 140, no. 4 p.709-714dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00316.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02332naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100003500150245009700185300001600282500001500298520108300313592002801396650003201424650002401456650001801480650001701498650001501515650004301530650001201573650002601585650001101611650002001622650001301642653003801655700002701693700002001720773009901740856008601839852000901925655001201934IND4467104220221118190857.0141111e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446710422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández-Cázares, Aleida S.10aReprint of: An enzyme sensor for the determination of total amines in dry-fermented sausages  ap. 324-327.  a2019-12-06  aAn enzyme sensor employing diamine oxidase from porcine kidney in combination with an oxygen electrode has been developed and optimised to estimate the content of total amines in dry-fermented sausages. The enzyme DAO was immobilised on a preactivated Immunodyne membrane using glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent. The enzymatic determination was based on the measurement of the consumed O₂ in a platinum electrode poised at −600mV versus Ag/AgCl. The reaction was started by the direct injection of either the standard or meat extract on the enzymatic membrane. The immobilised enzyme could be used up to 30 analyses along the day without significant loss of sensitivity and could be stored at 4°C showing good stability for at least 6 weeks. A good correlation was observed when comparing data obtained with the enzyme sensor to those obtained with a standard HPLC method. Thus, this sensor may be a reliable screening method to detect the presence of biogenic amines in dry-fermented sausages that can constitute a useful tool for quality control in the meat industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3alivestock and meat industry 3aimmobilized enzymes 3ameat extracts 3ameat quality 3aelectrodes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3akidneys 3aprimary-amine oxidase 3aoxygen 3abiogenic amines 3asausages 0aamine oxidase (copper-containing)1 aAristoy, M-Concepción1 aToldrá, Fidel,0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 May, v. 110, no. 2 p.324-327dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245013800183300001800321500001500339520149500354592002801849650001701877650001601894650001001910650002401920650001201944650001301956650002201969650001701991650001702008650001602025650001902041651001302060653001802073653001902091653001602110653001602126653001302142653001102155700001802166700002002184700001902204700002102223700002102244700002002265773013002285856008202415852000902497655001202506IND60517486520221121032354.0190803e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051748652DNAL7 a257149932pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800150002822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElbel, Brian10aAssessment of a government-subsidized supermarket in a high-need area on household food availability and children’s dietary intakes  ap. 2881-2890.  a2019-12-06  aTo assess the impact of a new government-subsidized supermarket in a high-need area on household food availability and dietary habits in children. A difference-in-difference study design was utilized. Two neighbourhoods in the Bronx, New York City. Outcomes were collected in Morrisania, the target community where the new supermarket was opened, and Highbridge, the comparison community. Parents/caregivers of a child aged 3–10 years residing in Morrisania or Highbridge. Participants were recruited via street intercept at baseline (pre-supermarket opening) and at two follow-up periods (five weeks and one year post-supermarket opening). Analysis is based on 2172 street-intercept surveys and 363 dietary recalls from a sample of predominantly low-income minorities. While there were small, inconsistent changes over the time periods, there were no appreciable differences in availability of healthful or unhealthful foods at home, or in children’s dietary intake as a result of the supermarket. The introduction of a government-subsidized supermarket into an underserved neighbourhood in the Bronx did not result in significant changes in household food availability or children’s dietary intake. Given the lack of healthful food options in underserved neighbourhoods and need for programmes that promote access, further research is needed to determine whether healthy food retail expansion, alone or with other strategies, can improve food choices of children and their families.  aPublisher supplied data 3asupermarkets 3afood intake 3afoods 3aexperimental design 3asurveys 3achildren 3afood availability 3ahealthy diet 3afood choices 3adiet recall 3afood retailing 3aNew York 0aeating habits 0aDietary intake 0aFood access 0aSupermarket 0aChildren 0aPolicy1 aMoran, Alyssa1 aDixon, L.

In this work, aSnS₂ ultra-thin layer is fabricated on the surface of the Na₃Zr₂Si₂PO₁₂ electrolyte by a fast (1 min) and convenient (air atmosphere) pyrolysis method. A mixed-ion-electron conductor layer consisting of Na–Sn alloy and Na₂S constructed in situ through the reaction between the Na metal anode and SnS₂ can not only build a continuous and tight bonding interface between Na₃Zr₂Si₂PO₁₂ and Na, but also realize the uniform and rapid transfer of charge and Na⁺ flux at the interface, resulting in a stable interface during the Na deposition/stripping process. The Na symmetric cell with a maximum current density of 0.9 mA cm⁻² can be stably operated at 0.1–0.4 mA cm⁻² with low overpotential for a long time at room temperature. The Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃|Na₃Zr₂Si₂PO₁₂–SnS₂|Na solid-state battery delivers excellent capacity retention ratios and rate performance, profiting from the constructed stable interface. This work proposes a facial strategy for the improvement of interface design, driving the application of inorganic solid electrolyte in solid-state batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalloys 3aambient temperature 3aanodes 3abatteries 3aelectrolytes 3apyrolysis 3asodium1 aChen, Jingjing1 aMao, Zhiyong1 aWang, Dajian0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 27, v. 9, no. 29 p.16039-16045dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta04869d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011000174300001600284500002000300520167000320592002801990650001702018650002802035650001502063650001802078650001202096650001302108650001202121650001402133650003302147650001902180700001802199700001902217773012002236852000902356856008902365961001302454655001202467IND2198229120221118041210.0210417e199812  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219822912DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00308.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLIVINGSTON, D. P.10aBarley yellow dwarf virus: effects on carbohydrate metabolism in oat (Avena sativa) during cold hardening  ap. 699-707.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBarley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) causes significant losses in yield and in overwintering ability of winter cereals. Mechanisms by which the physiology of plants is affected by the virus are not clear. To see how carbohydrates in the crown of winter cereals were affected by BYDV, fructan isomers of degree of polymerization (DP) 3–5, fructan DP>6 and the simple sugars, glucose, fructose and sucrose, were measured before and during cold hardening in three oat (Avena sativa L.) cultivars, ‘Wintok’, ‘Coast Black’ and ‘Fulghum’. On a fresh weight basis fructan DP>6 decreased by 50% in infected ‘Wintok’ and ‘Coast Black’ and by 25% in ‘Fulghum’. Two DP3, one DP4 and one DP5 isomer were significantly higher than non‐infected controls. The percentages of simple sugars in infected crowns were significantly higher than controls in all three cultivars in every week except the first week of hardening. Crude enzyme extracts from BYDV infected plants incubated with sucrose suggested higher invertase and lower sucrose‐sucrosyl transferase activity. When incubated with 1‐kestose and neokestin, no significant difference was found in fructose fructosyl transferase or in hydrolase activity. The activity of unidentified enzymes catalysing the synthesis of larger (DP>5) fructan was altered by BYDV. The decrease of carbohydrates in the crown induced indirectly by BYDV may alter the plant's capacity to regenerate tillers in the spring. The ability of plants to prevent or tolerate carbohydrate fluctuations induced by BYDV infection may be an important genetically regulated characteristic for developing virus‐resistant cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acrop yield 3aoverwintering 3aglucose 3afructose 3asucrose 3acultivars 3aplant diseases and disorders 3acold tolerance1 aGILDOW, F.

Several episodes of low water level and increased salinity were evidenced by peaks of Chenopodium rubrum seeds and the occurrence of obligate (Salicornia sp., Ruppia maritima and Suaeda sp.) and facultative (Zannichellia palustris) halophytic macrophytes as well as brackish water and marine diatoms. Some of these events can be correlated with an increase in diatoms indicative of higher conductivity and with changes in oxygen-isotope data. They are interpreted as the expression of general climatic dryness, although water-level changes might also have resulted from episodes of deposition on the alluvial fans that dam the lake. A few such water-level changes occurred in the Pleniglacial. The most pronounced lowering corresponds to the Younger Dryas interval of high climatic aridity. Macrofossil indicators of water-level changes appeared also in the Holocene section of the profiles at the same time as Quercus expanded on the surrounding uplands, culminating about 6000- 5000 ¹⁴C yr BP, giving support to the hypothesis that the delay of forest expansion in this part of the Zagros Mountains was caused by climatic dryness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChenopodium rubrum 3aQuercus 3aRuppia maritima 3aSalicornia 3aSuaeda 3aZannichellia 3abrackish water 3acarbon 3adry environmental conditions 3aforests 3ahalophytes 3ahighlands 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3amarshes 3amountains 3apaleoecology 3aradionuclides 3asalinity 3aseeds 3aIran 0aPlant macrofossils 0aaquatic macrophytes 0aclimate aridity 0awater-level changes 0aPleniglacial 0aYounger Dryas 0aHolocene 0aIran0 tHolocene.g2005 July, v. 15, no. 5 p.720-735dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl846rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03531naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003300135040001800168100001800186245021100204300001200415506007600427520167100503592002802174506003702202650001002239650002502249650001902274650001202293650000902305650001102314650003502325650001302360650003802373650001202411650003202423650003002455650003602485650000902521650001102530650001102541650000902552650005702561650002702618650006002645700002302705700001902728700002202747700002102769700002302790773009702813856004602910852000902956655001202965IND50061983420221207050906.0130327e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006198342DNAL7 a231311922pmid7 aPMC35345022pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-6148-8-2122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Raul F10aEvaluation of the effect of calcium gluconate and bovine thrombin on the temporal release of transforming growth factor beta 1 and platelet-derived growth factor isoform BB from feline platelet concentrates  ap. 527.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: There are not reported regarding the protocols for obtaining platelet concentrates (PC) in cats for medical purposes. The objectives of this study were: 1) to describe a manual method for producing two kinds of PC in cats (PC-A and PC-B), 2) to describe the cellular population of the PC, 3) to measure and compare the effect of calcium gluconate (CG) and bovine thrombin (BT) on the temporal release of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β₁) and platelet-derived growth factor type BB (PDGF-BB) at 3 and 12 hours post-activation and 4) to establish correlations between the cellular population of both PCs and the concentration of growth factors (GF). Blood samples were taken from 16 cats for complete blood count, plasma collection and PC preparation. The PC were arbitrarily divided into two fractions, specifically, PC-A (lower fraction) and PC-B (upper fraction). RESULTS: The platelet counts were significantly different (P<0.05) between the PC and whole blood but not between the PC fractions. The TGF-β₁ concentration efficiencies for PC-A and PC-B activated with CG were 42.86% and 46.54%, and activated with BT were 42.88% and 54.64%, respectively. The PDGF-BB concentration efficiencies for PC-A and PC-B activated with CG were 61.36% and 60.61%, and activated with BT were 65.64% and 72.12%, respectively. The temporal release of GFs showed no statistically significant difference (P>0.05) between the activating substances at the time or for any PC fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Whatever the activation means, these preparations of cat PC provide significant concentrations of platelets and GFs for possible clinical or experimental use.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood 3ablood platelet count 3ablood sampling 3acalcium 3acats 3acattle 3aplatelet-derived growth factor 3athrombin 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 2aAnimals 2aBlood Plateletsxmetabolism 2aBlood Specimen Collection 2aCalcium Gluconatexpharmacology 2aCats 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aMale 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-sisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aThrombinxpharmacology 2aTransforming Growth Factor beta1xgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aAlvarez, Maria E.,1 aRíos, Diana L1 aLópez, Catalina,1 aCarmona, Jorge U1 aRezende, Cleuza MF0 tBMC veterinary research.g2012 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.527-527dSpringer-Verlagx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-212  aDNAL 7aarticle01444naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012300172300001800295520028300313592002800596650001100624650001100635650002300646650002300669650001400692653001800706653001200724653002000736653002200756700002500778700002200803700002400825700001900849700001900868773008100887856008100968852000901049655001201058IND60551568420221120201413.0161102e20161013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllsworth, Alyssa A.10aOne-pot triflic anhydride-mediated synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted 2-imidazolines from N-(2-haloethyl)amides and amines  ap. 6380-6389.  aA one-pot synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted 2-imidazolines from N-(2-haloethyl)amides has been developed.

These biochars were subsequently evaluated as a perfume delivery system for air care. The performance of biochar was compared to that of cellulosic material, which is commonly used for the release of perfume into the air, and to that of active charcoal, which is used for air purification. A perfume model system consisting of alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, and terpenes was loaded onto these solid materials. Results showed that the cellulosic material had a good release profile, but that the aldehydes oxidized to some extent, which generates a rancid smell if no antioxidant is added. On the other hand, active charcoal strongly absorbed all volatiles such that no perfume release occurred and no smell was perceived. The biochar heated at 200°C showed good release performance (long lasting) but some fecal off‐notes remained in the background. Biochar prepared at 300°C was the best material as a compromise between the release profile and the energy needed to produce the material. The goal of this work was to add value to biochar and in so doing empower toilet innovators, aid the circular economy, and propose a sustainable solution for malodor control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aalkanes 3aantioxidants 3abiochar 3aenergy 3afeces 3ahumans 3amodels 3aoff odors 3aoxygen 3aperfumes 3asawdust 3asmell 3aterpenoids1 aNiclass, Yvan1 aBeaussoubre, Pascal1 aZimmermann, Janina1 aCayeux, Isabelle1 aChappuis, Charles Jean‐François1 aFieber, Wolfgang0 tFlavour and fragrance journal.g2018 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.82-90dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0882-57347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ffj.34133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245020900172300001400381520181400395592002802209650001702237650001502254650000902269650002102278650001302299650001602312650001302328650001902341650001402360650001902374650001802393650001902411650001902430650002202449650001502471651001002486651001302496700002002509700001802529700002102547700002002568700002102588700002002609773008502629856008602714852000902800655001202809IND4475682620221118190458.0141111e20110415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447568262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScarciglia, Fabio10aSoil genesis, morphodynamic processes and chronological implications in two soil transects of SE Sardinia, Italy: Traditional pedological study coupled with laser ablation ICP-MS and radionuclide analyses  ap. 39-64.  aSoils are characterized by an intrinsic variability through time and space at different scales of observation and are often affected by morphodynamic processes strictly interacting with pedogenesis, under changing (paleo)environmental/climatic conditions. We focus on exploring this interplay in modern soils and paleosols of southeast Sardinia (Italy), integrating two innovative techniques to a traditional pedological study: (i) laser ablation ICP-MS spot analyses applied to detect microscale distribution of trace elements in discrete soil features of organic-mineral (A) and argillic (Bt) horizons in thin sections, and (ii) radioactive disequilibria as tracers and chronometers of pedogenetic alteration and geomorphic dynamics. The Pleistocene paleosols developed mainly during interglacial periods, with important clay illuviation and rubification. The other soils are essentially characterized by organic matter incorporation into the profiles. Field discontinuities described within soil profiles, related to phases of sediment aggradation and/or surface erosion, are often supported by laboratory results, mainly micromorphological and geochemical data. LA-ICP-MS data show an overall trend of increase of most trace elements (REEs included) from skeletal rock fragments to both clayey and organic-rich soil matrix to clay coatings. This pathway is clearly controlled by the degree of weathering of primary minerals and by pedogenetic processes, where element adsorption onto reactive sites of organic matter and clay particles and clay illuviation play prominent roles. Recent trends of the studied soils/paleosols in terms of geomorphic stability (equilibrium) or morphodynamic processes (erosion/accumulation rates) are estimated using radionuclide disequilibria in the order of 1cm/a or lower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aclay 3aclimatic factors 3acoatings 3ailluviation 3aminerals 3aorganic matter 3asediments 3asoil formation 3asoil profiles 3aspace and time 3atrace elements 3atracer techniques 3aweathering 3aItaly 3aSardinia1 aTuccimei, Paola1 aVacca, Andrea1 aBarca, Donatella1 aPulice, Iolanda1 aSalzano, Roberto1 aSoligo, Michele0 tGeoderma.g2011 Apr. 15, v. 162, no. 1-2 p.39-64dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245007600201300001800277500001100295520107400306592002801380650001701408650001001425650002301435650001101458651001801469700001801487700003101505773012401536856007301660852000901733655001201742IND60607700920221119210024.0180731e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060770092DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.133842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReeve, Andrew Hart1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5233-603010aEcologically flexible endemics dominate Indo‐Pacific bird communities  ap. 1980-1982.  aLETTER  aReeve et al. (2016, Ecography, 39, 990‐997) found that ecologically flexible endemics dominate Indo‐Pacific bird communities. This negative relationship between local abundance and global range size contrasts strongly with the positive range size‐abundance relationship “rule,” which would predict community dominance by globally widespread species. Theuerkauf et al. (2017, Journal of Biogeography, 44, 2161–2163) provide new data from New Caledonia which they claim invalidate our study. They find positive relationships between local abundance and local range size, which they attribute to endemic species having narrower habitat niches than globally widespread species. We reanalysed their data using global range sizes, corroborating the pattern we originally reported: negative relationships between local abundance and global range size, driven by a subset of adaptable endemic species. We stress the importance of being explicit about the scale of ecological mechanisms, and ensuring that the scale of analysis matches the scale of interpretation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abirds 3aindigenous species 3aniches 3aNew Caledonia1 aFjeldså, Jon1 aBorregaard, Michael Krabbe0 tJournal of biogeography.g2018 Aug., v. 45, no. 8 p.1980-1982dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.133843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001600151245012500167300001400292520157700306592002801883650001601911650001901927650002001946650001501966650002501981650001702006650002302023650002102046650002402067650001502091650001102106651001102117700003102128773008802159856008702247852000902334655001202343IND4475789720221119103501.0150808e20120424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447578972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiou, Cyril12aA demo-genetic individual-based model for Atlantic salmon populations: Model structure, parameterization and sensitivity  ap. 37-52.  aPredicting the persistence and adaptability of natural populations to climate change is a challenging task. Mechanistic models that integrate biological and evolutionary processes are helpful toward this aim. Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar (L.), is a good candidate to assess the effect of environmental change on a species with a complex life history through an integrative modelling approach due to (i) a large amount of knowledge concerning its biology and (ii) extensive historical data sets that can be used for model validation. This paper presents an individual-based demo-genetic model developed to simulate S. salar population dynamics in southern European populations: IBASAM (Individual-Based Atlantic SAlmon Model). The model structure is described thoroughly. A parameterization exercise was conducted to adjust the model to an extensive set of demographic data collected over 15 years on the Scorff River, Brittany, France. A sensitivity analysis showed that two parameters determining mean and variability of juvenile growth rates were crucial in structuring the simulated populations. Additionally, realistic microevolutionary patterns of different aspects of life history were predicted by the model, reproducing general knowledge on S. salar population biology. The integration into IBASAM of a demo-genetic structure coupled with the explicit representation of individual variability and complex life histories makes it a cohesive and novel tool to assess the effect of potential stressors on evolutionary demography of Atlantic salmon in further studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ademography 3aenvironmental impact 3alife history 3amechanistic models 3amodel validation 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3arivers 3aFrance1 aPrévost, É.q(Étienne),0 tEcological modelling.g2012 Apr. 24, v. 231 p.37-52dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245012900175520181900304592002802123650001602151650001802167650001102185650001302196650002202209650001602231650002202247650001902269651001402288653002302302653002202325653002202347653002602369653001402395773011602409856008302525852000902608655001202617IND60793708320221120104136.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079370832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2022.1277342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaddad, By Samer Hatem10aStrategic planning to integrate urban agriculture in Palestinian urban development under conditions of political instability  aToday, urban agriculture, an element of sustainable urban development, is not a new idea in an urban planning context. However, not all urban planners and policymakers consider urban agriculture in their cities. Palestinian cities are subject to conditions of political instability that negatively impact urban food security. This study proposes a new strategic model to integrate urban agriculture into a Palestinian urban development framework based on an evaluation of the current status of urban agriculture in the Palestinian urban planning system. This study argues that urban agriculture is absent in urban development processes in Palestinian cities and claims presence of a clear gap between urban planning policies and urban agriculture in Palestine. Lack of knowledge and will among Palestinian urban planners and policymakers have led to the emergence of negative attitudes toward urban agricultural activities in the Palestinian urban planning system. This study proposes a strategic model to enhance knowledge and awareness about urban agricultural issues among Palestinian urban planners and policymakers to foster positive attitudes toward the combination of urban agriculture and the urban planning process in harmony with the Palestinian urban methods, laws, and strategic urban development plans for support of the urban agricultural while making Palestinian cities more sustainable, especially under conditions of political instability. Also, integration urban agriculture as a green area into the Palestinian urban environment would support urban ecosystem services to become more resilient and increase the multifunctional use of urban green spaces such as enhancement of urban food security, social and cultural interaction, and improvement of air quality and life in the Palestinian cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3afood security 3amodels 3apolitics 3aurban agriculture 3aurban areas 3aurban development 3aurban forestry 3aPalestine 0aStrategic Planning 0aUrban agriculture 0aUrban development 0aPolitical instability 0aPalestine0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2022 Oct., v. 76 p.127734-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.1277343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02203naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245008100169500001400250520098800264592002801252650001401280650001001294650001401304650001701318651001101335653000801346653000801354653000801362653000801370653000801378653000801386653002701394653001701421653002201438653002001460653001201480700002701492700002501519700002001544773009801564856008601662852000901748655001201757IND60713327420221122220725.0201216e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071332742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1096122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCravo, Túlio10aHeterogeneous effects of Brazilian unemployment insurance reforms on layoffs  aNAL-light  aThis paper presents the first use of program administrative data from Brazil’s unemployment insurance (UI) program to assess the heterogeneous impact of changes in UI eligibility criteria on layoff probabilities. To estimate these impacts, we exploit exogenous program changes introduced by executive and legislative actions in 2015. We demonstrate the importance of using UI administrative data that accounts for the number of prior UI benefit requests to assess the heterogeneous effects of changes in eligibility rules and obtain more precise estimates. We show that the 2015 changes in UI eligibility rules reduced layoffs, and we find evidence that the changes also reduced collusion between workers and employers for layoffs as it became harder to extract subsidies from the UI system. Changes in UI eligibility criteria had heterogeneous impacts depending on the number of prior benefit requests. The layoff reductions were greatest before workers’ second benefit request.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainsurance 3apaper 3asubsidies 3aunemployment 3aBrazil 0aJ21 0aJ22 0aJ46 0aJ65 0aJ68 0aK20 0aUnemployment insurance 0aLabor supply 0aLabor legislation 0aWorker turnover 0aLayoffs1 aO’Leary, Christopher1 aSierra, Ana Cristina1 aVeloso, Leandro0 tEconomics letters.g2020 Dec., v. 197 p.109612-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1096123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014600185300001600331520115700347592002801504650003101532650000801563650003201571650002101603650002801624650001601652650001301668650001001681650002201691650002001713650002401733650001801757650002901775650001801804650005401822650005601876650004201932650002301974650002801997650003002025650002002055650004002075650002402115650002702139700002102166700002602187700002202213700001702235700001802252700002002270700002102290773011302311856004802424852000902472655001202481IND4472985720221119103502.0121003e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447298572DNAL7 a228856682pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-012-4336-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolátko, Jiří10aConstruction of in vitro transcription system for Corynebacterium glutamicum and its use in the recognition of promoters of different classes  ap. 521-529.  aTo facilitate transcription studies in Corynebacterium glutamicum, we have developed an in vitro transcription system for this bacterium used as an industrial producer of amino acids and a model organism for actinobacteria. This system consists of C. glutamicum RNA polymerase (RNAP) core (α2, β, β′), a sigma factor and a promoter-carrying DNA template, that is specifically recognized by the RNAP holoenzyme formed. The RNAP core was purified from the C. glutamicum strain with the modified rpoC gene, which produced His-tagged β′ subunit. The C. glutamicum sigA and sigH genes were cloned and overexpressed using the Escherichia coli plasmid vector, and the sigma subunits σA and σH were purified by affinity chromatography. Using the reconstituted C. glutamicum holo-RNAPs, recognition of the σA- and σH-dependent promoters and synthesis of the specific transcripts was demonstrated. The developed in vitro transcription system is a novel tool that can be used to directly prove the specific recognition of a promoter by the particular σ factor(s) and to analyze transcriptional control by various regulatory proteins in C. glutamicum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aEscherichia coli 3aaffinity chromatography 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3aplasmid vectors 3aregulatory proteins 3asigma factors 3atranscription (genetics) 2aBase Sequence 2aCorynebacterium glutamicumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenetic Techniques 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProtein Binding 2aSigma Factorxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscription, Genetic1 aŠilar, Radoslav1 aRabatinová, Alžbeta1 aŠanderová, Hana1 aHalada, Petr1 aNešvera, Jan1 aKrásný, Libor1 aPátek, Miroslav0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Oct., v. 96, no. 2 p.521-529dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4336-1  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008800169300001800257520052700275592002800802650001800830650002300848650002200871650003700893653002300930653001700953653002400970653002900994653002401023700001901047700002001066700002601086700002401112700001901136700002301155700001601178700001901194700002101213700001701234700002201251773008101273856008101354852000901435655001201444IND60551568620221120201452.0161019e20161006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.08.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO' Neill, Paul M.10aOptimisation of the synthesis of second generation 1,2,4,5 tetraoxane antimalarials  ap. 6118-6126.  aAn efficient route to the synthesis of potent antimalarial aryloxy 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes is described that permits parallel synthesis for Structure–Activity Relationship (SAR) investigations.

They are responsible for the synthesis and remodelling of extracellular proteins by the way of synthesis of some specific kind of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs). Imbalance between MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are known to involve ulcerative wounds in many tissues, including skin. In veterinary medicine, bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) is an ulcerative skin disorder of dairy cattle. To date, Koch’s postulate has not yet been fulfilled for the pathogenesis. In present study, we tested in vitro role of hypoxia if it evokes a response in MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-13 enzymes and their inhibitors in bovine dermal fibroblasts. Dermal fibroblasts were exposed to hypoxia in various time periods (6, 12 and 24 h). Immunoblotting revealed 6-, 12- and 24-h hypoxia, which resulted in 43.5%, 75% and 65% increase in MMP-1, 76%, 61% and 55% increase in MMP-2 and 80%, 78% and 55% increase in MMP-13 enzymes levels, respectively. We observed slight increases in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 enzymes, but differences between treatment and control groups did not show any statistical significance. Our findings indicate that hypoxia induces MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-13 enzymes and may contribute to pathogenesis of BDD through in the development of in vivo lesions.  aThis work was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey under grant [TUBITAK-TOVAG-109O305] and Uludağ University Research Fund under grant [2009-22].  aPublisher supplied data  a109O305cScientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey  a2009-22cUludağ University Research Fund 3acattle diseases 3adairy cattle 3adermatitis 3afibroblasts 3ahomeostasis 3ahypoxia 3aimmunoblotting 3ametalloproteinases 3apathogenesis 3aproteins 3asecretion 3aveterinary medicine 0aBovine dermal fibroblast 0ahypoxia 0amatrix metalloproteinases 0aELISA 0abovine digital dermatitis1 aKahraman, M.

The soils, dated by the radiocarbon method, enabled various alluvial phases that have occurred in the last 2500 years to be chronologically framed. These phases were then correlated with the frequency of the Tiber floods at Rome and with the progradation of its delta. The phases of soil burial by alluvial sediments coincide with the periods of intense flooding of the Tiber at Rome (between the second century Bc and the second century AD, between the sixth and the ninth centuries AD, and between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries AD) and with periods of strong progradation of the river delta. On the basis of the chronological correlation between alluvial phases, glacial variations, and oscillations in the levels of Lakes Fucino and Trasimeno, it was then possible to establish that, corresponding to the alluvial phases, the hydrological balance of the lakes was positive and, in two of the three cases, the increased flood frequency coincided with the phases of advance of the only glacier located in the Apennines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburied soils 3afloods 3aglaciers 3alakes 3ariver deltas 3asediments 3aItaly 0aLate Holocene 0aalluvial sediments 0afloods 0aclimatic changes 0acentral-northern Apennines 0aRome 0aItaly0 tHolocene.g2005 July, v. 15, no. 5 p.768-773dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl850rr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002000154245009800174300001800272500002000290500001500310520124800325592002801573650002301601650001101624650001501635650002301650650002301673650002401696650003201720650001201752650001401764650001501778650002301793650002301816650002401839650003501863650002401898653002401922700002101946700001801967773009801985852000902083856007102092655001202163IND4398323120221122130018.0170626e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439832312DNAL7 a176011482pmid7 a10.1890/06-13352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeeuwen, E. van10aHow population dynamics shape the functional response in a one‐predator–two‐prey system  ap. 1571-1581.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aThe type III functional response has historically been associated with switching predators; when there is a choice of prey the predator favors the more abundant prey type. Although this functional response has been found in experiments where both prey densities are manipulated, in real world studies the type II functional response is more commonly found. In modeling, the type III functional response is often used in systems where the second prey type is, implicitly, assumed to be constant. Here we define a functional response that takes into account both prey densities. This causes the functional response to show both type II and type III behavior, dependent on the interaction between the two prey densities. If we take into account population dynamics, we find a type II functional response in most cases, because predation regulates the relative prey densities. This explains why type III functional responses are found in experiments where both prey densities are manipulated, but type II functional responses occur when the feedback of population dynamics on the functional response is important. Furthermore, the results show that switching can have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect and can even lead to predator extinction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aselection response 3amodels 3aextinction 3apopulation density 3aanimal preferences 3apopulation dynamics 3apredator-prey relationships 2aAnimals 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aModels, Biological 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPredatory Behaviorxphysiology 2aSpecies Specificity 0afunctional response1 aJansen, V.

In particular, since the average number of electronic devices in homes increases year by year and their sensitivity is very high, it is not only important to monitor the total energy consumption, but also the quality of the power supplied. However, in practice, end-users do not have information about the energy consumption in real-time nor about the quality of the power they receive, because electric energy meters are too expensive and complex to be handled. In order to overcome these inconveniences, an innovative, open source, low-cost, precise, and reliable power and electric energy meter is presented that can be easily installed and managed by any inexperienced user at their own home in urban or rural areas.

For example, for desalination discharges, it is done due to cost considerations and the relative ease of construction, while for the discharge of mine tailings the configuration is taken to minimize the mixing of the tailings with the overlying ambient waters. Upon exiting the nozzle, the horizontal dense jet will curve towards and impinge on the seabed due to the negative buoyancy. The boundary interactions would intensify if the offset between the outfall and seabed, or the bed proximity, reduces. If the outfall is placed sufficiently close to the boundary, a dynamic attachment, also known as Coanda attachment, can take place. The Coanda attachment is undesirable for desalination discharges since the mixing and dilution of the brine discharge will be significantly impaired. At the same time, it is desirable for mine tailing discharges for the same reason. Quantitative assessment of the boundary impingement and attachment of the offset dense jet is thus of interest for the specific design objectives. In the present study, an experimental investigation of this subject was conducted using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) as the experimental techniques. Coanda-influenced and free horizontal offset dense jets were investigated by varying the discharge densimetric Froude number, Fr, as well as the bed proximity parameter z₀/LM. Various impingement characteristics are established through the analysis of the experimental results. In particular, it is found that the velocity and concentration axes begin to diverge at the impingement point due to the differences in boundary conditions at the bottom surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesalination 3afluorescence 3amine spoil 3amixing1 aLaw, Adrian Wing-Keung0 tJournal of hydro-environment research.g2011 Mar., v. 5, no. 1 p.15-24dElsevier B.V.x1570-64437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jher.2010.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000008004100012016002200053024003200075040001800107100002200125245009700147300001600244520107600260592002801336650002201364650001601386650001201402650003101414650001101445650002301456650001501479650001801494650001301512650001501525650002501540650002301565650001401588700002301602700001901625700002001644700001901664700001701683700002201700700002501722700002201747773008701769856004501856852000901901655001201910IND44791440120815e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447914402DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2011001662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCáceres, Marleny10aPhysico‐chemical characterization of starches extracted from potatoes of the group Phureja  ap. 621-630.  aStarch was extracted from twenty‐four accessions of Group Phureja cultivated diploid potatoes, and from two commercial potato (Solanum tuberosum) varieties. Extracted starch samples were characterized and compared to industrial potato starch. Starch from Phureja generally exhibited smaller granule sizes and lower phosphorus content than starch from commercial potatoes. Amylose content and thermal properties (gelatinization temperature and enthalpy) were however in the same range for both groups. Starches from Phureja displayed very distinct pasting behavior from that of commercial potato. The former exhibited lower initial pasting viscosity but higher shear resistance. This may be related to lower starch granule size, causing lower swelling power and solubility. Iodine complexation results seem to indicate that phureja potatoes have higher proportion of amylopectin long chains. Phureja thus appears to be a promising new source of starch with specific physico‐chemical and functional properties intermediate between industrial potato and cereal starches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3agelatinization temperature 3aiodine 3apasting properties 3aphosphorus 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3asolubility 3aswelling (materials) 3athermal properties 3aviscosity1 aMestres, Christian1 aPons, Brigitte1 aGibert, Olivier1 aAmoros, Walter1 aSalas, Elisa1 aDufour, Dominique1 aBonierbale, Merideth1 aPallet, Dominique0 tStärke =.g2012 Aug., v. 64, no. 8 p.621-630dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201100166  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010100166506011700267506007600384520162200460592002802082506003702110650002002147650001102167650001902178650001002197650001002207650002102217650002002238650000902258650002002267650002002287650001302307650000902320650000902329653001902338653001902357653000902376653001702385700002202402700002402424700002102448700001802469773010002487856005102587852000902638655001202647IND60793708920221207053951.0220920e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079370892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.animal.2022.1006222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandel, Roi10aDairy vs beef production – expert views on welfare of cattle in common food production systems  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConsumers’ views and concerns about the welfare of farm animals may play an important role in their decision to consume dairy, meat and/or plants as their primary protein source. As animals are killed prematurely in both dairy and beef industries, it is important to quantify and compare welfare compromises in these two sectors before the point of death. Seventy world-leading bovine welfare experts based in 23 countries were asked to evaluate the likelihood of a bovine to experience 12 states of potential welfare concern, inspired by the Welfare Quality® protocol. The evaluation focused on the most common beef and dairy production systems in the experts’ country and was carried out separately for dairy/beef calves raised for red meat, dairy/beef calves raised for veal, dairy/beef calves raised as a replacement, and for dairy/beef cows. The results show experts rated the overall likelihood of a negative welfare state (i.e. welfare risk) to be higher in animals from dairy herds than from beef herds, for all animal categories, regardless of whether they were used to produce milk, red meat or veal. These findings suggest that consuming food products derived from common dairy production systems (dairy or meat) may be more harmful to the welfare of animals than consuming products derived from common beef production systems (i.e. from animals solely raised for their meat). Raising awareness about the linkage between dairy and meat production, and the toll of milk production on the welfare state of animals in the dairy industry, may encourage a more sustainable and responsible food consumption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeef production 3acattle 3adairy industry 3adeath 3afarms 3afood consumption 3afood production 3amilk 3amilk production 3aprotein sources 3ared meat 3arisk 3aveal 0aAnimal welfare 0aExpert opinion 0aMeat 0aWelfare risk1 aBracke, Marc B.M.1 aNicol, Christine J.1 aWebster, John A.1 aGygax, Lorenz0 tAnimal.g2022 Sept., v. 16, no. 9 p.100622-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl3938811x1751-73117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.animal.2022.100622  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008700168300001400255520086200269592002801131650002301159650000901182650001301191650000901204650001901213650001201232650000701244650002101251650001301272650001301285650002001298650001101318650001201329653002501341653001101366653001701377653001301394653001201407700002101419700001701440773009301457856008301550852000901633655001201642IND60559967320221119064836.0190417e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055996732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbio.2016.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Yuka10aGelation properties of tilapia fish protein isolate and surimi pre- and post-rigor  ap. 17-23.  aThe structural changes and rheological properties of tilapia proteins prepared using two refining methods (pH shift processing and surimi processing, respectively) with pre- and post-rigor muscle were investigated.

The effect of salt on the gelation of tilapia muscle with different rigor states or refining method was also determined. The addition of salt appeared to readily unfold protein structures in FPI as measured by surface hydrophobicity, surface reactive sulfhydryl content, dynamic rheology, and Raman spectroscopy.

A decrease in the phycocyanine/chlorophyll and no significant change in the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio were observed in salt‐adapted cells. Salt stress inhibited the apparent quantum efficiency of photosynthesis and PSII activity while stimulating PSI activity and dark respiration significantly. Salt stress also resulted in a decrease in overall activity of the electron transport chain, which could not be restored by diphenylcarbazide, an artificial electron donor to the reaction centres of PSII. Measurements of the polyphasic fluorescence rise in fluorescence transients including phases O, J, I and P showed that salt stress had no effect on the fluorescence yield at phase O but decreased the fluorescence yield at phases J, I and P. Analyses of the JIP test developed from the polyphasic rise of fluorescence transients showed that salt stress led to a decrease in both the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry and the maximum quantum efficiency of electron transport beyond the primary quinone electron acceptor. However, salt stress induced no significant changes in the probability of transporting an electron beyond QA, the trapping flux per PSII reaction centre, or the electron transport flux per PSII reaction centre. A theoretical analysis of fluorescence parameters indicated a decrease in the rate constant of excitation energy trapping by PSII reaction centres. In addition, salt stress induced an increase in the complementary area above the fluorescence induction curve in the presence of 3‐(3,4‐dichlorophenyl)‐1,1‐dimethylurea, suggesting an increase in the proportion of closed PSII reaction centres in salt‐adapted cells. Based on these results, it is suggested that modifications in PSII photochemistry in salt‐adapted Spirulina cells maintained a high conversion efficiency of excitation energy, such that no significant change was observed in either the trapping flux or the electron transport flux per PSII reaction centre.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpirulina 3asalinity 3afluorescence 3aelectron transfer 3aphotosystem II 3asodium chloride 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll1 aVonshak, Avigad,0 tnew phytologist.g1999 Feb., v. 141, no. 2 p.231-239dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl44665x0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00340.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02775naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009500161500001900256520146300275592002801738650002201766650001301788650002001801650001101821650001501832650001401847650000901861650001401870650001301884650001601897651001001913653002201923653002401945653001901969653002701988700001502015700001702030700001702047700002002064700001702084773012402101856008302225852000902308655001202317IND60713328120221122220751.0201202e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071332812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1049422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Cong10aOil shale in situ catalytic conversion over clin/SBA-15 composites under subcritical water  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe massive reserves of oil shale in China offer the potential to lessen energy dependence on conventional sources. A novel oil shale in situ upgrading process over mineral-based clin/SBA-15 catalysts has been proposed, and catalytic pyrolysis behavior was intensively studied. Clinoplilolite was chosen for clin/SBA-15 preparation. The apparent activation energy Eₐ of hexadecane cracking on clin/SBA-15(3.0) is 90.37 kJ/mol that is 35 kJ/mol less than that of thermal cracking. DSC curves of n-C16 conversion under 3 MPa N₂ reveals that the cracking peak temperature was declined to 365 °C and 372 °C from 417 °C (thermally) on clin/SBA-15 and kaolin/SBA-15, respectively. The extracted kerogen was converted at 280 °C with a biphasic solvent (water and decalin) to mimic the hydrocarbon generation process, and the products were mainly concentrated in C9, C10 and C11. Oil shale conversion was carried out at 280 °C under subcritical water. Non-catalytic converted products mainly contains hydrocarbons (34.01 %), long-chain fatty acids (esters), alcohol, and ketones. Catalytically produced oil have a strongly aliphatic nature, and the hydrocarbon yield is up to 70.50 % for clin/SBA-15. The clin/SBA-15 played a remarkable role on H/C ratio rising (1.98–2.08) and O/C ratio declining (0.10 to 0.04) because of the catalytic decarboxylation. Clin/SBA-15 showed no activity decay on seven-day oil shale aqueous conversion test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalcohols 3adecarboxylation 3aenergy 3ahexadecane 3aoil shale 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3asolvents 3atemperature 3aChina 0aIn situ upgrading 0aCatalytic pyrolysis 0aClinoptilolite 0aHydrocarbon generation1 aQi, Zhilei1 aGuo, Yuehong1 aBian, Junjie1 aMeng, Xianglong1 aLong, Qiulan0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2020 Nov., v. 152 p.104942-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2020.1049423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015200168300001800320520107000338592002801408650001701436650002301453650002301476650001101499650001901510650001701529650001701546650001401563653002501577653003001602653002301632653001701655653003501672653002801707773008101735856008101816852000901897655001201906IND60551569220221120192043.0161102e20161013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.08.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezvanian, Atieh13aAn expedient synthesis strategy to the 1,4-dihydropyridines and pyrido[1,2-a]quinoxalines: iodine catalyzed one-pot four-component domino reactions  ap. 6428-6435.  aAnother aspect concerning enaminone chemistry leading to the one-pot synthesis of functionalized novel 1,4-dihydropyridines and pyrido[1,2-a]quinoxalines has been described. By highly efficient, one-pot, iodine-catalyzed four-component reactions, combining one set of enamine intermediates and arylidene pyruvic acid (APA) in two procedures, heterocyclic skeletal diversity can be achieved. The synthesis involves reaction of the intermediates formed by the 1:1 interaction between primary amines (or o-phenylenediamine) and dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate with pyruvic acid and benzaldehyde through an iodine-catalyzed Knoevenagel/Michael/cyclization sequence. The reaction is particularly attractive due to the following advantages: atom economy, optimum convergence, high bond-forming efficiency, and avoidance of tedious workup and purification of products. Significantly, the presence of an acidic group at the 9-position on the products make these compounds excellent precursors for further synthetic modifications to meet the need for diverse chemical inputs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzaldehyde 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aiodine 3aprimary amines 3apyruvic acid 3aquinoxalines 3asynthesis 0a1,4-Dihydropyridines 0aPyrido[1,2-a]quinoxalines 0ao-Phenylenediamine 0aPyruvic acid 0aDialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate 0aFour-component reaction0 tTetrahedron.g2016 Oct. 13, v. 72 p.6428-6435dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2016.08.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008500164300001600249500002000265520128400285592002801569650001701597650002201614650002201636650001601658650001401674650001601688650001901704650002001723650000901743650002101752650000901773650001401782650001201796650000901808650001101817650002301828650001401851650001101865650001001876650001401886650001001900650001901910650001601929651001801945700002201963700002201985700002402007700002902031773013302060856007402193852000902267655001202276IND60587242620221118034354.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058724262DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.123282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKembenya, Elijah M.10aCaptive Breeding of Threatened African Carp, Labeo victorianus, of Lake Victoria  ap. 955-962.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAfrican carp, Labeo victorianus, is one of the threatened endemic fishes of Lake Victoria which requires conservation and has potential for aquaculture. We conducted a series of experiments on L. victorianus aiming at producing juveniles for both human consumption and stock enhancement. A total of 79 broodstock (mean body weight = 227.06 g) were collected from the wild; packed at 200, 300, and 500 g/L; and transported by road for 7 h. All fish survived during transportation whereas dissolved oxygen decreased and total ammonia nitrogen increased significantly after transport. Females produced 46,702–86,712 eggs (mean = 68,189 ± 2397) and fecundity was highly correlated with the fish body size (R² = 0.96). Only males re‐spawned in captivity while females did not. At 28 C, females spawned 11–12 h after pairing with males. Larvae can either be fed with formulated diet or natural zooplankton. Juveniles (mean length = 36.7 mm; mean body weight = 0.46 g) can be packed as high as 60 fish/L and transported by road for 12 h with low mortality (2.7–10.3%). These results show that captive breeding of L. victorianus can be a good strategy to produce juveniles to boost wild population as well as a source of seeds for culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabeo coubie 3aLabeo victorianus 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquaculture 3abody size 3abody weight 3abreeding stock 3acaptive animals 3adiet 3adissolved oxygen 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3afish 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amales 3amortality 3aseeds 3atransportation 3azooplankton 3aLake Victoria1 aMarcial, Helen S.1 aOuta, Nicholas O.1 aSakakura, Yoshitaka1 aHagiwara, A.q(Atsushi),0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 Dec., v. 48, no. 6 p.955-962dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.123283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01830naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002100168245006900189300001600258500001500274520067100289592002800960650002500988650001301013650001201026650002601038650002501064650002701089650001301116650001401129653001201143700002101155700002501176700002001201700002201221773009501243856008501338852000901423655001201432IND4449773420221120170304.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444977342DNAL7 a211771372pmid7 a10.1016/j.tplants.2010.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranzke, Andreas10aCabbage family affairs: the evolutionary history of Brassicaceae  ap. 108-116.  a2019-12-06  aLife without the mustard family (Brassicaceae) would be a world without many crop species and the model organism Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that has revolutionized our knowledge in almost every field of modern plant biology.

Due to their particular susceptibility to WNV infection, horses serve as a sentinel species. In a population of Romanian semi-feral horses living in the Danube delta region, we have analyzed the distribution of candidate polymorphic genetic markers between anti WNV-IgG seropositive and seronegative horses. Thirty-six SNPs located in 28 immunity-related genes and 26 microsatellites located in the MHC and LY49 complex genomic regions were genotyped in 57 seropositive and 32 seronegative horses. The most significant association (pcₒᵣᵣ < 0.0002) was found for genotypes composed of markers of the SLC11A1 and TLR4 genes. Markers of five other candidate genes (ADAM17, CXCR3, IL12A, MAVS, TNFA), along with 5 MHC class I and LY49-linked microsatellites were also associated with the WNV antibody status in this model horse population. The OAS1 gene, previously associated with WNV-induced clinical disease, was not associated with the presence of anti-WNV antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data  aCZ.1.05/1.1.00/02cCentral European Institute of Technology  aNPU LQ1601cMinisterstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy 3aCXCR3 receptor 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aWest Nile virus 3aantibodies 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3ameningoencephalitis 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3ariver deltas 3aseroprevalence 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aRomania1 aJanova, E.1 aHorecky, C.1 aHorecka, E.1 aVaclavek, P.1 aHubalek, Z.1 aRelling, K.1 aCvanova, M.1 aD’Amico, G.1 aMihalca, A.

Consequently, abundant heteroxylans have been somewhat neglected in current biomass-to-fuel concepts. The “glucocentric” approach to biorefining means that extraction technologies are sub-optimal and non-specific with regard to pentose sugars, the development of hemicellulases as biorefining enzymes has been slow and pentose-specific conversion technologies for the production of value-added products are relatively scarce. Nevertheless, xylan-related biocatalysis has continued to make steady progress in many areas, including the discovery and characterization of a wide range of hemicellulases, which are important enzymes for biomass hydrolysis. Similarly, the development of high-performance ethanol producing yeast has focused for many years on the recruitment of pentose isomerases or, alternatively, pentose reductases and pentitol dehydrogenases. However, similar efforts are being made to develop microorganisms for alternative bioconversion processes that are widening the range of chemicals that can be derived from pentoses. Finally, progress is also being made in the area of glycosynthesis, which is opening new prospects for the use of pentose sugars as building blocks for engineered pentosides, which will have quite different applications, such as non-ionic surfactants or prebiotic food/feed ingredients. This review provides an overview of these different development areas and discusses future prospects for discovery and impact on biorefining.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysis 3abiocatalysts 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3acellulose 3aethanol 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3aisomerases 3anonionic surfactants 3apentoses 3aprebiotics 3avalue-added products 3ayeasts1 aSong, Letian1 aBozonnet, Sophie1 aFauré, Régis1 aO’Donohue, Michael J.0 tProcess biochemistry.g2012 Mar., v. 47, no. 3 p.346-357dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02218naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014100176300001600317520097900333592002801312650001701340650002001357650002601377650001501403650001901418650001501437650002301452650002001475653002301495653002101518653001101539653002601550700005901576773011501635856008501750852000901835655001201844IND60634847020221120212131.0190326e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063484702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontginoul, Marielle10aSmart metering: A water-saving solution?

However, households are not taking advantage of this technology in spite of the benefits it theoretically offers. This article investigates factors that may explain this technology low adoption rate, focusing on the first two steps in the process of adoption: providing information and fostering good intentions. It describes a natural field experiment conducted in a residential suburb in which 261 households were officially informed about the new smart metering service and 77 of them were then surveyed to identify potential barriers to the adoption of smart meters. We analyse the prevailing social representations of the words “water” and “smart metering”. Although respondents seem more interested in, than opposed to, this new technology, its adoption rate remains low, particularly among heavy water consumers and flat renters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adeuterium oxide 3afield experimentation 3ahouseholds 3asuburban areas 3atechnology 3awater conservation 3awater utilities 0aSmart water meters 0aHousehold survey 0aFrance 0aSocial representation1 aVestier, Arnaud1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6570-59740 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2018 June, v. 104 p.188-198dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245010800171300001800279520134500297592002801642650002101670650001301691650001201704650002101716650001001737650001601747650001101763650002001774650003001794650002201824650001401846650001401860700001901874700002401893773010201917856008502019852000902104655001202113IND60563581920221118155106.0170301e20170228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056358192DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.6b011112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChairatana, Phoom10aHuman α-Defensin 6 Self-Assembly Prevents Adhesion and Suppresses Virulence Traits of Candida albicans  ap. 1033-1041.  aHuman α-defensin 6 (HD6) is a host-defense peptide that contributes to intestinal innate immunity and mediates homeostasis at mucosal surfaces by forming noncovalent oligomers that capture bacteria and prevent bacterial invasion of the epithelium. This work illustrates a new role of HD6 in defending the host epithelium against pathogenic microorganisms. We report that HD6 blocks adhesion of Candida albicans to human intestinal epithelial cells and suppresses two C. albicans virulence traits, namely, invasion of human epithelial cells and biofilm formation. Moreover, a comparison of HD6 and a single-point variant F2A that does not form higher-order oligomers demonstrates that the self-assembly properties of HD6 are essential for functional activity against C. albicans. This opportunistic fungal pathogen, which resides in the intestine as a member of the gut microbiota in healthy individuals, can turn virulent and cause a variety of diseases ranging from superficial infections to life-threatening systemic infections. Our results indicate that HD6 may allow C. albicans to persist as a harmless commensal in the gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, HD6 and HD6-inspired molecules may provide a foundation for exploring new antimicrobial strategies that attenuate the virulence traits of C. albicans and other microbial pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aepithelial cells 3afungi 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal mucosa 3apathogens 3avirulence1 aChiang, I-Ling1 aNolan, Elizabeth M.0 tBiochemistry.g2017 Feb. 28, v. 56, no. 8 p.1033-1041dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.6b011113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01686naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245007500173300001600248520035400264592002800618650002200646650002900668650001100697650001200708650001500720650002400735650001900759650001100778650001000789700001700799700002000816700002200836700001800858700001900876700001900895700002500914700002100939700001700960700002000977700002200997773011501019856008501134852000901219655001201228IND60564786420221120113912.0190416e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056478642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Connell, Sarah10aSplenic dysfunction from celiac disease resulting in severe babesiosis  ap. 537-539.  aWe describe a 79-year-old Irish man who, because he had hyposplenism and splenic atrophy due to adult celiac disease, became critically ill from a severe Babesia divergens infection.

The hybrids selected for this study were Eucalyptus grandisÃE. urophylla (IP), E. urophyllaÃE. urophylla (U1ÃU2), E. grandisÃ[E. urophyllaÃE. globulus] (G1ÃUGL), and [E. dunniiÃE. grandis]ÃE. urophylla (DGÃU2). The analyses of the lipophilic extractives indicated a similar composition in all eucalypt hybrids, which were dominated by sitosterol, sitosterol esters and sitosteryl 3Î²-d-glucopyranoside. These compounds are responsible for pitch deposition during kraft pulping of eucalypt wood. Some quantitative differences were found in the abundances of different lipid classes, the wood from U1ÃU2 having the lowest amounts of these pitch-forming compounds. The chemical composition and structure of lignins were characterized by Py-GC/MS and 2D-NMR that confirmed the predominance of syringyl over guaiacyl units and only showed traces of p-hydroxyphenyl units in all the woods, with the highest S/G ratio for G1ÃUGL. The 2D-NMR spectra gave additional information about the inter-unit linkages in the lignin polymer. All the lignins showed a predominance of Î²-O-4â² ether linkages (75â79% of total side-chains), followed by Î²âÎ²â² resinol-type linkages (9â11%) and lower amounts of Î²-5â² phenylcoumaran-type, Î²-1â² spirodienone-type linkages or Î²-1â² open substructures. The lignin from the hybrid G1ÃUGL presented also the highest proportion of Î²-O-4â² linkages, and therefore, it is foreseen that the wood from this hybrid will be more easily delignifiable than the other selected Brazilian eucalypt hybrids. In complement to these chemical analyses, the morphological characterization of fibers, vessels and fines revealed that hybrid eucalypt clone DGÃU2 presented the most interesting properties for the manufacture of paper pulps and biofuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3achemical analysis 3achemical structure 3aclones 3aesters 3aethers 3ahybrids 3akraft pulping 3alignin 3apaper pulp 3apapermaking 3apulpwood1 aGutiÃ©rrez, Ana1 aRencoret, Jorge1 aNieto, Lidia1 aJimÃ©nez-Barbero, JesÃºs1 aBurnet, AuphÃ©lia1 aPetit-Conil, Michel1 aColodette, Jorge L.1 aMartÃ­nez, Ãngel T.1 adel RÃ­o, JosÃ© C.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2012 Mar., v. 36, no. 1 p.572-583dElsevier B.V.x0926-66907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2011.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02051naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245006600165300001800231500001900249500002000268520106200288592002801350650002001378650002301398650001801421650001101439700003201450700006001482773011201542856007401654852000901728655001201737IND60720316720221119220301.0201212e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072031672DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.132342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Luz Adriana12aA Bayesian nonparametric testing procedure for paired samples  ap. 1133-1146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe propose a Bayesian hypothesis testing procedure for comparing the distributions of paired samples. The procedure is based on a flexible model for the joint distribution of both samples. The flexibility is given by a mixture of Dirichlet processes. Our proposal uses a spike‐slab prior specification for the base measure of the Dirichlet process and a particular parametrization for the kernel of the mixture in order to facilitate comparisons and posterior inference. The joint model allows us to derive the marginal distributions and test whether they differ or not. The procedure exploits the correlation between samples, relaxes the parametric assumptions, and detects possible differences throughout the entire distributions. A Monte Carlo simulation study comparing the performance of this strategy to other traditional alternatives is provided. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to spirometry data collected in the United States to investigate changes in pulmonary function in children and adolescents in response to air polluting factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMonte Carlo method 3alung function 3amodels1 aTaylor‐Rodríguez, Daniel1 aGutierrez, Luis,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6340-56360 tBiometrics.g2020 Dec., v. 76, no. 4 p.1133-1146dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16956x0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.132343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245008800171520156400259592002801823650001601851650001501867650002201882650001301904650001801917650001701935650001601952650001701968650001401985650001901999650001902018650001302037650001902050650001302069650000902082650002102091650001702112650001602129650002002145653001502165653001302180653003202193653001302225700001602238700001402254700001702268700001302285700001702298700001602315773010602331856008702437852000902524655001202533IND60779849320221118041937.0220824e20221020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077984932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhonghua10aPhotothermal responsive hydrogel for adsorbing heavy metal ions in aqueous solution  aA solar-driven hydrogel composed of photothermal polydopamine (PDA) nanocoating, linear chitosan (CTS), and thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) crosslinking network was successfully synthesized to remove heavy metal ions from contaminated water. The as-prepared PDA/CTS/PNIPAM (DCN) hydrogel can achieve hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transition driven by solar energy when the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) was reached. The micromorphology, wetting behavior, swelling behavior, compression properties, photothermal responsiveness, and adsorption properties of hydrogels were studied one by one. The cross-linking of the controllable active nanogel (ANG) along with the modification of PDA endowed DCN hydrogel with a regular and interpenetrating porous structure, which enabled DCN to have excellent elasticity and withstand up to 80 % compressive deformation. And the hydrophilic groups of CTS and PDA reduced the water contact angle of DCN hydrogel to 13°, which was conducive to resisting the erosion of oil substances. The excellent photothermal conversion enabled DCN hydrogel to reach VPTT in only about 11 min under a simulated sunlight source. In addition, DCN hydrogel had excellent selective adsorption for Pb²⁺ and Cu²⁺, and the maximum theoretical adsorption capacities were 42.63 mg/g and 38.55 mg/g, respectively. It was also found that the volume phase transformation of hydrogel significantly enhanced its ability to resist external interference and effectively prevented the loss of heavy metal ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achitosan 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3alighting 3amicrostructure 3ananogels 3aoils 3aphase transition 3asolar energy 3atemperature 3awater pollution 0aAdsorption 0aChitosan 0aPhotothermal responsiveness 0aHydrogel1 aZhang, Zhao1 aZhu, Zhan1 aZou, Xinquan1 aZhao, Yu1 aShi, Jinshuo1 aWang, Jikui0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Oct. 20, v. 651 p.129425-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03176naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012800156300001800284500002000302520180000322592002802122596005702150650001502207650001202222650002202234650001402256650002202270650002402292650001302316650000902329650001802338650001402356650002102370650002102391650001202412650001402424650001702438650002402455700001802479700002002497773011702517856007502634852000902709655001202718IND60636453020221119173257.0190520e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063645302DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.147132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, JeeEun10aCrystal structure of Kumaglobin: a hexacoordinated heme protein from an anhydrobiotic tardigrade, Ramazzottius varieornatus  ap. 1287-1304.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTardigrades, also known as water bears, can survive extreme conditions. For example, tardigrades have high tolerance to extreme desiccation because they can enter an anhydrobiotic state, in which they show no or nearly undetectable metabolic processes. Proteins from anhydrobiotic tardigrades with low homology to known proteins from other organisms are new potential targets for structural genomics. Here, we present spectroscopic and structural characterization of an unprecedented globin protein (Kumaglobin: Kgb) found in an anhydrobiotic tardigrade. Spectroscopy reveals that Kgb contains hexacoordinated low‐spin heme, which is not capable of binding to hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) unlike other globin proteins, such as neuroglobin. Interestingly however, when distal histidine is replaced with alanine, H₂S is capable of binding to heme, implying that the distal histidine of Kgb binds tightly to heme. The overall structure of Kgb at 1.5 Å resolution shows high resemblance to well‐characterized eukaryotic globin proteins, such as myoglobin and cytoglobin. However, the heme coordination geometry in Kgb is unique because the distal histidinyl ligand is located at the 11th position of helix E while it is found at 7th position on helix E in many known globin proteins. The unusual conformation of distal histidine in Kgb is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl O atom of A103. Furthermore, bulky residues exist around the heme cofactor, resulting in a ruffling conformation of the porphyrin ring. Based on our study, Kgb is thought to be involved in electron transfer or enzymatic reactions rather than transporting or storing ligands.

Many studies, however, aggregate the population, activities, or concentration levels of the pollutant across space and/or time, failing to capture critical variations in the exposure levels. We couple spatiotemporal air quality estimates of ozone with a synthetic information model of the Houston Metropolitan Area, allowing us to attach exposure levels to individuals based on exact times, geo-locations, and microenvironments of activities. Several scenarios of the model are run at different levels of resolution. When we maintain the spatiotemporal resolution of the data, the proportion of the population that experiences sharp increases in short-term exposure increases substantially. This can be particularly important if experienced by sensitive populations given the increased risk for adverse health effects. We find that individuals in the same zip code, neighborhood, and even household have varying levels of exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3aadverse effects 3aair quality 3ametropolitan areas 3amodels 3aozone 3apollutants 3arisk 0aSynthetic populations 0aAir quality 0aOzone 0aMicroenvironment 0aPersonal exposure1 aKorkmaz, Gizem1 aEnsor, Katherine1 aHigdon, David1 aKeller, Sallie1 aLewis, Bryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0793-60821 aSchroeder, Aaron0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2018 May, v. 103 p.146-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014400163300001600307520125400323592002801577596003201605596005301637650003801690650001601728650001601744650001601760650002301776650001201799650002101811650002701832650004401859650001801903650001501921650001901936650001201955650001801967650002401985650001602009650002302025700001702048700001702065700001602082700001802098700005402116773013002170856008102300852000902381655001202390IND60627501320221120151027.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062750132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-018-1334-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEtxaniz, I.10aDispersion Characteristics and Curing Behaviour of Waterborne UV Crosslinkable Polyurethanes Based on Renewable Dimer Fatty Acid Polyesters  ap. 189-197.  aIn the last few years there has been a great deal of interest in modifying the methodologies for obtaining polyurethanes using more sustainable strategies. Following this tendency, in the present work, waterborne UV-curable polyurethanes were synthesized using commercially available dimer fatty acid based polyols obtained from renewable resources (Priplast from Croda). The polyols, characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H NMR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and size exclusion chromatography (GPC–SEC), were semicrystalline and presented very broad melting related with their complex molecular weight distribution. Different polyurethane dispersions were obtained by changing the percentage of the hard segment. Comparing with waterborne polyurethane dispersions obtained from non-renewable resources, the dispersions showed higher particle size even using similar or higher amounts of internal emulsifier. The curing behaviour was characterized by photo-differential scanning calorimetry (Photo-DSC) and the results showed that the conversion and polymerization rate decreased with the hard segment content and temperature. The obtained products displayed good thermal characteristics with phase-separated structures.  aPublisher supplied data  aIT618-13cEusko Jaurlaritza  aUFI 11/56, SGIkercEuskal Herriko Unibertsitatea 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adispersions 3aemulsifiers 3afatty acids 3agel chromatography 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3anonrenewable resources 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aparticle size 3apolyesters 3apolymerization 3apolyols 3apolyurethanes 3arenewable resources 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aLlorente, O.1 aAizpurua, J.1 aMartín, L.1 aGonzález, A.1 aIrusta, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2079-80160 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2019 Jan., v. 27, no. 1 p.189-197dSpringer USwJournal:jnl3870065x1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-018-1334-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01374naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011300166300001800279520047800297592002800775650001700803650000700820650000900827650001700836650001300853700002200866700001800888773010900906856004801015852000901063655001201072IND4515834620221120210208.0151006e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451583462DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348110901882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerdizade, N.

Their substrate promiscuity, high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity are prerequisites for the use in synthetic chemistry and should pave the way for successful industrial processes. Nonetheless, only a very limited number of industrial relevant transformations are known, mainly due to the lack of BVMOs stability and cofactor dependency. In this review, we focus on novel BVMO-mediated transformations, BVMOs in cascade type reactions, potential industrial applications, and how limitations have been tackled by the community. Special attention will be put on whole-cell immobilization strategies. We emphasize to bridge recent developments in fundamental research to industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenantiomers 3aenzymes 3aindustrial applications1 aGemeiner, Peter1 aSchenkmayerová, Andrea1 aKrajčovič, Tomáš1 aRudroff, Florian1 aMihovilovič, MarkoD.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 100, no. 15 p.6585-6599dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-016-7670-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011900166300001600285520131600301592002801617650002501645650001201670650001901682650001001701650001101711650001601722650001201738650001301750650002501763650001501788650001401803650002601817650002301843650001101866650001601877653003201893653002301925653001901948653001501967653002601982700006702008700002802075700002602103700001702129700002102146773013302167856008502300852000902385655001202394IND60564786820221120113936.0190416e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056478682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2017.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDroce, Aida10aPTR2 peptide transporters in Fusarium graminearum influence secondary metabolite production and sexual development  ap. 515-527.  aPutative proton coupled di-peptide transporters, PTR2s, are found in filamentous fungi in different numbers and their function during fungal development and plant infection is unresolved. In Fusarium graminearum, the cause of head blight in cereals, we identified four putative PTR2 transporters (FgPTR2A-D). The genes did not cluster together in phylogenetic analyses and only FgPTR2A and FgPTR2C were able to complement a PTR2 deficient yeast mutant in uptake of di-peptides. All FgPTR2s are continuously expressed throughout the fungal lifecycle, although at different levels. In silico analyses of existing expression-data show that FgPTR2B is found at higher levels than the others in planta and during sexual development. Deletion mutants of FgPTR2A, FgPTR2C, and FgPTR2D had a higher production of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone and lower production of fusarielin H than the wild type. Perithecium development was reduced in these mutants but unaffected by deletion of FgPTR2B. Conidia production was reduced in the FgPTR2B mutant and unaffected by deletion of the other PTR2 transporters. Sexual development and secondary metabolite production are known to be linked at the regulatory level and the results suggest that PTR2s are active in nitrogen turnover and thereby influence signal processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium graminearum 3aconidia 3adeoxynivalenol 3agenes 3agrains 3ahead blight 3amutants 3anitrogen 3apeptide transporters 3aperithecia 3aphylogeny 3asecondary metabolites 3asexual development 3ayeasts 3azearalenone 0aDi/tri peptide transporters 0aFungal development 0aPeptide uptake 0aRegulation 0aSecondary metabolites1 aSørensen, Jens Laurids1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2392-53431 aSondergaard, Teis Esben1 aRasmussen, Janus Jagd1 aLysøe, Erik1 aGiese, Henriette0 tFungal biology.g2017 May, v. 121, no. 5 p.515-527dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2017.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02368naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245005300194300001800247500001500265500002000280520128600300592002801586650002401614650001801638650003001656650002901686650002201715700005701737700005301794773011201847856007401959852000902033655001202042IND60720317220221119220235.0201212e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072031722DNAL7 a10.1111/biom.132332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Moming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9843-836310aOn symmetric semiparametric two‐sample problem  ap. 1216-1228.  agolden set  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe consider a two‐sample problem where data come from symmetric distributions. Usual two‐sample data with only magnitudes recorded, arising from case‐control studies or logistic discriminant analyses, may constitute a symmetric two‐sample problem. We propose a semiparametric model such that, in addition to symmetry, the log ratio of two unknown density functions is modeled in a known parametric form. The new semiparametric model, tailor‐made for symmetric two‐sample data, can also be viewed as a biased sampling model subject to symmetric constraint. A maximum empirical likelihood estimation approach is adopted to estimate the unknown model parameters, and the corresponding profile empirical likelihood ratio test is utilized to perform hypothesis testing regarding the two population distributions. Symmetry, however, comes with irregularity. It is shown that, under the null hypothesis of equal symmetric distributions, the maximum empirical likelihood estimator has degenerate Fisher information, and the test statistic has a mixture of χ²‐type asymptotic distribution. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to demonstrate promising statistical powers under correct and misspecified models. We apply the proposed methods to two real examples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3adata analysis 3adensity functional theory 3aprobability distribution 3asimulation models1 aDiao, Guoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7304-95911 aQin, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2817-63260 tBiometrics.g2020 Dec., v. 76, no. 4 p.1216-1228dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16956x0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/biom.132333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245015500181300001600336520143600352592002801788650001401816650001201830650001901842650001101861650001101872653002201883653004101905653002501946653003501971653002102006700002102027700002102048700002302069773009902092856008702191852000902278655001202287IND60598461420221123022542.0190725e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059846142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJannesar, Mohammad Rasol10aOptimal placement, sizing, and daily charge/discharge of battery energy storage in low voltage distribution network with high photovoltaic penetration  ap. 957-966.  aProper installation of rooftop photovoltaic generation in distribution networks can improve voltage profile, reduce energy losses, and enhance the reliability. But, on the other hand, some problems regarding harmonic distortion, voltage magnitude, reverse power flow, and energy losses can arise when photovoltaic penetration is increased in low voltage distribution network. Local battery energy storage system can mitigate these disadvantages and as a result, improve the system operation. For this purpose, battery energy storage system is charged when production of photovoltaic is more than consumers’ demands and discharged when consumers’ demands are increased. Since the price of battery energy storage system is high, economic, environmental, and technical objectives should be considered together for its placement and sizing. In this paper, optimal placement, sizing, and daily (24 h) charge/discharge of battery energy storage system are performed based on a cost function that includes energy arbitrage, environmental emission, energy losses, transmission access fee, as well as capital and maintenance costs of battery energy storage system. All simulations are carried out in DIgSILENT and MATLAB linked together. Results show that by using the proposed approach, overvoltage and energy losses are decreased, reverse power flow is prevented, environmental emission is reduced, and economic profit is maximized.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acapital 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aprices 0aPhotovoltaic (PV) 0aBattery energy storage system (BESS) 0aDistribution network 0aOptimal planning and operation 0aHigh penetration1 aSedighi, Alireza1 aSavaghebi, Mehdi1 aGuerrero, Josep M.0 tApplied energy.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 226 p.957-966dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.06.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001400149245008600163300001600249520147200265592002801737650002501765650001201790650002401802650001001826650003001836650001301866650001301879650001601892650001301908650001701921650003801938700001701976700001401993700001302007700001802020773010302038856008502141852000902226655001202235IND4486575920221120202021.0150810e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448657592DNAL7 a10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60067-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ying,10aTransient Expression of Exogenous Gene into Plant Cell Mediated by PEI Nanovector  ap. 820-826.  aThis study was carried out to investigate the transfection effect of exogenous gene into plant protoplast cell mediated by polyethylenimine (PEI) nanovector, based on PEI gene delivery system in the field of medical science. PEI/DNA complexes were prepared by using PEI polymer to bind the plant expression plasmid, pCMl205-GFPn. The ability of PEI combining and protecting DNA was investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis retardation assay. The surface characteristics of PEI/DNA complexes were observed with transmission electron microscope. The transfection efficiency of Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts mediated by PEI/DNA complexes at different N/P ratios was analyzed based on observation of transient expression of green fluorescent protein with confocal laser scanning microscope. PEI could bind and condense DNA, and form stable 100â200 nm PEI/DNA complexes when the proportion of PEl and DNA is in the range of 5:1-1:4. Transfection efficiency of PEI/DNA complexes increased with N/P ratios in range of N/P<5 and reached the highest at N/P=5, and began to decrease beyond N/P>5 as higher toxicity to cells. The transfection efficiency of PEI/DNA complexes at N/P=5 was higher than PEG. This study confirmed that PEI nanovector could effectively mediate foreign gene entering into A. thaliana protoplast cell to obtain transient expression, which may be developed as a hopeful and novel transgenic method combined with plant protoplast regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aagarose 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aplasmids 3apolymers 3aprotoplasts 3atoxicity 3atransfection 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aCUI, Hai-xin1 aSong, Yu,1 aLi, Yao,1 aHUANG, Jin-li0 tAgricultural sciences in China.g2011 June, v. 10, no. 6 p.820-826dElsevier B.V.x1671-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1671-2927(11)60067-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245013000162300001400292520159400306592002801900650002801928650001801956650001601974650001101990650002202001650001502023650001002038650001202048650002702060650000902087650001902096650001502115650002702130653002402157653002302181653001102204653001902215653002402234653002302258653002602281653001402307653002302321653004102344653004302385700001802428700001402446700001302460700001602473700005602489700002002545700001502565700001402580700001802594700001402612773011302626856008302739852000902822655001202831IND60732868620221116203858.0210513e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073286862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejbt.2021.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xian10aBovine TMEM95 gene: Polymorphisms detecting in five Chinese indigenous cattle breeds and their association with growth traits  ap. 58-66.  aTransmembrane protein 95 (TMEM95) plays a role in male fertility. Previous studies showed that genes with a significant impact on reproductive traits can also affect the growth traits of livestock. Thus, we speculated that the genetic variation of TMEM95 gene may have effects on growth traits of cattle.Two SNPs were genotyped. The rs136174626 and rs41904693 were in the intron 4 and 3′-untranslated region, respectively. The linkage disequilibrium analysis illustrated that these two loci were not linked. The rs136174626 was associated with six growth traits of Nanyang cattle, four traits of Luxi cattle, and three traits of Ji’an cattle. For rs41904693 locus, the GG individuals had greater body height and abdominal girth in Ji’ an cattle than TT and TG individuals. In Jinnan cattle, GG and TT individuals had greater body height, height at hip cross, body length, and heart girth than TG individuals. The potential splice site prediction results suggest that the rs136174626 may influence the splicing efficiency of TMEM95, and the miRNA binding site prediction results showed that the rs41904693 may influence the expression of TMEM95 by affecting the binding efficiency of Bta-miR-1584 and TMEM95 3′-UTR.The findings of the study suggested that the two SNPs in TMEM95 could be a reliable basis for molecular breeding in cattle.How to cite: Guo X, Zhang S, Yang H, et al.

To make full use of the potential of this technique, values relating to certain microscopic properties of the material under study must be known, yet the literature contains little information in this respect. Indeed, some of the values required are difficult to obtain experimentally, and there are no standardized procedures in place for their determination. The present work reports the experimental determination of values for several of the microscopic properties – the particle density, modulus of elasticity, particle–wall coefficient of restitution, particle–particle coefficient of restitution, and the particle–wall coefficient of friction – of maize grains and olives, required for use in DEM simulations. To make preliminary evaluation of the assay procedures, glass beads, a better known material, was also used. The apparatuses and experimental protocols employed are explained, the difficulties arising with each described, and the results obtained discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3afoods 3amechanical properties 3amodulus of elasticity 3aolives1 aFuentes, J.M.1 aAyuga-Téllez, E.1 aAyuga, F.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 Aug., v. 111, no. 4 p.553-562dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2012.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245010900210300001600319520102500335592002801360650001701388650001701405650001601422650002201438650001501460650002001475650002001495650001601515651002501531651001301556653002601569653003201595653002601627653002101653653002701674700001701701700006301718700002201781773011501803856008501918852000902003655001202012IND60634848020221122184355.0190326e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063484802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmato, Federico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5886-903810aFuzzy definition of Rural Urban Interface: An application based on land use change scenarios in Portugal  ap. 171-187.  aLand cover dynamics influence the spatio-temporal evolution of the Rural-Urban Interface (RUI). This represents the most prone area for human-caused forest fires ignitions in Mediterranean countries. Traditionally, RUI mapping is based on the measurement of the distances among specific land covers. This methodology suffers from the definition of pre-established fixed parameters. To avoid this arbitrariness, a new procedure based on Multilayer Perceptron and Fuzzy Set Theory is introduced in this paper. This allows to develop continuous non-categorical maps expressing the possibility of being part of this interface. Thus, an innovative way for assessing the uncertainty in identifying RUI is presented. The proposed methodology has been applied to the case study of Portugal, elaborating a future scenario for the RUI. The results show how the framework proposed in this paper is able to correctly identify the areas belonging to this interface, providing useful information for forest fires -prevention policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aforest fires 3afuzzy logic 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aland use change 3aneural networks 3auncertainty 3aMediterranean region 3aPortugal 0aRural-urban interface 0aLand use-land cover changes 0aMultilayer perceptron 0aFuzzy set theory 0aUncertainty assessment1 aTonini, Marj1 aMurgante, Beniamino1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2409-59591 aKanevski, Mikhail0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2018 June, v. 104 p.171-187dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012300167300002000290520169500310592002802005650001502033650001902048650001802067650001502085650001002100650002002110650001902130650001402149650000902163650001702172650001602189650001102205650001502216650002502231653001102256653004102267653002402308653001502332653002702347653002602374700001202400700001502412700001302427700005602440700001702496700005602513700001802569773014702587856008502734852000902819655001202828IND60751021320221121063254.0210920e20210907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075102132DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c045732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Binbin10aSuperhydrophobic UHMWPE Foams with High Mechanical Robustness and Durability Fabricated by Supercritical CO₂ Foaming  ap. 12663-12673.  aThe low durability and stability of superhydrophobic foams and high fabrication costs are the main reasons that limit their practical applications in water remediation and oil recycling. Herein, an extremely superhydrophobic and exceptionally robust foam was developed based on ultrahigh-molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) by supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO₂) foaming and subsequent surface modification. The developed foam comprises a highly porous structure decorated with hydrophobic silica nanoparticles and aligned UHMWPE crystallites, constructing a complex micro–nanosized hierarchical morphology, which contributed to an unprecedented water contact angle (WCA) of 162° and a sliding angle of 1°. When used in selective oil absorption and oil/water separation, the foam demonstrated about 100% separation efficiency in repetitive use and even under a vacuum of −70 Kpa due to its high water repellency. More importantly, the foam has outstanding tolerance against mechanical damages such as ultrasonication, bending and twisting, tape peeling, steel wool abrasion, and knife scratching. The surface could maintain the hierarchical structure and a WCA of over 156° after enduring different damages. Moreover, when the surface is clogged, the foam could restore its superhydrophobicity by arbitrary fracturing and cutting, resulting in a theoretically unlimited lifespan. This work not only proposes a UHMWPE-based superhydrophobic foam with extremely high superhydrophobicity, durability, and separation efficiency but also provides insights into the design and mass production of ultraefficient and robust superhydrophobic porous materials for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3acontact angle 3adurability 3afoams 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3alongevity 3aoils 3apolyethylene 3aremediation 3asilica 3asteel wool 3aultrasonic treatment 0aUHMWPE 0asupercritical carbon dioxide foaming 0asuperhydrophobicity 0arobustness 0ahierarchical structure 0aseparation efficiency1 aLi, Jun1 aGuo, Yahao1 aLi, Heng1 aMi, Hao-Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0894-93711 aDong, Binbin1 aLiu, Chuntai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9751-62701 aShen, Changyu0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Sept. 07, v. 9, no. 37 p.12663-12673dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c045733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100004100151245009800192520156000290592002801850650002001878650001501898650001501913650001201928650001601940650001101956650002601967650002201993650001302015650002402028650001702052650002102069650001102090650001902101650001102120651001102131700003502142773012702177856008502304961000902389852000902398655001202407IND60707886220221118035846.0200821e20200724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070788622DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80811162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonteiro Moreira, Geisianny  Augusta10aSoil Yeast Communities in Revegetated Post-Mining and Adjacent Native Areas in Central Brazil  aYeasts represent an important component of the soil microbiome. In central Brazil, mining activities are among the main anthropogenic factors that influence the dynamics of the soil microbiota. Few studies have been dedicated to analysis of tropical soil yeast communities, and even fewer have focused on Brazilian hotspots influenced by mining activity. The aim of the current study was to describe soil yeast communities in a post-mining site with revegetated and native areas, along Neotropical Savanna and Atlantic Forest biomes. Yeast communities were described using a culture-based method and estimator-based species accumulation curves, and their associations with environmental characteristics were assessed using multivariate analysis. The results indicate a greater species richness for yeast communities in the revegetated area. We identified 37 species describing 86% of the estimated richness according to Chao2. Ascomycetous yeasts dominated over basidiomycetous species. Candida maltosa was the most frequent species in two phytocenoses. Red-pigmented yeasts were frequent only in the summer. The main soil attributes affecting yeast communities were texture and micronutrients. In conclusion, each phytocenosis showed a particular assemblage of species as a result of local environmental phenomena. The species richness in a Revegetated area points to a possible ecological role of yeast species in environmental recovery. This study provided the first comprehensive inventory of soil yeasts in major phytocenoses in Minas Gerais, Brazil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida maltosa 3aNeotropics 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ainventories 3amining 3amultivariate analysis 3aplant communities 3asavannas 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil texture 3aspecies richness 3asummer 3atropical soils 3ayeasts 3aBrazil1 aMartins do Vale, Helson  Mario0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 July 24, v. 8, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80811163Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245014900168300001600317520154000333592002801873650002201901650002101923650001801944650004601962650001402008650001602022650001302038650004302051650001302094650001202107650001502119650001502134650001402149650002102163650001402184653000802198653000802206653000702214653000702221653000602228653000802234653001502242653002202257653002002279653001702299653002202316700001902338773012202357856008302479852000902562655001202571IND60564787120221120123626.0210812e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056478712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2017.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jiann-Tsyh10aStructural characteristics of the molecular species of tetraacylglycerols in lesquerella (Physaria fendleri) oil elucidated by mass spectrometry  ap. 167-173.  aTetraacylglycerols (triacylglycerol estolides) contain an acylacyl chain (one fatty acid attached to the hydroxyl group of another fatty acid attached to the glycerol backbone) and have different physical properties from those of triacylglycerols. Tetraacylglycerols can be used in industry such as the viscosity improver and pour point depressant of lubricants. The structures, contents and the ratios of the contents of regioisomers of the molecular species of tetraacylglycerols affect the physical properties of the mixture of tetraacylglycerols. They were elucidated by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the lithium adducts of tetraacylglycerols from the HPLC fractions of lesquerella oil. The ratios of the contents of acyl and acylacyl chains at the sn−2 position of the molecular species of tetraacylglycerols containing one normal FA (LsLsLsA type, Ls is lesquerolic acid. A is normal fatty acid and without hydroxyl group) in lesquerella oil were as: normal FA 58–98%), LsLs 0–35%), Ls 2–19%). For the molecular species of tetraacylglycerols containing two normal FA, 100% of the chains at the sn−2 position were normal FA, and the Ls, LsLs and LsA chains were all at the sn−1,3 positions. Acyl and acylacyl chains at the sn−2 position of the molecular species of tetraacylglycerols in lesquerella oil were predominately normal FA. Tetraacylglycerols are biodegradable and renewable, of low contents in seed oils, and can be produced through biotechnology focusing on triacylglycerol acyltransferase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhysaria fendleri 3abiodegradability 3abiotechnology 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aestolides 3afatty acids 3aglycerol 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aindustry 3alithium 3alubricants 3apour point 3aseed oils 3atriacylglycerols 3aviscosity 0aDAG 0aESI 0aLs 0aMS 0aR 0aTAG 0aStructures 0aTetraacylglycerol 0aLesquerella oil 0aRegioisomers 0aPhysaria fendleri1 aChen, Grace Q.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2017 Apr., v. 10 p.167-173dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2017.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245003300190300001600223520106000239592002801299650001301327650001101340650001501351650000901366650001401375650001401389650001201403650002301415650001101438650002601449650002401475650005901499650001701558650002501575700001701600700002201617700002301639773009801662856008401760990002301844852000901867655001201876IND60092117920221122061941.0141103e20121128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009211792DNAL7 a226344982pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2012.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiarella, Paula10aConcomitant tumor resistance  ap. 133-141.  aConcomitant tumor resistance (CR) is a phenomenon in which a tumor-bearing host is resistant to the growth of secondary tumor implants. This phenomenon has been described in human and animal systems and it can be generated by both immunogenic and non-immunogenic tumors. The relevance of CR to the mechanisms of metastases control has been highlighted by numerous observations showing that the removal of human and murine tumors may be followed by an abrupt increase in metastatic growth, suggesting that a primary tumor may exert a controlling action on its metastases which could be considered as secondary tumor implants developed spontaneously during the primary tumor growth. A more profound understanding of the different mechanisms claimed to be associated with the phenomenon of CR could contribute to develop new and more harmless means to manage malignant diseases, especially by limiting the development of metastases that arise after resection of primary tumors or after other stressors that may promote the escape of metastases from dormancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adormancy 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aresection 2aAnimals 2aCell Proliferation 2aHumans 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aNeoplasm Metastasis 2aNeoplasmsximmunologyxmetabolismxpathologyxsurgery. 2aTumor Burden 2aTyrosinexmetabolism1 aBruzzo, Juan1 aMeiss, Roberto P.1 aRuggiero, Raúl A.0 tCancer letters.g2012 Nov. 28, v. 324, no. 2 p.133-141dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.05.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003300152245017200185520177900357592002802136650001002164650001202174650001102186650000702197650001102204650001502215650001502230650002002245650001602265650001402281650001102295650001602306650001602322653001902338653003002357653004002387653001402427653002402441700002702465700002502492700002902517773010702546856008702653852000902740655001202749IND60779850020221118041632.0220621e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077985002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTowesend, Vinícius de Jesus10aSynergism in binary surfactant mixtures containing a pH-responsive surfactant towards enhanced foam stability in brine at high pressure and high temperature conditions  aThe use of liquid foams in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications requires the formation of stable foams under harsh reservoir conditions, such as a wide pH range, brines containing divalent cations, and high temperature and pressure. In this work, mixtures of the pH-responsive surfactant bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) cocoalkylamine (C12) with nonionic (tallow fatty amine, TFA20), zwitterionic (cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, CAHS) and anionic (sodium olefin sulfonate, AOS) surfactants were evaluated to obtain foams with improved stability under conditions relevant to CO₂-based EOR. The presence of TFA20 in the foaming formulation increased the solubility of C12 at basic pH values, but impaired foam stability. In contrast, the surfactant mixtures containing CAHS exhibited a significant synergy regarding surface tension reduction and foam stabilization. The synergy was confirmed by the negative value of the interaction parameter, indicating strong attraction, likely electrostatic, between the surfactant molecules at the interface. This effect was evidenced in the decrease in the bubble growth rate obtained with the C12:CAHS (1:2) mixture, compared to the individual components, suggesting a reduction in Ostwald ripening and coalescence mechanisms of foam destruction due to higher packing density of surfactants in the interfacial film. The presence of the zwitterionic surfactant in the foaming mixture containing C12 allowed obtaining foams with improved stability at pH 4, under high pressure (100 bar) and high temperature (65 °C) conditions. The results obtained in this study showed the potential of using synergic mixtures to tailor the solubility and foaming properties of pH-responsive surfactants for enhanced performance in foam-based EOR methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoams 3aliquids 3aolefin 3apH 3asodium 3asolubility 3asulfonates 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3asynergism 3atallow 3atemperature 3azwitterions 0aFoam stability 0apH-responsive surfactants 0aBis-(2-hydroxyethyl) cocoalkylamine 0aSynergism 0aSurfactant mixtures1 aCreatto, Eduardo José1 aPedroni, Lucas Gomes1 aPérez-Gramatges, Aurora0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129433-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010500165300002000270520083000290592002801120650001801148650001701166650002001183650001801203650002301221650001201244650001101256653001701267653001701284653001901301653002301320653002401343700001901367700001301386700005301399700005801452700005501510773014701565856008501712852000901797655001201806IND60751021520221122001142.0210920e20210903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075102152DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c051172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Yi-Ke10aImproving the Oxygenation Performance of a Cyanobacterial Lipoxygenase by Oxygen Channel Engineering  ap. 12514-12519.  aLipoxygenase catalyzes the dioxygenation of unsaturated fatty acids, which represents a sustainable pathway for producing bioderived fine chemicals. Herein, structure-guided engineering of the oxygen tunnel of a well-expressed 13-(S)-lipoxygenase from cyanobacteria was performed, resulting in a mutant A324G/S392G which showed 3 to 5-fold increases in activity toward a panel of unsaturated fatty acids. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated the molecular basis for A324 and S392 as activity determining residues in the oxygen tunnel. The practicability of the mutant was demonstrated by the biosynthesis of hydroperoxy fatty acid 13S-HPOD with a high space time yield (STY) of 2.28 kg L–¹ d–¹. Our results also demonstrate a good example for engineering biocatalysts that require gaseous molecules as cosubstrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3abiosynthesis 3agreen chemistry 3alipoxygenases 3amolecular dynamics 3amutants 3aoxygen 0aBiocatalysis 0aLipoxygenase 0aOxygen channel 0aEnzyme engineering 0aHydroxy fatty acids1 aZheng, Yu-Cong1 aChen, Qi1 aHe, Yucai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7905-42171 aZhang, Zhi-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9836-02041 aXu, Jian-He1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0140-38080 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Sept. 03, v. 9, no. 37 p.12514-12519dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c051173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245009400184300001600278520159600294592002801890650001201918650001601930650001501946650001001961650001501971650001401986650000902000650001202009650001402021650000902035650006402044650001602108650001202124650001402136651001002150700002202160700001102182700002002193700001602213700001702229773009502246856004802341852000902389655001202398IND50062604820221120210158.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006260482DNAL7 a233148102pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-012-1007-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Junchang10aChicken-sized oviraptorid dinosaurs from central China and their ontogenetic implications  ap. 165-175.  aOviraptorids are a group of specialized non-avian theropod dinosaurs that were generally one to 8 m in body length. New specimens of baby oviraptorids from the Late Cretaceous of Henan Province are some of the smallest individuals known. They include diagnostic characters such as the relative position of the antorbital fenestra and the external naris, distinct opening in the premaxilla anteroventral to the external naris, antorbital fossa partly bordered by premaxilla posterodorsally, lacrimal process of premaxilla does not contact the anterodorsal process of the lacrimal, parietal almost as long as frontal; in dorsal view, posterior margin forms a straight line between the postzygapophyses in each of the fourth and fifth cervicals; femur longer than ilium. They also elucidate the ontogenetic processes of oviraptorids, including fusion of cranial elements and changes in relative body proportions. Hind limb proportions are constant in oviraptorids, regardless of absolute body size or ontogenetic stage. This suggests a sedentary lifestyle that did not involve the pursuit of similar-sized prey. The functional implications for bite force and therefore dietary preferences are better understood through the study of such small animals. The comparison of the measurements of 115 skeletons indicates that oviraptorids maintain their hind limb proportions regardless of ontogenetic stage or absolute size, which is a pattern seen more commonly in herbivores than in carnivores. This may weakly support the hypothesis that oviraptorids are herbivores rather than active carnivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abody length 3acarnivores 3afemur 3aherbivores 3alifestyle 3anose 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aDiet 2aDinosaursxanatomy & histologyxclassificationxphysiology. 2aEnvironment 2aFossils 2aPhylogeny 3aChina1 aCurrie, Philip J.1 aXu, Li1 aZhang, Xingliao1 aPu, Hanyong1 aJia, Songhai0 tNaturwissenschaften.g2013 Feb., v. 100, no. 2 p.165-175dSpringer-Verlagx0028-10427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-012-1007-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007900168300001600247520154200263592002801805650001601833650001201849650001301861650001101874650001601885650001801901650002801919650001101947650001901958650001201977650002101989650001002010650000902020650002502029650001102054650002102065650001502086650002302101650002102124650001102145650001202156651001102168700002702179700002602206700001802232700001902250700002202269700001902291700002402310773011102334856008102445852000902526655001202535IND60081871720221119113541.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008187172DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-013-0205-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasule, Lawrence10aLow nutritive quality of own-mixed chicken rations in Kampala City, Uganda  ap. 921-926.  aChicken production is popular in Kampala City, Uganda. Indeed about 70 % of all poultry products consumed in Kampala are produced locally. However, the high cost of feed is a major limiting factor. As a consequence, chicken farmers are formulating and mixing their own feeds. However, these own-mixed feeds may not meet recommended nutrient levels. We therefore studied five classes of own-mixed chicken feeds: broiler starter, broiler finisher, chick mash, grower mash, and layer mash. Samples of the chicken feeds were collected from farmers in and around Kampala City. We analyzed crude protein, ether extract, crude fiber, total starch, ash, calcium, phosphorus, and gross energy contents of the feeds. The apparent metabolizable energy content was calculated. We compared data with dietary requirements recommended for chickens in the tropics. Results show that own-mixed rations contained 21.9–36.3 % less protein than minimum recommendations. Broiler rations contained 16.2–20 % less metabolizable energy than minimum recommendations, and their crude fiber content was 37.5–50 % higher than the maximum recommendation. Layer mash contained 66.7 % less calcium and 17.5 % less metabolizable energy than minimum recommendations. All the five classes of own-mixed chicken rations were very high in ash content, ranging from 17.0 to 21.2 %. We conclude that own-mixed chicken rations do not conform to the dietary recommendations. There is therefore a need to give chicken farmers training on feed formulation and mixing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3acalcium 3achickens 3achicks 3acrude fiber 3acrude protein 3adietary recommendations 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3afarmers 3afeed formulation 3afeeds 3amash 3ametabolizable energy 3amixing 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3apoultry production 3apoultry products 3astarch 3atropics 3aUganda1 aKatongole, Constantine1 aNambi-Kasozi, Justine1 aLumu, Richard1 aBareeba, Felix1 aPresto, Magdalena1 aIvarsson, Emma1 aLindberg, Jan Eric,0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2014 Oct., v. 34, no. 4 p.921-926dSpringer-Verlagx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-013-0205-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245010500163300001600268520133700284592002801621650001501649650001701664650002701681650002101708650001701729650002201746650002201768650001901790650001701809650001401826650001101840650001501851650001001866650002001876650001701896700001501913700001501928773009001943856004602033852000902079655001202088IND4477808420221120032404.0120727e199801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447780842DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10068364228552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEastman, P.A.K.10aChanges of the photosystem 2 activity and thylakoid proteins in spruce seedlings during water stress  ap. 201-210.  aWe subjected spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Ã P. engelmanni Parry hybrid complex] seedlings to a severe water stress (shoot water potential â¤-3.5 MPa) to permit assessment of stress effects on photosystem 2 (PS2) in isolated photosynthetic membranes. The thylakoids and Triton-treated membranes isolated from stressed seedlings showed declines in O2-evolving capacity (H2O â 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, DCBQ) and electron transport activity (H2O â 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, DCIP). A partial restoration of O2-evolution by adding CaCl2 suggested an effect of water stress on the oxygen-enhancing extrinsic (OEE) polypeptides. Water stress had an additional impact on the reaction centre, shown by the inability of 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC) to restore the electron transport (DPC â DCIP) to the levels seen in control membranes. Quantification of specific photosynthetic membrane proteins by immunoblots strengthened the above suggestions: after drought stress, concentrations of OEE1 and OEE2 declined by 40 %, and amount of the reaction centre protein D1, ATP synthetase, and cytochrome f also declined. The specific effect of stress on these proteins was confirmed by the fact that the amount of chlorophyll-protein complex CP2 was unchanged in membranes isolated from drought-stressed seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aD1 protein 3aPicea glauca 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acalcium chloride 3acytochrome f 3aelectron transfer 3amembrane proteins 3aphotosystem II 3apolypeptides 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3athylakoids 3awater 3awater potential 3awater stress1 aRashid, A.1 aCamm, E.L.0 tPhotosynthetica.g1998 Jan., v. 34, no. 2 p.201-210dSpringer-Verlagx0300-36047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006836422855  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002000169245008900189300001600278520102600294592002801320650001501348650001901363650002101382650002101403650002801424650001201452650001301464650001201477650003901489650005001528650001201578650004501590650006001635650002401695650004501719650001101764650001101775650005001786650003601836650002801872650002401900700002301924700002001947700002101967700002701988700002102015700002302036700002502059700002002084700002202104773009802126856008402224990002302308852000902331655001202340IND60092118020221120200438.0141103e20121128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009211802DNAL7 a226431152pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2012.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuan-Yuan10aAdipose tissue and breast epithelial cells: A dangerous dynamic duo in breast cancer  ap. 142-151.  aAmong the many different cell types surrounding breast cancer cells, the most abundant are those that compose mammary adipose tissue, mainly mature adipocytes and progenitors. New accumulating recent evidences bring the tumor-surrounding adipose tissue into the light as a key component of breast cancer progression. The purpose of this review is to emphasize the role that adipose tissue might play by locally affecting breast cancer cell behavior and subsequent clinical consequences arising from this dialog. Two particular clinical aspects are addressed: obesity that was identified as an independent negative prognostic factor in breast cancer and the oncological safety of autologous fat transfer used in reconstructive surgery for breast cancer patients. This is preceded by the overall description of adipose tissue composition and function with special emphasis on the specificity of adipose depots and the species differences, key experimental aspects that need to be taken in account when cancer is considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3abreast neoplasms 3aepithelial cells 3ainterspecific variation 3aobesity 3apatients 3asurgery 2aAdipocytesxmetabolismxpathology. 2aAdipose Tissue, Whitexmetabolismxpathology. 2aAnimals 2aBreast Neoplasmsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Transformation, Neoplasticxmetabolismxpathology. 2aDisease Progression 2aEpithelial Cellsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMammary Glands, Humanxmetabolismxpathology. 2aObesityxmetabolismxpathology. 2aParacrine Communication 2aSignal Transduction1 aLehuédé, Camille1 aLaurent, Victor1 aDirat, Béatrice1 aDauvillier, Stéphanie1 aBochet, Ludivine1 aLe Gonidec, Sophie1 aEscourrou, Ghislaine1 aValet, Philippe1 aMuller, Catherine0 tCancer letters.g2012 Nov. 28, v. 324, no. 2 p.142-151dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2012.05.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010600169300001600275520149800291592002801789650001701817650002401834650002401858650001201882650002501894650001101919650002201930650001701952650001601969650001901985650001402004650002002018650001902038650001702057650003702074653001402111653003302125653001102158653001302169653001602182700001502198700001502213700001902228700001402247700002002261773012802281856008502409852000902494655001202503IND60563583020170803000000.0170301e20170321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056358302DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2016.12226092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi-Can10aArbuscular mycorrhizas improve plant growth and soil structure in trifoliate orange under salt stress  ap. 491-500.  aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as a biostimulant enhance salt tolerance in plants, while the informations regarding AMF-induced changes in soil structure are only available to a limited degree. In this study, trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings were inoculated with Diversispora versiformis under 100 mM NaCl for 85 days. The salt stress considerably inhibited mycorrhizal colonization by 26%, compared with non-salt stress. Mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased plant height, stem diameter, leaf number, shoot biomass, and root biomass, length, surface area, and volume in comparison to non-mycorrhizal inoculation under salt stress or non-salt stress. Mycorrhization induced significantly higher production of easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EE-GRSP), and total glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP), higher percentage of water-stable aggregates (WSAs) in 0.25–0.50, 0.50–1.00, and 1.00–2.00 mm size, and lower in 2.00–4.00 mm size, regardless of non-salt stress or salt stress. Mycorrhizal soils represented higher aggregate stability (in terms of mean weight diameter) under salt and non-salt stress, which was related with root colonization, root surface area, root volume, EE-GRSP, and T-GRSP. The better soil structure by mycorrhization provided higher leaf water potential under salt stress. It suggests that mycorrhizas had a positive contribution to improve plant growth and soil structure, thereby enhancing salt tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiversispora 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3aaggregate stability 3abiomass 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplant growth 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3asoil structure 3asurface area 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aAggregate 0aarbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0acitrus 0aglomalin 0aNaCl stress1 aWang, Peng1 aWu, Q.

Light emitting diodes (LED) could provide specific quality and quantity of light overcoming existing limitations for normal plant growth. However, there have been very few investigations on the applications of LED in incubators and plant growth chambers. The devices fabricated in this study, were lighted with 100 % red, 100 % blue, 70 % red plus 30 % blue, or 100 % white LED. We cultivated Mentha piperita, Mentha spicata and Mentha longifolia, lentil, basil, and four ornamentals to test the effect of various LED lights on plants productivity compared with field and greenhouse conditions. Our results show that 70/30 % red-blue LED light increased Mentha essential oil yield up to four times along with increases in plant photosynthesis and fresh weight compared with field condition. The red-blue LED incubator also led to a better growth of lentil and basil and to higher flower buds and less days to flowering for pot flowers versus greenhouse conditions. Our findings demonstrate that LED could improve economic characteristics of plant species by probably stimulating plant metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMentha longifolia 3aMentha piperita 3aMentha spicata 3abasil 3abuds 3aeconomics 3aessential oils 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agreenhouses 3agrowth chambers 3alentils 3amedicinal plants 3aornamental plants 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant characteristics 3aplant growth 3aurban agriculture 3avegetables1 aHeydarizadeh, Parisa1 aZahedi, Morteza1 aBoroomand, Amin1 aAgharokh, Mehran1 aSahba, Mohammad R.1 aSchoefs, Benoît,0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2014 Oct., v. 34, no. 4 p.879-886dSpringer-Verlagx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0209-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008300168300002000251520110600271592002801377650001201405650001301417650001801430650003401448650002101482650002001503650001701523650002501540650001301565650000701578650002001585653002101605653002401626653003101650653001701681653002301698653001301721700002101734700001801755700005701773773014701830856008501977852000902062655001202071IND60751021720221122001210.0210920e20210906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075102172DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c051442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Weikun10aAmmonia Recovery from Domestic Wastewater Using a Proton-Mediated Redox Couple  ap. 12699-12707.  aAmmonia in wastewater can be a valuable resource if recovered sustainably and with sufficient purity to compete with commercial ammonia products. A new electrochemical method employing a proton-mediated redox couple was developed to selectively recover ammonia from domestic wastewater by simultaneous separation of NH₄⁺ and conversion into NH₃ at an elevated pH. Using hydroquinone (HQ) and benzoquinone (BQ), solution pH increased by H⁺ uptake (BQ + 2H⁺ + 2e– → HQ) or decreased by H⁺ release (HQ → BQ + 2H⁺ + 2e–). This redox reaction facilitated the separation of ammonium from synthetic wastewater (5 mM NH₄⁺ + 20 mM Na⁺) at a nitrogen flux of 33.8 g N m–² day–¹ while increasing the solution pH to 9.6. A low voltage of 0.47 V at 9.6 A m–² resulted in a 3.2 kWh kg–¹ N energy consumption. The separated ammonia was recovered in a membrane contactor at a nitrogen flux of 12.0 g N m–² day–¹ (9.1 kWh kg–¹ N). This proof-of-concept demonstrated the use of a proton-mediated redox couple as a new platform to enable ammonia recovery from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abenzoquinones 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3agreen chemistry 3ahydroquinone 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3apH 3aredox reactions 0aammonia recovery 0adomestic wastewater 0aelectrochemical separation 0aredox couple 0amembrane stripping 0apH swing1 aGrimberg, Stefan1 aRogers, Shane1 aKim, Taeyoung1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0346-55190 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Sept. 06, v. 9, no. 37 p.12699-12707dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c051443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010600167300001600273520141800289592002801707650001701735650001201752650002001764650001201784650002001796650001401816650001201830650000901842650001001851650001301861650001601874650001401890650001101904650001101915650002001926650001801946650002101964650001001985650002001995651001002015653001702025653002002042653001602062653002102078653001602099700001402115700002002129700001602149700001902165773012802184856008502312852000902397655001202406IND60563583120170803000000.0170301e20170321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056358312DNAL7 a10.1080/03650340.2016.12238422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Ruxiao10aEffect of salinity and soil temperature on the growth and physiology of drip-irrigated rice seedlings  ap. 513-524.  aDrip irrigation offers potential for rice (Oryza sativa L.) production in regions where water resources are limited. However, farmers in China’s Xinjiang Province report that drip-irrigated rice seedlings sometimes suffer salt damage. The objective of this study was to learn more about the effects of soil salinity and soil temperature on the growth of drip-irrigated rice seedlings. The study consisted of a two-factor design with two soil salinity treatments (0 and 1.8 g kg ⁻¹ NaCl) and three soil temperature treatments (18°C, 28°C and 36°C). The results showed that shoot biomass, root biomass and root vigor were greatest when seedlings were grown with no salt stress (0 g kg ⁻¹ NaCl) at 28°C. Moderate salt stress (1.8 g kg ⁻¹ NaCl) combined with high temperature (36°C) significantly reduced root and shoot biomass by 39–53%. Moderate salt stress and high temperature also increased root proline concentration by 77%, root malonyldialdehyde concentration by 60% and seedling mortality by 60%. Shoot and root Na ⁺ concentrations, shoot and root Na ⁺ uptake and the Na ⁺ distribution ratio in shoots were all the greatest when moderate salt stress was combined with high temperature. In conclusion, high soil temperature aggravates salt damage to drip-irrigated rice seedlings. Therefore, soil salinity should be considered before adopting drip-irrigation for rice production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abiomass 3acrop production 3afarmers 3amicroirrigation 3amortality 3aproline 3arice 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoil salinity 3asoil temperature 3avigor 3awater resources 3aChina 0aOryza sativa 0adrip irrigation 0asalt stress 0asoil temperature 0ainteraction1 aChen, Lin1 aZhang, Xinjiang1 aWei, Guohua1 aWei, Changzhou0 tArchiv für Acker- und Pflanzenbau und Bodenkunde.g2017 Mar. 21, v. 63, no. 4 p.513-524dTaylor & Francisx1476-35677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2016.12238423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245016200167520125600329592002801585650002101613650001901634650001901653650002601672650002301698650001101721650001801732650000901750653001401759653001701773653001601790653001701806653002201823700001801845700001701863700001401880700001601894773010701910856008702017852000902104655001202113IND60779850320221118041804.0220714e20220920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077985032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiao, Xixi10aPreparation and exploration of multifunctional wood coating based on an interpenetrating network system of CO2-polyurethane and natural bio-based benzoxazine  aIn this study, we synthesized CO₂-based polyurethane (PU) as a wood coating through the reaction of CO₂-polyol with isocyanate and explored its properties such as heat resistance, acid and alkali resistance, hydrophobicity, and flame retardancy. From the results, the modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) of PU wood coatings are 150.60 and 2524.45 MPa, respectively, and the hydrophobic angle is 115°, but they do not have good acid/alkali and salt resistance. At the same time, the flame retardant effect is also poor with the limiting oxygen indexes (LOI) of 24.5 %. Therefore, PU was modified after the synthesis of bio-based benzoxazine (BZ) to prepare PU/BZ 3D interpenetrating network system, which is versatile and practical as wood coatings. In contrast, the PU/BZ wood coatings exhibited a higher value of MOR and MOE of 2979.01 and 176.63 MPa and exhibited a super-hydrophobicity of 150°. They are also stronger than PU coatings in terms of acid/alkali and aging resistance. At the same time, it endows the coating with flame retardant properties, and the LOI is 30.1 due to the existence of BZ. Therefore, the interpenetrating network system of PU/BZ has an innovative impact on the preparation of wood coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflame retardants 3aheat tolerance 3ahydrophobicity 3amodulus of elasticity 3amodulus of rupture 3aoxygen 3apolyurethanes 3awood 0aCO2-based 0aPolyurethane 0aBenzoxazine 0aWood coating 0aSuper-hydrophobic1 aGuo, Hanxiang1 aCao, Yizhong1 aWang, Zhe1 aJin, Chunde0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 20, v. 649 p.129437-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008800171300001400259520100200273592002801275650002201303650001501325650002001340650001101360650001801371650002601389653002001415653001901435653001001454653003101464700001501495700005501510700001401565700001601579700005501595700001601650700001901666700001401685700001301699773012601712856008601838852000901924655001201933IND60634848720221120094739.0201202e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063484872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolzworth, Dean10aAPSIM Next Generation: Overcoming challenges in modernising a farming systems model  ap. 43-51.  aFrom 1990, the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) has grown from a field-focused farming systems framework used by a small number of people, into a large collection of models used by thousands of modellers internationally. The software grew to consist of several hundred thousand lines of code in multiple programming languages. This has led to a large, complex software ecosystem that is difficult to maintain. In addition, systems modellers increasingly require software systems that integrate multiple disciplines, can represent evermore complex farming systems, can run on multiple operating systems (desktop, web, mobile), can operate at or be adjusted to multiple temporal and spatial scales (field, farm, region, continent, global) and run faster for larger simulation analyses. This is difficult to achieve in an aging framework.For these reasons, the APSIM Initiative is building the next generation of APSIM. This manuscript outlines the approach taken and lessons learnt.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aecosystems 3afarming systems 3amodels 3amodernization 3aproduction technology 0aModel framework 0aAgile software 0aAPSIM 0aAgricultural systems model1 aHuth, N.I.1 aFainges, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8179-64581 aBrown, H.1 aZurcher, E.1 aCichota, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1618-986X1 aVerrall, S.1 aHerrmann, N.I.1 aZheng, B.1 aSnow, V.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2018 May, v. 103 p.43-51dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007700167300001800244520126400262592002801526650000801554650001201562650002201574650001301596650001401609650000901623650002001632650001101652650001101663650001301674650002101687650001401708650001201722650001701734650001801751700002101769700002001790700006101810700002401871700002501895773011401920856008402034852000902118655001202127IND60607192520180918000000.0180730e20180618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060719252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b007162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorti, Mario10aNanometric Surface Oscillation Spectroscopy of Water-Poor Microemulsions  ap. 8154-8162.  aSelectively exchanging metal complexes between emulsified water-poor microemulsions and concentrated solutions of mixed electrolytes is the core technology for strategic metal recycling. Nanostructuration triggered by solutes present in the organic phase is understood, but little is known about fluctuations of the microemulsion-water interface. We use here a modified version of an optoelectric device initially designed for air bubbles, in order to evidence resonant electrically induced surface waves of an oily droplet suspended in an aqueous phase. Resonant waves of nanometer amplitude of a millimeter-sized microemulsion droplet containing a common ion-specific extractant diluted by dodecane and suspended in a solution of rare earth nitrate are evidenced for the first time with low excitation fields (5 V/cm). From variation of the surface wave spectrum with rare earth concentration, we evidence uptake of rare-earth ions at the interface and at higher concentration the formation of a thin “crust” of liquid crystal forming at unusually low concentration, indicative of a surface induced phase transition. The effect of the liquid crystal structure on the resonance spectrum is backed up by a model, which is used to estimate crust thickness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abubbles 3acrystal structure 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3aions 3aliquid crystals 3ametals 3amodels 3anitrates 3aphase transition 3arecycling 3asolutes 3aspectroscopy 3asurface waves1 aRaudino, Antonio1 aCantu’, Laura1 aTheisen, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8282-52811 aPleines, Maximilian1 aZemb, Th.q(Thomas),0 tLangmuir.g2018 June 18, v. 34, no. 28 p.8154-8162dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b007163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245018000163520187600343592002802219650001702247650001602264650001802280650001002298650001302308650002302321650001702344650001402361650003002375650001402405650001402419650001302433650001502446653002002461653003302481653002402514653002902538700001302567700001302580700001802593700002002611700005602631773012502687856008402812852000902896655001202905IND60732869220221116203736.0211129e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073286922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.syapm.2021.1262022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aComparative genomic analysis of the genus Novosphingobium and the description of two novel species Novosphingobium aerophilum sp. nov. and Novosphingobium jiangmenense sp. nov  aMembers of the genus Novosphingobium are well known for their metabolically versatile and great application potential in pollution elimination. The three novel bacterial strains, designated 4Y4ᵀ, 4Y9, and 1Y9Aᵀ, were isolated from aquaculture water and characterized by using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. The 16S rRNA gene sequences phylogenetic analysis revealed that the three strains belonged to the genus Novosphingobium. The phylogenomic analysis indicated that the three strains formed two independent and robust branches distinct from all reference strains. The analyses of dDDH values and ANIs between the three strains and their relatives further demonstrated that the three strains represented two different novel genospecies. Comparative genomic analysis of the three isolates and 32 type strains of the genus Novosphingobium showed that the most important central metabolic pathways of these strains appeared to be similar, while specific and specialized metabolic pathways were flexible and variable among these strains. Chemotaxonomic characterization exhibited that the predominant cellular fatty acids were summed feature 8, summed feature 3, and C₁₄:₀ 2OH; the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and sphingoglycolipid; the major respiratory quinone and polyamine were Q-10 and spermidine. The DNA G + C contents were 67.6 and 64.7 %.

However, map-based cloning can be time-consuming or even hampered due to low chromosomal recombination. Current strategies using next generation sequencing for molecular identification of mutations require whole genome sequencing and advanced computational devises and skills, which are not readily accessible or affordable to every laboratory. We have developed a streamlined method using parallel massive sequencing for mutant identification in which only targeted regions are sequenced. This targeted parallel sequencing (TPSeq) method is more cost-effective, straightforward enough to be easily done without specialized bioinformatics expertise, and reliable for identifying multiple mutations simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate its use by identifying three novel nitrate-signaling mutants in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3agenome 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3amutation1 aMcCormack, Matthew1 aSheen, Jen0 tPlant methods.g2012 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.183-183dSpringer-Verlagx1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4811-8-12  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013800169520079200307592002801099650001001127650001901137650001501156650001901171650001901190650001301209653001901222653001501241653003201256653002301288700001701311700001601328700001401344700001401358700001601372773010701388856008701495852000901582655001201591IND60779850420221118041651.0220714e20220920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077985042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Jinxing10aElectrostatic self-assembled PTh/Ag/protonated g-C3N4 nanocomposite with remarkable photocatalytic degradation for organic pollutants  aA novel ternary polythiophene/Ag/protonated g-C₃N₄ nanosheets (PTh/Ag/pCN) nanocomposite was constructed by electrostatic self-assembly strategy. The as-prepared 5% PTh/Ag/pCN exhibits excellent visible light photocatalytic performance toward methylene orange (MO), which is 6 and 3.7 times higher than pCN and PTh, respectively. The result was dominantly ascribed to the forming of Z-scheme heterojunction due to the synergetic effects of pCN, Ag and PTh, which is conductive to the separation of photogenerated charges. Meanwhile, the radical trapping experiments and ESR techniques proved that the photogenerated holes and superoxide radicals are vital reactive substances.

The redox polymerization was triggered by the calcined oil shale semicoke (CSC) under air atmosphere, in which the iron-compounds of CSC and Na₂S₂O₃ were employed as oxidizing agent and reducing agent, respectively. The CS-g-PAA/PDUP/CSC composites prepared at the optimal conditions exhibited the maximum water absorption capacity of 412.89 and 51.30 g/g in deionized water and 0.9 wt% NaCl solution within 60 min, respectively. The excellent water absorption and retention performance were related to the introduction of CSC, which could be served as an inorganic component weakening the hydrogen-bond interaction between the functional groups in the polymer matrix and the semi-IPN. The superabsorbent composites also showed the favorable degradability, and 42.35 % of superabsorbent was degraded at 90 days. Interestingly, the nitrogen element provided by urea and chitosan could be released during degradation and directly absorbed by the plant to promote the growth. Integration of the above performance, the prepared composites may be used for better water resources management in agriculture taken into account of the corresponding environmental benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aair 3aambient temperature 3acabbage 3achitosan 3ahydrogen bonding 3anitrogen 3aoil shale 3aphosphates 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aurea 3awater binding capacity 3awater uptake 0aSuperabsorbent 0aBiodegradable 0aRedox polymerization 0aOil shale semicoke 0aWater retention1 aZhu, Yongfeng1 aWang, Yongsheng1 aMu, Bin1 aWang, Xicun1 aWang, Aiqin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 648 p.129439-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1294393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007400139245012700213300001600340500001900356500002000375520177400395592002802169650001502197650001502212650001702227650002502244650001502269650001002284650001802294650001702312650000902329650002302338650002102361650001502382651001302397651001802410700005802428700003302486700002102519700004202540700003002582700003002612700002302642700007102665773012602736856007302862852000902935655001202944IND60720318020221119215630.0201212e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072031802DNAL7 a10.1111/aje.127752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTchoudjin, Gertrude‐Loveline1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3065-288910aInfluence of season on leaf litter ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) diversity in the locality of Minko'o (Southern, Cameroon)  ap. 796-814.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSeasonality is known to influence ant activity in many tropical rain forests in the world such as South America and Africa. We surveyed ant fauna in the leaf litter in the locality of Minko'o. The work aimed to evaluate the effect of seasonal variation on the diversity and composition of litter ants. Ants were sampled from November 2015 to June 2017, using four sampling methods: visual capture, bait, pitfall trap and extraction. Species richness, Shannon diversity index and analysis of similarities were used to characterise diversity of ant communities between seasons. We collected 306 ant species, shared out between 56 genera and 11 subfamilies. Subfamilies Myrmicinae, Ponerinae, Dolichoderinae, Formicinae, Dorylinae, Cerapachyinae and Pseudomyrmecinae occurred in all the seasons. Species richness was highest in major dry season with 243 species followed by minor rainy season with 188, major rainy season with 177 species and finally minor dry season that recorded the lowest with 155 species. Kruskal–Wallis test showed that ant species richness did not differ between seasons (p > 0.05). Species diversity index indicated that diversity was the highest during minor dry season (H′ = 4.24), followed by the major dry season (H′ = 4.23), minor rainy season (H′ = 4.21) and lowest during major rainy season (H′ = 4.06). Eight most frequents ants have been recorded: Axinidris sp.1, Camponotus flavomarginatus, Monomorium guineense, Myrmicaria opaciventris, Odontomachus troglodytes, Carebara perpusilla, Paltothyreus tarsatus and Pheidole megacephala. Assessment of the seasonal effect on diversity reveals that dry season is richer and more diverse than rainy season and the season significantly influence the diversity of litter ants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamponotus 3aMonomorium 3aOdontomachus 3aPheidole megacephala 3adry season 3afauna 3apitfall traps 3aplant litter 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3aspecies richness 3awet season 3aCameroon 3aSouth America1 aZephirin, Tadu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4790-92921 aFomekong‐Lontchi, Judicael1 aKakam, Stephanie1 aAymélé‐Choungmo, Syntiche Roselle1 aKenfack‐Fogang, Patrick1 aMassussi, Jacques Anselme1 aNiba, Augustine S.1 aDjiéto‐Lordon, Champlain1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3144-74490 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2020 Dec., v. 58, no. 4 p.796-814dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31087x0141-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.127753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245009400193300001600287520119500303592002801498650002501526650001501551650002801566650001901594650001301613650002901626650001501655650001001670650001001680650001501690650001101705650001901716650001401735650001501749650001401764650002001778650001001798650001501808650006601823650001801889650001001907650002101917650004101938650001901979650003501998650002402033650001102057650002602068650001102094650001102105650000902116650001602125650002802141650001402169650004102183650002702224700003002251700002902281700002702310700003802337773013902375856008202514852000902596655001202605IND4481023820221120040944.0220611e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448102382DNAL7 a229231082pmid7 a10.1007/s12275-012-2045-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSathyabama, Sathyaseelan10aScreening for probiotic properties of strains isolated from feces of various human groups  ap. 603-612.  aThe present study searched for potential probiotic strains from various human fecal samples. A total of 67 aerobic and 38 anaerobic strains were isolated from 5 different categories of human feces. Systematic procedures were used to evaluate the probiotic properties of the isolated strains. These showed about 75–97% survivability in acidic and bile salt environments. Adhesion to intestinal cell line Caco-2 was also high. The isolates exhibited hydrophobic properties in hexadecane. The culture supernatants of these strains showed antagonistic effects against pathogens. The isolates were resistant to a simulated gastrointestinal environment in vitro. Of the 4 best isolates, MAbB4 (Staphylococcus succinus) and FIdM3 (Enterococcus fecium), were promising candidates for a potential probiotic. S. succinus was found to be a probiotic strain, which is the second such species reported to date in this particular genus. A substantial zone of inhibition was found against Salmonella spp., which adds further support to the suggestion that the probiotic strain could help prevent intestinal infection. This study suggested that the human flora itself is a potential source of probiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus succinus 3aacid tolerance 3aadhesion 3aantibacterial properties 3abile salts 3afeces 3aflora 3ahexadecane 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3apathogens 3aprobiotics 3ascreening 2aAcidsxtoxicity 2aAdult 2aAntibiosis 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCell Adhesion 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDrug Tolerance 2aEpithelial Cellsxmicrobiology 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aHuman Experimentation 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPregnancy 2aProbioticsxisolation & purification 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aVijayabharathi, Rajendran1 aBruntha devi, Palanisamy1 aRanjith kumar, Manohar1 aPriyadarisini, Venkatesan Brindha0 tjournal of microbiology.g2012 Aug., v. 50, no. 4 p.603-612dThe Microbiological Society of KoreawJournal:jnl4619042x1225-88737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-012-2045-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02429naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245009000210300001400300520103100314592002801345650001501373650001401388650001101402650001901413650002201432650001501454650001301469650002601482650001501508650000901523650002201532650002301554651001401577653002101591653001501612653001801627653001501645653001401660653000801674700001901682700001901701700002001720773011301740856008501853852000901938655001201947IND60634848920221120094728.0190326e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063484892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreebairn, D.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1166-771912aA tool for monitoring soil water using modelling, on-farm data, and mobile technology  ap. 55-63.  aRainfall is low and unreliable in much of Australia's dryland cropping areas, requiring well-informed crop management for optimising yield and profit. Growing-season rainfall is usually supplemented by soil water during fallow periods preceding a crop. While rainfall is conveniently measured, the difficulty of measuring a soil's plant available water (PAW, mm) has led to using simulation models for estimating PAW. Here we developed a smartphone application (app) that simulates soil water balance by accessing weather, soil and crop data from databases and on-farm records. Predictions of PAW using the Howleaky modelling engine were compared with field measurements. Validation of the simulation engine across sites in Australian cropping areas showed good agreement between simulated and measured PAW. Errors in model estimates are compared with variability found within small fields. We conclude that estimating PAW for paddocks using a simulation model built in a smartphone app is a reliable and adaptable technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3adatabases 3afallow 3agrowing season 3amobile telephones 3amonitoring 3apastures 3aplant available water 3aprediction 3arain 3asimulation models 3asoil water balance 3aAustralia 0aDecision support 0aSoil water 0aWater balance 0aMonitoring 0aModelling 0aApp1 aGhahramani, A.1 aRobinson, J.B.1 aMcClymont, D.J.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2018 June, v. 104 p.55-63dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011000208300001800318520116200336592002801498650001301526650001301539650001101552650001601563650001301579650002301592650002301615700005701638773011401695856008401809852000901893655001201902IND60607192720221119134659.0180730e20180413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060719272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b007272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Qingguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9260-322810aFrom Dot to Ring: The Role of Friction in the Deposition Pattern of a Drying Colloidal Suspension Droplet  ap. 5303-5311.  aThe deposition of particles on a substrate by drying a colloidal suspension droplet is at the core of applications ranging from traditional printing on paper to printable electronics or photovoltaic devices. The self-pinning induced by the accumulation of particles at the contact line plays an important role in the formation of a deposit. In this article, we investigate, both numerically and theoretically, the effect of friction between the particles and the substrate on the deposition pattern. Without friction, the contact line shows a stick-slip behavior and a dotlike deposit is left after the droplet is evaporated. By increasing the friction force, we observe a transition from a dotlike to a ringlike deposit. We propose a theoretical model to predict the effective radius of the particle deposit as a function of the friction force. Our theoretical model predicts a critical friction force when self-pinning happens and the effective radius of deposit increases with increasing friction force, confirmed by our simulation results. Our results can find implications for developing active control strategies for the deposition of drying droplets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolloids 3adroplets 3adrying 3aelectronics 3afriction 3aphotovoltaic cells 3atheoretical models1 aHarting, Jens1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9200-66230 tLangmuir.g2018 Apr. 13, v. 34, no. 18 p.5303-5311dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b007273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007700158300001600235500002000251520151600271592002801787650002201815650002501837650001001862650002301872650001101895650001901906650001701925650001801942650002301960650000901983650001301992650001002005650002202015650001402037650002802051650001602079650001702095650002702112650002002139650001302159700002202172700001802194700002402212773013302236856007402369852000902443655001202452IND60587242720221118034305.0171215e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058724272DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.124222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasser, Nivin10aToxicity of Four Chemotherapeutic Agents to Rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus  ap. 877-886.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs aquaculture evolves from extensive pond culture to intensive tank and cage systems, chemical dips and baths are increasingly being used to treat a concomitant increase in ectoparasitic and bacterial infestations. Some of the main disease‐causing agents are ectoparasites on the skin and gills of fish. Consequently, application of chemotherapeutics is increasing in aquaculture industries in order to control outbreaks of parasitic infestations. However, the toxic effect of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents on specific aquacultured fish species is often unknown. The present work was performed to test the effect of four commonly used chemical treatments on rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus. The lethal concentrations for 50% of population (LC₅₀) of formalin, copper sulfate, potassium permanganate, and hydrogen peroxide for S. rivulatus juveniles treated for 1 h were assessed. Formalin and potassium permanganate tolerance values were determined by calculating 72‐h LC₅₀ values through probit analysis. The 72‐h LC₅₀ values for the formalin toxicity tests were 551.0 and 1.68 mg/L, respectively. LC₅₀ of copper sulfate and hydrogen peroxide could not be determined from the concentrations tested but were found to be >3 and >700 mg/L, respectively. Accordingly, treatment concentrations of formalin and potassium permanganate used for other fish species could be lethal to S. rivulatus, but the species appears to be quite tolerant to copper sulfate and hydrogen peroxide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiganus rivulatus 3aaquaculture industry 3acages 3achemical treatment 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3adrug therapy 3aectoparasites 3aetiological agents 3afish 3aformalin 3agills 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ajuveniles 3alethal concentration 50 3aparasitoses 3apond culture 3apotassium permanganate 3aprobit analysis 3atoxicity1 aBabikian, Jessica1 aMonzer, Samer1 aSaoud, Imad Patrick0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 Dec., v. 48, no. 6 p.877-886dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.124223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100007500155245016100230300001600391520172400407592002802131650001102159650002502170650002702195650001602222650001902238650001702257650002102274650001202295650001602307650002802323650001202351650002002363650001602383650001702399650001402416650001002430650002002440650002502460650001402485650001402499650001402513653002502527653001602552653002002568653000902588653002202597700003402619700002702653700003302680700004102713700003502754700001902789773010802808856009002916852000903006655001203015IND60622932720221120083355.0190405e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062293272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2018.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraripe Sucupira, Maria Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0327-170910aParenteral use of ADE vitamins in prepartum and its influences in the metabolic, oxidative, and immunological profiles of sheep during the transition period  ap. 120-124.  aTo evaluate the effect of the parenteral administration of vitamins ADE blend during the transition period, 27 adult Santa Inês sheep, which were healthy and in the last month of pregnancy, were distributed into two groups: a treated-group, which received 1 mL/50 kg BW of a vitamins ADE blend (270.000 UI vitamin A, 80.000 UI vitamin D and 80 UI vitamin E /mL) via intramuscular injection 30 days and 10 days before partum, and a control-group, which received saline solution at the same times and volumes. On days -30, -10, 0, 7, 14 and 28 to parturition, the following levels were determined: plasma concentrations of glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxyburyrate (BHB), serum activities of AST, GGT and CK enzymes and concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD). The in vitro intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by current polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and intensity of phagocytosis were also evaluated. There was no effect of time and treatment to the biochemical parameters and oxidative status. NEFA concentration reduced in the control and the ADE groups after lambing. Close to the lambing period, ROS production increased when stimulated by LPS and PI-Sa, and phagocytosis decreased in all sheep. The increase in ROS production in sheep treated with the ADE vitamin blend was milder than in the control group, either with stimulus of LPS or no stimulus. The use of two doses of ADE vitamin blend in sheep at 120 and 140 days of gestation improved in vitro the antioxidant capacity of PMN when animals were well fed and it presented a moderate, negative energy balance in the transition period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3ablood serum 3aenergy balance 3aerythrocytes 3afree fatty acids 3aglucose 3aglutathione 3aintramuscular injection 3alambing 3amalondialdehyde 3aneutrophils 3aphagocytosis 3apregnancy 3asheep 3asodium chloride 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avitamin A 3avitamin D 3avitamin E 0aOxidative metabolism 0aAntioxidant 0aInnate immunity 0aEwes 0aEnergetic profile1 aMarques Nascimento, Priscilla1 aSilva Lima, Alessandra1 ade Oliveira S Gomes, Márcia1 aMelville P Della Libera, Alice Maria1 aMazza odrigues, Paulo Henrique1 aSusin, Ivanete0 tSmall ruminant research.g2019 Jan., v. 170 p.120-124dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2018.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03799naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010300181300001600284500001500300520152700315592002801842650002701870650001001897650001401907650001801921650001401939650002301953650001001976650001401986650001302000650001802013650001102031650001802042650001102060650001402071650001202085650001402097650001702111650001502128650004302143650002502186650002202211650002202233650001202255650001702267650001402284650006402298650002102362650004102383650004102424650000902465650001602474650001502490650002802505650001402533650003002547650004602577650002902623650003402652650002402686650002702710653002502737700002002762700001802782700001602800700001902816700001702835773009602852856004802948852000902996655001203005IND4479837620221118114020.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447983762DNAL7 a217442882pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-011-9975-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, K.

Three animals were fed diet comprised green fodder Napier bajra 21 (Pennisetum purpureum), mature pasture grass (Dicanthium annulatum) and concentrate mixture (20% crude protein, 65% total digestible nutrients). A protozoa-specific primer (P-SSU-342f) and a eukarya-specific primer (Medlin B) were used to amplify a 1,360 bp fragment of DNA encoding protozoal small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA from rumen fluid. A total of 91 clones were examined and identified 14 different 18S RNA sequences based on PCR–RFLP pattern. These 14 phylotypes were distributed into four genera-based 18S rDNA database sequences and identified as Dasytricha (57 clones), Isotricha (14 clones), Ostracodinium (11 clones) and Polyplastron (9 clones). Phylogenetic analyses were also used to infer the makeup of protozoa communities in the rumen of Surti buffalo. Out of 14 sequences, 8 sequences (69 clones) clustered with the Dasytricha ruminantium-like clone and 4 sequences (13 clones) were also phylogenetically placed with the Isotricha prostoma-like clone. Moreover, 2 phylotypes (9 clones) were related to Polyplastron multivesiculatum-like clone. In addition, the number of 18S rDNA gene copies of Dasytricha ruminantium (0.05% to ciliate protozoa) was higher than Entodinium sp. (2.0 × 105 vs. 1.3 × 104) in per ml ruminal fluid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDasytricha ruminantium 3arumen 3abuffaloes 3aribosomal RNA 3aphylogeny 3aCenchrus purpureus 3agenes 3anutrients 3apastures 3aribosomal DNA 3aclones 3acrude protein 3aforage 3adatabases 3agrasses 3aIsotricha 3aPolyplastron 3aEntodinium 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 3asequence homology 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aBuffaloes 2aCiliophoraxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDiet 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMetagenome 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aRumenxparasitology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aPennisetum purpureum1 aTripathi, A.

As these “forest community stewards” promote local resource access and management, their organizations often take on greater internal complexity. This paper draws on the experience of the Association of Forest Communities of Petén (ACOFOP), Guatemala and the community-based concessions it serves to examine interactions among multiple forest activities, participants, interests and objectives in increasingly complex community-based organizations. Interntal interactions and tensions among multiple activities inevitably arise as these organizations seek to maintain their responsiveness and legitimacy amid rapidly changing social, political and environmental contexts. This paper suggests that rather than seek to eliminate tensions emerging from increased internal diversity and complexity, grassroots forest organizations should confront and manage these tensions to ensure continued viability while responding appropriately to moments of “structural choice”. Seeing these community-based forest organizations as social movement processes managed over time by their participants rather than as sets of static principles best designed a priori allows more accurate analysis of the complex factors that shape success or failure, and of how appropriate external support may be provided.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental governance 3aforests 3aresource management 3asocial change 3asocial structure 3aviability 3aGuatemala0 tForest ecology and management.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 268 p.29-38dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245007100171300001400242520099100256592002801247650002001275650001101295650001101306650001901317650001301336650002001349650001601369650002801385650000901413700002201422773011501444856008101559852000901640655001201649IND4397113420221117212041.0151024e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439711342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-005-9054-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciejewska, Bożenna10aEmbryonic dormancy persists in the calli derived from apple embryo  ap. 83-89.  aGrowth rate and differentiation ability of calli obtained form apple embryos depended on the depth of embryo dormancy and on the organ of callus origin. We wanted to answer whether some dormancy – related metabolic activities persist also in calli and whether they are affected by the dormancy status. The activities of invertases and proteases were determined in the calli obtained from axes and cotyledons of embryos after different periods of cold stratification. Patterns of changes in activities of alkaline invertase, albumine hydrolysing protease and cystine-aminopeptydase in extracts of different calli corresponded precisely to changes of these activities in axes and cotyledons of intact embryos submitted to stratification. These findings indicate that embryonic dormancy persists in undifferentiated cells of calli. The involvement of an unknown factor responsible for maintenance of the dormancy, which is transmitted to daughter cells during callus growth is suggested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3acallus 3aembryo (plant) 3adormancy 3aenzyme activity 3aproteinases 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acold1 aLewak, Stanisław0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2006 Apr., v. 85, no. 1 p.83-89dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-005-9054-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245021700164506011700381506007600498520153800574592002802112506003702140650001702177650001102194650002802205650002202233650001502255651001002270651001702280653002702297653002002324653003902344653004302383653002902426700001602455700001902471700002002490700001702510773010102527856008602628852000902714655001202723IND60793706120221207085147.0220929e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079370612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1094732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Lan10aWhere is the pathway to sustainable urban development?

Few studies have considered the coupling coordination between low-carbon development and eco-environment (LC-EE) simultaneously for the key region, and ignored the interdependence of its influencing factors. Based on the coupling coordination degree model, this research analyzes the coordinated development level between LC-EE systems in prefecture-level cities of the Yellow River Basin (YRB). The qualitative comparative analysis method is employed to explore influencing factors configuration affecting the coupling coordination degree and further explore sustainable development pathways. The results indicate that the coupling coordination between LC-EE systems in the YRB has undergone considerable regional differences and achieved marginal balance, but several cities are fighting with imbalances. The configuration analysis shows that a single influencing factor does not constitute a necessary condition for the high coupling coordination degree. LC-EE coupling coordination is a multifactorial synergy, referring to the effective combination of technical, organizational, and environmental conditions which can promote sustainable development in the way of “all paths lead to the same goal”. Finally, based on the conclusion and the cities' realities, three kinds of sustainable development patterns are proposed, including the eco-industry promotion model, the government-led life service model, and the industry-city integration model.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acase studies 3amodels 3asustainable development 3aurban development 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aLow-carbon development 0aEco-environment 0aCoupling coordination degree model 0aQualitative comparative analysis (QCA) 0aYellow River Basin (YRB)1 aWang, Yanan1 aLiu, Yangcheng1 aZhang, Xiangwei1 aFang, Xiaoli0 tEcological indicators.g2022 Nov., v. 144 p.109473-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.1094733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012600164300001600290520150100306592002801807650002301835650001001858650001601868650001501884650001401899650001301913650001801926650001301944650001801957700001801975700001701993700001802010700001402028700001402042700001902056700001702075773011502092856008202207852000902289655001202298IND4472770720221118185958.0190314e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447277072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-011-1202-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Weidong10aSmall-angle X-ray scattering study on nanostructural changes with water content in red pine, American pine, and white ash  ap. 470-478.  aWood is a highly sophisticated and multihierarchical material. The nanoscale structures in natural cell walls of red pine, American pine, and white ash specimens were investigated using the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique. A tangent-by-tangent method was used to analyze the SAXS data. The results demonstrate that the multihierarchical scatterers in the three specimens can be divided into two dominant components, i.e., a sharp component and a wide component. The sharp component mainly corresponds to the contribution of cellulose microfibrils, and its size is almost unaffected by the water content. However, the wide component includes voids or microcracks and cellulose microfibril aggregates; its size changes, reflecting swelling and water accumulation in the voids or microcracks. Because of the different morphological features of the cell walls, softwood (red pine and American pine) displays different tendencies from hardwood (white ash) in terms of changes in the wide component with water content: the average scatterer size of the wide component has an incremental tendency with the water content in softwood, but it has a descending tendency in hardwood. Fractal analysis further revealed that in white ash the surface of scatterers is coarser and the scatterers form more compact nanostructures than in the two pine woods. All this nanostructural information can be used to explain well the difference of swelling behaviors between the two pines and the white ash.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFraxinus americana 3aPinus 3aX-radiation 3acell walls 3acellulose 3ahardwood 3ananomaterials 3asoftwood 3awater content1 aXing, Xueqing1 aWang, Dehong1 aZhang, Kunhao1 aCai, Quan1 aMo, Guang1 aChen, Zhongjun1 aWu, Zhonghua0 tJournal of wood science.g2011 Dec., v. 57, no. 6 p.470-478dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-011-1202-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02163naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245016900162300002000331520086900351592002801220650000901248650001301257650002301270650001301293650001801306700001901324700001701343700001801360700002201378700002101400700001901421700002501440700002901465700002001494700002401514773014401538856007401682852000901756655001201765IND60746208420221116164809.0210729e20210727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074620842DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta03296h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Mayanak K.10aStoichiometric tuning of lattice flexibility and Na diffusion in NaAlSiO₄: quasielastic neutron scattering experiment and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations  ap. 16129-16136.  aWe have performed quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) experiments up to 1243 K and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the Na diffusion in various phases of NaAlSiO₄ (NASO), namely, low-carnegieite (L-NASO; trigonal), high-carnegieite (H-NASO; cubic) and nepheline (N-NASO; hexagonal) phases. The QENS measurements reveal Na ions localized diffusion behavior in L-NASO and N-NASO, but long-range diffusion behavior in H-NASO. The AIMD simulation supplemented the QENS measurements and showed that excess Na ions in H-NASO enhance the host network flexibility and activate the AlO₄/SiO₄ tetrahedra rotational modes. These framework modes enable the long-range diffusion of Na across a pathway of interstitial sites. The simulations also show Na diffusion in Na-deficient N-NASO through vacant Na sites along the hexagonal c-axis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNaso 3ageometry 3amolecular dynamics 3aneutrons 3astoichiometry1 aMittal, Ranjan1 aSajan Kumar,1 aSingh, Baltej1 aJalarvo, Niina H.1 aDelaire, Olivier1 aShukla, Rakesh1 aAchary, Srungarpu N.1 aKolesnikov, Alexander I.1 aTyagi, Avesh K.1 aChaplot, Samrath L.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 27, v. 9, no. 29 p.16129-16136dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta03296h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100006000185245016100245300001800406500002000424506007600444520190500520592002802425506003702453650001902490650001202509650002002521650001002541650002102551650002202572650002102594650001802615650001302633650001302646650002102659700002002680700002402700700001902724700003802743700003502781700002202816773012102838856007802959852000903037655001203046IND60607699220221207112439.0180731e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060769922DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2017003822doi7 aPMC60016962pmcid7 a294657532pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, Victor U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0056-681910aSize and molecular weight determination of polysaccharides by means of nano electrospray gas‐phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (nES GEMMA)  ap. 1142-1150.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSize, size distribution and molecular weight (MW) determination of nanoparticles and that are for example large polymers, are of great interest and pose an analytical challenge. In this context, nano electrospray gas‐phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (nES GEMMA) is a valuable tool with growing impact. Separation of single‐charged analytes according to their electrophoretic mobility diameter (EMD) starting from single‐digit EMDs up to several hundred nm diameters is possible. In case of spherical analytes, the EMD corresponds to the dry nanoparticle size. Additionally, the instrument is capable of number‐based, single‐particle detection following the recommendation of the European Commission for nanoparticle characterization (2011/696/EU). In case an EMD/MW correlation for a particular compound class (based on availability of well‐defined standards) exists, a nanoparticle's MW can be determined from its EMD. In the present study, we focused on nES GEMMA of linear and branched, water‐soluble polysaccharides forming nanoparticles and were able to obtain spectra for both analyte classes regarding single‐charged species. Based on EMDs for corresponding analytes, an excellent EMD/MW correlation could be obtained in case of the branched natural polymer (dextran). This enables the determination of dextran MWs from nES GEMMA spectra despite high analyte polydispersity and in a size/MW range, where classical mass spectrometry is limited. EMD/MW correlations based on linear (pullulans, oat‐ß‐glucans) polymers were significantly different, possibly indicating challenges in the exact MW determination of these compounds by, for example, chromatographic and light scattering means. Despite these observations, nES GEMMA of linear, monosaccharide‐based polymers enabled the determination of size and size‐distribution of such dry bionanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatography 3adextran 3aelectrophoresis 3agases 3alight scattering 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3apullulan 3awater solubility1 aGolesne, Monika1 aFriedbacher, Gernot1 aAlban, Susanne1 aSzymanski, W.

Two common strategies to achieve high electrocatalytic performance for SACs are to enhance the intrinsic activity by modulating the electronic structure of active sites and to incorporate more single active sites by increasing the metal loading. In this review, we have summarized the key advances in ORR electrocatalysis of carbon-supported heterogeneous catalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites during the past decade, mainly focusing on the modulation of the electronic structure and the elevation of metal loading, and the operando/ex situ characterization techniques of the electronic structure evolution of SACs during the ORR process have also been highlighted. Meanwhile, the underlying formation mechanism of SACs has also been discussed in detail for both “bottom-up” and “top-down” approaches. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of carbon-supported SACs for ORR-related energy devices have been outlined. Hopefully, this timely review will provide an insightful roadmap for the future research of SACs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aoxygen1 aChen, Zhiwen1 aKou, Shuqing1 aLu, Guolong1 aChen, Donghui1 aLiu, Zhenning0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 27, v. 9, no. 29 p.15919-15936dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta03375a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03453naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100002000154245008800174300001800262500002000280520153500300592002801835650001701863650001001880650001201890650002201902650001501924650001101939650002101950650002201971650002401993650001802017650003002035650001802065650002502083650001502108650006202123650001702185650002902202650002602231650001402257650004002271650003002311650006202341650003002403650002402433650002502457650002302482650002002505651001102525651001802536651002002554700002202574700002002596700002102616773009802637852000902735856007102744655001202815IND4398315120221120193554.0170626e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439831512DNAL7 a176011292pmid7 a10.1890/06-03872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrump, Byron C.10aBiogeography of bacterioplankton in lakes and streams of an arctic tundra catchment  ap. 1365-1378.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBacterioplankton community composition was compared across 10 lakes and 14 streams within the catchment of Toolik Lake, a tundra lake in Arctic Alaska, during seven surveys conducted over three years using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR‐amplified rDNA. Bacterioplankton communities in streams draining tundra were very different than those in streams draining lakes. Communities in streams draining lakes were similar to communities in lakes. In a connected series of lakes and streams, the stream communities changed with distance from the upstream lake and with changes in water chemistry, suggesting inoculation and dilution with bacteria from soil waters or hyporheic zones. In the same system, lakes shared similar bacterioplankton communities (78% similar) that shifted gradually down the catchment. In contrast, unconnected lakes contained somewhat different communities (67% similar). We found evidence that dispersal influences bacterioplankton communities via advection and dilution (mass effects) in streams, and via inoculation and subsequent growth in lakes. The spatial pattern of bacterioplankton community composition was strongly influenced by interactions among soil water, stream, and lake environments. Our results reveal large differences in lake‐specific and stream‐specific bacterial community composition over restricted spatial scales (<10 km) and suggest that geographic distance and connectivity influence the distribution of bacterioplankton communities across a landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3alakes 3astreams 3amicrobial ecology 3awatersheds 3atundra 3abacterioplankton 3aspecies diversity 3agel electrophoresis 3aribosomal DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asoil bacteria 3aspatial distribution 3asoil water 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aBiodiversity 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacer 2aEcosystem 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aPlanktonxclassificationxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aRiversxmicrobiology 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Movements 3aAlaska 3aArctic region 0aArctic regions.1 aAdams, Heather E.1 aHobbie, John E.1 aKling, George W.0 tEcology.g2007 June, v. 88, no. 6 p.1365-1378dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-03873Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01809naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009800168300001800266520035500284592002800639650001300667650002300680650002300703650001300726653001500739653001200754653002000766653003300786700002200819700001800841700001600859700001700875700001400892700001700906700002300923700001500946700001400961700001500975700001200990700001901002700001901021700002101040700002001061700001701081700002201098773008101120856008101201852000901282655001201291IND60551566720221121003043.0161019e20161006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055156672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilbert, Eric J.12aA novel domino reaction for the preparation of substituted non-racemic β-proline derivatives  ap. 6011-6020.  aA novel domino reaction for the preparation of non-racemic β-proline derivatives is reported.

The ventilation rate of the exhausted fan was classified as 120, 80, and 40 m³ min⁻¹. Three inlet types were used as follows: (1) side windows, (2) ceiling slot with opening angle of 90°, and (3) ceiling slot with opening angle of 45°. Then, the local mean age (LMA) and air supply effectiveness (ASE) were calculated from the measured data at 18 points (3 × 3 sensors placed top and bottom). The LMA means the time for the inflow air to reach a point and ASE is the ratio of the LMA at a point to the total average LMA in the facility. When side windows and ceiling slots were used with the ventilation rate of 120 m³ min⁻¹, each ASE was approximately 0.8 and 0.9, respectively, suggesting that ceiling slots could be more efficient than side windows with high ventilation rate. When the ventilation rate was low, the ASE of side windows was higher than the ceiling slots. However, when the angle of ceiling slots was changed to 45° with the ventilation rate of 40 m³ min⁻¹, the ASE was almost 1.0, indicating that the ventilation efficiency was improved. Thus, ventilation efficiency can be sufficiently improved for all ventilation rates by using ceiling slots whilst controlling the angle of the slots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3apiglets 0aair supply effectiveness 0aartificial piglet house 0alocal mean age 0atracer-gas decay method 0aventilation efficiency1 aLee, In bok,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0401-76571 aKim, Rack-woo1 aYeo, Uk-hyeon1 aLee, Sang-yeon1 aJeong, Deuk-young1 aDecano, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0254-88840 tBiosystems engineering.g2022 Sept. 12, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2022.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005000171500001400221520075900235592002800994650002201022650001001044650001501054650001701069651001101086653000801097653000801105653000801113653001501121653002401136700001901160773009801179856008601277852000901363655001201372IND60713325420221121060732.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071332542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1095802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIacono, Roberto14aThe wage curve across the wealth distribution  aNAL-light  aThis paper studies the relationship between wages and the unemployment rate across the wealth distribution.

First, the share of unemployed individuals belonging to the bottom decile of the gross wealth distribution is tenfold larger than that belonging to the top decile (34% and 3.2%, respectively). Second, the share of unemployed individuals belonging to the bottom decile of the gross wealth distribution moves in the opposite manner to that of the top decile. Third, the negative slope of the wage curve is confirmed. Fourth, the wage-to-unemployment ratio increases monotonically with gross wealth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aincome and wealth 3apaper 3apopulation 3aunemployment 3aNorway 0aJ30 0aD31 0aE01 0aWage curve 0aWealth distribution1 aRanaldi, Marco0 tEconomics letters.g2020 Nov., v. 196 p.109580-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1095803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04305naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001700154245005700171300001800228500002000246500001500266520255200281592002802833650001902861650001602880650001302896650001802909650001602927650001802943650002002961650001802981650001202999650003003011650001403041650002203055650001103077650002203088650002403110650001503134650002003149650001903169650006403188650001703252650002303269650001403292650001403306650002303320650002403343650002203367650002403389651001803413653002503431700002203456700002303478773009803501852000903599856007103608655001203679IND4398315020221120183656.0170626e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439831502DNAL7 a176011282pmid7 a10.1890/05-18392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFierer, Noah10aToward an ecological classification of soil bacteria  ap. 1354-1364.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aAlthough researchers have begun cataloging the incredible diversity of bacteria found in soil, we are largely unable to interpret this information in an ecological context, including which groups of bacteria are most abundant in different soils and why. With this study, we examined how the abundances of major soil bacterial phyla correspond to the biotic and abiotic characteristics of the soil environment to determine if they can be divided into ecologically meaningful categories. To do this, we collected 71 unique soil samples from a wide range of ecosystems across North America and looked for relationships between soil properties and the relative abundances of six dominant bacterial phyla (Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, α‐Proteobacteria, and the β‐Proteobacteria). Of the soil properties measured, net carbon (C) mineralization rate (an index of C availability) was the best predictor of phylum‐level abundances. There was a negative correlation between Acidobacteria abundance and C mineralization rates (r² = 0.26, P < 0.001), while the abundances of β‐Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were positively correlated with C mineralization rates (r² = 0.35, P < 0.001 and r² = 0.34, P < 0.001, respectively). These patterns were explored further using both experimental and meta‐analytical approaches. We amended soil cores from a specific site with varying levels of sucrose over a 12‐month period to maintain a gradient of elevated C availabilities. This experiment confirmed our survey results: there was a negative relationship between C amendment level and the abundance of Acidobacteria (r² = 0.42, P < 0.01) and a positive relationship for both Bacteroidetes and β‐Proteobacteria (r² = 0.38 and 0.70, respectively; P < 0.01 for each). Further support for a relationship between the relative abundances of these bacterial phyla and C availability was garnered from an analysis of published bacterial clone libraries from bulk and rhizosphere soils. Together our survey, experimental, and meta‐analytical results suggest that certain bacterial phyla can be differentiated into copiotrophic and oligotrophic categories that correspond to the r‐ and K‐selected categories used to describe the ecological attributes of plants and animals. By applying the copiotroph–oligotroph concept to soil microorganisms we can make specific predictions about the ecological attributes of various bacterial taxa and better understand the structure and function of soil bacterial communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3amineralization 3arhizosphere 3ataxonomy 3asoil bacteria 3aOligotropha 3aAcidobacteria 3abioavailability 3ameta-analysis 3asucrose 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3amicrobial ecology 3acarbon 3aspecies diversity 3abeta-Proteobacteria 3aFirmicutes 3apopulation size 3aActinobacteria 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBiodiversity 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aEcosystem 2aPhylogeny 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSucrosexmetabolism 3aNorth America 0aalpha-Proteobacteria1 aBradford, Mark A.1 aJackson, Robert B.0 tEcology.g2007 June, v. 88, no. 6 p.1354-1364dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/05-18393Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03287naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001600274520194600290592002802236650001502264650001302279650001202292650002502304650002102329650001402350650002702364650002002391650001502411650001802426650002202444650001302466650001502479650001802494650001402512650001502526650002002541650002102561700002202582700002102604700001802625773008402643856008102727852000902808655001202817IND60438922720221121054113.0151024e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043892272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-004-1514-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuess, Liliane10aNitrogen isotope ratios and fatty acid composition as indicators of animal diets in belowground systems  ap. 336-346.  aThis study analyses trophic interactions between soil fungi, micro- and mesofauna in microcosm experiments. The trophic shift of ¹⁵N and fatty acids (FAs) was investigated in different food chains, which comprised either two (fungi and grazers) or three (fungi, nematodes and Collembola) levels. Contrary to the widely accepted assumption of ¹⁵N enrichment in trophic cascades the experiments revealed enrichment, depletion or no change in ¹⁵N of consumers compared to their diet. Factors responsible for this pattern were suggested to be: (1) the main metabolic pathway used for N excretion in ammonotelic nematodes to be similar or depleted in the heavier isotope, and uricotelic Collembola mostly enriched in the heavier isotope; (2) a higher shift in ¹⁵N with a high-protein diet (e.g. for predators); (3) compensation due to low-quality food altering the fractionation of ¹⁵N. Analysis of the lipid composition showed phospholipids to be generally unaffected and neutral lipids closely related to the FA pattern of the food source. Dietary routing of FAs into neutral lipids occurred, as evidenced by corresponding frequencies of FAs in host and consumer profiles. Additionally, several FAs were only detected in the grazer when present in the food source. Oleic acid showed a shift over three trophic levels, from fungi to nematodes to Collembola. The assimilation of dietary FAs resulted in a more diverse neutral lipid profile, i.e. animals higher in the food chain contained more individual FAs compared to animals lower in the food chain. The results indicate that monoenoic C18 and monoenoic C20 FAs have the potential to act as tools for the bioindication of feeding strategies in belowground systems. We suggest that primary consumers will have no or only trace amounts of monoenoic C20 acids in their neutral lipid profile, whereas consumers feeding on a eukaryote diet will show a considerably higher frequency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3aNematoda 3aanimals 3abiochemical pathways 3aeukaryotic cells 3aexcretion 3afatty acid composition 3afeeding methods 3afood chain 3afractionation 3ahigh protein diet 3anitrogen 3aoleic acid 3aphospholipids 3apredators 3asoil fungi 3astable isotopes 3atriacylglycerols1 aHäggblom, Max M.1 aLangel, Reinhard1 aScheu, Stefan0 tOecologia.g2004 May, v. 139, no. 3 p.336-346dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-004-1514-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245016200169300001800331500002000349520144100369592002801810650002601838650001701864650001401881650001301895650002301908650002001931650002801951650000901979650001801988650001702006650001402023650001702037650001402054650002102068650001302089650001102102650001202113650001202125650001402137650001302151700002702164700002102191700002502212700002102237700002002258700002202278700002302300700001802323700002002341700002302361773012102384856007802505852000902583655001202592IND60607699620221121032310.0180731e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060769962DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2017004112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPietrowska, Karolina13aAn exploratory LC‐MS‐based metabolomics study reveals differences in aqueous humor composition between diabetic and non‐diabetic patients with cataract  ap. 1233-1240.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCataract is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. Epidemiological studies revealed up to a fivefold increased prevalence of cataracts in diabetic subjects. Metabolomics is nowadays frequently implemented to understand pathophysiological processes responsible for disease occurrence and progression. It has also been used recently to study the metabolic composition of aqueous humor (AH). AH is a transparent fluid which fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. It supplies nutrients and removes metabolic waste from avascular tissues in the eye. The aim of this study was to use metabolomics to compare the AH of diabetic and non‐diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery. Several antioxidants (methyltetrahydrofolic acid, taurine, niacinamide, xanthine, and uric acid) were found decreased (−22 to −61%, p‐value 0.05–0.003) in AH of diabetics. Also amino acids (AA) and derivatives were found decreased (−21 to −36%, p‐value 0.05–0.01) while glycosylated AA increased (+75–98%, p‐value 0.03–0.009) in this group of patients. Metformin was detected in AH of people taking this drug. To our knowledge, this is the first metabolomics study aiming to assess differences in AH composition between diabetic and non‐diabetic patients with cataract. An increased oxidative stress and perturbations in amino acid metabolism in AH may be responsible for earlier cataract onset in diabetic patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid metabolism 3aantioxidants 3ablindness 3acataract 3adisease occurrence 3aelectrophoresis 3aepidemiological studies 3aeyes 3aglycosylation 3ametabolomics 3ametformin 3anicotinamide 3anutrients 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apeople 3asurgery 3ataurine 3auric acid 3axanthine1 aDmuchowska, Diana Anna1 aKrasnicki, Pawel1 aBujalska, Aleksandra1 aSamczuk, Paulina1 aParfieniuk, Ewa1 aKowalczyk, Tomasz1 aWojnar, Malgorzata1 aMariak, Zofia1 aKretowski, Adam1 aCiborowski, Michal0 tElectrophoresis.g2018 May, v. 39, no. 9-10 p.1233-1240dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2017004113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245004500166300001600211520125800227592002801485650002101513650003101534650001601565650001101581650001201592650001501604650002201619650001101641650001601652650000901668650003701677650001701714650002601731650002101757650001901778650001101797650001301808650003201821650000901853700001601862700001901878700002501897700002401922700001701946773009001963856008602053852000902139655001202148IND4464316120221118190532.0141111e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446431612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.02.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaase, Hajo10aImpact of allicin on macrophage activity  ap. 141-148.  aAllicin (diallyl thiosulphinate) is the main antimicrobial constituent of garlic. It has been suggested for use as an antibiotic, or for treating diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Yet, several lines of evidence indicate that allicin affects cells of the immune system. Therefore, this study investigates its impact on macrophages, using the murine Raw 264.7 cell line. Half-maximal allicin toxicity occurred around 130μM in Raw cells, which was comparable to values in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, allicin inhibited nitrogen monoxide production by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), whereas it had no impact on the oxidative burst. Moreover, a reporter gene assay indicated activation of the promoter for the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, although, at higher concentrations than those required for iNOS inhibition. Investigating the molecular basis for the activation by allicin, we found that it triggered zinc, but not calcium signals, and inhibited dephosphorylation of the mitogen activated protein kinase, ERK1/2. Both effects were possibly caused by oxidizing cysteine thiols. In conclusion, whereas allicin might not be a promising antibiotic, it has a potential use for selectively suppressing iNOS expression in macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantibiotics 3aassays 3acalcium 3acell lines 3adephosphorylation 3agarlic 3amacrophages 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aoxidative stress 3areporter genes 3athiols 3atoxicity 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3azinc1 aHieke, Nora1 aPlum, Laura M.1 aGruhlke, Martin C.H.1 aSlusarenko, Alan J.1 aRink, Lothar0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 134, no. 1 p.141-148dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.02.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010400160520107300264592002801337650002701365650002501392650002001417650002401437650001001461650001101471650002301482650002601505650001901531650001401550650002901564650002101593650001501614650000901629650002401638650001301662651001301675700001801688700002601706700001701732700003001749700001901779700001901798773012801817856007401945852000902019655001202028IND60652681320221121105349.0190713e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065268132DNAL7 a10.3390/su101140212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNebeská, Diana10aEffect of Growing <i>Miscanthus x giganteus</i> on Soil Microbial Communities in Post-Military Soil  aGrowing a second generation energetic plant Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) in former military sites appears to be a promising way to use such areas with synergic phytoremediation of contaminants (organic pollutants, potential toxic metals). Effect of Mxg growth on soil microbial communities during a two-year pot experiment with real post-military soil (Sliač, Slovakia) and the effect of potential toxic metal concentration was studied by analyses of microbial activities and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). Year-on-year positive changes in microbial community structure and state were detected (higher ratios of G+/G&minus; bacteria and fungal/bacterial PLFA, and a decrease of stress indicators trans/cis and cy/pre PLFA). Portion of gram-positive bacteria correlated negatively with potential toxic metal concentrations; however, the concentration of potential toxic metals was not identified as the main stress factor&mdash;the access to bioavailable nutrients was more important. Overall, Mxg growth generally exhibited a positive effect on soil microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aMiscanthus giganteus 3abioavailability 3acommunity structure 3afungi 3ametals 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amilitary lands 3anutrients 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3atoxicity 3aSlovakia1 aTrögl, Josef1 aPidlisnyuk, Valentina1 aPopelka, Jan1 aVeronesi Dáňová, Petra1 aUsťak, Sergej1 aHonzík, Roman0 tSustainability.g2018 Nov. 02, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su101140213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011300167300001600280520162900296592002801925650001301953650001901966650002601985650002602011650001302037650002702050650001302077650001602090650001502106700002002121773008402141856008102225852000902306655001202315IND60438922920221121043938.0151024e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043892292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-004-1523-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeegaard, Einar10aClimate change affects the outcome of competitive interactions—an application of principal response curves  ap. 459-466.  aIt has been hypothesised that climate change may affect vegetation by changing the outcome of competitive interactions. We use a space-for-time approach to evaluate this hypothesis in the context of alpine time-of-snowmelt gradients. Principal response curves, a multivariate repeated-measurement analysis technique, are used to analyse for compositional differences in local ridge-to-snowbed gradients among 100 m altitudinal bands from 1,140 to 1,550 m a.s.l., corresponding to a temperature gradient of 2.5°C (local lapse rate is 0.6°C). The interaction between time-of-snowmelt and altitude is strongly significant statistically, indicating that the altitudinal gradient cannot be explained simply by the physiological responses of the species, but that there are also changes in the outcome of competitive interactions. At higher altitudes, there is a decrease in the time-of-snowmelt ranges of species which have intermediate times-of-snowmelt optima, whereas snowbed (chinophilous) species have wider time-of-snowmelt ranges. As snowbed species can survive, grow and reproduce at very early snow-free sites at high altitudes, the most likely explanation for their absence from all but the latest time-of-snowmelt habitats at lower altitudes is competitive exclusion by more vigorous lee-side species. This suggests that with future climate change snowbed species will experience, in addition to habitat fragmentation and reduced size of habitats due to increased temperature and snowmelt, an indirect effect due to competitive exclusion from late-snowmelt sites by species that have their optima outside snowbeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3acompetitive exclusion 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aphysiological response 3asnowmelt 3atemperature 3avegetation1 aVandvik, Vigdis0 tOecologia.g2004 May, v. 139, no. 3 p.459-466dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-004-1523-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001300169245012300182300001800305520106300323592002801386650002701414650001201441650001501453650002001468650001401488650005401502650003001556650003201586650003801618650001501656650002101671650003101692650002001723650007401743650001901817700001601836700001301852700001201865773009701877856008601974852000902060655001202069IND4447399020221119103414.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444739902DNAL7 a210302492pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Lin12aA pilot study on the regeneration of ferrous chelate complex in NOₓ scrubber solution by a biofilm electrode reactor  ap. 2605-2609.  aA chemical absorption–biological reduction integrated process has been proposed for the removal of nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) from flue gases. In this study, we report a new approach using biofilm electrode reactor (BER) to regenerate Fe(II)EDTA via simultaneously reducing Fe(II)EDTA–NO and Fe(III)EDTA in NOₓ scrubber solution. Biofilm formed on the surface of the cathode was confirmed by Environmental Scan Electro-Microscope. Experimental results demonstrated that it was effective and feasible to utilize the BER to promote the reduction of Fe(II)EDTA–NO and Fe(III)EDTA simultaneously. The reduction efficiency of Fe(II)EDTA–NO and Fe(III)EDTA was up to 85% and 78%, respectively when the BER was continuously operated with electricity current at 30mA. The absence of electricity induced an immediate decrease in reduction efficiency, indicating that the bio-regeneration of ferrous chelate complex was electrochemically accelerated. The present approach is considered advantageous for the enhanced bio-reduction in the NOₓ scrubber solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3abiofilm 3aelectrodes 3anitrogen oxides 3ascrubbers 2aBacteria, Aerobicxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aChelating Agentsxchemistry 2aElectrochemistryxinstrumentation 2aElectrodes 2aEquipment Design 2aEquipment Failure Analysis 2aIronxchemistry 2aNitric Oxidexchemistryxisolation & purificationxradiation effects. 2aPilot Projects1 aMi, Xu-Hong1 aZhou, Ya1 aLi, Wei0 tBioresource technology.g2011 Feb., v. 102, no. 3 p.2605-2609dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01886naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008700171300001600258520066000274592002800934650001200962650001900974650001100993650001201004650001001016650002101026650001701047650001101064650002301075650001201098651001401110653002001124653002501144653002301169653002301192653001401215653001601229653001301245773010401258856008101362852000901443655001201452IND60622356120221117185230.0181124e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062235612DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683605hl832rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtanassova, Juliana10aPalaeoecological setting of the western Black Sea area during the last 15000 years  ap. 576-584.  aAnalysis of pollen, dinoflagellate cysts and lithology was carried out on ten cores from the western deep Black Sea and combined with radiocarbon dating to reconstruct the vegetation, climate and palaeoecological conditions.

The fixed- or random-effect model was selected based on heterogeneity. Meta-regression was used to explore potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Begg’s test. The dose–response relationship was assessed by a restricted cubic spline model. Relevant studies were identified by a search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library to May 2014, without language restrictions. Studies involved samples of people of all ages. Dietary vitamin E intake, dietary and supplemental vitamin E intake, and high serum tocopherol levels were significantly associated with decreased risk of ARC, the pooled relative risk was 0·73 (95 % CI 0·58, 0·92), 0·86 (95 % CI 0·75, 0·99) and 0·77 (95 % CI 0·66, 0·91), respectively. Supplemental vitamin E intake was non-significantly associated with ARC risk (relative risk=0·92; 95 % CI 0·78, 1·07). The findings from dose–response analysis showed evidence of a non-linear association between dietary vitamin E intake and ARC. The risk of ARC decreased with dietary vitamin E intake from 7 mg/d (relative risk=0·94; 95 % CI 0·90, 0·97). The findings of the meta-analysis indicated that dietary vitamin E intake, dietary and supplemental vitamin E intake, and high level of serum tocopherol might be significantly associated with reduced ARC risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acataract 3adose response 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3arelative risk 3arisk reduction 3avitamin E 3avitamin supplements 0aVitamin E 0aSerum tocopherol 0aAge-related cataract 0aMeta-analysis1 aJiang, Wenjie1 aXie, Zhutian1 aWu, Wenlong1 aZhang, Dongfeng0 tPublic health nutrition.g2015 Oct., v. 18, no. 15 p.2804-2814dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800140031153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02055naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013300164300001800297520092800315592002801243650002201271650001201293650001701305650001201322650001101334650001301345650002001358700002601378700002301404700002901427700001801456700001901474773010501493856008601598852000901684655001201693IND60578105620180731000000.0170811e20151013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057810562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b016752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVis, Mark10aEffects of Electric Charge on the Interfacial Tension between Coexisting Aqueous Mixtures of Polyelectrolyte and Neutral Polymer  ap. 7335-7345.  aUpon demixing, an aqueous solution of a polyelectrolyte and an incompatible neutral polymer yields two phases separated by an interface with an ultralow tension. Here, both in theory and experiment, we study this interfacial tension in detail: how it scales with the concentrations of the polymers in the two phases and how it is affected by the interfacial difference in the electrical potential. Experiments are performed on an aqueous model system of uncharged dextran and charged nongelling gelatin. The experimental tension scales to the power ∼3 with the tie-line length in the phase diagram of demixing, in agreement with mean-field theory where space is filled with a binary mixture of polymer blobs. The interfacial electrical potential difference is experimentally found to decrease the interfacial tension in a way that is consistent with Poisson–Boltzmann theory inspired from Frenkel and Verwey–Overbeek.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3adextran 3aelectrolytes 3agelatin 3amodels 3apolymers 3asurface tension1 aPeters, Vincent F.

Here, the WO₃/BiVO₄ interface is passivated with a sulfur-modified Bi₂O₃ interfacial layer with a staggered band edge alignment to facilitate charge transfer and lifetime. Additionally, BiVO₄ was co-doped with Ga³⁺ at Bi³⁺ sites and W⁶⁺ at V⁵⁺ sites (i.e., (Ga,W):BiVO₄) to improve the light absorption and photogenerated charge carrier concentration. The optimized WO₃/S:Bi₂O₃/(Ga,W):BiVO₄ photoanode exhibited a photocurrent density of 4.0 ± 0.2 mA cm⁻² compared to WO₃/(Ga,W):BiVO₄ with 2.8 ± 0.12 mA cm⁻² at 1.23 VRHE in K₂HPO₄ under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopic analysis of the WO₃/S:Bi₂O₃/(Ga,W):BiVO₄ electrode validated the enhanced interfacial charge transfer kinetics. In operando femto- and nano-second transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed the presence of long-lived photogenerated charge carriers and revealed lower recombination initially due to rapid charge separation of WO₃/S:Bi₂O₃/(Ga,W):BiVO₄. The distribution and role of sulfur was further investigated using EDAX, XPS and TOF-SIMS depth profiling. Finally, a Co-Pi co-catalyst layer was added to achieve a photocurrent of 5.1 ± 0.25 mA cm⁻² and corresponding H₂ generation rate of 67.3 μmol h⁻¹ cm⁻² for the WO₃/S:Bi₂O₃/(Ga,W):BiVO₄/Co-Pi photoanode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3agallium 3alighting 3aphotoluminescence 3aspectral analysis 3asulfur1 aYoung, James L.1 aJohnson, Justin C.1 aMcGott, Deborah L.1 aGu, Hengfei1 aGarfunkel, Eric1 aKannan, Arunachala M.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 July 27, v. 9, no. 29 p.16137-16149dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta03786b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245005900179300001800238520119700256592002801453650002301481650001501504650002301519650002301542650001301565700001601578700002001594773010601614856008601720852000901806655001201815IND60578099620221120170312.0170811e20150908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057809962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b012412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSethuraman, Vaidyanathan10aEntanglements in Lamellar Phases of Diblock Copolymers  ap. 6321-6328.  aUsing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in conjunction with topological analysis algorithms, we investigate the changes, if any, in entanglement lengths of flexible polymers in ordered lamellar phases of diblock copolymers. Our analysis reveals a reduction in the average entanglement spacing of the polymers with increasing degree of segregation between the blocks. Furthermore, the results of the topological analysis algorithms indicate an inhomogeneous distribution of entanglement junctions arising from the segregated morphology of the block copolymer. To understand such trends, we invoke the packing arguments proposed by Kavassalis and Noolandi in combination with the framework of polymer self-consistent-field theory (SCFT) and Monte Carlo simulations. Such an analysis reveals qualitatively similar characteristics as our MD results for both the average entanglement spacing and the inhomogeneities in entanglements. Together, our results provide evidence for the changes in entanglement features arising from compositional inhomogeneities and suggest that the ideas embodied in packing arguments may provide a simple means to semiquantitatively characterize such modifications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aalgorithms 3acomposite polymers 3amolecular dynamics 3atopology1 aKipp, Dylan1 aGanesan, Venkat0 tMacromolecules.g2015 Sept. 08, v. 48, no. 17 p.6321-6328dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b012413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245013300206300001800339500001500357520200300372592002802375650002102403650001902424650001802443650002702461650003702488650002902525650001702554650001102571650002502582650001202607650001902619650001102638650002302649650001102672650001302683650002202696650001402718651001002732653001502742653002102757653001902778653001802797653002302815653003402838700005702872700002002929700001702949700001502966700001302981773012102994856008803115852000903203655001203212IND60609865420221117020341.0190705e20181210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060986542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lilai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4697-124610aInvestigating the comparative roles of multi-source factors influencing urban residents' transportation greenhouse gas emissions  ap. 1336-1345.  a2019-12-06  aThe current growth in transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been largely attributed to rapid urbanization, particularly for cities in developing countries. Studies on the contributing factors and analysis of the mechanisms by which they influence transportation GHG emissions could aid in better achievement of mitigation goals. Yet, comparative contributions of the different sources of these drivers have not been well quantitatively investigated. This study employs a wide range of indicators across urban form, socio-demographic characteristics and residents' travel attitudes. By integrating a questionnaire-based survey of 1125 household in 45 communities in Xiamen City, China, land-use-based urban form quantification, inventory-based GHG calculation, a path analysis model is built to identify the interactions among these indicators and investigate their comparative direct and indirect effects on residents' local transportation GHG emissions. It was found that many variables interactively influence the transportation GHG emissions, producing considerable effects, both direct and indirect. Urban form plays a leading role in transportation GHG emissions, in comparison to socio-demographics and travel attitudes. Population density, land use mix, road connectivity and bus accessibility, in urban form; education, in socio-demographics; and willingness to ride the bus, in travel attitudes; were found to have significant positive effects on reducing residents' local transportation GHG emissions. Urban density—characterized by population density here—is the primary influential factor, due not only to its large direct effects, but also to its wide indirect effects through its influence on other variables. The results of this study may help policy makers consider how they can effectively utilize these key indicators to formulate mitigations in the transportation sector, and particularly, how to design low-carbon-friendly urban forms, in urban planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gases 3aquestionnaires 3apath analysis 3aattitudes and opinions 3asociodemographic characteristics 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aurbanization 3amodels 3adeveloping countries 3asurveys 3aurban planning 3atravel 3apopulation density 3acities 3aland use 3aissues and policy 3aeducation 3aChina 0aUrban form 0aTravel attitudes 0atransportation 0aPath analysis 0aSocio-demographics 0aresidents' transportation GHG1 aCui, Shenghui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1290-32341 aTang, Jianxiong1 aYan, Xiaomei1 aHuang, Wei1 aLv, Hong0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Dec. 10, v. 644 p.1336-1345dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.07.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015900171300001800330520096300348592002801311650001701339650001301356650001601369650001401385650002501399650001601424650001301440650002301453650002701476650000901503650001801512650000901530650001501539650001001554650001701564653001601581653001301597653001601610653000901626653001001635700001601645773013101661856008501792852000901877655001201886IND60458471620221122114123.0151106e20151113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045847162DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2015.10892612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSondhia, Shobha10aBioefficacy and Determination of Terminal Residues of a Herbicide Anilofos in Field Soil and Plants Following an Application to the Transplanted Rice Crop  ap. 2576-2584.  aAlthough herbicides provide effective weed control, some herbicides may pose serious health and environmental threats. Thus the bioefficacy and the persistence of three formulations of a herbicide, anilofos [GR (granules), W/O (water in oil emulsion), and EC (emulsifier concentration)], at 300, 450, and 600 g ha ⁻¹ as pre-emergent applications were evaluated in transplanted rice (Oryza sativa L.). All of the formulations enhanced the rice grain yield by 50% over weedy check and the grain yield was greatest in the 30% EC treatment applied at a 450 g ha ⁻¹ rate. Phytotoxic symptoms of anilofos were not observed with any of these formulations on the transplanted rice. Terminal residues of anilofos in the soil and mature rice plants were below the maximum residues limit (MRL, 0.05 mg/kg) in the soil, grains, and straw treated with the various formulations of anilofos. Study showed fast degradation of anilofos in the soil and rice plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aanilofos 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3aenvironmental health 3agrain yield 3agranules 3aherbicide residues 3amaximum residue limits 3aoils 3aphytotoxicity 3arice 3arice soils 3astraw 3aweed control 0aBioefficacy 0aHPLC-DAD 0arice grains 0asoil 0astraw1 aDixit, Anil0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2015 Nov. 13, v. 46, no. 20 p.2576-2584dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2015.10892613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245013800161506011700299506007600416520128600492592002801778506003701806650001201843650001701855650001201872650001001884650001401894650001101908650001401919650001001933650002301943650001801966650002701984653002402011653003002035653001202065653001102077653002302088700001802111700001702129700001802146700001602164700001402180700001702194700001702211700001402228773012602242856008202368852000902450655001202459IND60787309420221207051656.0220906e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078730942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Dan12aA developed variable pressure-assisted salting process: Improving the textural, flavor, and sensory attributes in roasted duck breast  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study developed variable pressure salting (VPS) equipment to accelerate salting efficiency and improve the sensory qualities of roasted duck breast. It evaluated the effect of this VPS technology on the textural and flavor changes of roasted duck breast at different roasting stages (0–50 min) and examined the sensory attributes of the final products obtained after VPS and control treatment. The results indicated that the VPS treatment improved the water-holding capacity, tenderness, and salt concentration in roasted duck breast. After 50 min, the moisture content, immobilized moisture, and salt concentrations of the VPS samples increased by 3.58%, 5.69%, and 62.33%, respectively, compared with the control samples (static wet salting, SWS), while the shear force decreased by 45.63%. PLS analysis showed that hexanal, decanal, (E)-2-decenal, undecanal and benzaldehyde represented the main flavor compounds in the VPS samples, while (E, E)-2,4-decadienal, (E)-2-octen-1-ol, and (E)-2-octenal dominated in the SWS samples. Furthermore, VPS treatment enriched the fruity, almond, and orange flavor of the roasted duck breast. The sensory scores of aroma, tenderness, juiciness, and overall acceptance of the VPS samples were distinctly higher than that of SWS ones.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalmonds 3abenzaldehyde 3abreasts 3aducks 3aequipment 3aflavor 3ajuiciness 3aodors 3asalt concentration 3awater content 3awater holding capacity 0aRoasted duck breast 0aVariable pressure salting 0aTexture 0aFlavor 0aSensory attributes1 aZhang, Dequan1 aChen, Ruixia1 aYang, Xiaoyue1 aShi, Haonan1 aLiu, Huan1 aWang, Zhenyu1 aLu, Lianshui1 aHui, Teng0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 167 p.113800-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2022.1138003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005300152245011800205300001600323520150000339592002801839650002601867650002601893650001201919650001401931650001601945650001101961650001301972650002001985650001402005650001902019650001402038650001102052650001302063653001602076653001702092653001402109653002202123653001302145653001202158700005702170773011502227856008702342852000902429655001202438IND60622816920221121052951.0190202e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062281692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1442-205810aSynergistic enhancement of product quality through fast co-pyrolysis of acid pretreated biomass and waste plastic  ap. 629-638.  aWith the increasing global production of plastics, co-pyrolyzing biomass and waste plastics has emerged as a promising way to improve the quality of pyrolysis products. In the present study, the possibility of enhancing the synergistic interactions between biomass and plastics was explored by co-pyrolyzing acid pretreated corn stover (CS) and polyethylene (PE) in the presence or absence of zeolite catalyst. During non-catalytic co-pyrolysis, the use of acid-pretreated CS was found to synergistically reduce char yield and increase both the yield and quality of CS-derived pyrolysis oil. When acid-pretreated CS was catalytically co-pyrolyzed with PE, the yields of aromatic hydrocarbons and alkene increased whereas the yields of solid residue and carbon oxides decreased to a much greater extent than co-pyrolyzing raw CS and PE. The synergistic effect was least significant with raw CS and PE, suggesting the presence of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) in the biomass hinder the occurrence of synergy. The positive synergy was strongest with acid-infused CS and PE. When acid-infused CS was co-pyrolyzed with PE, not only did the yield of phenolic monomers increase, but levoglucosan yield also increased significantly. During catalytic co-pyrolysis, acid-infused CS and PE also produced the highest yield of aromatic hydrocarbon and lowest yield of solid residue. This study also showed that co-pyrolysis with PE mitigates char agglomeration associated with pyrolyzing CS alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline earth metals 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acorn stover 3aoxides 3aplastics 3aproduct quality 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis oils 3asynergism 3awastes 3azeolites 0aCorn stover 0aPolyethylene 0aPyrolysis 0aAcid pretreatment 0aCatalyst 0aZeolite1 aBai, Xianglan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6849-26870 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 May 15, v. 164 p.629-638dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015400163300002000317520164400337592002801981650002702009650002302036650002602059650002202085650001502107650001302122650001202135650001202147650001102159650002302170650000902193650002402202650001402226650001402240650002202254650001302276650001502289650001302304650002202317651001002339700001702349700001902366700002002385700001502405700001602420700001302436773014902449856008102598852000902679655001202688IND60574495920221121041625.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057449592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9232-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xuehua10aDiversity and activity patterns of sympatric animals among four types of forest habitat in Guanyinshan Nature Reserve in the Qinling Mountains, China  ap. 16465-16477.  aEnvironmental heterogeneity contributes to various habitats and may influence the diversity and activity patterns of wildlife among habitats. We used camera traps to assess wildlife habitat use in Guanyinshan Nature Reserve from 2009 to 2012. We focused on four types of habitat including open areas with gentle slope (<15°) (Type1), low elevation areas (about 1500–1700 m) with high bamboo coverage (Type2), high elevation areas (about 2100–2300 m) with high canopy coverage (Type3), and wildlife migration passages (Type4). We analyzed the differences in species richness, relative abundance index (RAI), species diversity, and animals’ activity pattern among habitats. Total six species were analyzed on activity pattern, which are Takin (Budorcas taxicolor), tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral), wild boar (Sus scrofa), golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus), and porcupine (Hystrix hodgsoni). The results are (1) that there were significant differences in richness and RAIₜ among habitats; (2) Type4 habitat had the highest richness and RAIₜ while Type2 had the highest species diversity; giant pandas were found in these two habitats; (3) there were significant differences in species’ activity during daytime and nighttime; and (4) differences appeared in habitat preference of the most abundant species. Takin and tufted deer preferred Type1, Himalayan goral preferred Type2, and golden pheasant preferred Type3. Type4 habitat was used by most animals. All these revealed that habitat heterogeneity plays an important role in species diversity and the importance for conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3aBudorcas taxicolor 3aElaphodus cephalophus 3aNaemorhedus goral 3aSus scrofa 3aaltitude 3abamboos 3acameras 3acanopy 3aconservation areas 3adeer 3ahabitat preferences 3amountains 3apheasants 3aspecies diversity 3asympatry 3awild boars 3awildlife 3awildlife habitats 3aChina1 aWu, Pengfeng1 aShao, Xiaoming1 aSonger, Melissa1 aCai, Qiong1 aHe, Xiangbo1 aZhu, Yun0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 July, v. 24, no. 19 p.16465-16477dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9232-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03876naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010500171520225600276592002802532650002702560650001102587650001302598650001602611650003002627650001302657650001802670650001102688650001202699650001802711650001302729650000902742650001502751650001502766653001502781653001702796653002502813653001402838653001502852653001902867653002002886700001902906700002102925700001702946700002802963700002002991700002003011700001703031700001903048700001703067700002303084773009703107856008503204852000903289655001203298IND60761054320221122044606.0220205e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076105432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2021.1180082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoutnik, Vera S.10aMicroplastics retained in stormwater control measures: Where do they come from and where do they go?  aStormwater control measures (SCM) can remove and accumulate microplastics and may serve as a long-term source of microplastics for groundwater pollution because of their potential for downward mobility in subsurface. Furthermore, the number of microplastics accumulated in SCM may have been underestimated as the calculation typically only accounts for microplastics accumulated via episodic stormwater loading and ignores microplastic accumuation via continuous atmospheric deposition. To evaluate the source pathways of accumulated microplastics and their potential for downward mobility to groundwater, we analyzed spatial distributions of microplastics above ground on the canopy around SCM and below ground in the subsurface in and outside the boundaries of fourteen SCM in Los Angeles. Using an exponential model, we link subsurface retardation of microplastics to the median particle size of soil (D₅₀) and land use. Despite receiving significantly more stormwater, microplastic concentrations in SCM at surface depth or subsurface depth were not significantly different from the concentration at the same depth outside the SCM. Similar concentration in and outside of SCM indicates that stormwater is not the sole source of microplastics accumulated in SCM. The high concentration of microplastics on leaves of vegetation in SCM confirms that the contribution of atmospheric deposition is significant. Within and outside the SCM boundary, microplastics are removed within the top 5 cm of the subsurface, and their concentration decreases exponentially with depth, indicating limited potential for groundwater pollution from the microplastics accumulated in SCM. Outside the SCM boundary, the subsurface retardation coefficient decreases with increases in D₅₀, indicating straining of microplastics as the dominant removal mechanism. Inside the boundary of SCM, however, the retardation coefficient was independent of D₅₀, implying that microplastics could have either moved deeper into the filter layer in SCM or that compost, mulch, or organic amendments used in the filter media were pre-contaminated with microplastics. Overall, these results provide insights on microplastics source, accumulation, and downward mobility in SCM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3acanopy 3acomposts 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aland use 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3amulches 3aparticle size 3aresearch 3asoil 3astormwater 3avegetation 0aSubsurface 0aUrban runoff 0aGreen infrastructure 0aStraining 0aBiofilters 0aDry deposition 0aCanopy trapping1 aLeonard, Jamie1 aGlasman, Joel B.1 aBrar, Jaslyn1 aKoydemir, Hatice Ceylan1 aNovoselov, Anna1 aBertel, Rebecca1 aTseng, Derek1 aOzcan, Aydogan1 aRavi, Sujith1 aMohanty, Sanjay K.0 tWater research.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 210 p.118008-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1180083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245020200152300001600354500002000370520135100390592002801741650002501769650001901794650002501813650001701838650002101855650001301876650000901889650001001898650002701908650001901935650001301954650001101967650002501978700001902003700001802022700001202040700001302052700001402065700001702079773012102096856007302217852000902290655001202299IND60587797120221120203356.0180102e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058779712DNAL7 a10.1111/anu.124222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Y.10aEffects of dietary Rhodiola rosea on growth, body composition and antioxidant capacity of white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei under normal conditions and combined stress of low‐salinity and nitrite  ap. 548-559.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn 8‐week feeding trial followed by an acute combined stress of low‐salinity and nitrite were designed to examine the effects of Rhodiola rosea on growth, body composition and antioxidant capacity of the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Shrimp (3.60 ± 0.03 g) were randomly allocated to 4 groups, with 3 replicates per group and 30 shrimp per replicate. The dietary groups were given as follows: control and diets containing R. rosea (300, 1000 and 3000 mg kg⁻¹). Antioxidant capacity including total antioxidant status (TAS), activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px), catalase (CAT) as well as gene expression of GSH‐Px and CAT in hepatopancreas of shrimp was analysed at the end of feeding trial and again during the combined stress. The results showed that supplemental R. rosea had no significant impacts on growth and whole body composition of shrimp. There was significant effect of R. rosea supplementation dose and times on the antioxidant status parameters of L. vannamei. R. rosea (3000 mg kg⁻¹) significantly improved the resistance of L. vannamei against the combined stress of low‐salinity and nitrite, as indicated by the significant higher activities of TAS, GSH‐Px and CAT (P < 0.05), as well as by the higher transcript levels of GPx and CAT gene (P < 0.05).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aRhodiola rosea 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abody composition 3acatalase 3adiet 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahepatopancreas 3anitrites 3ashrimp 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aLiang, J.‐P.1 aDuan, Y.‐F.1 aNiu, J.1 aWang, J.1 aHuang, Z.1 aLin, H.‐Z.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2017 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.548-559dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.124223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001600293520183000309592002802139650002102167650001702188650001402205650001202219650001902231650001202250650001202262650001302274650001502287650001802302650001102320650002102331650002102352650001002373650001102383650001602394650001902410651001202429651002802441700002102469700002202490773011102512856008102623852000902704655001202713IND60572597920221120035450.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057259792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-017-0499-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlindow, Irmgard10aManagement regimes in a coastal heathland –effects on vegetation, nutrient balance, biodiversity and gain of bioenergy  ap. 273-288.  aLittle is known about nutrient balances and the effect of different management measures on coastal heathlands, which differ in habitat structure and nutrient deposition from the more well-investigated inland heaths. This investigation aims at documenting management effects in a coastal heathland on the island of Hiddensee, northeastern Germany, and to recommend suitable management measures for this heathland type. Soil and vegetation samples were taken, and the development of vegetation was monitored after a number of restoration measures such as sod-cutting, choppering, Heirieten (= manual removal of over-aged Calluna vulgaris) and mowing. Effects from grazing were estimated based on own and literature data, and the possible effect of burning was calculated. Finally, the potential gain of renewable energy was considered. A positive correlation between mineral soil nutrient concentrations and share of grasses in the vegetation indicates increasing grass-encroachment due to eutrophication. Areas with heavily grass-encroached, overaged Calluna developed a vegetation poor in grass cover and with dense, healthy Calluna after sod-cutting, choppering, mowing and Heirieten. Nutrient balance calculations indicate that high-intensity measures (sod-cutting, choppering, Heirieten) counteract 450, 250 and 90 years of nutrient deposition, respectively. A combination of low-intensity measures such as mowing, sheep grazing, burning and regular shrub clearance is recommended to preserve a high biodiversity, to rejuvenate Calluna vegetation and to achieve a balanced nutrient budget in Baltic coastal heathlands, where atmospheric nutrient deposition is far lower than in western Europe. Contrary to inland heathlands, mowing seems to be sufficient even for an initial restoration of heavily grass-encroached areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalluna vulgaris 3abiodiversity 3abioenergy 3aburning 3aeutrophication 3agrasses 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3aheathlands 3amineral soils 3amowing 3anutrient balance 3anutrient content 3asheep 3ashrubs 3asod cutting 3asoil nutrients 3aGermany 3aWestern European region1 aGauger, Dorothea1 aAhlhaus, Matthias0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2017 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.273-288dSpringer Netherlandsx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-017-0499-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014400165300001200309520132900321592002801650650001001678650001301688650002701701650002901728650002001757650001501777650001801792650001901810650002101829650001401850650001001864700001701874700001901891700001401910773012501924856008102049852000902130655001202139IND60556234520221119053311.0161103e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055623452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-016-3118-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Changyong10aPretreatment of Petrochemical Secondary Effluent by Micro-flocculation and Dynasand Filtration: Performance and DOM Removal Characteristics  ap. 415.  aA pilot scale micro-flocculation and dynasand filtration process was used to pretreat the petrochemical secondary effluent. The suspended solids (SS) and the dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal characteristics were investigated. The results showed that the optimized poly aluminum ferric chloride (PFAC) dosage was 10 mg/L during the experiment. In this dosage period, the SS removal rate was as high as 50.58 % with the effluent SS of 15.38 mg/L when the influent SS was 33.53 mg/L. The COD removal rate was 10.42 %. The DOM fraction with large apparent molecular weight (MW) higher than 3 k was removed more significantly than that of small molecular DOM. Resin fractionation showed that the micro-flocculation and dynasand filtration process could preferentially remove the hydrophobic neutrals (HON) and hydrophobic acids (HOA) of DOM, so it could be suitable as the pretreatment unit. When oxidized by catalytic ozonation, the ozone consumption of COD removal for filtrated effluent was 1.2 g-O₃/g-COD while it was 1.6 g-O₃/g-COD for untreated petrochemical secondary effluent, saving 25 % of ozone consumption. The micro-flocculation and dynasand filtration is a suitable pretreatment process for petrochemical secondary effluent, especially when the subsequent unit is the catalytic ozonation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aaluminum 3achemical oxygen demand 3adissolved organic matter 3aferric chloride 3afiltration 3afractionation 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular weight 3aozonation 3aozone1 aWang, Yaning1 aZhou, Baoying,1 aZhu, Chen0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2016 Nov., v. 227, no. 11 p.415-415dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-3118-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011700172300001800289520144400307592002801751650002701779650002001806650002501826650002101851650002001872650001201892650002101904650002001925650001601945650002301961650001101984650000901995650001502004650002402019650001502043650000902058650001202067653001702079653002302096653002002119700002002139700001802159700001802177700002002195700002202215700002102237700002102258773013102279856008502410852000902495655001202504IND60458471720221122090050.0151106e20151113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045847172DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2015.10892622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamtahal, Gideon10aPrediction of Soil Cadmium Bioavailability to Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) using Single-Step Extraction Procedures  ap. 2585-2594.  aIn this study, complexation extractants ammonium bicarbonate diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (AB-DTPA), diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and mild cation-exchange extractants calcium chloride (CaCl ₂) and ammonium nitrate (NH ₄NO ₃) were used to evaluate the bioavailability of soil cadmium (Cd) to cacao in the field. Among the five extractants, the extractable Cd generally followed the order EDTA > DTPA > AB-DTPA > CaCl ₂ > NH ₄NO ₃. Correlation analysis was done between the extractable Cd in soil and total Cd content of cacao tissues (nibs, shells, leaves, and pods). The Cd extracted by CaCl ₂ and NH ₄NO ₃ was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with some of the tissues but their Pearson correlation coefficients were weak. In contrast, extractants AB-DTPA, DTPA, and EDTA showed stronger, significant correlations to the Cd concentration in all four tissues. Overall, regression analysis demonstrated that AB-DTPA, DTPA, or EDTA can be used to predict bioavailable Cd in soils for cacao. Of these, AB-DTPA and DTPA both showed the strongest correlations compared to EDTA. However, the ease of preparation and the superior shelf-life of DTPA over AB-DPTA make it the preferred reagent for Cd bioavailability extractions from cacao soils and is currently being used to develop cost-effective soil treatments to reduce bioavailable Cd to cacao plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aTheobroma cacao 3aammonium bicarbonate 3aammonium nitrate 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acalcium chloride 3acation exchange 3acorrelation 3acost effectiveness 3aleaves 3apods 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3ashelf life 3asoil 3atissues 0aHeavy metals 0asoil contamination 0atropical fruits1 aChang Yen, Ivan1 aAhmad, Nazeer1 aBekele, Isaac1 aBekele, Frances1 aMaharaj, Kamaldeo1 aWilson, Lawrence1 aHarrynanan, Lisa0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2015 Nov. 13, v. 46, no. 20 p.2585-2594dTaylor & Francisx1532-24167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2015.10892623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002500164245011300189300001600302520181800318592002802136650002402164650001802188650001002206650001302216650001902229650002002248650001002268650001402278650001502292650001602307700002102323700001902344700002002363700001602383773011102399856007902510852000902589655001202598IND50073217420221116175650.0150206e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007321742DNAL7 a241173842pmid7 a10.1111/1365-2656.121542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnowles, Sarah C. L.10aDispersal in a patchy landscape reveals contrasting determinants of infection in a wild avian malaria system  ap. 429-439.  aUnderstanding exactly when, where and how hosts become infected with parasites is critical to understanding host–parasite co‐evolution in natural populations. However, for host–parasite systems in which hosts or parasites are mobile, for example in vector‐borne diseases, the spatial location of infection and the relative importance of parasite exposure at successive host life‐history stages are often uncertain. Here, using a 6‐year longitudinal data set from a spatially referenced population of blue tits, we test the extent to which infection by avian malaria parasites is determined by conditions experienced at natal or breeding sites, as well as by postnatal dispersal between the two. We show that the location and timing of infection differs markedly between two sympatric malaria parasite species. For one species (Plasmodium circumflexum), our analyses indicate that infection occurs after birds have settled on breeding territories, and because the distribution of this parasite is temporally stable across years, hosts born in malarious areas could in principle alter their exposure and potentially avoid infection through postnatal dispersal. Conversely, the spatial distribution of another parasite species (Plasmodium relictum) is unpredictable and infection probability is positively associated with postnatal dispersal distance, potentially indicating that infection occurs during this major dispersal event. These findings suggest that hosts in this population may be subject to divergent selection pressures from these two parasites, potentially acting at different life‐history stages. Because this implies parasite species‐specific predictions for many coevolutionary processes, they also illustrate the complexity of predicting such processes in multi‐parasite systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium relictum 3aavian malaria 3abirds 3abreeding 3abreeding sites 3adata collection 3ahosts 3aparasites 3aprediction 3aprobability1 aWood, Matthew J.1 aAlves, Ricardo1 aSheldon, Ben C.1 aBoots, Mike0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2014 Mar., v. 83, no. 2 p.429-439dBlackwell Scientific Publ.x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.121543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002900113040001800142100001600160245012800176300001800304520093600322592002801258650000901286650002401295650001201319650004301331650000901374650002701383650002401410650005201434650002301486650002701509650003701536650002801573650002601601650002601627653002401653653002201677653002001699653001601719700001701735700001501752700001801767700001901785700001801804700001901822773011701841856007501958852000902033655001202042IND60114937720221122061039.0141124e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011493772DNAL7 a230280062pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.12001512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Hai-Lun10aIsolation and characterization of polymorphic microsatellite loci in the endangered plant Dipteronia sinensis (Sapindaceae)  ap. e425-e427.  a• Premise of the study: Microsatellite markers were developed in Dipteronia sinensis to investigate the population genetics of this endangered plant.• Methods and Results: Using the Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences COntaining repeats (FIASCO) protocol, 19 microsatellite loci were developed in D. sinensis and evaluated for their variability in 29 samples from a natural population. For the 15 polymorphic loci, the number of alleles ranged from nine to 33, while the observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.3793 to 0.9655 and from 0.6029 to 0.9609, respectively.

Growth performance was not affected by different dietary CHO:L ratios (P > 0.05); however, the viscerosomatic index, the intraperitoneal fat, whole‐body lipid, energy and n‐3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids levels increased with decreasing dietary CHO:L ratios (P < 0.05). Fish fed with 1.8 CHO:L diet had the lowest apparent digestibility coefficients of protein and lipid, as well as the lowest plasma haemolytic and lysozyme activities (P < 0.05). Red blood cell counts and plasma glucose levels were higher in fish fed with 1.1 and 1.8 CHO:L ratio diets than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Plasma alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase, as well as the level of lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity in the liver and plasma increased as dietary CHO:L ratios decreased (P < 0.05). The results of the current study indicated that the diets with CHO:L ratios between 0.6 and 1.1 are optimal for silvery‐black porgy, whereas higher ratios may result in hyperglycaemia and immune suppression, and lower CHO:L ratios may lead to oxidative stress and liver dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSparidentex hasta 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood glucose 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aenergy 3agrowth performance 3ahyperglycemia 3ajuveniles 3alipid peroxidation 3aliver 3along chain polyunsaturated fatty acids 3alysozyme 3aoxidative stress 3aporgy1 aYavari, V.1 aMarammazi, J.G.1 aAgh, N.1 aGisbert, E.0 tAquaculture nutrition.g2017 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.470-483dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl56078x1353-57737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/anu.124153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245009800159300001600257520194500273592002802218650001502246650001902261650001602280650001202296650002002308650001702328650002702345650001702372650001002389650001202399650000902411650003702420650001202457650001902469650002902488700001502517700001702532700001702549700001802566773012902584856007502713852000902788655001202797IND60677624620221122020229.0191202s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067762462DNAL7 a10.1071/RDv32n2Ab442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagara, Kinji10a44 Analysis of abnormal chromatin configuration induced by inhibiting MEK at the 1-cell stage  ap. 147-148.  aAfter fertilisation, mammalian oocytes resume meiosis, leading to pronuclear (PN) formation. It has been known that the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway negatively regulates PN formation. However, it remains largely unknown how the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is involved in the dynamic organisation of chromatin structure in PNs. Here, to address how MEK1/2 activity is involved in PN formation and transcriptional regulation, we examined whether treatment of fertilised oocytes with MEK1/2 inhibitor (PD0325901; PD) during the 1-cell stage affects their global epigenetic modifications and heterochromatin formation in mice. We performed IVF using superovulated oocytes from and ICR strain female mouse and treated IVF embryos with 1 µM PD for 10h from insemination to observe global epigenetic modifications such as H3K9me3 or H3K27me3, localization of heterochromatin protein. First, we found that PD treatment enhanced PN formation with abnormal pronuclear sizes, that is, larger female and smaller male PNs. Further, PD treatment for 10h after fertilisation caused significantly lower global H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 modifications in female PN [H3K9me3: 1.00±0.01 vs. 0.75±0.01 (N>10); P=1.0×10−2, H3K27me3: 1.00±0.01 vs. 0.55±0.01 (N>10); P=6.0×10−7], suggesting failure of establishment of normal histone modifications for heterochromatin. Consistently, we found loss of HP1b around the nucleolus precursor body, which is normally associated with pericentric heterochromatin, suggesting that MEK1/2 activity is required for normal PN and heterochromatin formation. Regardless, embryos treated with PD at the 1-cell stage recovered such global histone modifications through the pre-implantation embryos to reach the blastocyst stage. Together, our data show that MEK1/2 activity plays a pivotal role not only in regulation of PN formation but also heterochromatin formation during the 1-cell stage in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3acell nucleolus 3aepigenetics 3afemales 3aheterochromatin 3ahistone code 3ain vitro fertilization 3ainsemination 3amales 3ameiosis 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoocytes 3asuperovulation 3atranscription (genetics)1 aNaruto, S.1 aWatanabe, R.1 aWakayama, T.1 aKishigami, S.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2020, v. 32, no. 2 p.147-148dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RDv32n2Ab443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245008800158300001600246520141400262592002801676650001001704650001901714650000901733650002801742650001601770650001801786650001001804650002201814650001401836650002101850650001401871650000701885650001301892650001401905650001501919650001101934650002101945653001001966653002101976653001901997653001902016653001102035653001002046700002202056700002802078773010902106856003802215852000902253655001202262IND4472718820221122025358.0120319s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447271882DNAL7 a10.1071/WF100842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCouto-Vázquez, A.10aLong-term effects of fire and three firefighting chemicals on a soil–plant system  ap. 856-865.  aThe effects of fire and firefighting chemicals on soil properties and the soil–plant system were evaluated 5 years after treatment application. Unburnt soils were compared with burnt soils treated with water alone (BS) or with foaming agent (BS+Fo), Firesorb polymer (BS+Fi), or ammonium polyphosphate (BS+Ap). Soils (0–2cm depth) and foliar material (Ulex micranthus, Pterospartum tridentatum, Erica umbellata and Pinus pinaster) were analysed for total C, total N, δ15N, nutrients (soil-available; plant total), pH and inorganic-N (soils) and vegetation cover and height. No long-term effects of firefighting chemicals on soil properties were found except for pH (BS+Fo>BS+Ap), inorganic-N and P (BS+Ap>other treatments). BS+Ap plants usually showed higher values of δ15N, N, P and Na, but less K. Soil coverage by Pterospartum and Ulex was higher in BS+Ap than in other treatments, whereas the opposite was observed for Erica; shrubs were always taller in BS+Ap. After 3 years of growth, the size of pine seedlings followed the order BS+Ap>unburnt soil>other treatments. Foliar N and P, scrub regeneration and growth of pines showed the long-term fertilising effect of ammonium polyphosphate, although the second highest pine mortality was found in the BS+Ap treatment. The foaming agent did not affect vegetation cover, and Firesorb had no noticeable effect on shrubs but the highest pine mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aErica 3aPinus pinaster 3aUlex 3aammonium polyphosphates 3aburnt soils 3afire fighting 3afires 3along term effects 3amortality 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3apH 3apolymers 3aseedlings 3ashrublands 3ashrubs 3avegetation cover 0aδ15N 0aflame retardants 0amacronutrients 0amicronutrients 0ashrubs 0atrees1 aGarcía-Marco, S.1 aGonzález-Prieto, S.

Iso-proteic diets containing 0, 150 or 300g of regular SBM (RSBM)/kg, corresponding to 460g of crude protein (CP)/kg, or high-protein SBM (HSBM), corresponding to 500gCP/kg, with or without 2.0genzymes/kg, were evaluated in three experiments. In experiment 1, a palatability test was performed to make six pair-wise comparisons: 0 vs. 150g RSBM/kg; 0 vs. 300g RSBM/kg; 300g RSBM vs. 300g HSBM/kg; 0 vs. 0g RSBM/kg+enzymes; 300g RSBM vs. 300g RSBM/kg+enzymes and 300g HSBM vs. 300g HSBM/kg+enzymes. In addition, two digestibility trials were conducted to evaluate three levels of RSBM (experiment 2) or HSBM (experiment 3) diets. The results of experiment 1 indicated that dogs preferred diets containing 300g HSBM/kg to the RSBM diet (P<0.05), whereas they preferred RSBM diets relative to the control diet (P<0.05). Dogs also preferred the control and RSBM diets with enzymes to the diets without enzymes (P<0.05). In experiments 2 and 3, enzyme supplementation increased the CTTAD of dry matter (DM), organic matter and CP of the RSBM and HSBM diets (P<0.05). The RSBMÃenzymes interaction supplied 0.53MJ/kg in addition to the ME in the 150g RSBM/kg+enzymes diet, relative to the control diet (P<0.05). The inclusion of RSBM and HSBM in the diet increased the CTTAD of the DM and CP compared to the control diet but reduced that of ether extract and ME (P<0.05). The faecal characteristics of the dogs were not influenced by the enzyme supplementation (P>0.05). An increase in the level of inclusion of RSBM and HSBM reduced the DM content, faecal score (looser stools), and pH, whereas the volume of the faeces produced was increased (P<0.05). Enzyme supplementation increased palatability, the DM and CP digestibility, and the ME content of dog foods containing up to 300g of the two SBM/kg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-galactosidase 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adogs 3afeces 3afoods 3ametabolizable energy 3aorganic matter 3apalatability 3asoybean meal1 aCarvalho, M.P.1 aAlarÃ§a, L.G.1 aBrito, C.B.M.1 aOliveira, S.G.1 aMaiorka, A.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 June 22, v. 174, no. 3-4 p.182-189dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2012.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002300167245010500190300001600295500001500311520140400326592002801730650003201758650001801790650004101808650003301849650000901882650002201891650003001913650002901943650001001972650002001982650003102002650001002033650002902043650001602072650003402088650001202122650003302134650004302167650003202210650005802242650003102300650004702331650005402378650006402432650005302496650001802549653003802567700002202605700002202627773012002649856008402769852000902853655001202862IND4470152620221122044704.0141111e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447015262DNAL7 a217191132pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAchleitner, Andrea10aT-regulatory cells infected with feline immunodeficiency virus up-regulate programmed death-1 (PD-1)  ap. 307-313.  a2019-12-06  aCD4⁺CD25⁺ regulatory T (Treg) cells play a crucial role in the regulation of peripheral tolerance and immune response. Treg cells influence the nature and magnitude of immune responses, in particular to chronic infections with viruses such as HIV in humans and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in cats. The co-stimulatory molecule programmed (cell) death-1 (PD-1) is expressed on T cells and antigen presenting cells. Interaction with its ligand, PD-L1, reduces CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T-cell function, and may lead to dysfunction or exhaustion of T cells. In this study, lymphocytes from blood or lymph nodes of healthy cats were mock or FIV infected, and sorted into CD4⁻, CD4⁺CD25⁺ and CD4⁺CD25⁻ subsets. Expression of FoxP3, PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA relative to the housekeeping genes beta actin and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR assays. Results indicated that CD4⁺CD25⁺ cells had higher transcript numbers of FoxP3, PD-1 and PD-L1 than CD4⁻ and CD4⁺CD25⁻ cells (P<0.05). Acute in vitro FIV infection increased expression of FoxP3, PD-1 and PD-L1 in CD4⁺CD25⁺ and CD4⁺CD25⁻ cells, with highest relative expression in CD4⁺CD25⁺ cells. These findings suggest that up-regulation of PD molecules in acutely FIV-infected lymphocytes may contribute to the immunosuppressive function of Treg cells in lentiviral infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3amessenger RNA 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3acats 3aimmunosuppression 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aantigen-presenting cells 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aactin 3atyrosine 3-monooxygenase 3alymph nodes 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 2aAnimals 2aB7-H1 Antigenxbiosynthesis. 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesxmetabolism 2aCatsximmunologyxvirology. 2aFeline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndromeximmunology 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aImmunodeficiency Virus, Felineximmunology 2aNucleic Acid Amplification Techniquesxveterinary 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aT-Lymphocytes, Regulatoryxmetabolismxvirology. 2aUp-Regulation 0aimmunosuppression (physiological)1 aClark, Mary Ellen1 aBienzle, Dorothee0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 143, no. 3-4 p.307-313dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245014900202300001600351506007600367520123200443592002801675506003701703650002201740650002501762650002201787650001101809650004901820650000901869650001201878650002801890650002201918650001201940650001301952650001301965650001801978650003901996650002402035650002402059650001402083650001402097650001202111700002002123700001902143700002002162700002002182700002102202700002202223700001802245773013402263856008002397852000902477655001202486IND4468260220221207144456.0120419e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446826022DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.06284-112doi7 aPMC32729872pmcid7 a221564332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujimori, Yoshie10aNovel Antiviral Characteristics of Nanosized Copper(I) Iodide Particles Showing Inactivation Activity against 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Influenza Virus  ap. 951-955.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe investigated the antiviral activity of nanosized copper(I) iodide (CuI) particles having an average size of 160 nm. CuI particles showed aqueous stability and generated hydroxyl radicals, which were probably derived from monovalent copper (Cu+). We confirmed that CuI particles showed antiviral activity against an influenza A virus of swine origin (pandemic [H1N1] 2009) by plaque titration assay. The virus titer decreased in a dose-dependent manner upon incubation with CuI particles, with the 50% effective concentration being approximately 17 μg/ml after exposure for 60 min. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the inactivation of the virus due to the degradation of viral proteins such as hemagglutinin and neuraminidase by CuI. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy revealed that CuI generates hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solution, and radical production was found to be blocked by the radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine. Taken together, these findings indicate that CuI particles exert antiviral activity by generating hydroxyl radicals. Thus, CuI may be a useful material for protecting against viral attacks and may be suitable for applications such as filters, face masks, protective clothing, and kitchen cloths.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantiviral properties 3aaqueous solutions 3acopper 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aface 3afilters 3afree radical scavengers 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aiodides 3akitchens 3apandemic 3aparticle size 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprotective clothing 3aprotein degradation 3asialidase 3atitration 3aviruses1 aSatō, Tetsuya,1 aHayata, Taishi1 aNagao, Tomokazu1 aNakayama, Mikio1 aNakayama, Tsuruo1 aSugamata, Ryuichi1 aSuzuki, Kazuo0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 78, no. 4 p.951-955dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.06284-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245013500189300001600324520093800340592002801278650002101306650001101327650002001338650004301358650001301401650000701414650001301421650005001434650004801484650003401532650003801566650003101604650001501635653003401650653004901684653003101733653002601764653004601790700002101836700001801857773010001875856008701975852000902062655001202071IND50070515520221119045705.0190402e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007051552DNAL7 a242067082pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.09.1412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Fang-Yu10aCombined use of HPLC–ICP-MS and microwave-assisted extraction for the determination of cobalt compounds in nutritive supplements  ap. 215-219.  aSpeciation analysis of cobalt in nutritive supplements has been carried out using HPLC and ICP-MS equipped with a membrane desolvation sample introduction system as detector.

It argues that exporters straddle contract and estate farming as a strategy to break through and survive in European markets, where the power of large‐scale retailers is increasing and the proliferation of food standards act as a non‐tariff barrier. It also analyses the relative opportunities as well as the costs of contract and estate farming. Then it focuses on how the control of buyers over suppliers is far from complete, revealing downstream and upstream spaces and dynamics of non‐compliance. In conclusion, some reflections on the development of capitalism in Africa are advanced.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapitalism 3aexports 3afarming systems 3ahorticulture 3aindigenous peoples 3amarkets 3aAfrica0 tJournal of agrarian change.g2015 Jan., v. 15, no. 1 p.17-42dBlackwell Publishersx1471-03587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.120323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245012900181300001600310520164300326592002801969650001401997650002402011650001102035653000802046653003402054653002602088653002702114653001302141653002802154700005802182700001802240700002802258773011602286856008602402852000902488655001202497IND60622817420221121062755.0181127e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062281742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.08.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres-Jiménez, Eloísa10aMethodology to simulate normalized testing cycles for engines and vehicles via design of experiments with low number of runs  ap. 817-832.  aThis paper proposes a methodology for simulating engine/vehicle responses of a non-stationary test cycle by means of few steady-state operating modes, which can greatly reduce testing costs and time. The novelty of the proposed methodology is the application of a mapping from the engine working region to a square domain, which allows testing any design of experiments (DoE) regardless of the testing cycle, vehicle or engine. In this new working space (mapped region) it is easy to apply a DoE that satisfies optimality conditions. The validation of the methodology is based on experimental data obtained from the New European Driving Cycle. Firstly, the methodology consists in determining which representative responses can be instantaneously and/or cumulatively approximated via a low degree polynomial function (smooth surfaces) and, secondly, in performing a DoE analysis in the mapped working region where the points defining each DoE are placed. An approach function for each response is developed based on DoE tested points. Subsequently, this model allows simulating vehicle responses during the transient test. For the studied validation case, results show that main engine performance responses can be instantaneously and cumulatively predicted with high accuracy by means of a DoE with few runs. On the other hand, this analysis reveals a cumulative predicted response of confidence for regulated exhaust emissions, but not for the instantaneous values. These findings support future studies to determine the optimal DoE which minimizes testing time and costs with a satisfactory and accurate estimation of engine responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aexperimental design 3amodels 0aDoE 0aEngine performance prediction 0aVehicle driving cycle 0aWorking region mapping 0aModeling 0aNew testing methodology1 aArmas, Octavio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3675-15221 aLešnik, Luka1 aCruz-Peragón, Fernando0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Dec. 01, v. 177 p.817-832dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.08.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012200172300001100294520187100305592002802176650001302204650002502217650001202242650001402254650001202268650000902280650001902289650000902308650001502317650001402332650001802346650002002364650001402384650001002398650001402408650001602422650001602438700002302454700001602477700002402493773012702517856008202644852000902726655001202735IND60685969120221117004656.0200424e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068596912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00027-020-0709-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnsen, Mitchell A.10aResilience of pond communities to extreme thermal regime shifts: an alpine–montane reciprocal transplant experiment  ap. 38.  aElevational gradients are ideal ecological venues for testing how communities respond to environmental changes associated with global warming. Recent warming rates have been shown to increase with elevation, hypothetically translating into heat waves that more adversely affect cold-adapted alpine communities than lower montane communities exposed to cold waves. We tested this hypothesis by conducting a replicated two-factor (source × elevation) experiment involving a reciprocal transplant of regional alpine and montane pond communities across two elevational sites (2345 m versus 1390 m asl). At each elevation, half of the mesocosms were inoculated with zooplankton and sedimentary egg-banks collected from alpine ponds while the other mesocosms were similarly seeded with zooplankton and sediment collected from montane ponds in 2016. After overwintering, the mesocosms were sampled for temperature and plankton during the ice-free periods of 2017 and 2018. The mesocosms at the low elevation were 8.0 ± 1.2 °C °C warmer than those at the high elevation. Elevation significantly affected total zooplankton biomass, whereas source effects were not significant. Elevation effects revealed that the temperature difference between sites affected the phenology of species within the assembled communities, but not their total biomass. Functional trait analysis revealed that the warmer environment selected for smaller body size and asexual reproduction as a warmer thermal regime stimulated several small parthenogenetic herbivores while suppressing larger, obligate sexual omnivores. Nevertheless, thermal regime shifts did not substantially affect the abundance-weighted mean functional identities of either transferred pond community, highlighting ponds as potential sources of functional insurance against increasingly extreme climate events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aasexual reproduction 3abiomass 3abody size 3aclimate 3acold 3aglobal warming 3aheat 3aherbivores 3aomnivores 3aoverwintering 3aparthenogenesis 3aphenology 3aponds 3asediments 3atemperature 3azooplankton1 aStuparyk, Blake R.1 aCook, Jenna1 aVinebrooke, Rolf D.0 tAquatic sciences.g2020 Apr., v. 82, no. 2 p.38-38dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:J000000051x1015-16217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-0709-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001600172245016600188300001600354520169600370592002802066650001402094650001302108650001102121650001502132650001602147650002702163650001402190650001502204650002302219650001702242650001502259650001402274650002902288650001402317650003302331650002102364650001102385650002102396650001202417650001702429650004102446651001402487651002002501653001102521653002302532653001202555653002002567653001902587700001702606700001602623700002002639773010602659856008702765852000902852655001202861IND50066045720221117090902.0160902e20130601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006604572DNAL7 a235709102pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.02.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirch, G.F.14aThe use of vintage surficial sediment data and sedimentary cores to determine past and future trends in estuarine metal contamination (Sydney estuary, Australia)  ap. 542-561.  aThe objectives of the present investigation were to determine past trends in sediment contamination and possibly predict future trends. Multiple vintages of surficial sediment metal data, from a quasi-decadal ‘Status and Trends’ programme, were used to provide large-scale spatial information on current status and temporal change. This information was augmented by sediment cores, specifically located to verify surface sediment data and to determine trends at major points of stormwater discharge. The data obtained indicate that surficial sediment metal concentrations have declined, since about the early 1990s, in extensive parts of the upper and central estuaries and have increased slightly in the lower estuary, due mainly to a down-estuary shift in industry and urbanisation. Declining surficial sediment metal concentrations is due to a movement of industry out of the catchment, especially from foreshore areas and the introduction of regulation, which prevent pollutants being discharged directly to the estuary. The major present-day source of metals is stormwater, with minor inputs from the main estuary channel into embayments and runoff from previously contaminated mainland sites. Modelled relaxation rates are optimistic as high metal concentrations in stormwater will slow predicted rates. Stormwater remediation should be the main managerial focus for this estuary. Multiple vintages of surficial sediment metal data covering the past 30years, supplemented by sedimentary core data, have allowed past and future contamination trends to be determined. This type of science-based information provides an important tool for strategic management of this iconic waterway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestuaries 3aindustry 3ametals 3apollutants 3aremediation 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3astormwater 3atemporal variation 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3awaterways 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEstuaries 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aHuman Activities 2aHumans 2aMetalsxanalysis 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aAustralia 0aNew South Wales 0aMetals 0aSurficial sediment 0aEstuary 0aRelaxation rate 0aSydney estuary1 aChang, C.-H.1 aLee, J.

There are reports of peasant suicides due to non‐profitability of farming. However, scant empirical evidence is available on changes in real income and wages in the Indian agricultural sector. The present study uses data from the National Accounts Statistics and Cost of Cultivation Surveys to analyse the changes in real income and discusses the underlying reasons. The study reveals that the purchasing power of farmers has remained low and has worsened over recent years. The value of crop output has increased, but a disproportionate rise in input costs has resulted in a fall in crop incomes in several states, with the agriculturally developed Punjab being an exception. Interestingly, real wage rates for agricultural labour have shown an increasing trend, indicating improvement in the welfare of labour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural income 3aagricultural industry 3acrop yield 3afarm labor 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3ainput costs 3apeasantry 3aprices 3apurchasing 3astatistics 3awage rates 3aIndia0 tJournal of agrarian change.g2015 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.201-219dBlackwell Publishersx1471-03587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.120683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013400173300001800307500001500325520129200340592002801632650002001660650001401680650001401694650001001708650001501718650001301733650002101746650001401767650002001781650001701801650001701818650002201835650001601857650001401873650002001887650001601907650002001923650001601943650002101959653003701980653002502017653001002042653002002052700001802072700002402090700001702114773010802131856008402239852000902323655001202332IND60458472520221122065402.0151106e20151110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6045847252DNAL7 a10.1080/01904167.2014.9581692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Rai Altaf10aNutrient Uptake, Water Relations, and Yield Performance lf Different Wheat Cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) under Salinity Stress  ap. 2139-2149.  a2019-12-06  aA pot experiment was conducted in the wire house of Department of Crop Physiology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad to evaluate the effect of salinity stress on water relations, nutrient uptake and yield of six local spring wheat cultivars. The seeds were sown in plastic pots (25 × 15 cm) and experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design in factorial arrangement with three repeats. De-ionized water was used as control treatment while salinity stress was imposed by irrigating plants with sodium chloride (NaCl) solution of 10 mM at tillering, stem elongation, anthesis, and grain development stages. Results of the study demonstrated that salinity stress decreased water potential by 32%, osmotic potential by 12%, and relative water contents by 20% as compared to control treatment. The nitrogen (N) uptake was decreased by 36% under salinity stress, while phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) uptake were decreased by 56% and 42%, respectively. The yield of wheat plants was also significantly reduced under salinity stress. It reduced grain yield by 25% and grain weight by 7%. The response of different cultivars was also different to salinity stress as cultivars ‘Lasani-08’ and ‘FSD-08’ were found to be more tolerant as compared to other cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3astem elongation 3acultivars 3aflowering 3aseeds 3airrigation 3anitrogen 3aosmotic pressure 3atillering 3anutrient uptake 3awater stress 3aspring wheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3agrain yield 3apotassium 3asodium chloride 3apot culture 3awater potential 3asalt stress 3aseed development 0anutrient uptake. salinity stress 0adevelopmental stages 0awheat 0awater relations1 aAhmad, Rashid1 aWaraich, Ejaz Ahmad1 aNawaz, Fahim0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2015 Nov. 10, v. 38, no. 13 p.2139-2149dTaylor & Francisx1532-40877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2014.9581693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245010300175300001600278520151200294592002801806653001701834653002601851653001701877653001801894653001501912700001901927700002201946773012901968856008802097852000902185655001202194IND60520391720221119073606.0160520e20150203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052039172DNAL7 a10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2014.04432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanilova, Marina10aRespiratory Symptoms and Ventilatory Function in Never- Smoking Males Working in Dusty Occupations  ap. 645-649.  aAIM: To assess the effect of occupational exposure on respiratory symptoms and ventilatory capacity in never-smoking male workers exposed to mineral or organic dusts.MATERIALANDMETHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including 138 never-smoking male workers exposed to mineral or organic dust (34 construction workers, 32 furniture manufacturers, 37 agricultural workers, and 35 bakers) and 35 unexposed controls (office workers). Evaluation of all study subjects included completion of a questionnaire and spirometric measurements.RESULTS: The prevalence of the overall respiratory symptoms in the last 12 months was higher in dusty occupation workers than its prevalence in office workers. Statistically significant difference was found between the prevalence of cough in construction workers, agricultural workers and bakers, as well as between the prevalence of phlegm in construction workers, furniture manufacturers and agricultural workers as compared to its prevalence in office workers. The mean values of spirometric parameters were lower in all groups of exposed workers as compared to their mean values in office workers with statistical significance for all measured parameters in construction workers and furniture manufacturers, as well as for small airways indices in agricultural workers and bakers.CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate significant effect of occupational exposure on respiratory symptoms and ventilatory capacity impairment in workers exposed to mineral or organic dusts.  aPublisher supplied data 0amineral dust 0aoccupational exposure 0aorganic dust 0aquestionnaire 0aspirometry1 aStoleski, Saso1 aMijakoski, Dragan0 tMacedonian journal of medical sciences.g2015 Feb. 3, v. 7, no. 4 p.645-649dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23186x1857-57497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2014.04433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04058naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245010700205300001800312500001900330520223300349592002802582596003802610650002202648650002802670650002102698650001702719650001802736650001802754650002602772650001602798650001602814650001602830650001102846650004102857650000902898653001502907653002302922653001302945653003802958653002302996653001603019653001003035653001703045653001003062653004303072653002303115653001803138700002803156700001903184700001703203700002403220773013203244856008303376852000903459655001203468IND60734737920221122023240.0210429e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073473792DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-20-1596-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xin-Gen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0883-650210aCombined Use of PGPRs and Reduced Rates of Azoxystrobin to Improve Management of Sheath Blight of Rice  ap. 1034-1041.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFarmers rely heavily on the use of strobilurin fungicides to manage sheath blight (ShB) caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA, the most important disease in rice in the southern United States. Greenhouse and field studies were conducted to evaluate the potential use of plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) in combination with a reduced rate of azoxystrobin application as a strategy to improve the current fungicide-reliant management. Of the nine antagonistic PGPR strains screened in the greenhouse, Bacillus subtilis strain MBI600 provided the most significant and consistent suppression of ShB. Efficacy of strain MBI600 was further evaluated at the concentrations of 0, 10³, 10⁶, 10⁹, and 10¹¹ CFU/ml alone or in combinations with 0, 17, 33, 50, 67, 83, and 100% of the recommended application rate (0.16 kg a.i./ha) of azoxystrobin. Strain MBI600 applied at 10⁶,10⁹, and 10¹¹ CFU/ml alone was effective in reducing ShB severity. Combinations of this strain at these rates with ≥33% of the recommended application rate of azoxystrobin further reduced ShB severity. A dose–response model defining the relationships between strain MBI600, azoxystrobin, and ShB severity was established. Estimates of the effective concentrations (EC₅₀ and EC₉₀) of strain MBI600 when applied in combination with 50% of the recommended application rate of azoxystrobin were 10⁴ and 10⁹ CFU/ml, respectively. A field trial was conducted over 4 years to verify the efficacy of their combinations. Strain MBI600 alone, when applied at 10⁹ CFU/ml at the boot stage, reduced ShB severity but did not significantly increase grain yields each year. Combination of strain MBI600 with azoxystrobin at half of the recommended application rate improved efficacy of strain MBI600, reducing ShB severity to a level comparable to that of azoxystrobin applied at the full rate in all 4 years. The combined treatment also increased grain yield by 14 to 19%, comparable to the fungicide applied at the full rate in 3 of 4 years. Combined use of PGPR strain MBI600 with a reduced rate of azoxystrobin application can be a viable management option for control of ShB while allowing producers to use less fungicide on rice.  aPublisher supplied data  a2010-34103-21156cUSDA/NIFA SRIPM 3aBacillus subtilis 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3aapplication rate 3aazoxystrobin 3abooting stage 3adose response 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3agreenhouses 3aleaf blight 3amodels 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3arice 0abiocontrol 0acereals and grains 0achemical 0acultural and biological practices 0adisease management 0afield crops 0afungi 0aOryza sativa 0aPGPRs 0aplant growth–promoting rhizobacteria 0aRhizoctonia solani 0asheath blight1 aKumar, K.

The practice of clonally propagating potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), which has been lasted for thousands of years, has caused the accumulation of deleterious alleles. Despite yellow margin (ym) being a common cause of a detrimental weak-vigor phenotype and reduced yield in diploid potato, the underlying gene has eluded discovery to date. In this paper, we mapped the ym gene to a 30-kb region containing four annotated genes. Among them, PGSC0003DMG402023481 encodes a pectate lyase-like gene (StPLL) with lower expression in ym plants than in the wild-type plants. PCR amplification confirmed a 4.1-kb deletion in the mutant allele of StPLL. Knockout of StPLL in diploid potato resulted in a similar phenotype with the ym plants. This study not only characterizes the ym allele but also provides the molecular tools to select and purge it from populations, while also deepening our understanding of the morphogenesis in potato.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 31601360cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aalleles 3adiploidy 3agenomics 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3amutation 3apectate lyase 3aphenotype 3apotatoes1 aFeng, Shuangshuang1 aTang, Die1 aZhang, Lidong1 aLi, Yumei1 aKear, Philip1 aHuang, Sanwen1 aChang, Ch'un-sik,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0658-13980 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Apr., v. 133, no. 4 p.1123-1131dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03536-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04237naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003200113024002900145024003600174040001800210100002000228245012900248300001800377506002800395506003000423520164800453592002802101596004402129596004502173506003702218650000802255650001002263650002602273650001702299650003702316650002202353650002702375650001102402650002402413650002002437650001202457650002502469650001802494650002102512650003702533650001902570650002202589650001402611650003702625650002002662650002802682650001402710650002602724650002302750650002402773650002702797650004102824651001402865651001602879651001602895653002702911653001602938653001102954653002302965653002402988700002903012700002103041700002503062700002403087700002503111700002003136773013203156856007503288903002203363961001303385852000903398655001203407IND60114938620221207113218.0141124e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011493862DNAL7 a231254342pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.12004942chorus7 a10.3732/ajb.12004942doi7 a10.3732/ajb.12004942chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeerow, Alan W.10aZamia (Cycadales: Zamiaceae) on Puerto Rico: Asymmetric genetic differentiation and the hypothesis of multiple introductions  ap. 1828-1839.  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  a• Premise of the Study: This study of Zamia in Puerto Rico is the most intensive population genetics investigation of a cycad to date in terms of number of markers, and one of few microsatellite DNA studies of plants from the highly critical Caribbean biodiversity hotspot. Three distinctive Zamia taxa occur on the island: Z. erosa on the north coast, and Z. portoricensis and Z. pumila, both in the south. Their relationships are largely unknown. We tested three hypotheses about their genetic diversity, including the possibility of multiple introductions.• Methods: We used 31 microsatellite loci across 10 populations and analyzed the data with AMOVA, Bayesian clustering, and ABC coalescent modeling.• Key Results: Puerto Rican zamias exhibit an amalgam of patterns of genetic differentiation that have been reported for cycads. Overall, the taxa are slightly inbred, with high infra-populational variation and little evidence of recent bottlenecks. Zamia erosa exhibits a more than threefold greater degree of population differentiation than the other two taxa. Admixture is evident only between Z. portoricensis and Z. pumila. Zamia portoricensis is inferred to be the youngest taxon on the island, on the basis of estimates of coalescence time and effective population size. A selective sweep may be underway in a small population of Z. erosa in a saline environment.• Conclusions: Zamia erosa may represent an independent introduction into Puerto Rico; Z. portoricensis and Z. pumila fit a scenario of allopatric speciation. This will be explored further in the context of genetic analysis across the entire Caribbean region.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aZamia 3aallopatric speciation 3abiodiversity 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amodels 3apopulation genetics 3apopulation size 2aAlleles 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBayes Theorem 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aZamiaceaexclassificationxgenetics. 3aCaribbean 3aPuerto Rico 0aPuerto Rico 0aCaribbean biogeography 0acoalescence 0acycads 0amicrosatellite DNA 0apopulation genetics1 aFrancisco-Ortega, Javier1 aCalonje, Michael1 aGriffith, M.

Ninety-six 21-day-old piglets were randomly assigned to three dietary treatments. Each treatment had eight replicates with four piglets per replicate. The piglets were fed either control diet (control) or control diet supplemented with in-feed antibiotics (300 mg/kg chlortetracycline and 60 mg/kg colistin sulfate) or pharmacological doses of ZnO (3000 mg/kg). The experiment lasted 4 weeks. Blood samples were collected at days 14 and 28, while intestinal samples were harvested at day 28 of the experiment. Dietary high doses of ZnO supplementation significantly increased the body weight (BW) at day 14 and average daily gain (ADG) of days 1 to 14 in weaned piglets, when compared to control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of diarrhea of piglets fed ZnO-supplemented diets, at either days 1 to 14, days 14 to 28, or the overall experimental period, was significantly decreased in comparison with those in other groups (P < 0.05). Supplementation with ZnO increased the villus height of the duodenum and ileum in weaned piglets and decreased the crypt depth of the duodenum, when compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). Dietary ZnO supplementation decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration at either day 14 or day 28, but increased total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) at day 14, when compared to that in the control (P < 0.05). ZnO supplementation upregulated the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in the jejunum mucosa of weaned piglets, compared to those in the control (P < 0.05). The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-lβ (IL-1β) mRNA expression in the jejunum mucosa was downregulated in the ZnO-supplemented group, compared with the control (P < 0.05). Both in-feed antibiotics and ZnO supplementation decreased the mRNA expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), but increased the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), in the jejunum mucosa of piglets, when compared to those in the control (P < 0.05). In summary, supplemental ZnO was effective on the prevention of post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in weaned piglets and showed comparative growth-promoting effect on in-feed antibiotics, probably by the mechanism of improvement of the antioxidant capacity, restoration of intestinal barrier function and development, and modulation of immune functions.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016B070701013cScience and Technology Program of Guangdong Province, China  a31501967cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31472112cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCARS-36cChina Agriculture Research System  a2014B030301054cOperating Funds for Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Breeding and Nutrition  a2012BAD39B01-5cNational Science and Technology Support Program  a201403047cSpecial Fund for Agro-scientific Research in the Public Interest 3aantioxidant activity 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood sampling 3abody weight 3achlortetracycline 3acolistin 3adiarrhea 3adiet 3aduodenum 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aileum 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ajejunum 3amalondialdehyde 3amessenger RNA 3aoccludins 3apiglets 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atransforming growth factor beta 3avilli 3azinc oxide1 aLv, Hang1 aChen, Zhuang1 aWang, Li1 aWu, Xiuju1 aChen, Zhongjian1 aZhang, Weina1 aLiang, Rui1 aJiang, Zongyong0 tBiological trace element research.g2017 Feb., v. 175, no. 2 p.331-338dSpringer USwJournal:jnl11497x0163-49847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-016-0767-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245007500209300002000284506007600304520124600380592002801626506003701654650001901691650000801710650001201718650000901730650001401739650001101753650002501764650000901789650002501798650002601823650001501849650002001864650000901884651001101893700002301904700002101927773014901948856008102097852000902178655001202187IND60574497520221207092941.0170728e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057449752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9233-92doi7 aPMC55065052pmcid7 a285473692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamczyk, Janusz10aAir protection programmes in Poland in the context of the low emission  ap. 16316-16327.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe protection of the air against pollutants from individual boiler plants is a big challenge in Poland. It results mainly from the preference for coal, the national energy carrier, the use of old low-efficiency boilers and the location of Poland in a temperate climate where the heating period lasts at least 5 months. This article presents a wide range of activities aimed at the reduction of the environmental impact of the emissions of pollutants from individual heat sources—the so-called low emission. The article presents the extent of the national legislation resulting from the European Union regulations. It discusses the assumptions of the air protection programmes (APPs) and the low emission reduction programmes (LERPs). The assumptions mentioned above are analysed as part of a life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis and a multi-criterion analysis. An important result of these analyses (in the Polish conditions) is the conclusion that a boiler fired with large pieces of wood is an optimal solution from the economic and ecological points of view. The article proposes systemic, organisational and legislative solutions whose implementation could contribute to raising the effectiveness of the protection of the atmosphere.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEuropean Union 3aair 3aboilers 3acoal 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aheat 3alaws and regulations 3alife cycle assessment 3apollutants 3atemperate zones 3awood 3aPoland1 aPiwowar, Arkadiusz1 aDzikuć, Maciej,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 July, v. 24, no. 19 p.16316-16327dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9233-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01847naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245016800163300001600331520075900347592002801106650002201134650001701156650001401173650001301187650001501200650001201215650001401227650001301241650001901254651002501273651001001298773010601308856007401414852000901488655001201497IND60137818120221117213740.0150524e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013781812DNAL7 a10.1111/joac.120582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParcerisas, Lluís10aLandownership Distribution, Socio‐Economic Precariousness and Empowerment: The Role of Small Peasants in Maresme County (Catalonia, Spain) from 1850 to the 1950s  ap. 261-285.  aI present fresh data that show the leading role played by smallholder peasants in land‐use intensification, technical improvement and landscape transformation in Maresme County (province of Barcelona, Spain) between 1850 and the 1950s. As a reaction to their precarious situation, caused by an unequal landownership distribution (which is assessed by looking at the minimum‐income and maximum workable farm sizes), smallholders drove agrarian changes in this coastal Mediterranean area. The results of their individual efforts, and their collective action through social mobilization and cooperatives, entailed a socio‐economic and political improvement, especially in denser populated areas closer to markets, until the arrival of Franco's regime.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollective action 3acooperatives 3afarm size 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amarkets 3apeasantry 3apolitics 3asocioeconomics 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain0 tJournal of agrarian change.g2015 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.261-285dBlackwell Publishersx1471-03587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joac.120583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245007300172300001600245520062300261592002800884653002100912653002000933653002800953653003900981653002201020700002301042700002101065700002501086773012901111856008801240852000901328655001201337IND60520391920221119073908.0160520e20150203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052039192DNAL7 a10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2014.04452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFatic, Nikola10aAxillary Arterial Thrombosis Secondary to Re-Fracture of the Humerus  ap. 618-621.  aIn the presented case report, we evaluated mechanism of axillary artery thrombosis in cases of repeated fracture of the shoulder.

Reducing the salt adversely impacted Cheddar flavour and texture. The key compositional parameters of moisture-in-non-fat-substances and salt-in-moisture were most affected. Decreasing salt resulted in a concomitant reduction of pH, a slight reduction in buffering capacity and an increase in water activity and growth of starter and non-starter lactic acid bacteria that resulted in enhanced proteolysis. Lipolysis was not impacted by salt reduction. To produce quality reduced salt Cheddar cheese cognisance must be taken on how to reduce proteolysis, limit growth of NSLAB, reduce water activity, achieve pH 5.0–5.4 by modifications to the cheese making procedure to create a more appropriate environment for selected starter and/or adjunct cultures to generate acceptable Cheddar flavour and texture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCheddar cheese 3abuffering capacity 3acheesemaking 3aflavor 3alactic acid bacteria 3alipolysis 3apH 3aproteolysis 3asodium chloride 3atexture 3awater activity1 aKilcawley, K.N.1 aDoolan, I.A.1 aAlonso-Gomez, M.1 aNongonierma, A.B.1 aHannon, J.A.1 aWilkinson, M.G.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2013 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.45-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011200156520140000268592002801668650001001696650001201706650001101718650002301729650000901752700001401761700001601775773012101791856007401912852000901986655001201995IND60754218520221121215355.0211023e20211009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421852DNAL7 a10.3390/f121013692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Wengang 10aCharacterizing Mode I Fracture Behaviors of Wood Using Compact Tension in Selected System Crack Propagation  aThe fracture behaviors of four wood species commonly used in wood products were characterized when subjected to compact tension (CT) load in radial-longitudinal (RL) system crack propagation. Meanwhile, the failure modes of evaluated CT samples were compared and analyzed using the fractal dimension method. The results showed that wood species had a significant effect on fracture characteristic values, including maximum fracture load, critical stress intensity factor and fracture energy. These characteristic values changed in the same way, i.e., beech wood CT samples obtained the maximum characteristic values, followed by ash, okoume, and poplar in descending order. The fracture behaviors of all wood species evaluated can be described by combining linear and exponential fitting equations at the crack initial stage and evolution stage, respectively. Linear positive proportional relationships were observed between fracture characteristic values and fractal dimensions calculated using cracks in front and left views of CT samples. However, the relationships between fracture characteristic values and fractal dimensions calculated using fracture surfaces were negative. The fractal dimensions of cracks in front view of CT samples could be a better indicator used to predict critical stress intensity factor and fracture energy, which had greater correlation coefficients beyond 0.95.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPopulus 3aenergy 3afractal dimensions 3awood1 aLiu, Yan 1 aLi, Shuang 0 tForests.g2021 Oct. 09, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245006700178300001600245520216600261592002802427650002102455650002302476650001502499650001502514650001902529650001702548650000902565650002102574650001702595650001402612700002402626700002202650773013602672856008202808961001302890852000902903655001202912IND50072408520221120205028.0201217e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007240852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-013-0752-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaz-Alberto, Annie Melinda10aPhytoremediation of Pb in the sediment of a mangrove ecosystem  ap. 251-258.  aPURPOSE: Coal-fuelled power plants can discharge hazardous materials, particularly heavy metals such as lead (Pb). An alternative way of reducing Pb concentration from contaminated sediments is through phytoremediation. Presently, there are few research findings on the phytoremediation potential of mangroves on metals like Pb. The study was conducted to survey and identify mangroves that thrive near the coal-fired power plant and to assess the phytoremediation potential of mangroves on Pb in sediment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study sites were located in the mangrove ecosystems of Sitio Oyon and Sitio Asinan in Masinloc, Zambales, Philippines. The first stage of our study was to survey and identify the mangrove species. The second stage was to assess the levels of Pb in the sediments, water, and tissues of mangrove trees. The diversity assessment of the mangrove species was done through the use of 10 × 12 m quadrat technique. Water and sediment samples from each mangrove ecosystem were collected using composite sampling methods. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Three mangrove species were identified in the study sites: Avicennia marina, Rhizophora stylosa, and Sonneratia alba. The order of importance of the mangrove trees in the two sampling locations, based on an importance value index (IVI), were as follows: SA (IVI = 171.20) > AM (77.79) > RS (51.01). The total uptake of Pb from sediments near the power plants varied significantly (p ≤ 0.001) among the three mangrove species. S. alba had the highest Pb uptake of 48.4 kg ha⁻¹ followed by A. marina (23.1 kg ha⁻¹), and R. stylosa (2.4 kg ha⁻¹). These three mangrove species have the potential to phytoremediate Pb in the sediment. CONCLUSIONS: The three mangrove species present in the coastal ecosystem near the electric power plant—A. marina, R. stylosa, and S. alba—were potential phytoremediators of sediment Pb. The present study indicated that the mangroves possess beneficial characteristics that remove Pb from contaminated sediments in areas directly affected by coal-fired power plants, and thus have potential phytoremediation properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvicennia marina 3aRhizophora stylosa 3aSonneratia 3aecosystems 3aelectric power 3aheavy metals 3alead 3aphytoremediation 3apower plants 3asediments1 aCelestino, Arnel B.1 aSigua, Gilbert C.0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2014 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.251-258dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-013-0752-93Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014700160520186000307592002802167650003302195650001202228650002002240650001002260650001202270650002502282650003502307650001502342650001502357650001802372650001602390651001002406700001602416700001902432700001402451700001802465700001802483700001602501773012102517856007402638852000902712655001202721IND60757729020221121144834.0211125e20211026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075772902DNAL7 a10.3390/f121114602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaofang 12aA Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Height-Diameter Model with Interaction Effects of Stand Density and Site Index for Larix olgensis in Northeast China  aTree height is a basic input variable in various forest models, such as growth and yield models, biomass models, and carbon budget models, which serve as very important tools for the informed decision-making in forestry. The height-diameter model is the most important component of the growth and yield models and forest simulators. We developed the nonlinear mixed-effects height-diameter model with the interaction effects of stand density and site index introduced using data from 765 Larix olgensis trees in Jingouling forest farm of the Wangqing Forest Bureau in northeast China. Among the various basic versatile functions evaluated, a simple exponential growth function fitted the data adequately well, and this was then expanded through the introduction of the variables describing the interaction effects of the stand density and site index on the height-diameter relationship. Sample plot-level random effects were included into this model through mixed-effects modeling. The results showed that the random effect of the stand density on the height-diameter relationship was substantially different at different classes of the site index, and the random effect of the site index was different for the different stand density classes. The nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) height-diameter model coping with the interaction effects of the stand density and site index had a better performance than those of the NLME models with the random effect of the single variable of stand density or site index. To conclude, the inclusion of the interaction effects of stand density and site index could significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the height-diameter model for Larix olgensis Henry. The proposed model with the interactive random effects included can be applied for the accurate prediction of Larix olgensis tree height in northeast China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarix gmelinii var. olgensis 3abiomass 3adecision making 3afarms 3aforests 3aglobal carbon budget 3anonlinear mixed effects models 3aprediction 3asite index 3astand density 3atree height 3aChina1 aFu, Liyong 1 aSharma, Ram P.1 aHe, Xiao 1 aZhang, Huiru 1 aFeng, Linyan 1 aZhou, Zeyu 0 tForests.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121114603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03722naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245014000173300001400313520215500327592002802482650002702510650001302537650001102550650001702561650001902578650002002597650001202617650001602629650001802645650001302663650002202676650001102698650001202709650001802721650002002739650001602759653002702775653003002802653001702832653002102849653001702870700001802887700001502905700001202920700001702932700001602949773012802965856009003093852000903183655001203192IND60610155220221119102736.0190318e20181202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061015522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Hongmei10aInduction of a viable but non-culturable state in Salmonella Typhimurium is correlated with free radicals generated by thermosonication  ap. 90-97.  aThe viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state in bacteria is gaining more and more attention around the world, mainly due to it is not only an important strategy for adaption to a stressful environment but also may possibly pose a threat to food safety and public health. It was found that a small subpopulation of Salmonella Typhimurium in pure culture was induced into a VBNC state during thermosonication (TS) processing in our previous study, though few known about the situation in real food and how bacteria were induced into that special state. Base on the speculation that free radicals generated during TS affected induction of VBNC, the relationship between them was investigated preliminarily. It was observed that higher intensity of TS treatment, such as higher power, elevated temperature and prolonged duration resulted in more viable S. Typhimurium cells in carrot juice been inducted into VBNC state. The observed results showed that VBNC incidence indexes were 1000 as TS treatments at 57–62 °C and 380 W for 6 min, and 53 °C and 380 W for 8–10 min were applied, indicating a 100% VBNC state of viable cells in those cases. The ESR spectra revealed three kinds of free radicals, including carbon centered (ethanol) radicals, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen protons were generated in carrot juice during TS processing. The intensity of free radicals was tied to the TS processing parameters and also influenced the occurrence of VBNC. A nonlinear sigmoidal curve of the intensity of free radicals VS the VBNC incidence index in three stages, including a slow phase (with free radicals intensity of 0–0.10), a rapid growth phase (with free radicals intensity ranged 0.10–0.14) and a final equilibrium phase (with free radicals intensity greater than 0.14), was observed and well fitted with the Boltzmann model. Moreover, the significance of free radicals generated during TS processing for induction of VBNC state was verified and confirmed with 0–200 mM sodium pyruvate. The obtained results may contribute to understand the complicated phenomenon and guide the application of TS as a decontamination technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acarrot juice 3acell viability 3adecontamination 3aethanol 3afood safety 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3aprotons 3apublic health 3asodium pyruvate 3atemperature 0aSalmonella Typhimurium 0aViable but non-culturable 0aFree radical 0aInduction factor 0aCarrot juice1 aZhang, Ruirui1 aZhong, Kui1 aMa, Yun1 aNie, Xinying1 aLiu, Yuanfa0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2018 Dec. 02, v. 286 p.90-97dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245010900160300001600269500001500285520178300300592002802083650001202111650001002123650002102133650001202154650001102166650001102177650001202188650001402200650000902214650002202223653001602245700001702261700001602278700001602294773013102310856003802441852000902479655001202488IND50065042520221119234922.0130415e200110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006504252DNAL7 a10.2307/32369082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuhta, Ari‐Pekka10aRestorative mowing on an abandoned semi‐natural meadow: short‐term and predicted long‐term effects  ap. 677-686.  a2019-12-04  aWhen management, in the form of cattle grazing and mowing, ceases the abundance of competitively superior plant species tends to increase in abandoned semi‐natural meadows. Litter accumulation elevates the soil nutrient levels and hinders seedling recruitment. We surveyed changes in plant cover and species composition of a formerly grazed meadow in permanent plots for six years. Some plots were unmown, while others were mown and raked annually in August. The cover of grasses decreased and herb cover remained unchanged regardless of the treatment. Mowing and raking significantly reduced litter accumulation and increased the number of ground layer species. The expected long‐term effects of abandonment and restorative mowing were studied by calculating the transition probabilities for unmown and mown plots and simulating the course of succession as projected by the transition matrices. During a simulation period of 30 yr, abandonment led to (1) a decrease in the cover of small herbs, (2) a slight increase in the cover of tall herbs and (3) a slight decrease in the cover of grasses. In contrast, the cover of small herbs on the mown plots remained unchanged or slightly increased during the course of simulation. These results suggest that mowing late in the season is primarily a management tool for the maintenance of the existing species diversity and composition. However, it may not be an effective restorative tool to induce overall changes in the resident vegetation of abandoned grass‐dominated meadows. Grazing or mowing early in the season may be more effective in this respect. Consequently, mowing early or, alternatively, late in the season may provide management strategies for the maintenance and restoration of species diversity, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3aherbs 3anutrient content 3ameadows 3amowing 3acattle 3agrazing 3aseedlings 3asoil 3aspecies diversity 0arecruitment1 aRautio, Pasi1 aTuomi, Juha1 aLaine, Kari0 tJournal of vegetation science.g2001 Oct., v. 12, no. 5 p.677-686dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46820x1100-92337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3236908  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011200157520182400269592002802093650001502121650000902136650001602145650001202161650001102173650001502184650002402199650000902223650001902232650001902251650002402270650001502294650002202309650001102331650001902342650002302361651001002384700002002394700002002414700001902434700001702453700001702470773012102487856007402608852000902682655001202691IND60754218620221121215343.0211023e20211009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421862DNAL7 a10.3390/f121013702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ziguan 10aEffect of Environmental Factors on Soil Nutrient Loss under Conditions of Mining Disturbance in a Coalfield  aUnderground coal mining can result in land deformation (e.g., land subsidence and ground fissures), and may consequently change the soil nutrients. Soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), and available phosphorus (AP) are critical indicators of soil fertility and eco-restoration in mining areas. In this study, soil samples (depth: 0–20 cm) were collected twice from 20 sampling points in pre-mining and post-mining in the No.12 panel of Caojiatan coalfield, in the Loess Plateau of China. SOM, TN, and AP in soil samples were measured, and the nutrient loss was evaluated. Ten environmental factors affecting soil nutrient loss were identified from a 5-m resolution digital elevation map (DEM). The paired t-test was utilized to evaluate the differences between SOM, TN, and AP in pre-mining and post-mining soil. The mechanisms of the effects of environmental factors on soil nutrient loss were revealed based on multiple linear regression, redundancy analysis (RDA), and the random forest algorithm (RF). Ordinary kriging and RF were utilized to predict and optimize the spatial distribution of the soil nutrient loss. The results showed that significant differences existed between the SOM, TN, and AP in the pre-mining and post-mining soil. The model established by RF provided a higher accuracy in terms of fitting the correlation between soil nutrient loss and environmental factors compared to the model established by multiple linear regression, and the feature importance obtained by RF showed that profile curvature, distance to working panel margin, and surface roughness were the most significant factors affecting the loss of SOM, TN, and AP, respectively. This study provides a theoretical reference for eco-restoration, as well as soil and water conservation, in subsided lands in coalfields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoal 3adeformation 3akriging 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3asoil fertility 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic matter 3asubsidence 3asurface roughness 3at-test 3atotal nitrogen 3awater conservation 3aChina1 aWang, Guangcai 1 aWang, Chengshu 1 aWang, Xiaohui 1 aLi, Meiling 1 aRen, Tingyu 0 tForests.g2021 Oct. 09, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015100165300001600316520190000332592002802232650000902260650001702269650001102286650001802297650002402315650001102339650002102350650001102371650001702382650000902399650001502408650000902423650001602432650001702448650001602465650001202481650001402493650001402507700001402521700001702535773013602552856008202688852000902770655001202779IND50072408620221120205214.0201217e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007240862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-013-0753-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Taihui10aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in rural soils of Dongjiang River Basin: occurrence, source apportionment, and potential human health risk  ap. 110-120.  aPURPOSE: A comprehensive study was conducted to investigate the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Dongjiang River Basin (DRB) soils and to evaluate their sources and ecological and health risk. In addition, factors affecting the distribution and fate of PAHs in the soils such as emission density, soil organic matter, degradation, etc. were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surface soil (0–20 cm) samples from 30 sampling sites in the rural areas of DRB were collected and analyzed for 17 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (16 EPA priority PAHs and perylene). Positive matrix factorization model was used to investigate the source apportionment of these PAHs, and an incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was used to estimate the integrated lifetime risks of exposure to soil-borne PAHs through direct ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation collectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The total PAH concentrations in the rural soils in DRB range from 23.5 to 231 μg/kg with a mean concentration of 116 μg/kg. The predominant PAHs in the rural soils were naphthalene, fluoranthene, phenanthrene, and benzo(b)fluoranthene. Cluster analysis was performed to classify the soil PAHs into three clusters, which could be indicative of the soil PAHs with different origins and different properties. Source apportionment results showed that coal, biomass, oil, commercial creosotes, and vehicle contributed 24 %, 24 %, 17 %, 17 %, and 18 % of the total soil PAH burden, respectively. The ILCR results indicated that exposure to these soil-borne PAHs through direct ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation collectively produces some risk. CONCLUSIONS: PAHs in the soils of the DRB will produce long-term influences on rivers and oceans via soil erosion and river transport. Therefore, PAHs in rural soils of DRB have potential impacts on the water supply and human health risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3awater supply 3arivers 3aphenanthrenes 3asoil organic matter 3aoceans 3acluster analysis 3amodels 3ahuman health 3asoil 3awatersheds 3acoal 3arural areas 3asoil erosion 3anaphthalene 3abiomass 3aingestion 3abreathing1 aRan, Yong1 aChen, Laiguo0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2014 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.110-120dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-013-0753-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01330naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003400135040001800169100001300187245005000200300001200250500001100262506007600273520024400349592002800593506003700621650003100658650001000689650002900699650002600728700001400754700001900768773010300787856008100890852000900971655001200980IND60119425420221207113714.0190919e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011942542DNAL7 a215547492pmid7 aPMC32188582pmcid7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-4042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Chao10aObservations on shifted cumulative regulation  ap. 404.  aLetter  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA response to Dynamic cumulative activity of transcription factors as a mechanism of quantitative gene regulation by F He, J Buer, AP Zeng and R Balling.

The NGO Practical Action has been working in the Andes to address farmers' veterinary and agriculture needs. The work has included the training of farmer-to-farmer extension agents, known locally as Kamayoq. The Kamayoq have encouraged farmer participatory research, and local farmers pay them for their veterinary and crop advisory services in cash or in kind. The Kamayoq model is largely an unsubsidised approach to the provision of appropriate technical services and encouragement of farmer participation. The model also illustrates that, in the context of encouraging farmer participation and innovation, NGOs have advantages over research organisations because of their long-term presence, ability to establish trust with local farmers, and their emphasis on social and community processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooperative research 3afarmers 3amodels 3aon-farm research 3arural poverty 3aAndes region 3aPeru 0aCivil society 0aLabour and livelihoods 0aMethods 0aLatin America and the Caribbean1 aDixon, John0 tDevelopment in practice.g2008 Aug. 1, v. 18, no. 4-5 p.627-632dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096145208021818893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002200155245011600177300001400293520090600307592002801213650002301241650002401264650001301288650002201301650001201323650001001335650001301345650001501358650001501373650001401388650001401402650004301416650000901459651001901468653001801487653001601505653001801521653001501539653001001554653001401564700001901578700002101597700001701618700001801635700001701653700001801670773012801688856009001816852000901906655001201915IND60610155420221119102722.0190318e20181202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061015542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkorpikova, Lucie10aMolecular detection of Toxoplasma gondii in feathered game intended for human consumption in the Czech Republic  ap. 75-79.  aToxoplasma gondii is an important ubiquitous protozoan parasite, which can infect almost all warm-blooded vertebrates, including humans. The diagnosis of T. gondii infection is crucial for the prevention, surveillance, and control of its transmission. Here, a triplex real-time PCR assay targeting the B1 gene and 529rep element was used to determine the presence of T. gondii in feathered game (Anas platyrhynchos and Phasianus colchicus) hunted in the Czech Republic. The prevalence of T. gondii was 5.4% in wild ducks (n = 280) and 3.4% in common pheasants (n = 350). Additionally, genotyping of 28 T. gondii-positive samples revealed the presence of archetypal genotypes II and III as well as non-archetypal genotypes combining both type II and III alleles. Our results suggest that consumption of feathered game could pose a risk of T. gondii transmission to humans in the Czech Republic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aPhasianus colchicus 3aProtozoa 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aalleles 3aducks 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3amonitoring 3aparasites 3apheasants 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk 3aCzech Republic 0aToxoplasmosis 0aFood safety 0aReal-time PCR 0aGenotyping 0aDucks 0aPheasants1 aReslova, Nikol1 aLorencova, Alena1 aPlhal, Radim1 aDrimaj, Jakub1 aKamler, Jiri1 aSlany, Michal0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2018 Dec. 02, v. 286 p.75-79dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2018.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245012200209300001600331520136400347592002801711650002301739650001901762650001301781650002201794650001201816650003001828650001401858650001801872650002001890650001901910650001701929650002301946650001101969650001701980650001401997650003002011653002402041653000802065653003002073700002702103700002302130700002102153773021002174856008202384852000902466655001202475IND60690670920221122052343.0200508e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069067092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2017.06.0132doi7 aPMC69388912pmcid7 a303370262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRapaka, Deepthi10aVitis vinifera acts as anti-Alzheimer's agent by modulating biochemical parameters implicated in cognition and memory  ap. 241-247.  aAluminum a known neuro and cholinotoxin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Its exposure is associated with impairment of the memory and cognition.The present study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-Alzheimer’s activity of Vitis vinifera in aluminum induced Alzheimer’s disease.In this study, we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects of aluminum in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were exposed to aluminum chloride (100 mg/kg/day) orally for a period of 8 weeks. Vitis was given in doses of 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg for 16 weeks and the possible effects of Vitis vinifera on the expression of Tau and amyloid precursor protein were evaluated by PCR analysis and the possible activities of lipid peroxidation, inflammation and anti-cholinesterase activity were evaluated.Aluminum intoxication was associated with significant impairment in learning and memory in Morris water maze test. A significant improvement was observed with Vitis vinifera in a dose dependent manner.The findings of the present study revealed the significant neuroprotective actions of Vitis vinifera by modifying the biochemical parameters and inhibited the mRNA expression of Amyloid Precursor Protein and Tau, which are the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, which was further confirmed by histopathological observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aVitis vinifera 3aaluminum 3aaluminum chloride 3aamyloid 3acholinesterase inhibitors 3acognition 3adose response 3agene expression 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3alipid peroxidation 3amemory 3apathogenesis 3apoisoning 3apolymerase chain reaction 0aAlzheimer's disease 0aTau 0aAmyloid Precursor Protein1 aBitra, Veera Raghavulu1 aVishala, T.

The J-AIM has been doing this in the form of conducting workshops on scientific writing and research methods on different platforms. This article is based on our experiences and varied discussions that we have had with students, teachers, practitioners and researchers during these interactive sessions, and is intended at addressing the gap that prevails in the domain. The need for such awareness is felt even more strongly ever since the Beall's list of predatory journals has been unpublished. This article tries to fill the void this disappearance has created. We analyze the current scenario of AYUSH publications, enumerate the common perceptions and concerns among the workers in the field, and consider the periodicals where the doctoral and postgraduate level of Ayurveda research works are being published at present. The article also presents a practical checklist that will be helpful for students and teachers to refer authentic resources and submit their work to an appropriate scholarly journal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3afields 3ajournals 3aresearch methods 3aresearchers 3astudents 3ateachers 3awills1 aTillu, Girish1 aJadhav, Priyanka M.0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2017 Apr.,  June, v. 8, no. 2 p.132-136dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2017.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245010600204300001800310520061400328592002800942596005200970596009401022650002401116650002001140650001401160650002301174650001301197650001301210650001101223650001401234700005301248700005301301773012101354856008101475852000901556655001201565IND60619512620221119140431.0181102e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061951262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2896-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Guoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6787-601310aCatalytic oxidation mechanisms of carbon monoxide over single and double vacancy Cr-embedded graphene  ap. 1395-1408.  aThe detailed catalytic oxidation mechanisms of CO over Cr-embedded graphene have been investigated by means of M06-2X density functional. Both models with chromium atom embedded in single and double vacancy (Cr-SV and Cr-DV) in a graphene sheet were considered. It is found that the CO oxidation on Cr-SV-graphene prefers to Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism, while the Cr-DV-graphene shows good catalytic activity toward the CO oxidation via the Eley–Rideal (ER) mechanism. The present results imply that the low-cost Cr-embedded graphene is a prospective catalyst for CO oxidation at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data  a21203135cNational Science Foundations of China  a14KJB150024cNatural Science Foundation for colleges and universities in Jiangsu Province 3aambient temperature 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achromium 3agraphene 3amodels 3aoxidation1 aChen, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3803-35641 aZhao, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4302-97730 tJournal of materials science.g2019 Jan., v. 54, no. 2 p.1395-1408dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2896-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009200176300001600268520097000284592002801254650001501282650001401297650001101311650002101322651000901343653002301352653003201375653004201407653001901449653002401468700002301492700002001515773012301535856008401658852000901742655001201751IND60122847820221123033223.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012284782DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2014.8902852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavassoli, Hamid Reza10aClassification of natural flow regimes in Iran to support environmental flow management  ap. 517-529.  aDevelopment of environmental flow standards at the regional scale has been proposed as a means to manage the influence of hydrological alterations on riverine ecosystems in view of the rapid pace of global water resources management. Flow regime classification forms a critical part in such environmental flow assessments. We present a national-scale classification of hydrological regimes for Iran based on a set of hydrological metrics. It describes ecologically relevant characteristics of the natural hydrological regime derived from 15- to 47-year-long records of daily mean discharge data for 539 streamgauges within a 47-year period. The classification was undertaken using a fuzzy partitional method within Bayesian mixture modelling. The analysis resulted in 12 classes of distinctive flow regime types that differ in various hydrological aspects. This classification is being used for further research in regional-scale environmental flow studies in Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3ahydrology 3amodels 3awater management 3aIran 0aenvironmental flow 0ahydrological classification 0aindicators of hydrological alteration 0aIranian rivers 0anatural flow regime1 aTahershamsi, Ahmad1 aAcreman, M.

Physicochemical parameters and preliminary phytochemical screening were carried out using standard methods. The in-house prepared sample underwent physico-chemical analysis, qualitative phytochemical analysis, Gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC-MS) analysis, High performance thin layer chromatographic (HPTLC) fingerprinting profile and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopic (ICP-OES) analysis.Physico-chemical parameters of the prepared formulation were comparable to that of coconut oil. Aqueous methonolic extract of this drug was found to be positive for alkaloid, saponin, coumarin, steroid, triterpinoid, quinine and furan. The GC-MS values were comparable to that of the base used i.e., the coconut oil. HPTLC fingerprinting profile revealed the presence of phytochemicals in the medicated oil derived from both coconut oil and Datura metel. ICP-OES addressed the mineral portion of the formulation and its safety in heavy metal aspect.All these parameters can be utilized for the overall quality check over its preparation and formulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aDatura metel 3acoconut oil 3acoumarin 3adiabetic foot 3afurans 3aheavy metals 3aphytochemicals 3aquality control 3aquinine 3asaponins 3athin layer chromatography 3aIndia 0aGC-MS 0aMathan Tailam 0aPhytochemical 0aPhysico-chemical 0aHPTLC 0aICP-OES1 aSusila, R.1 aMurugammal, S.1 aDivya, S.0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2020 Jan.,  Mar., v. 11, no. 1 p.10-15dElsevier B.V.aTransdisciplinary University, Bangalore and World Ayurveda FoundationwJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2017.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009300208300001800301520178200319592002802101650002402129650002002153650001502173650002602188650001002214650002202224650002302246650001302269700006402282700006102346773012902407856008202536852000902618655001202627IND60643683620221119051052.0190512e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064368362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-019-01756-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMushet, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5910-274410aTemporal gamma-diversity meets spatial alpha-diversity in dynamically varying ecosystems  ap. 1783-1797.  aCommunity measures collected at a single instance or over a short temporal period rarely provide a complete accounting of biological diversity. The gap between such “snapshot” measures of diversity and actual diversity can be especially large in systems that undergo great temporal variation in environmental conditions. To adequately quantify diversity in these temporally varying ecosystems, individual measures of diversity collected throughout the range of environmental variation, i.e., temporal alpha-diversity measures, must be combined to obtain temporal gamma-diversity. Such a time-integrated gamma-diversity measure will be a much closer approximation of a site’s true alpha-diversity and provide a measure better comparable to spatial alpha-diversity measures of sites with lower temporal variation for which a single or a few “snapshot” measures may suffice. We used aquatic-macroinvertebrate community-composition data collected over a 24-year period from a complex of 16 prairie-pothole wetlands to explore the rate that taxa accumulate over time at sites with differing degrees of temporal variation. Our results show that the rate of taxa accumulation over time, i.e., the slope of the species–time relationship, is steeper for wetlands with ponds that frequently dry compared to those with more-permanent ponds. Additionally, we found that a logarithmic function better fit species accumulation data for seasonally ponded wetlands whereas a power function better fit accumulations for permanently and semi-permanently ponded wetlands. Thus, interpretations of ecological diversity measures, and conservation decisions that rely on these interpretations, can be biased if temporal variations in community composition are not adequately represented.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aponds 3aspecies diversity 3atemporal variation 3awetlands1 aSolensky, Matthew J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4376-77651 aErickson, Shay F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5378-98210 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2019 June, v. 28, no. 7 p.1783-1797dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl50341x0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01756-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05043naa a2201225 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003400135040001800169100003600187245011100223300001200334506007600346520138000422592002801802506003701830650002701867650002301894650002301917650002301940650003001963650001001993650001002003650002702013650001802040650002502058650001702083650001402100650002002114650001602134650002102150650001902171650002202190650001602212700003002228700002602258700002202284700002402306700001802330700003202348700002502380700002602405700002602431700002002457700002302477700002002500700001802520700002102538700001902559700003102578700002202609700001902631700002102650700002002671700002202691700002202713700002302735700003202758700002202790700002002812700001902832700003102851700001902882700001502901700002302916700001802939700003002957700002102987700001603008700002303024700002103047700001703068700002003085700002103105700002103126700001903147700001803166700002303184700001803207700002003225700002303245700002703268700001803295700002003313700002203333700002003355700002103375700003103396700001703427700001603444700002503460700001903485700002203504700002403526700001903550700001903569700002403588773010303612856008103715852000903796655001203805IND60119425820221207111249.0190919e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011942582DNAL7 a215015002pmid7 aPMC32188662pmcid7 a10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubicek, C.

R40.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Mycoparasitism, a lifestyle where one fungus is parasitic on another fungus, has special relevance when the prey is a plant pathogen, providing a strategy for biological control of pests for plant protection. Probably, the most studied biocontrol agents are species of the genus Hypocrea/Trichoderma. RESULTS: Here we report an analysis of the genome sequences of the two biocontrol species Trichoderma atroviride (teleomorph Hypocrea atroviridis) and Trichoderma virens (formerly Gliocladium virens, teleomorph Hypocrea virens), and a comparison with Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina). These three Trichoderma species display a remarkable conservation of gene order (78 to 96%), and a lack of active mobile elements probably due to repeat-induced point mutation. Several gene families are expanded in the two mycoparasitic species relative to T. reesei or other ascomycetes, and are overrepresented in non-syntenic genome regions. A phylogenetic analysis shows that T. reesei and T. virens are derived relative to T. atroviride. The mycoparasitism-specific genes thus arose in a common Trichoderma ancestor but were subsequently lost in T. reesei. CONCLUSIONS: The data offer a better understanding of mycoparasitism, and thus enforce the development of improved biocontrol strains for efficient and environmentally friendly protection of plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrichoderma atroviride 3aTrichoderma reesei 3aTrichoderma virens 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3afungi 3agenes 3agermplasm conservation 3amycoparasites 3anucleotide sequences 3apest control 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogens 3aplant pests 3aplant protection 3apoint mutation 3asequence analysis 3ateleomorphs1 aHerrera-Estrella, Alfredo1 aSeidl-Seiboth, Verena1 aMartinez, Diego A1 aDruzhinina, Irina S1 aThon, Michael1 aZeilinger-Migsich, Susanne,1 aCasas-Flores, Sergio1 aHorwitz, Benjamin A.,1 aMukherjee, Prasun K.,1 aMukherjee, Mala1 aKredics, László,1 aAlcaraz, Luis D1 aAerts, Andrea1 aAntal, Zsuzsanna1 aAtanasova, Lea1 aCervantes-Badillo, Mayte G1 aChallacombe, Jean1 aChertkov, Olga1 aMcCluskey, Kevin1 aCoulpier, Fanny1 aDeshpande, Nandan1 avon Döhren, Hans1 aEbbole, Daniel J.,1 aEsquivel-Naranjo, Edgardo U1 aFekete, Erzsébet1 aFlipphi, Michel1 aGlaser, Fabian1 aGómez-Rodríguez, Elida Y1 aGruber, Sabine1 aHan, Cliff1 aHenrissat, Bernard1 aHermosa, Rosa1 aHernández-Oñate, Miguel1 aKaraffa, Levente1 aKosti, Idit1 aLe Crom, Stéphane1 aLindquist, Erika1 aLucas, Susan1 aLübeck, Mette,1 aLübeck, Peter S1 aMargeot, Antoine1 aMetz, Benjamin1 aMisra, Monica1 aNevalainen, Helena1 aOmann, Markus1 aPacker, Nicolle1 aPerrone, Giancarlo1 aUresti-Rivera, Edith E1 aSalamov, Asaf1 aSchmoll, Monika1 aSeiboth, Bernhard1 aShapiro, Harris1 aSukno, Serenella1 aTamayo-Ramos, Juan Antonio1 aTisch, Doris1 aWiest, Aric1 aWilkinson, Heather H1 aZhang, Michael1 aCoutinho, Pedro M1 aKenerley, Charles M1 aMonte, Enrique1 aBaker, Scott E1 aGrigoriev, Igor V.,0 tGenome biology.g2011 Apr., v. 12, no. 4 p.R40-R40dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-4-r403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008400166300001600250500002900266520102200295592002801317650002301345650001501368650002901383650002401412650001601436650001201452650001001464653000801474653001201482773010901494856008101603852000901684655001201693IND60688673020221122230216.0200416e20081101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068867302DNAL7 a10.1080/096145208023863142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradley, Megan10aOn the agenda: North–South research partnerships and agenda-setting processes  ap. 673-685.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aCo-operation between researchers in the global North and South is critical to the production of new knowledge to inform development policies. However, the agenda-setting process is a formidable obstacle in many development research partnerships. The first section of this article examines how bilateral donor strategies affect collaborative agenda-setting processes. The second section explores researchers' motivations for entering into North–South partnerships; the obstacles that Southern researchers encounter in agenda-setting processes; and the strategies that they employ to ensure that research partnerships respond to their concerns. This analysis suggests that while strong Southern research organisations are best placed to maximise the benefits of collaboration, donors and researchers alike are well advised to recognise the limitations of this approach and use it prudently, because North–South partnerships are not necessarily the best way to advance research agendas rooted in Southern priorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adevelopment policy 3amotivation 3aresearch and development 3aresearch management 3aresearchers 3arooting 3aroots 0aAid 0aMethods0 tDevelopment in practice.g2008 Nov. 1, v. 18, no. 6 p.673-685dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096145208023863143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169300001600279520127500295592002801570650002501598650001101623650001601634650002701650650002001677650002101697650001501718650002201733650002301755650001101778650001701789650002101806650001801827653001501845653001601860653001501876653001701891653001501908653003001923700001801953700002301971700002101994700002202015773009202037856008102129852000902210655001202219IND60544798520221121052345.0160901e20150819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054479852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Rupesh K.12aA label free aptasensor for Ochratoxin A detection in cocoa beans: An application to chocolate industries  ap. 106-112.  aContamination of food by mycotoxin occurs in minute/trace quantities. Nearly 92.5% of the cocoa samples present Ochratoxin A (OTA) levels at trace quantity. Hence, there is a necessity for a highly sensitive and selective device that can detect and quantify these organic toxins in various matrices such as cocoa beans. This work reports for the first time, a facile and label-free electrochemical impedimetric aptasensor for rapid detection and quantitation of OTA in cocoa beans. The developed aptasensor was constructed based on the diazonium-coupling reaction mechanism for the immobilization of anti-OTA-aptamer on screen printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs). The aptasensor exhibited a very good limit of detection (LOD) as low as 0.15 ng/mL, with added advantages of good selectivity and reproducibility. The increase in electron transfer resistance was linearly proportional to the OTA concentration in the range 0.15–2.5 ng/mL, with an acceptable recovery percentage (91–95%, RSD = 4.8%) obtained in cocoa samples. This work can facilitate a general model for the detection of OTA in cocoa beans based on the impedimetric aptasensor. The analysis can be performed onsite with pre-constructed and aptamer modified electrodes employing a portable EIS set up.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acarbon 3acocoa beans 3aconfectionery industry 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3afood contamination 3amodels 3aochratoxin A 3aoligonucleotides 3arapid methods 0aAptasensor 0aCocoa beans 0aLabel free 0aImpedimetric 0aOchratoxin 0aScreen printed electrodes1 aHayat, Akhtar1 aCatanante, Gaëlle1 aOcaña, Cristina1 aMarty, Jean-Louis0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Aug. 19, v. 889 p.106-112dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.06.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04664naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245013800207300001600345520262000361592002802981596009603009596011603105650005003221650000803271650001203279650001203291650001603303650001503319650001403334650004103348650001703389650002503406650001503431650003403446650001403480650003703494650000903531650001603540650000903556650001803565650001703583650001203600650001303612650001603625650001903641651001003660700002203670700002403692700002003716700002003736700002103756700001503777700003003792773013703822856008203959852000904041655001204050IND60643683820221119050841.0210731e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064368382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-018-0147-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiombane, Matar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6546-792610aSource patterns and contamination level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in urban and rural areas of Southern Italian soils  ap. 507-528.  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of persistent organic pollutants. They have been identified as a type of carcinogenic substance and are relatively widespread in environment media such as air, water and soils, constituting a significant hazard for human health. In many parts of the world, PAHs are still found in high concentrations despite improved legislation and monitoring, and it is therefore vital defining their profiles, and assessing their potential sources. This study focused on a large region of the south of Italy, where concentration levels, profiles, possible sources and toxicity equivalent quantity (TEQ) level of sixteen PAHs were investigated. The survey included soils from five large regions of the south of Italy: 80 soil samples (0–20 cm top layer) from urban and rural locations were collected and analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Total PAHs and individual molecular compounds from the US Environmental Protection Agency priority pollutants list were identified and measured. Results showed that 16 PAHs varied significantly in urban and rural areas, and different regions presented discordant characteristics. Urban areas presented concentrations ranging from 7.62 to 755 ng g⁻¹ (mean = 84.85 ng g⁻¹), whilst rural areas presented ranges from 1.87 to 11,353 ng g⁻¹ (mean = 333 ng g⁻¹). Large urban areas, such as Rome, Naples and Palermo, exhibited high PAHs total concentration, but high values were also found in rural areas of Campania region. Different PAHs molecular ratios were used as diagnostic fingerprinting for source identification: LWMPAHs/HWMPAHs, Fluo/(Fluo + Pyr), BaA/(BaA + Chr), Ant/(Ant + Phe) and IcdP/(IcdP + BghiP). These ratios indicated that PAHs sources in the study area were mainly of pyrogenic origin, i.e. mostly related to biomass combustion and vehicular emission. On the other hand, values in Sicilian soils seemed to indicate a petrogenic origin, possibly linked to emissions from crude oil combustion and refineries present in the region. Finally, results allowed to calculate the toxicity equivalent quantity (TEQBAP) levels for the various locations sampled, highlighting that the highest values were found in the Campania region, with 661 and 54.20 ng g⁻¹, in rural and urban areas, respectively. These findings, which could be linked to the presence of a large solid waste incinerator plant, but also to well-documented illegal waste disposal and burning, suggest that exposure to PAH may be posing an increased risk to human health in some of the studied areas.  aPublisher supplied data  aBioPoliS” PON03PE_00107_01cMinistero dell'Università e della Ricerca Scientifica, Italy  aD.

The scanning electron micrographs showed that the wing-coupling apparatuses of the five cereal aphid species were similar to the structure found in the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko). The wing-coupling apparatuses were composed of a forewing fold and a set of spiral-shaped (or twice-curved) hindwing hamuli. The hindwing hamuli were not fish hook-like (or once-curved) structures. Previous light-microscopy description of fish hook-like hamuli was the result of limited resolving power and field depth of light microscopy. The number of hamuli varied among and within the aphid species. An asymmetric number of the hamuli between the left and right hindwings were also found in all aphids. Rhopalosiphum padi and D. tritici had the least number of the hamuli, ranging from one to four, whereas S. avenae had the most hamuli, ranging from five to seven. Wing-coupling mechanisms and possible use of the hamuli as a taxonomic character are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 0acereal aphids 0ahindwing hamuli 0awing-coupling apparatus 0aSternorrhyncha 0ataxonomy1 aJohnson, Gregory D.1 aQuisenberry, Sharron S.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2002 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.109-114dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282002%29095%5B0109%3ACOHHFF%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04006naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245012500212300001600337500001900353520205700372592002802429596003502457650001502492650001302507650003302520650002002553650002002573650001902593650002002612650001902632650002102651650001402672650000902686650001702695650002202712650001302734650001402747650001602761650001302777650001802790650002702808650001502835650001802850700005402868700006102922700005902983700005603042700006503098700005803163773012803221856008203349852000903431655001203440IND60707263620221120124322.0200819e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070726362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-020-00695-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, Rasmus Jes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9930-620X10aNitrate reduction pathways and interactions with iron in the drainage water infiltration zone of a riparian wetland soil  ap. 235-255.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEutrophication of natural water bodies is moderated by transformation of nitrate (NO₃⁻) in riparian wetlands, which serve as filters of infiltrating drain water from upland agricultural areas. The present study comprised field observations, laboratory experiments and metagenomic studies to describe NO₃⁻ removing transformation pathways and interactions with the cycling of iron (Fe) in a temperate riparian wetland soil profile down to 1 m depth. Water samples from piezometers showed a distinct plume of NO₃⁻ in the subsurface soil where agricultural drain water was infiltrating. However, within a distance of few meters in the water flow direction, NO₃⁻ was depleted from the percolating water. Sampling and analyses of soil from the active zone of the biogeochemical NO₃⁻ removal showed that denitrifying enzyme activity was ~ tenfold higher in the upper 0–25 cm than in the lower 25–100 cm. Yet, net transformation of NO₃⁻ was substantial also at 25–100 cm when assayed with relatively undisturbed soil samples and by ¹⁵N tracer techniques in soil slurries. Transformation pathways of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and anaerobic ammonium oxidation were identified, but were quantitatively minor as compared to denitrification. Heterotrophic denitrification and denitrification mediated by oxidation of ferrous iron, Fe(II), were identified as important processes in the wetland soil. The latter was substantiated by geochemical observations, by rates of NO₃⁻ depletion in slurry incubations with added FeCl₂, and by identification of microorganisms with known capacity of NO₃⁻ reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation (Acidovorax sp.). The transformation pathway of iron-mediated NO₃⁻ reduction could involve biotic and abiotic reactions, and N₂O, which is a potent greenhouse gas, was a major product of the process. It remains to be seen under field conditions if N₂O emission hotspots are linked to specific sites of dynamic NO₃⁻ reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data  a4106-00027BcInnovationsfonden 3aAcidovorax 3aammonium 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abiogeochemistry 3adenitrification 3adrainage water 3aenzyme activity 3aeutrophication 3agreenhouse gases 3ahighlands 3airon 3ametagenomics 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3apiezometers 3aslurries 3asoil profiles 3asubsurface soil layers 3awater flow 3awetland soils1 aLiang, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9510-92811 aPrinds, Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2631-72281 aJéglot, Arnaud1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5768-58431 aThamdrup, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1221-70771 aKjaergaard, Charlotte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9134-82931 aElsgaard, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0058-76090 tBiogeochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 150, no. 2 p.235-255dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl36028x0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-020-00695-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02915naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245018000154300002000334520128900354592002801643650004401671650002101715650001801736650001601754650001801770650001701788650001201805650001901817650001401836650001401850650001901864650001501883650003301898650002301931650000901954650001301963650001101976650003201987700001602019700001802035700001802053700001802071700001202089700002002101700001502121700001602136700001402152773012402166856007402290852000902364655001202373IND60619246220221120220207.0181031e20181022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061924622DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra07123c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yao10aPreparation and evaluation of poly(ester-urethane) urea/gelatin nanofibers based on different crosslinking strategies for potential applications in vascular tissue engineering  ap. 35917-35927.  aDue to the brittleness of gelatin, the resulting absence of mechanical performance restricts its applications in vascular tissue engineering. In this research, the fabrication of poly(ester-urethane) urea/gelatin (PU75) nanofibers via an electrospinning technique, followed by different crosslinking methods, resulted in the improvement of its mechanical properties. Poly(ester urethane) urea (PEUU) nanofibrous scaffolds and PU75-based nanofibrous scaffolds were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD), a mechanical properties test, a cytocompatibility assay, a hemolysis assay, and a histological analysis. Water contact angle (WCA) tests confirmed that the PU75-GA (PU75 nanofibers crosslinked with glutaraldehyde vapor) nanofibrous scaffold surfaces became more hydrophilic compared with other crosslinked nanofibrous scaffolds. The results show that the PU75-GA nanofibrous scaffold exhibited a combination of excellent mechanical properties, suitable pore diameters, hydrophilic properties, good cytocompatibility, and reliable hemocompatibility. Overall, PU75-GA nanofibers may be a potential scaffold for artificial blood vessel construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiocompatibility 3ablood vessels 3abrittleness 3acontact angle 3acrosslinking 3agelatin 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahemolysis 3ahistology 3ahydrophilicity 3ananofibers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atissue engineering 3aurea 3aurethane 3avapors 3awide-angle X-ray scattering1 aZhu, Tonghe1 aKuang, Haizhu1 aSun, Xiaoning1 aZhu, Jingjing1 aShi, Yu1 aWang, Chunsheng1 aMo, Xiumei1 aLu, Shuyang1 aHong, Tao0 tRSC advances.g2018 Oct. 22, v. 8, no. 63 p.35917-35927dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra07123c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012300171300001600294520060600310592002800916650001700944650001700961650002100978650001900999650002801018653002201046653003301068653003401101700001801135700002001153700001401173773007701187856008501264852000901349655001201358IND60582250420221118110313.0171005e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058225042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2016.07.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiao-Hong12aA naphthalene-based two-photon fluorescent probe for selective and sensitive detection of endogenous hypochlorous acid  ap. 470-474.  aAn efficient naphthalene-based two-photon fluorescent probe for endogenous HClO has been reported in the present study, which consists of a 6-(2-benzothiazolyl)-2-naphthalenol fluorophore connected with a 4-aminophenol (the fluorescence quenching and response group).

Apart from the cerebral task of bringing together two different viewpoints, the question at the pragmatic level remains ‘who benefits whom’.The aim is to highlight the challenges in integration of information (Ayurvedic) and technology using test examples of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolomics and anti-HIV-1 potential of select Ayurvedic medicinal plants. The other value added objective is implications and relevance of such work for Ayurveda.Six medicinal plants (Azadirachta indica, Tinospora cordifolia, Swertia chirata, Terminalia bellerica, Zingiber officinale and Symplocos racemosa) were studied using high resolution proton NMR spectroscopy based metabolomics and also evaluated for anti-HIV-1 activity on three pseudoviruses (ZM53 M.PB12, ZM109F.PB4, RHPA 4259.7).Of the six plants, T. bellerica and Z. officinale showed minimum cell cytotoxicity and maximum anti-HIV-1 potential. T. bellerica was effective against all the three HIV-1 pseudoviruses. Untargeted NMR profiling and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the six plants, all of which had different Ayurvedic pharmacological properties, showed maximum differences in the aromatic region of the spectra.The work adds onto the list of potential plants for anti-HIV-1 drug molecules. At the same time, it has drawn attention to the different perspectives of Ayurveda and Western medicine underscoring the inherent limitations of conceptual bilinguism between the two systems, especially in the context of medicinal plants. The study has also highlighted the potential of NMR metabolomics in study of plant extracts as used in Ayurveda.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aAzadirachta indica 3aPseudoviridae 3aSwertia chirayita 3aSymplocos racemosa 3aTerminalia 3aTinospora cordifolia 3aZingiber officinale 3aantiretroviral agents 3acytotoxicity 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aNMR metabolomics 0aAnti-HIV-1 plants 0aAyurvedic pharmacology1 aGhatak, Somenath1 aMakhdoomi, Muzamil Ashraf1 aLuthra, Kalpana1 aSingh, Aruna1 aVelpandian, Thirumurthy0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2019 Apr.,  June, v. 10, no. 2 p.94-101dElsevier B.V.aTransdisciplinary University, Bangalore and World Ayurveda FoundationwJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2017.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02736naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245018000192300001600372520166900388592002802057653002102085653001302106653002202119653002502141700002802166773013802194856011702332852000902449655001202458IND60126929520221119223931.0151108e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012692952DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0125:GSOAAD]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBirungi, Josephine10aGenetic Structure of Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) Populations Based on Mitochondrial ND5 Sequences: Evidence for an Independent Invasion into Brazil and United States  ap. 125-132.  aAedes albopictus (Skuse), Asian tiger mosquito, a dengue fever vector, colonized the United States and Brazil ≈≈15 yr ago. The geographic origin and changes in population structure were examined using DNA sequences of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5). A 450 bp region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened for variation by both the single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) mutation detection technique and direct sequencing. The United States populations were typified by some local differentiation, but the most common and widespread haplotype was characteristic of the native range (Asian) populations as well. A comparison of the native range populations with the United States populations indicated a shared ancestral origin. The Brazil populations contained private (population specific) haplotypes, indicating no genetic exchange between the Brazil and the United States populations since introduction. Local differentiation was not observed among Brazil populations in contrast to the United States populations; this suggested distinctive dispersal mechanisms in the two countries. Extremely low variability was present in the A. albopictus mitochondrial sequences when contrasted with other taxa, reflecting a history of dispersal from a narrow genetic base. In contrast, relatively high levels of variation in several sequenced nuclear loci indicated the following colonization sequence: (1) the founding population was small, genetic drift had insufficient time to reduce variation at nuclear loci, and (2) populations successively expanded to new geographic areas established from a few founder females.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAedes albopictus 0ainvasion 0amitochondrial DNA 0apopulation structure1 aMunstermann, Leonard E.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2002 Jan., v. 95, no. 1 p.125-132dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282002%29095%5B0125%3AGSOAAD%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012300153300001600276520119400292592002801486650003701514650002501551650002801576650001901604650001201623650001301635650001801648650001101666650001601677650001101693650000901704650001501713650001201728650002901740650002601769650001601795700001801811700001801829773010501847856007501952852000902027655001202036IND60532756920221118001122.0160728e20130211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053275692DNAL7 a10.1021/bm301523p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yang10aControl over the Gradient Differentiation of Rat BMSCs on a PCL Membrane with Surface-Immobilized Alendronate Gradient  ap. 342-349.  aGradient biomaterials can offer progressively changing signals to specific tissue interface, and thereby modulate the conjunction between different tissues. A linear density gradient of alendronate (Aln), a molecule that is capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), was created on an aminolyzed poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) membrane. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation revealed the linear increase of the Aln amount as a function of the position on the PCL membrane. By contrast, the surface wettability and energy were kept unchanged. The surface-grafted Aln showed a stronger ability to induce the osteogenic differentiation of rat BMSCs than its counterpart in culture medium of the same amount, and the osteo-inductive culture medium. On the Aln-grafted gradient surface, the BMSCs showed gradient osteogenic differentiation as a function of membrane position in terms of cell morphology, alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium deposition, and the expression of osteogenesis marker proteins including collagen type I (COL I), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and osteocalcin (OCN).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abiocompatible materials 3abone formation 3acalcium 3acollagen 3aculture media 3aenergy 3aosteocalcin 3aquartz 3arats 3astem cells 3atissues 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awettability1 aMao, Zhengwei1 aGao, Changyou0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 Feb. 11, v. 14, no. 2 p.342-349dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm301523p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01721naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245010500156300001200261520046500273592002800738650002200766650001400788650004100802650001500843650001100858650001500869650001900884650002600903650001200929650002300941653004800964653001501012653002501027700002001052700001601072773014801088856007801236852000901314655001201323IND60523057720221119180852.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052305772DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2005-1-2012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qun10a6-Substituted Indanoyl Isoleucine Conjugate Induces Tobacco Plant Responses in Secondary Metabolites  ap. 1-4.  aTo characterize the role of the phytotoxin mimic 6-substituted indanoyl isoleucine conjugate 1 in plant secondary metabolism, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.

A natural experiment provided by the inferred phylogenetic relationships and host associations of a tribe of ant guest beetles allows for a novel test of the phylogenetic utility of behavior. Historical and current evolutionary forces have acted in opposition during recent behavioral evolution, making it possible to determine the relative evolutionary lability of two general classes of behavioral characters. I dissected the behavioral phenotype into two components and tested for the relative presence of these two opposing forces on each behavioral component. Behavior was broken up into the continuously differing behavioral component (durations of functionally similar beetle behaviors) and the discretely differing behavioral component (species-typical behaviors). Conducting a series of statistic and cladistic tests on each component separately, I concluded that current evolutionary forces primarily determined the continuous behavioral component, because it was most similar among heterogeneric, nestmate beetle species. In contrast, I concluded that ancient evolutionary forces determined the discrete component because it was most similar among congeneric, non-nestmate species. These results support two hypotheses. First, the durations for which behaviors are performed evolve quicker than do species-typical behavioral traits. Second, species-typical behavioral characters are often as nonhomoplastic for phylogenetic reconstruction as are morphological characters.  aPublisher supplied data 0aant-guest beetles 0abehavioral evolution 0aancient evolutionary forces 0acoevolution 0amyrmecophily 0acladistics0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2002 Mar., v. 95, no. 2 p.143-155dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282002%29095%5B0143%3AELAPUO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010100171300001600272520106600288592002801354650001401382650001901396650001301415650001201428650002501440650001601465650001301481650000901494650000901503650001201512650001601524650002001540650001501560651001601575653004401591653002901635653001301664653001901677653001201696653002901708653002101737653001501758653003001773700002001803700001501823773012301838856008401961852000902045655001202054IND60122848120221123033243.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012284812DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2014.8926012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHendriks, D.M.D.10aGroundwater impact on environmental flow needs of streams in sandy catchments in the Netherlands  ap. 562-577.  aDuring recent years, water managers and water users in the Netherlands experienced water shortages in numerous streams. Besides low rainfall amounts and high temperatures, anthropogenic alterations to the groundwater system are also responsible for the reduced baseflow in streams. These alterations may reduce resilience and increase a risk to streams as more droughts are expected in the Netherlands due to climate change. We propose a methodology to assess the impact of groundwater-related alterations and climate change on baseflow and environmental flow needs (EFN). Application of this methodology for two sandy catchments showed that, under average meteorological conditions, baseflow in the main streams still meets the EFN requirements. During dry years, baseflow is probably insufficient in the upper parts of the catchments. Anthropogenic alterations show a significant impact: drainage caused 25–40% baseflow reduction, groundwater abstractions caused 5–28% and climate change will potentially cause an additional reduction of 33–70% by 2050.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3aclimate change 3adrainage 3adrought 3aenvironmental impact 3agroundwater 3amanagers 3arain 3arisk 3astreams 3atemperature 3awater shortages 3awatersheds 3aNetherlands 0agroundwater–surface water interaction 0aenvironmental flow needs 0abaseflow 0aclimate change 0adrought 0aanthropogenic alteration 0asandy catchments 0aresilience 0awater framework directive1 aKuijper, M.J.M.1 avan Ek, R.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 59, no. 3-4 p.562-577dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2014.8926013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245004600167300001700213520166500230592002801895650001201923650002001935650001701955650001701972650001201989650000902001650002602010650001502036650001402051650001502065650001902080650001802099650002102117650001502138650001502153651001502168700002002183773009802203856004802301852000902349655001202358IND50069821520221122110252.0131018e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006982152DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293131000492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLupachev, A.

Despite the extremely severe wind regime (the average wind velocity is 13 m/s, and the maximum wind velocity is up to 60 m/s), the projective cover of vegetation in the area of the station averages 25–40% and reaches 60–80% in some places. The phenomena of physical weathering of the bedrock-exfoliation, stone pavements, residual rocks exposed by wind (hoodoos), and others-are clearly manifested. In most of the described soils, normal organic and organomineral horizons are absent. The soil profiles represent the mixture of the residues of mosses and lichens and the gravelly eluvium. The fine earth material is blown out of the surface horizons by strong winds; its residual accumulation takes place in the middle and lower parts of the profiles. The classification position of these soils is open to argument; they are close to Petrozems and Lithozems. Most of the profiles are underlain by the massive or slightly disintegrated bedrock with dry permafrost at a depth of 20 to 50 cm. Soils with dry permafrost comprise about 75% of the surveyed area. In separate loci in the depressions of the local mesorelief and on gentle slopes, the soils with clearly expressed cryoturbation features are developed; their profiles are underlain by the ice-rich permafrost and compose about 15% of the surveyed area. Anthropogenically disturbed soils and soils polluted with petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and other pollutants occupy about 10% of the surveyed area.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3adisturbed soils 3aheavy metals 3ahydrocarbons 3alichens 3aloci 3amosses and liverworts 3apermafrost 3apetroleum 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3asoil profiles 3avegetation cover 3aweathering 3awind speed 3aAntarctica1 aAbakumov, E.

The content of the gastroprotective diterpene solidagenone as well as the phenolics chlorogenic acid (CA) and rutin was determined either in rhizomes from wild growing plants and in callus and in in vitro regenerated plantlets by analytical HPLC. Additionally, total phenolic and flavonoid content was assessed in plant samples, callus and cell suspensions. In terms of dry starting material, the percentual solidagenone content in nine S. chilensis samples ranged from 0.5-3.5% for rhizomes from wild growing plants, 0.1-0.3% for callus and 0.3% for an in vitro regenerated plantlet, respectively. The highest solidagenone contents were found in the wild plant during the late summer in the months of March and April (3.5- 2.2%) while highest values for chlorogenic acid (0.5%) and rutin (0.4%) were detected in May, before senescence. The callus tissue and cell suspensions contained some 1.8-2.0 and 1.2% of total phenolics, respectively. CA was the main phenolic in the cell suspension while only traces were found in the callus. Rutin was not detected in the callus nor cell culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolidago 3acallus 3acallus culture 3acell suspension culture 3achlorogenic acid 3aditerpenoids 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aphenolic compounds 3aplantlets 3arhizomes 3arutin 3asecondary metabolites 3ashoot tips 3asummer 3awild plants 0aIn vitro Propagation 0aSecondary Metabolite Content 0aSolidago chilensis1 aJordan, Miguel1 aGerth, André1 aWilken, Dirk0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 60, no. 1-2 p.5-10dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2005-1-2023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245014900189300001600338520065800354592002801012653003701040653002301077653002001100653001001120700001601130773013801146856011701284852000901401655001201410IND60126929720221119223748.0151108e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012692972DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0156:MPOTDV]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpicer, Greg S.10aMolecular Phylogeny of the Drosophila virilis Species Group (Diptera: Drosophilidae) Inferred from Mitochondrial 12S and 16S Ribosomal RNA Genes  ap. 156-161.  aThe phylogenetic relationships among all members of the Drosophila virilis Sturtevant species group were inferred from mitochondrial DNA [[partial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA)ᵛᵃˡ, and partial 12S rRNA]] sequence data.

Wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) and total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) methods were applied to study the bromine distributions in lake sediment cores. Conventional WDXRF technique usually requires relatively large mass of a sediment sample and a set of calibration samples. Some analytical approaches were developed to apply WDXRF to small sediment core samples in the absence of adequate calibration samples with a known Br content. The mass of a sample to be analyzed was reduced up to 200–300mg and the internal standard method with correction using fundamental parameters was developed for Br quantification. TXRF technique based on the direct analysis of a solid suspension using 20mg of sediment sample by internal standard method was additionally tested. The accuracy of the WDXRF and TXRF techniques was assessed by the comparative analysis of reference materials of sediments, soil and biological samples. In general, good agreement was achieved between the reference values and the measured values. The detection limits of Br were 1mg/kg and 0.4mg/kg for WDXRF and TXRF respectively. The results of the Br determination obtained with different XRF techniques were comparable to each other and used for paleoclimatic reconstructions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3abromine 3afluorescence 3alakes 3asediments 3asoil 3awavelengths 0aX-ray fluorescence analysis 0aWDXRF 0aTXRF 0aSediments 0aBromine 0aPaleoclimate1 aAisueva, Tatyana S.1 aFinkelshtein, Alexander L.1 aIvanov, Egor V.1 aShchetnikov, Alexander A.0 tTalanta.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 160 p.375-380dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2016.07.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245010600189300001600295520124300311592002801554653001401582653001401596653001501610653001401625700002001639773013801659856011701797852000901914655001201923IND60126929820221119223620.0151108e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012692982DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0162:MPOTNA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chung Ping10aMolecular Phylogeny of the North American Enchenopa binotata (Homoptera: Membracidae) Species Complex  ap. 162-171.  aThe North American Enchenopa binotata (Say) species complex is a model of sympatric speciation in which phytophagous insects are hypothesized to diverge through host-plant specialization resulting from changes in host plant usage that alter life history timing. A robust phylogeny is needed to evaluate the historical relevance of the prediction that sister taxa differ in critical life-history traits. Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony and likelihood criteria of 2305 nucleotides in sequences from mitochondrial COI, COII, tRNA-Leucine, and 12S genes revealed two pairs of sister taxa. Both pairs of sister taxa differ from each other in the timing of egg hatch in the spring that is mediated by differences in host-plant phenology. Host plant mediated timing of egg hatch results in asynchronous life histories among sister taxa facilitating reproductive isolation. Sister taxa of Enchenopa from Celastrus and from Viburnum differ in their diurnal and temporal spans during which mating occurs. Mating of Enchenopa from Liriodendron takes place after that of its sister species on Cercis. These results support the hypothesis that speciation could have been initiated through a shift to a host plant that alters life-history timing.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHomoptera 0aEnchenopa 0aspeciation 0asympatric1 aWood, Thomas K.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2002 Mar., v. 95, no. 2 p.162-171dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282002%29095%5B0162%3AMPOTNA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007100170300001600241520179000257592002802047650002902075650002302104650001702127650001402144650002302158650001402181650001902195650001402214650001102228650002202239651001002261653002302271653001402294653003302308653001002341700001902351773012302370856008402493852000902577655001202586IND60122848320221123033248.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012284832DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2014.8969962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Sharad K.10aEnvironmental flows in India: towards sustainable water management  ap. 751-769.  aThe strong wet and dry seasons of tropical monsoon hydrology in India necessitate development of storage and flow diversion schemes for utilization of water to meet various social and economic needs. However, the river valley schemes may cause adverse flow-related impacts due to storage, flow diversion, tunnelling and spoil disposal. There may be critical reaches in which altered flows are not able to sustain the river channel ecology and riparian environment that existed prior to implementation of the storage and diversion schemes. In the past, environmental flows in India have usually been understood as the minimum flow to be released downstream from a dam as compensation for riparian rights, without considering the impacts on the river ecosystem. Rivers in India have been significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities over the past 60 years and have great social and religious significance to the vast population. This paper explores various aspects of past, present and future environmental flow assessment (EFA) in India highlighted by case studies from rivers across the nation. It demonstrates that multidisciplinary studies requiring expertise from a range of fields are needed for EFA, and that environmental flows are necessary for aquatic ecosystems to remain in a healthy state and for the sustainable use of water resources. The major focus areas for the development of EFA research in India are the creation of a shareable database for hydrological, ecological and socioeconomic data, developing hydrology–ecology relationships, evaluation of ecosystem services, addressing pollution due to anthropogenic activities and promotion of research on EFA. At the same time, efforts will be needed to develop new methods or refine existing methods for India.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acase studies 3adatabases 3aecosystem services 3ahydrology 3amonsoon season 3apollution 3arivers 3awater utilization 3aIndia 0aenvironmental flow 0aecosystem 0asustainable water management 0aIndia1 aKumar, Pradeep0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 59, no. 3-4 p.751-769dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2014.8969963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01923naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008000161300002000241520075600261592002801017650001101045650001501056650001401071650001601085650002601101650001001127650001601137651001001153700002101163700001801184700002201202700002101224700001701245700002301262700002001285773013601305856007501441852000901516655001201525IND60536931120221121234812.0160807e20121003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053693112DNAL7 a10.1021/ie202676b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerndon, Scott C.10aApplication of the Carbon Balance Method to Flare Emissions Characteristics  ap. 12577-12585.  aThe destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) computation of target hydrocarbon species in the flaring process is derived using carbon balance methodologies.

Because species in the complex are diagnosed by their song phenotypes and not by morphology, the current systematic status of the type species has become a problem. Here, we attempt to determine which song species corresponds to Stephens’’ 1835 concept of C. carnea, originally based on a small series of specimens collected in or near London and currently housed in The Natural History Museum. With six European members of the complex from which to choose, we narrow the field to just three that have been collected in England: C. lucasina (Lacroix), Cc2 ‘‘slow-motorboat’’, and Cc4 ‘‘motorboat’’. Ecophysiology eliminates C. lucasina, because that species remains green during adult winter diapause, while Cc2 and Cc4 share with Stephens’’ type a change to brownish or reddish color in winter. We then describe the songs, ecology, adult morphology, and larval morphology of Cc2 and Cc4, making statistical comparisons between the two species. Results strongly reinforce the conclusion that Cc2 and Cc4 deserve separate species status. In particular, adult morphology displays several subtle but useful differences between the species, including the shape of the basal dilation of the metatarsal claw and the genital ‘‘lip’’ and ‘‘chin’’ of the male abdomen, color and coarseness of the sternal setae at the tip of the abdomen and on the genital lip, and pigment distribution on the stipes of the maxilla. Furthermore, behavioral choice experiments involving playback of conspecific versus heterospecific songs to individuals of Cc2 and Cc4 demonstrate strong reproductive isolation between the two species. Comparison of the adult morphology of song-determined specimens to that of preserved specimens in the original type series and in other collections in The Natural History Museum, London, indicate that the ‘‘true’’ Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) is Cc4. Cc2 cannot be confidently associated with any previously described species and is therefore assigned a new name, Chrysoperla pallida sp. nov., and formally described.  aPublisher supplied data 0asystematics 0acourtship song 0atremulation 0asibling species 0acryptic species 0aEurope1 aBrooks, Stephen J.1 aDuelli, Peter1 aJohnson, James B.0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2002 Mar., v. 95, no. 2 p.172-191dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282002%29095%5B0172%3ADTTCCI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009400165520145900259592002801718650002101746650002301767650001901790650001801809650001301827650002101840650001701861651001001878700002601888700002001914700002101934773012101955856007402076852000902150655001202159IND60757730120221121061224.0211125e20211027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075773012DNAL7 a10.3390/f121114702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBautista, Inmaculada 10aMid-Term Effects of Forest Thinning on N Mineralization in a Semi-Arid Aleppo Pine Forest  aIn order to assess the sustainability of silvicultural treatments in semiarid forests, it is necessary to know how they affect the nutrient dynamics in the forest. The objective of this paper is to study the effects of silvicultural treatments on the net N mineralization and the available mineral N content in the soil after 13 years following forest clearings. The treatments were carried out following a randomized block design, with four treatments and two blocks. The distance between the two blocks was less than 3 km; they were located in Chelva (CH) and Tuéjar (TU) in Valencia, Spain. Within each block, four experimental clearing treatments were carried out in 1998: T0 control; and T60, T75 and T100 where 60%, 75% and 100 of basal area was eliminated, respectively. Nitrogen dynamics were measured using the resin tube technique, with disturbed samples due to the high stoniness of the plots. Thirteen years after the experimental clearings, T100, T75 and T60 treatments showed a twofold increase in the net mineralization and nitrification rates with respect to T0 in both blocks (TU and CH). Within the plots, the highest mineralization was found in sites with no plant cover followed by those covered by undergrowth. These results can be explained in terms of the different litterfall qualities, which in turn are the result of the proportion of material originating from Pinus halepensis Mill. vs. more decomposable undergrowth residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus halepensis 3aconiferous forests 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aplant litter 3aSpain1 aLado-Monserrat, Luis 1 aLull, Cristina 1 aLidón, Antonio 0 tForests.g2021 Oct. 27, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121114703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02939naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012300157300002000280520149000300592002801790650004401818650002201862650001501884650001301899650001901912650002001931650001601951650002001967650002401987650001902011650002502030650001802055650001502073650001302088650001302101650002102114650003702135700001802172700001302190700001302203700001802216700001602234773012402250856007402374852000902448655001202457IND60619246720221120220020.0181031e20181025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061924672DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra07316c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Xinhua12aA convenient separation method for di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate by novel superparamagnetic molecularly imprinted polymers  ap. 36191-36199.  aThrough a surface molecular imprinting technique and coating superparamagnetic Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), a novel magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer (MMIP) was successfully fabricated for the convenient separation of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) with methacrylic acid as functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as cross linker and 2,2-azobis(isobutyronitrile) as initiator. A magnetic non-molecularly imprinted polymer (MNIP) was also prepared for comparison purposes. The morphology structure and the magnetic properties of MMIP were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The adsorption properties of MMIP and MNIP were investigated by static and dynamic adsorption experiments. The results show that the diameter of the synthesized MMIP microspheres is about 300–500 nm with good dispersibility in solvent. The prepared MMIP shows superparamagnetic properties with the maximum saturation magnetic intensity of 43.97 emu g⁻¹, and it can be conveniently separated using an external magnetic field. Compared with MNIP, MMIP has a higher adsorption capacity and better adsorption selectivity for DEHP, and the imprinting factor reaches 3.012. The regeneration adsorption experiment illuminates that the novel MMIP can be reused with good separation efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acoatings 3adispersibility 3aethylene glycol 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic properties 3amicroparticles 3amolecular imprinting 3ananoparticles 3aphthalates 3apolymers 3asolvents 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aLiu, Tiantian1 aGao, Lei1 aXing, Lu1 aZhu, Yingying1 aLi, Songjun0 tRSC advances.g2018 Oct. 25, v. 8, no. 63 p.36191-36199dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra07316c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245013300189300001600322520123000338592002801568653003001596653001701626653002301643653001701666653001101683700002101694773013801715856011701853852000901970655001201979IND60126930020221119231057.0151108e200203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012693002DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2002)095[0192:LHALRO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradshaw, J.

The bug also was reared from egg to adult under controlled laboratory conditions. This univoltine species occurred on the rock faces of sandstone bluffs often in association with plants and spider webs. Adults and nymphs preyed primarily on small flies. Adults overwintered within fallen leaves on the bluff outcroppings, emerged in early April, and began feeding and reproducing shortly thereafter. Eggs were found from early May to late October and were deposited on the leaves and stems of Heuchera parviflora Bartling. Nymphs were found from early June to early September. New adults appeared in mid-July and remained active until early October. This species was reared in the laboratory on adult Drosophila sp. at 26 ±± 3.0°°C under a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. The incubation period averaged 13.25 d; eyespots appeared in ≈≈7 d. The five stadia averaged 11.86, 11.77, 12.44, 15.35, and 18.88 d, respectively. The instars can be distinguished by differences in several anatomical features including body length and width.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPseudometapterus umbrosus 0alife history 0alaboratory rearing 0adescriptions 0anymphs1 aMcPherson, J.

Specifically, biocompatible naphthalene-terminated PEG (NP) and anticancer drugs (curcumin or doxorubicin (DOX)) were simultaneously integrated onto oxidized graphene (GO), leading to self-assembled, nanosized complexes. It was found that the oxidation degree of GO had a significant impact on the drug-loading efficiency and the structural stability of nanosystems. Interestingly, the nanoassemblies resulted in more effective cellular entry of DOX in comparison with free DOX or DOX-loaded PEG-polyester micelles at equivalent DOX dose, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy studies. Moreover, the nanoassemblies not only exhibited a sustained drug release pattern without an initial burst release, but also significantly improved the stability of formulations which were resistant to drug leaking even in the presence of strong surfactants such as aromatic sodium benzenesulfonate (SBen) and aliphatic sodium dodecylsulfonate (SDS). In addition, the nanoassemblies without DOX loading showed negligible in vitro cytotoxicity, whereas DOX-loaded counterparts led to considerable toxicity against HeLa cells. The DOX-mediated cytotoxicity of the graphene-based formulation was around 20 folds lower than that of free DOX, most likely due to the slow DOX release from complexes. A zebrafish model was established to assess the in vivo safety profile of curcumin-loaded nanosystems. The results showed they were able to excrete from the zebrafish body rapidly and had nearly no influence on the zebrafish upgrowth. Those encouraging results may prompt the advance of graphene-based nanotherapeutics for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abiosafety 3aconfocal microscopy 3acurcumin 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3agraphene 3amicelles 3amodels 3aoxidation 3asodium 3asodium dodecyl sulfonate 3asurfactants1 aXiong, Feng1 aJia, Hui-Zhen1 aWang, Xu-Li1 aCheng, Han1 aSun, Yong-Hua1 aZhang, Xian-Zheng1 aZhuo, Ren-Xi1 aFeng, Jun0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 Feb. 11, v. 14, no. 2 p.358-366dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm30152973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04185naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245022700161300002000388520234000408592002802748650001502776650001702791650001302808650001102821650001202832650001202844650001102856650001502867650002602882650001402908650001302922650002102935650001702956650002002973650000902993650001203002650002203014650001203036650001303048650001603061650001203077650001403089650002403103650000903127650001803136650001003154650003103164700002203195700002103217700001803238700002003256700002003276700002303296700002003319773013603339856007503475852000903550655001203559IND60536931320221120141551.0160807e20121003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053693132DNAL7 a10.1021/ie202695v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnighton, W. Berk10aDirect measurement of volatile organic compound emissions from industrial flares using real-time online techniques: Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry and Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectroscopy  ap. 12674-12684.  aDuring the 2010 Comprehensive Flare Study a suite of analytical instrumentation was employed to monitor and quantify in real-time the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions emanating from an industrial chemical process flare burning either propene/natural gas or propane/natural gas. To our knowledge this represents the first time the VOC composition has been directly measured as a function of flare efficiency on an operational full-scale flare. This compositional information was obtained using a suite of proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometers (PTR-MS) and quantum cascade laser tunable infrared differential absorption spectrometers (QCL-TILDAS) to measure the unburned fuel and associated combustion byproducts. Methane, ethyne, ethene, and formaldehyde were measured using the QC-TILDAS. Propene, acetaldehyde, methanol, benzene, acrolein, and the sum of the C₃H₆O isomers were measured with the PTR-MS. A second PTR-MS equipped with a gas chromatograph (GC) was operated in parallel and was used to verify the identity of the neutral components that were responsible for producing the ions monitored with the first PTR-MS. Additional components including 1,3-butadiene and C₃H₄ (propyne or allene) were identified using the GC/PTR-MS. The propene concentrations derived from the PTR-MS were found to agree with measurements made using a conventional GC with a flame ionization detector (FID). The VOC product (excludes fuel components) speciation profile is more dependent on fuel composition, propene versus propane, than on flare type, air-assisted versus steam-assisted, and is essentially constant with respect to combustion efficiency for combustion efficiencies >0.8. Propane flares produce more alkenes with ethene and propene accounting for approximately 80% (per carbon basis) of the VOC combustion product. The propene partial combustion product profile was observed to contain relatively more oxygenated material where formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are major contributors and account for ∼20 - 25% of VOC product carbon. Steam-assisted flares produce less ethyne and benzene than air-assisted flares. This observation is consistent with the understanding that steam assisted flares are more efficient at reducing soot, which is formed via the same reaction mechanisms that form benzene and ethyne.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetaldehyde 3aacrolein 3aallene 3abenzene 3aburning 3acarbon 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3aemissions 3aethylene 3aflame ionization 3aformaldehyde 3ainstrumentation 3aions 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3amethane 3amethanol 3anatural gas 3apropane 3apropylene 3areaction mechanisms 3asoot 3aspectrometers 3asteam 3avolatile organic compounds1 aHerndon, Scott C.1 aFranklin, Jon F.1 aWood, Ezra C.1 aWormhoudt, Jody1 aBrooks, William1 aFortner, Edward C.1 aAllen, David T.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Oct. 03, v. 51, no. 39 p.12674-12684dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie202695v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010500168300001600273520209300289592002802382650002302410650001702433650002502450650002502475650002302500650001102523650002502534650001602559650001102575650001702586650002102603650001802624650001502642650001302657651001102670651001402681651001902695651001102714651001802725653000902743653002302752653002402775653001902799700001602818700001502834700001802849700001802867700002002885700001602905773012302921856008403044852000903128655001203137IND60122848520221123033340.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012284852DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2014.8974082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOverton, I.C.10aImplementing environmental flows in integrated water resources management and the ecosystem approach  ap. 860-877.  aIn many of the world’s river basins, the water resources are over-allocated and/or highly modified, access to good quality water is limited or competitive and aquatic ecosystems are degraded. The decline in aquatic ecosystems can impact on human well-being by reducing the ecosystem services provided by healthy rivers, wetlands and floodplains. Basin water resources management requires the determination of water allocation among competing stakeholders including the environment, social needs and economic development. Traditionally, this determination occurred on a volumetric basis to meet basin productivity goals. However, it is difficult to address environmental goals in such a framework, because environmental condition is rarely considered in productivity goals, and short-term variations in river flow may be the most important driver of aquatic ecosystem health. Manipulation of flows to achieve desired outcomes for public supply, food and energy has been implemented for many years. More recently, manipulating flows to achieve ecological outcomes has been proposed. However, the complexity of determining the required flow regimes and the interdependencies between stakeholder outcomes has restricted the implementation of environmental flows as a core component of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). We demonstrate through case studies of the Rhône and Thames river basins in Europe, the Colorado River basin in North America and the Murray-Darling basin in Australia the limitations of traditional environmental flow strategies in integrated water resources management. An alternative ecosystem approach can provide a framework for implementation of environmental flows in basin water resources management, as demonstrated by management of the Pangani River basin in Africa. An ecosystem approach in IWRM leads to management for agreed triple-bottom-line outcomes, rather than productivity or ecological outcomes alone. We recommend that environmental flow management should take on the principles of an ecosystem approach and form an integral part of IWRM.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acase studies 3aeconomic development 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3aenvironmental health 3afloodplains 3arivers 3astakeholders 3awater allocation 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aColorado River 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aIWRM 0aecosystem approach 0aenvironmental flows 0aimplementation1 aSmith, D.M.1 aDalton, J.1 aBarchiesi, S.1 aAcreman, M.C.1 aStromberg, J.C.1 aKirby, J.M.0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 59, no. 3-4 p.860-877dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2014.8974083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02199naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245017400163300001400337520079300351592002801144650001201172650001201184650001701196650002301213650001701236650002201253650001601275650001301291650001901304650004101323650001301364650001301377651001401390653001201404653001801416653001601434700002401450700002101474700002101495773015001516856007801666852000901744655001201753IND60523058120221119180957.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052305812DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2005-1-2052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurray, Ana P.10aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Study of the Essential Oils of Schinus longifolia (Lindl.)

The essential oils from S. areira and S. longifolia exhibited a high biotoxicity in a brine shrimp assay with Artemia persimilis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aSchinus 3aaerial parts 3aalpha-phellandrene 3aalpha-pinene 3abeta-phellandrene 3abeta-pinene 3acamphene 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3alimonene 3asabinene 3aArgentina 0aSchinus 0aEssential Oil 0aBiotoxicity1 aFrontera, María A.1 aTomas, María A.1 aMulet, María C.0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 60, no. 1-2 p.25-29dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2005-1-2053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011000168300001600278520088300294592002801177650001201205650001401217650001401231650001801245650001701263650001201280650000701292650001601299650001101315653002101326653002101347653001601368653001701384653001601401700001701417700005601434700002001490700001501510700001701525773010001542856008701642852000901729655001201738IND60542380820221119025839.0190402e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054238082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.01.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yanyun14aThe characterization of soybean oil body integral oleosin isoforms and the effects of alkaline pH on them  ap. 288-294.  aOil body, an organelle in seed cell (naturally pre-emulsified oil), has great potentials to be used in food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and other applications requiring stable oil-in-water emulsions. Researchers have tried to extract oil body by alkaline buffers, which are beneficial for removing contaminated proteins. But it is not clear whether alkaline buffers could remove oil body integral proteins (mainly oleosins), which could keep oil body integrity and stability. In this study, seven oleosin isoforms were identified for soybean oil body (three isoforms, 24kDa; three isoforms, 18kDa; one isoform, 16kDa). Oleosins were not glycoproteins and 24kDa oleosin isoforms possessed less thiol groups than 18kDa ones. It was found that alkaline pH not only removed contaminated proteins but also oleosins, and more and more oleosins were removed with increasing alkaline pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuffers 3acosmetics 3aemulsions 3aglycoproteins 3alipid bodies 3aoleosin 3apH 3asoybean oil 3athiols 0aSoybean oil body 0aOleosin isoforms 0aAlkaline pH 0aGlycoprotein 0aThiol group1 aZhao, Luping1 aYing, Yusang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7411-24681 aKong, Xiangzhen1 aHua, Yufei1 aChen, Yeming0 tFood chemistry.g2015 June 15, v. 177 p.288-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.01.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04447naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245017600158520296500334592002803299650001203327650002203339650001603361650001803377650001403395650001403409650001303423650001903436650001703455650001603472651001003488700001503498700001503513700001603528700002003544700001703564700001803581700001703599700001503616700001803631700004603649700001803695700001703713700001903730773012103749856007403870852000903944655001203953IND60757730420221122095703.0211125e20211028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075773042DNAL7 a10.3390/f121114732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shixing 14aThe Responses of Leaf Litter Calcium, Magnesium, and Manganese Dynamics to Simulated Nitrogen Deposition and Reduced Precipitation Vary with Different Decomposition Stages  aLitter decomposition is a vital link between material circulation and energy flow in forest ecosystems and is intensely affected by global change factors, such as increased nitrogen (N) deposition and altered precipitation regimes. As essential nutrients, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and manganese (Mn) play crucial roles in plant energy metabolism, photosynthesis, and membrane transport of plants, and the major source of these nutrients is litter decomposition. However, the dynamics of Ca, Mg, and Mn during decomposition have been largely ignored. Thus, to better understand Ca, Mg, and Mn dynamics during leaf litter decomposition in the scenario of increasing N deposition and decreasing precipitation, we carried out a two-year field litterbag experiment in a natural evergreen broad-leaved forest in the central area of the rainy area of Western China. Two levels of N deposition (ambient N deposition and 150 kg·N·ha⁻¹·y⁻¹) and precipitation reduction (no throughfall reduction and 10% throughfall reduction) were set, i.e., control (Ctr: without nitrogen deposition or throughfall reduction), N deposition (N, 150 kg·N·ha⁻¹·y⁻¹), throughfall reduction (T, 10% throughfall reduction), and N deposition and throughfall reduction (NT, 150 kg·N·ha⁻¹·y⁻¹ and 10% throughfall reduction). We found that leaf litter Ca concentration increased in the early decomposition stage and then decreased, while Mg and Mn concentrations generally decreased during the whole period of decomposition. The amount of Ca showed an accumulation pattern, while Mg and Mn generally showed a release pattern. N deposition and throughfall reduction affected the Ca, Mg, and Mn dynamics, varying with different decomposition stages; i.e., N deposition significantly affected the concentration and amount of Ca, regardless of the decomposition stages, while throughfall reduction significantly affected the Ca concentration in the whole and early decomposition stages. N deposition significantly affected the concentration and amount of Mg in the whole and early decomposition stages, while throughfall reduction had no significant effects. Throughfall reduction significantly affected the concentration and amount of Mn in the whole and late decomposition stages, while N deposition had no significant effects. Ca concentration generally showed a significant positive linear relationship with mass loss in the early decomposition stage; Mg concentration showed a significant positive linear relationship with mass loss in the Ctr and N treatments in the early and late decomposition stages; Mn generally showed a significant negative linear relationship with mass loss, regardless of the decomposition stage. Overall, the results suggest that Ca accumulation is more likely affected by N deposition, while Mg and Mn releases are more likely affected by N deposition combined with throughfall reduction, particularly in the early decomposition stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adeciduous forests 3aenergy flow 3aglobal change 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant litter 3athroughfall 3aChina1 aYan, Gang 1 aHu, Junxi 1 aLiu, Xiong 1 aZou, Xingcheng 1 aTie, Liehua 1 aYuan, Rongze 1 aYang, Yudie 1 aXiao, Lin 1 aCui, Xinglei 1 aTewksbury, M.

The MIL, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrachloroferrate ([C4mim][FeCl4]), was used as the microextraction solvent to simplify the extraction procedure by magnetic separation. The effects of several important experimental parameters, including type of dispersant, ratio of sample to dispersant, type and volume of collected elution solvent, type and volume of MIL, were investigated. Using the present method, UFLC-UV gave the limits of detection (LODs) of 1.20–2.72 ng g−1 and the limits of quantification (LOQs) of 3.99–9.06 ng g−1 for triazine herbicides. The recoveries were ranged from 82.9 to 113.7% and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were equal or lower than 7.7%. The present method is easy-to-use and effective for extraction of triazine herbicides from oilseeds and shows the potentials of practical applications in the treatment of the fatty solid samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3adetection limit 3aionic liquids 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3amagnetic separation 3aoilseeds 3asolid phase extraction 3astatistical analysis 3atriazine herbicides 3aultrafast liquid chromatography 0aMagnetic ionic liquids 0aMatrix solid-phase dispersion 0aDispersive liquid–liquid microextraction 0aMagnetic separation 0aOilseed1 aSun, Ying1 aXu, Bo1 aLi, Xinpei1 aWang, Xinghua1 aZhang, Hanqi1 aSong, Daqian0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Aug. 12, v. 888 p.67-74dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02618naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245011200205300001800317520142900335592002801764650002201792650002201814650001301836650002001849650001301869650003801882650001801920650001901938650001201957650003301969650002002002700002302022773012102045856008102166852000902247655001202256IND60619513820221119140526.0181102e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061951382DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2902-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThieme, Katrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2531-642914aThe effect of dopants on crystal growth kinetics of lithium disilicate: surface versus bulk crystallization  ap. 1099-1111.  aGlasses with the compositions 2 RyOz·98 Li₂Si₂O₅ (R = Al, Ti, La, Ce, or Nb) and x ZrO₂·(100 − x) Li₂Si₂O₅ (x = 1, 2, 3, or 5 mol%) were studied with respect to their crystallization behavior using differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, as well as optical and scanning electron microscopy. During thermal treatment, in all samples lithium disilicate was crystallized. From the differential scanning calorimetry profiles recorded using different heating rates in the range from 5 to 20 K/min, activation energies and Avrami parameters were calculated. The activation energies decreased for coarser powders and bulk samples. The Avrami parameters were smallest for fine powders and largest for the bulk samples, which stand for sole surface and predominant bulk crystallization, respectively. The crystal growth velocities determined from optical and scanning electron micrographs were largest for the undoped sample. For most samples, the crystal growth velocities were notably larger (up to two times) for the bulk crystallization than for surface crystallization. This should be due to the formation of concentration gradients formed by the shoved-away components, which are not incorporated into the lithium disilicate crystals. In the case of bulk crystallization, radial diffusion plays an important part which enhances diffusion and hence leads to higher growth velocities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3aaluminum 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agrowth models 3aheat treatment 3apowders 3ascanning electron microscopy 3azirconium oxide1 aRüssel, Christian0 tJournal of materials science.g2019 Jan., v. 54, no. 2 p.1099-1111dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2902-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010600166300001600272520094800288592002801236650002301264650001701287650002501304650001401329650002901343650001401372650001501386650002801401650001001429650001901439650002501458650003301483650001001516650002101526653002301547653001701570653002501587653001401612653001901626653003301645700001501678700001601693700001901709700002201728773010001750856008701850852000901937655001201946IND60542380920221119025729.0190402e20150615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054238092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.01.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Mei10aPhytochemical profiles, antioxidant activities of functional herb Abrus cantoniensis and Abrus mollis  ap. 304-312.  aIt has been claimed that consumptions of Abrus cantoniensis (AC) and Abrus mollis (AM) as folk beverages and soups are good to cleanse liver toxicants and prevent liver diseases.

Five major phytochemicals in these two cultivars were qualitatively and quantitatively compared using UPLC-PDA. A high level of total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) was found in AC and AM. AC, in general, showed some antioxidant activities comparable to that of BHT, and stronger radical scavenging activities and higher reducing power than that of AM (p<0.05). When principal component analysis (PCA) was applied, high correlation between TPC, TFC and their antioxidant activities was found. Hence, this study proved that, both AC and AM could serve as antioxidant-rich component in foods or beverages to promote health function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbrus cantoniensis 3aAbrus mollis 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3afree radical scavengers 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoups 3atoxic substances 0aAbrus cantoniensis 0aAbrus mollis 0aAntioxidant activity 0aPhenolics 0aPhytochemicals 0aPrinciple component analysis1 aShen, Qing1 aLi, Lin-Qiu1 aHuang, Ye-Qing1 aCheung, Hon-Yeung0 tFood chemistry.g2015 June 15, v. 177 p.304-312dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.01.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03337naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012000158520199600278592002802274650002202302650002302324650002002347650001502367650001902382650002302401650002202424650001802446650001702464650002402481650002802505651001002533700002002543700001902563700001602582700001802598700001602616700001502632700001902647700002102666773012102687856007402808852000902882655001202891IND60754219920221121165921.0211023e20211011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075421992DNAL7 a10.3390/f121013822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Hanxue 10aRadial Growth Response of Picea crassifolia to Climatic Conditions in a Dryland Forest Ecosystem in Northwest China  aAs an important barrier against desert invasion in Northwest China, Helan Mountains (HL), Luoshan Mountains (LS) and their natural forests have an extremely important ecological status. It is of great significance to study the relationship between forest growth and climate in this region under the background of global change. At present, relevant research mostly focuses on the Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.), and little is known about how Qinghai spruce (Picea crassifolia Kom.) responds to climate change. To investigate the potential relationships between radial growth of P. crassifolia and climatic conditions in Ningxia, China, we collected tree-ring samples from P. crassifolia growing in the HL and LS and then established the standard tree-ring width chronologies for the two sites. Correlation analysis together with multivariate linear regression and relative contribution analyses were used, and results showed that radial growth in the HL was determined by the precipitation in the previous September, by the standardized evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in the current March and June, and by the maximum air temperature in the current September. The maximum air temperature in the current September contributed the most (0.348) to the radial growth in the HL. In the LS, radial growth was determined by the precipitation in the previous September and in the current March and by the minimum air temperature in the current July. The factor that made the most contribution was the precipitation in the current March (0.489). Our results suggested that in the wetting and warming future, growth of P. crassifolia in the HL will increase while that in the LS needs further investigation. Our results also provide a basis for predicting how P. crassifolia in northwest China will grow under the background of future climate change and provide a reference for formulating relevant management measures to achieve ecological protection and sustainable development policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea crassifolia 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aair temperature 3aarid lands 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest growth 3agrowth rings 3aregression analysis 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aJiang, Shaowei 1 aMuhammad, Ali 1 aKang, Jian 1 aZhu, Huoxing 1 aLi, Xuebin 1 aChen, Lin 1 aZhu, Liangjun 1 aHuang, Jian-Guo 0 tForests.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f121013823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010100159300002000260520147800280592002801758650001501786650002601801650001601827650001001843650001501853650001201868650001401880650001901894650001301913700002201926700001801948700001801966700001901984700001702003700001802020700001602038700002102054773013602075856007502211852000902286655001202295IND60536931620221120141519.0160807e20121003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053693162DNAL7 a10.1021/ie202783m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWormhoudt, Joda10aComparison of Remote Sensing and Extractive Sampling Measurements of Flare Combustion Efficiency  ap. 12621-12629.  aThe 2010 Comprehensive Flare Study provided the opportunity for the first blind validation of a remote sensing technique for flare combustion efficiency (CE) against extractive analysis techniques. The overall test results show that both remote sensing and extractive sampling accurately determined the flare performance curve. Both remote and extractive sampling techniques are challenged by the fluctuating and inhomogeneous nature of the flare exhaust plume. Accurate measurement of CE values near 100% is of interest to flare manufacturers, users, and regulators, while measurement of low CE flares is of interest in the development of other applications of combustion monitoring, and the 2010 tests provided information on both. In practice, accurate values of CE can be determined through the measurement of a small number of gaseous species, including fuel components and products of combustion. Nominal error bars generated from the fluctuations in these component measurements were adequate to account for most of the differences between the remote and extractive sampling CE measurements. The additional analysis reported here focused on individual species measurements and on cases where CE values measured by the two techniques differed by more than the nominal error estimates. In all cases, the key difference was the measurement of the main component of the fuel (in these tests, propene or propane). We discuss the challenges involved in these measurements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3acombustion efficiency 3aengineering 3afuels 3amonitoring 3apropane 3apropylene 3aremote sensing 3asampling1 aHerndon, Scott C.1 aFranklin, Jon1 aWood, Ezra C.1 aKnighton, Berk1 aEvans, Scott1 aLaush, Curtis1 aSloss, Mark1 aSpellicy, Robert0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Oct. 03, v. 51, no. 39 p.12621-12629dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie202783m3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015400166300001600320520058200336592002800918650002500946650002600971650001500997650001501012650001801027650001301045650001101058650002901069653002901098653001701127653001801144653001301162653006901175653000801244653001001252653000701262653000901269653000801278653000801286700001901294700001801313700001801331700001801349773009201367856008101459852000901540655001201549IND60544799420221122070925.0160901e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054479942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Chien-Ping12aA novel type of matrix for surface-assisted laser desorption–ionization mass spectrometric detection of biomolecules using metal-organic frameworks  ap. 103-109.  aA 3D metal-organic framework (MOF) nanomaterial as matrix for surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SALDI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was developed for the analysis of complex biomolecules.

Since national averages can mask the existence of winners and losers, national-level studies may be a poor guide to addressing the plight of the rural poor and the environment that are at the core of the agenda of the social and conservation movement. This article compares the international trade-liberalisation debate with the findings of local rural-based case studies in seven countries, co-ordinated by WWF and the World Bank during 2004–2007. It discusses some actions that the conservation and social movement could take to improve the discussion and the practice of trade liberalisation, poverty alleviation, and environmental conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Bank 3acollective action 3ainternational trade 3anatural resources conservation 3arural poverty 3atrade liberalization 0aEnvironment 0aGlobalisation 0aLabour and livelihoods0 tDevelopment in practice.g2008 Nov. 1, v. 18, no. 6 p.789-800dRoutledgewJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096145208023869263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02101naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245013300203300001800336520059800354592002800952596006300980650001601043650001201059650002701071650001901098650001901117650001301136650002801149700005401177700005201231700005501283700005501338700005601393700005501449773012101504856008101625852000901706655001201715IND60619513920221119140350.0181102e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061951392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2893-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wanting1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5009-390110aDifluoroborate-based conjugated organic polymer: a high-performance heterogeneous photocatalyst for oxidative coupling reactions  ap. 1205-1212.  aA photoactive difluoroborate-based conjugated organic polymer (B-COP) with A₃B₂-type donor–acceptor arrays in the polymer framework was synthesized by direct polycondensation and exhibited amorphous structure, high thermal and photophysical stability.

Hence, a comprehensive genome-wide study of the LecRLK genes was conducted in foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.). In the present study, a total of 113 LecRLK genes including 59 G-type, 53 L-type, and 1 C-type LecRLKs were retrieved from foxtail millet genome. We sub-grouped the G- and the L-type LecRLKs into 11 (Groups I–XI) and 10 (Groups I–X) distinct sub-families, respectively, on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships. These 113 LecRLK genes were located on 8 of the 9 foxtail millet chromosomes. Duplication analysis revealed that tandem duplications were common in the LecRLK genes family. Eighteen putative drought-induced LecRLK genes were identified from a comparison of de novo transcriptome sequencing data for foxtail millet plants that had been treated with or without drought conditions. Expression profiling of the 18 candidate LecRLK in plants subjected to PEG-6000 simulated drought and high temperature conditions showed that LecRLKs might play important roles in abiotic stress responses. The Si032100m.g gene was selected for further tolerance assays. Overexpression of the Si032100m.g gene improved the drought tolerance of Arabidopsis plants. The present study of the structural features, chromosome location, duplication analysis, and expression profiling of the LecRLK gene family establishes a foundation for further research into the functions of the LecRLK proteins of foxtail millet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aSetaria italica 3aabiotic stress 3achromosomes 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3alectins 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aphylogeny 3aplant response 3astress response 3atemperature 3atranscriptomics1 aLiu, Yong-Wei1 aZhou, Ji-Ming1 aZhao, Shu-Ping1 aZhang, Xiao-Hong1 aMin, Dong-Hong0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2016 Nov., v. 127, no. 2 p.335-346dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-016-1053-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02451naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017200167300001600339520127200355592002801627650002501655650001401680650000901694650000901703650001301712650001801725650000701743650002001750650002501770650003001795650001501825650001601840700002101856773011001877856008101987852000902068655001202077IND60572595720221117185440.0170717e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057259572DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348170400252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZarei, Ali Reza10aApplication of the localized surface plasmon resonance of gold nanoparticles for the determination of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine in water: Toward green analytical chemistry  ap. 430-436.  aLocalized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is an optical phenomena generated by light when it interacts with conductive nanoparticles that are smaller than the incident wavelength. In this work, we proposed a simple, fast, and green method for spectrophotometric determination of unsymmetrical 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) based on LSPR property of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). An LSPR band is produced via reduction of Au³⁺ ions in solution by UDMH as active reducing agent in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as a capping agent. Some important parameters in the formation of LSPR including Au(III) concentration, pH, concentration of stabilizer, and reaction time were studied and optimized. Under optimum conditions, the LSPR intensity displays linear response with the increasing UDMH concentration in the range from 0.5–10 μg/mL at 550 nm with a detection limit of 0.2 μg/mL. Also, the relative standard deviation for ten replicate determination of 5.0 μg/mL of UDMH was 3%. Usage of AuNPs as new nontoxic reagent instead of hazardous reagents in the spectrophotometric determination of UDMH is a step toward green analytical chemistry. The proposed method was successfully applied for determination of UDMH in water and wastewater samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3achlorides 3agold 3aions 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3apH 3areducing agents 3astatistical analysis 3asurface plasmon resonance 3awastewater 3awavelengths1 aBarghak, Farideh0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2017 Apr., v. 72, no. 4 p.430-436dPleiades Publishingx1061-93487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10619348170400253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009700166300001800263500001900281520144500300592002801745596007601773596006301849596006301912596003901975650002202014650001302036650001302049650001602062650001602078650001102094650001302105650001502118650003002133650001302163650001502176650002202191651002102213653002502234653002802259653002402287653002202311653002602333700001802359700001602377700002002393700001902413700005802432773013202490856008202622852000902704655001202713IND60734735320221122023305.0210422e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073473532DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1329-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Ju Yeon10aGenome Analysis of Erwinia amylovora Strains Responsible for a Fire Blight Outbreak in Korea  ap. 1143-1152.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aErwinia amylovora is a plant-pathogenic bacterium that causes fire blight disease in Rosaceae plants. Since fire blight is highly contagious and results in serious losses once introduced, it is regulated as a quarantine disease. Recently, for the first time in East Asia, fire blight emerged in Korea with strains of E. amylovora being isolated from lesions of infected trees. Five of those strains were selected and subjected to whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Each strain had two circular replicons, a 3.8-Mb chromosome and a 28-kb plasmid. The genome sequences were compared with those of other E. amylovora strains isolated from different hosts or geographical regions. Genome synteny was analyzed and sequence variations including nucleotide substitutions, inversions, insertions, and deletions were detected. Analysis of the population genomic structure revealed that the five strains form a distinct structural group. Phylogenomic analysis was performed to infer the evolutionary relationships among E. amylovora strains, which indicated that the Korean isolates, all descended from a common ancestor, are closely related to a lineage of North American strains. These results provide useful information for understanding the genomic dynamics of E. amylovora strains including those in Korea, developing genetic markers for surveillance of the pathogen or diagnosis of the disease, and eventually developing measures to eradicate it.  aPublisher supplied data  a914006-04cStrategic Initiative for Microbiomes in Agriculture and Food  a116071-03cExport Promotion Technology Development Program  a318097-5cAgri-Bio Industry Technology Development Program  cAnimal and Plant Quarantine Agency 3aErwinia amylovora 3aRosaceae 3aancestry 3achromosomes 3afire blight 3agenome 3agenomics 3amonitoring 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aplasmids 3aquarantine 3asequence analysis 3aKorean Peninsula 0acomparative genomics 0abacterial phytopathogen 0aquarantine organism 0agenetic diversity 0aphylogenetic analysis1 aYun, Yeo Hong1 aKim, Gi-Don1 aKim, Seong Hwan1 aLee, Seong-Jin1 aKim, Jihyun F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7715-69920 tPlant disease.g2021 Apr., v. 105, no. 4 p.1143-1152dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1329-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03913naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010700170300001600277520275500293592002803048650001503076650001703091650001103108650002003119650002103139653002603160653002503186653002903211653000803240653002303248653002503271700001503296700001703311773011503328856008703443852000903530655001203539IND60622815020221121053125.0190202e20180515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062281502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCavazzini, G.12aA novel two-swarm based PSO search strategy for optimal short-term hydro-thermal generation scheduling  ap. 460-481.  aThe optimal power generation of hydro-thermal systems to minimize total operating costs is one of the most important targets in short-term hydro-thermal scheduling (STHS) and its evaluation is complicated by several complex and interconnected equality and inequality constraints.To solve this type of problem, it is necessary to develop on one side a model of the system characterized by a fair and proper treatment of all the equality and inequality constraints and on the other a performing optimization algorithm simultaneously considering not only the minimization of the operating costs but also the feasibility of the proposed solution.The paper presents a novel two-swarm based PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) search strategy developed for solving these kinds of STHS problems. To exclude constraint violations as far as possible during the optimization process, first a complete inequality and equality constraints treatment of the hydrothermal systems was developed, combined with a fair spillage modelling. Then, a recent evolution of the particle swarm optimization algorithm ASD-PSO (Adaptive Search Diversification-Particle Swarm Optimization) was modified, introducing a secondary swarm able to exploit the potential contribution of the infeasible solutions. Within the context of this new strategy, two different swarms were designed, each characterized by a different treatment of the infeasible solutions, and each interacting properly with the other at every iteration.The primary swarm dealt with feasible solutions, resulting from the manipulation of constraint repairing strategies, and with a limited number of infeasible solutions whose potential contribution in the search process was not wasted out but it was properly weighted on the basis of the violation degree. The secondary swarm involved less manipulated solutions that were subjected only to one repair strategy in order to foster the exploration capability of the swarm. At each iteration, the two swarms independently update their position and velocity but partially interact with each other to obtain mutual advantages from their different peculiarities.This novel two-swarm based strategy for solving short-term hydro-thermal scheduling (STHS) problems was validated by comparing the achieved performance in terms of accuracy with those of several algorithms proposed in literature. Six different test cases, widely analysed in the literature and characterized by increasing complexity, were considered. In all the considered Test Cases, the algorithm performed very well with minimum total fuel costs that were still lower than all the feasible solutions proposed in the literature, and that satisfied all the equality and inequality constraints of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy costs 3amodels 3aoperating costs 3apower generation 0aShort-term scheduling 0aConstraints handling 0aHydro-thermal generation 0aPSO 0aOptimal management 0aHydro-thermal system1 aPavesi, G.1 aArdizzon, G.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 May 15, v. 164 p.460-481dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245008200162300001600244500002000260520170500280592002801985650003502013650002802048650001402076650002002090650001502110650002302125650001902148650001202167650001102179650001102190650001002201650001302211650002002224650001202244650001602256650001302272651001802285700001902303700002302322700001602345700001802361700002002379773010202399856007402501852000902575655001202584IND60571981020221118054646.0170712e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057198102DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.128382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeeren, Alexander10aExpert judgment and uncertainty regarding the protection of imperiled species  ap. 657-665.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDecisions concerning the appropriate listing status of species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) can be controversial even among conservationists. These decisions may determine whether a species persists in the near term and have long‐lasting social and political ramifications. Given the ESA's mandate that such decisions be based on the best available science, it is important to examine what factors contribute to experts’ judgments concerning the listing of species. We examined how a variety of factors (such as risk perception, value orientations, and norms) influenced experts’ judgments concerning the appropriate listing status of the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) population in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Experts were invited to complete an online survey examining their perceptions of the threats grizzly bears face and their listing recommendation. Although experts’ assessments of the threats to this species were strongly correlated with their recommendations for listing status, this relationship did not exist when other cognitive factors were included in the model. Specifically, values related to human use of wildlife and norms (i.e., a respondent's expectation of peers’ assessments) were most influential in listing status recommendations. These results suggest that experts’ decisions about listing, like all human decisions, are subject to the use of heuristics (i.e., decision shortcuts). An understanding of how heuristics and related biases affect decisions under uncertainty can help inform decision making about threatened and endangered species and may be useful in designing effective processes for protection of imperiled species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEndangered Species Act of 1973 3aUrsus arctos horribilis 3acognition 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aendangered species 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3ahumans 3amodels 3apeers 3apolitics 3arisk perception 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3awildlife 3aUnited States1 aKarns, Gabriel1 aBruskotter, Jeremy1 aToman, Eric1 aWilson, Robyn1 aSzarek, Harmony0 tConservation biology.g2017 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.657-665dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.128383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245014300163300001400306520100700320592002801327650003001355650001901385650001201404650002201416651001101438700001501449700002301464700001601487773011101503856004801614852000901662655001201671IND4472358920221119013024.0120612e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447235892DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-011-0550-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKalimeris, A.10aLong-term precipitation variability in the Ionian Islands, Greece (Central Mediterranean): climatic signal analysis and future projections  ap. 51-72.  aThe present study examines the variability of the precipitation regime across the Ionian Islands complex, Greece (Central Mediterranean), for a period spanning more than one century. Significant negative long-term linear trends in the annual precipitation totals are observed, more pronounced in the southern parts of the studied area, while a climatic discontinuity possibly occurred during the 1970s, manifested first in the southern Ionian. Statistically significant nonlinear trends and subdecadal intermittent oscillations were detected using Monte Carlo singular spectral analysis. The correlation of the winter precipitation variability at Ionian complex with the North Atlantic Oscillation anomalies was also investigated and extended in the frequency domain. Finally, future projections were performed using an ensemble of Regional Climatic Models. Model simulations suggested a decrease of the order of â¼20% or more in the mean annual precipitation of the area by the end of the century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimate models 3aislands 3asimulation models 3aGreece1 aFounda, D.1 aGiannakopoulos, C.1 aPierros, F.0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2012 July, v. 109, no. 1-2 p.51-72dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-011-0550-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012700155300002000282500001900302520117400321592002801495650001101523650001401534650002301548650001501571650002401586650000701610650001401617700002001631700001701651700001901668700001701687700001501704700001801719700001801737700001901755700001701774773014301791856007401934852000902008655001202017IND60739094120221117230452.0210526e20210525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073909412DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ta01868j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ji-Sen10aRuP₂-based hybrids derived from MOFs: highly efficient pH-universal electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction  ap. 12276-12282.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRational design of efficient, low-cost, and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in various pH media is highly desirable but remains challenging. Herein, for the first time, we present a novel hybrid of ruthenium diphosphide encapsulated in P-doped porous carbon (denoted as RuP₂@PC) utilizing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as templates by a multi-step strategy. Unexpectedly, benefitting from the synergistic contribution of highly dispersed ultrafine RuP₂ nanoparticles, porous carbon skeleton, and P-dopant, the as-synthesized RuP₂@PC exhibits exceptional catalytic activity and superior durability as pH-universal electrocatalysts for the HER. Particularly, a low overpotential of 78.9 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm⁻² and a small Tafel slope of 36.7 mV dec⁻¹ can be achieved in 1.0 M KOH toward the HER. Such outstanding electrocatalytic properties exceed those of commercial Pt/C and rank the catalyst among the best HER electrocatalysts reported until now. Importantly, this work paves a new route in elaborately fabricating efficient and stable electrocatalysts based on MOFs for energy-related fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3ahydrogen production 3apH 3aruthenium1 aHuang, Meng-Jie1 aZhou, Yu-Wei1 aChen, Xiao-Nan1 aYang, Shuang1 aZhu, Ji-Yu1 aLiu, Guo-Dong1 aMa, Ling-Juan1 aCai, Sheng-Hao1 aHan, Ji-Yuan0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2021 May 25, v. 9, no. 20 p.12276-12282dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ta01868j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03966naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013500162300001600297520267500313592002802988650001403016650002303030650001203053650001203065650002103077650001803098650002003116650002203136650001303158650001203171650001503183650001903198650001503217650001903232650002403251651001403275651002403289700001803313773011803331856007403449852000903523655001203532IND60137814920221117213911.0150524e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013781492DNAL7 a10.1111/ijcs.121622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranklyn, Sherrae10aVendor Hygienic Practices and Consumer Perception of Food Safety during the Carnival festival on the island of Tobago, West Indies  ap. 145-154.  aLocal festivals are usually the highlights on the small island, Tobago, West Indies. The street vendors capitalized on the Carnival season where they provide a variety of foods and beverages on‐demand for masqueraders and spectators. Therefore, this study examined food safety and hygienic practices by vendors and consumer perception of such practices at the Carnival festivals in Tobago. Standard structured questionnaires and observational checklists were compiled and administered to 50 vendors and 150 consumers at five Carnival events. Each vendor was observed for frequency of practices for 15–20 min. Consumers were sampled systematically (every fifth person encountered) at each event. The vendors examined were generally female (70.0%), 41–50 years old (34.0%), possessed less than primary education (36.0%), acquired more than 5 years of experience (44.0%) and were stationary (78.0%). The most common food prepared and sold was hot dog (36.0% of all sold foods). Educated vendors practised good personal hygiene and on‐site food handling, whereas the others performed improper practices such as absence of aprons and hair covering, wearing of jewellery and handling money while serving. Also, vendors displaying valid food badges generally practised more proper personal hygiene and food handling than those without badges. The majority of the consumers examined were residents of Tobago (80.0%), female (74.7%), 21–30 years old (39.3%) and possessed secondary education (53.3%). More than half of the consumers purchased foods at Carnival events (57.3%). Most (82.7%) who did not purchase stored foods in coolers. More than half (58.0%) had seen or read Carnival food safety articles in the local newspapers and most (96.0%) were aware that illnesses can be transmitted via consumption of food. Additionally, 42 out of 74 respondents (56.8%), who indicated that they were affected by foodborne illness, sought medical help when foodborne illness was suspected. However, a mere 13 out of 74 consumers (17.6%), who indicated that they were affected by foodborne illness, lodged reports of suspected foodborne illness with the local health authority. Younger consumers (21–30 years old) mostly read food safety articles and were conscious of illness being transmitted via consumption of food. In addition, the more educated consumers (tertiary education) indicated awareness as well as formal reporting of foodborne illness. Some gaps in vendor practices included handling of money while serving (78.0%), failure to clean utensils (68.0%) and access to water (48.0%). Noteworthy, only visual observation and interviews were utilized in the study.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3aconsumer attitudes 3acoolers 3afemales 3afood consumption 3afood handling 3afood sanitation 3afoodborne illness 3ahot dogs 3ahygiene 3ainterviews 3aprepared foods 3apurchasing 3aquestionnaires 3asecondary education 3aCaribbean 3aTrinidad and Tobago1 aBadrie, Neela0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2015 Mar., v. 39, no. 2 p.145-154dBlackwell Sciencex1470-64237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.121623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02721naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008400169300001600253500001500269520178200284592002802066650001902094650000902113650001102122650001602133650001102149650001102160650001402171650002402185653002402209773009302233856004802326852000902374655001202383IND50069731520221118162730.0131017e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006973152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10144-013-0384-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebblewhite, Mark10aConsequences of ratio-dependent predation by wolves for elk population dynamics  ap. 511-522.  a2019-12-06  aA growing number of studies suggest ratio-dependence may be common in many predator-prey systems, yet in large mammal systems, evidence is limited to wolves and their prey in Isle Royale and Yellowstone. More importantly, the consequences of ratio-dependent predation have not been empirically examined to understand the implications for prey. Wolves recolonized Banff National Park in the early 1980s, and recovery was correlated with significant elk declines. I used time-series data of wolf kill rates of elk, wolf and elk densities in winter from 1985-2007 to test for support for prey-, ratio-, or predator dependent functional and numeric responses of wolf killing rate to elk density. I then combined functional and numeric responses to estimate the total predation response to identify potential equilibrium states. Evidence suggests wolf predation on elk was best described by a type II ratio-dependent functional response and a type II numeric response that lead to inversely density-dependent predation rate on elk. Despite support for ratio-dependence, like other wolf-prey systems, there was considerable uncertainty amongst functional response models, especially at low prey densities. Consistent with predictions from ratio-dependent models, however, wolves contributed to elk population declines of over 80 % in our Banff system. Despite the statistical signature for ratio-dependence, the biological mechanism remains unknown and may be related to multi-prey dynamics in our system. Regardless, ratio-dependent models strike a parsimonious balance between theory and empiricism, and this study suggests that large mammal ecologists need to consider ratio-dependent models in predator-prey dynamics. © 2013 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3anational parks 3aelks 3awinter 3auncertainty 3amodels 3awolves 3apredation 3apopulation dynamics 0afunctional response0 tPopulation ecology.g2013 Oct., v. 55, no. 4 p.511-522dSpringer-Verlagx1438-38967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-013-0384-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245011400176300001600290520129800306592002801604653002501632653001301657653001301670653001801683653001001701700002701711700002001738700002701758700002501785773013001810856008801940852000902028655001202037IND60520388820221119131308.0160520e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052038882DNAL7 a10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2014.04072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGawish, Samiha M.10aEffect of Newly Synthesized Polypropylene/Silver Nonwoven Fabric Dressing on Incisional Wound Healing in Rats  ap. 395-403.  aAIM: The present work aimed to investigate the effect of the antimicrobial nano Ag/polypropylene (PP\Ag) dressing on incisional wound healing on the experimental level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male albino rats were divided into, control, PP/Ag dressing, Silver Sulfadiazine (Ag-SD) cream, blank PP dressing and undressed groups. Animals were sacrificed after 5, 10 and 15 days of incisional wound event. RESULTS: Reduction was found in incision wound length in PP/Ag dressed rats, Ag-SD cream treated rats, and blank PP dressed rats after 5, 10 and 15 days compared to undressed rats. Skin of PP/Ag group showed less adverse histopathological changes, enhanced granulation tissue formation, enhanced angiogenesis, accelerated re-epithelialization and quick complete healing; compared to all other groups. Significant decrease in TGF-β level was recorded in PP\Ag and Ag- SD cream groups as compared to blank PP group on day 5. While, significant decrease in TGF-β level was detected in PP\Ag group when compared with undressed and blank PP groups on day 10. TGF-β showed significant in PP\Ag group as compared to undressed, Ag-SD cream and blank PP groups on day 15. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that PP/Ag dressing enhances, promotes and plays an important role in wound healing.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPolypropylene/Silver 0aNonwoven 0aDressing 0aWound healing 0aRats.1 aGamal El Din, Amina A.1 aAhmed, Hanaa H.1 aFarrag, Abdel Razik H.1 aAbou-El Kheir, Amira0 tMacedonian journal of medical sciences.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 7, no. 3 p.395-403dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23186x1857-57497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3889/mjms.1857-5773.2014.04073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01902naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011700173300001600290520097300306592002801279650001401307650001001321650001001331700002301341700001901364700002001383773011501403856008501518852000901603655001201612IND60645663920221119162309.0190529e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064566392DNAL7 a10.1080/09571264.2019.16020312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallantyne, David10aOld world and new world wine concepts of terroir and wine: perspectives of three renowned non-French wine makers  ap. 122-143.  aThe concept of ‘terroir’ has roots steeped in French history of wine and evocative stories of the land. Today terroir is important as a quality marker in brand management for upmarket wines. French wines have benefited from their historical connotation with terroir but other wine growing countries have also adopted the term to mean characteristics in wine attributable to place of origin. However there is no universally accepted definition of terroir except to say it refers to a particular place. This paper addresses this ambiguity by seeking the practice-based views of three experienced non-French winemakers. This reveals a social dimension to terroir that in various degrees supports and extends both the technical/scientific progress and brand value for premium wines in both Old and New World regions. This article contributes to the growing body of research that seeks to understand the practicality of terroir as a marketing and brand value indicator.  aPublisher supplied data 3amarketing 3aroots 3awines1 aTerblanche, Nic S.1 aLecat, Benoît1 aChapuis, Claude0 tJournal of wine research.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 30, no. 2 p.122-143dRoutledgewJournal:J000000119x1469-96727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09571264.2019.16020313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03372naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245018300181300001400364520202200378592002802400650001602428650001702444650002002461650001202481650001502493650001202508650001402520650001302534650001302547650002002560650001402580650001502594650001902609650000902628650001302637650001602650650001502666650001502681651001602696700001902712773009302731856008102824852000902905655001202914IND60119966420221121005554.0150114e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011996642DNAL7 a10.1007/s12237-014-9827-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoler-Figueroa, Brenda María14aThe Influence of Rain Regimes and Nutrient Loading on the Abundance of Two Dinoflagellate Species in a Tropical Bioluminescent Bay, Bahía Fosforescente, La Parguera, Puerto Rico  ap. 84-92.  aPyrodinium bahamense (bioluminescent) and Ceratium furca (non-bioluminescent), two potentially harmful algal bloom species (HABs), are the most abundant dinoflagellates in the tropical bioluminescent bay Bahía Fosforescente. Reductions in bioluminescence have been attributed to fluctuations in their abundances. It is unclear how short-term changes in the environment influence these fluctuations and how seasonality regulates their presence and abundance. Thus, temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, rainfall, wind velocity and direction, and counts of both dinoflagellates were examined at six stations, during five consecutive days, and during two climate extremes (i.e., the wet and dry seasons). During the wet season, P. bahamense abundances surpassed those of C. furca, reaching bloom conditions. Positive correlations were found between P. bahamense abundance, temperature, and salinity. The higher phosphates and nitrites + nitrates concentrations (PO₄⁻, 0.09–1.92 μmol L⁻¹; N + N, 0.34–7.67 μmol L⁻¹) recorded during this season and their negative correlations with P. bahamense cell densities suggest efficient nutrient uptake and indicate that watershed-derived nutrients were important for the formation of blooms. C. furca cell densities were higher during the dry season, when nutrient concentrations were low (PO₄⁻, 0.17–0.5 μmol L⁻¹; N + N, 0.2–1.23 μmol L⁻¹). Physiological characteristics and adaptive strategies of C. furca, such as mixotrophy, osmotrophy, and luxury consumption, may explain the higher abundances of this species under low-nutrient conditions. The spatial distribution of both organisms was similar during both seasons with higher cell densities in the east/southeast regions of the bay. This study provides new insights on the ecology of Bahía Fosforescente that are important for its management and broadens the knowledge on the factors that regulate the presence and abundance of two potentially HABs species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDinophyceae 3aalgal blooms 3abioluminescence 3aclimate 3adry season 3aecology 3aflowering 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3apollution load 3arain 3asalinity 3atemperature 3awet season 3awind speed 3aPuerto Rico1 aOtero, Ernesto0 tEstuaries and coasts.g2015 Jan., v. 38, no. 1 p.84-92dSpringer-Verlagx1559-27237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-014-9827-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01701naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245004800159300001800207520067700225592002800902650001900930650001400949650002000963650001800983650001801001650001601019700001901035700003301054700002301087700004501110773012501155856007401280852000901354655001201363IND60662739620221123015055.0190906e20140224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066273962DNAL7 a10.1039/c3gc42302f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollet, Pamela10aSolvents for sustainable chemical processes  ap. 1034-1055.  aThe properties and some key applications of solvents such as (1) supercritical fluids (SCFs), (2) gas-expanded liquids (GXLs) and organic-aqueous tunable solvents (OATS), (3) water at elevated temperature (WET), and (4) switchable solvents like reversible ionic liquids (RevILs) are discussed in this review.

Lygodactylus incognitus (cryptic dwarf gecko) and Lygodactylus soutpansbergensis (Soutpansberg dwarf gecko) are range-restricted endemics to the Soutpansberg Mountains, South Africa, and have recently been shown to be potentially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This prompted us to study the relationship between the thermoregulatory characteristics and environmental temperatures for these syntopic species. Active geckos (i.e. those outside of a refuge) and environmental variables were recorded during scan surveys across two seasons. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict and explain activity based on presence/absence measures and environmental variables for each species. Of the variables measured, air temperature (Tₐ) was the main predictor of activity for both species. Cryptic dwarf geckos were active in cooler Tₐ than warmer temperatures in comparison to Soutpansberg dwarf geckos. Cryptic dwarf geckos are thus well adapted to temperate conditions. Soutpansberg dwarf geckos appear well adapted for warmer conditions, as they were more likely to be active at higher Tₐ. Our findings suggest that both species will alter their daily activity times in response to changing climate, but that the cryptic dwarf gecko is likely to be more negatively impacted than the Soutpansberg dwarf gecko, due to their affinity for cooler temperatures and avoidance of the hottest temperatures exhibited during the study period. Therefore, although these broadly sympatric, syntopic, range-restricted species are closely related and have similar life histories, they occupy different thermal niches and are likely to respond to climate change idiosyncratically. Our findings caution against the overuse of proxy species in predicting species geographic distribution changes in response to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abody temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adiel activity 3aectothermy 3ageographical distribution 3asympatry 3azoology 3aSouth Africa 0adiurnal 0aglobal warming 0aLygodactylus 0atemperature 0athermal niche1 aAlexander, GJ0 tAfrican zoology.g2021 July 03, v. 56, no. 3 p.202-212dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2021.19755603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245009000164300001400254520135800268592002801626650002201654650002601676650001701702650001501719650001201734650001401746650001301760650001201773650001501785650001901800653001501819653001801834653001701852653001401869653001501883700001401898773007601912856008301988852000902071655001202080IND60481366720221118032837.0160204e20140607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048136672DNAL7 a10.1515/helia.2010.33.53.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnemli, F.14aTHE CHARACTERIZATION OF SOME WILD SPECIES OF Helianthus FOR SOME MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS  ap. 17-24.  aThis present investigation was undertaken to determine some plant characters in six wild Helianthus genotypes and their test hybrids in 2007 and 2008. Helianthus petiolaris spp. petiolaris (E-142), Helianthus neglectus (E- 017) and four wild Helianthus annuus (E-060, E-173, E-174 and E-175) were used as the material. The morphological characters observed in the wild Helianthus genotypes were plant height, head diameter, lateral number, number of days to 50% flowering, flowering period length, and presence of anthocyanin in the cotyledons. In the second year, test hybrids of E-017, E-142, E-173 and E- 175 with the female line 2453-A were evaluated for seed yield, seed weight and some morphological traits. The results showed that plant height, head diameter and lateral number for these wild genotypes ranged from 63 to 171 cm, 2.4 to 8 cm and 43 to 324.3, respectively. The wild sunflower genotypes needed 82-105 days after emergence to reach 50% flowering and had flowering periods of 67-91 days. E-142 (Helianthus petiolaris spp. petiolaris) and its test hybrid with the female line 2453A were similarly in the early group for days to 50% flowering. E-017 (Helianthus neglectus) and its test hybrids were similarly late for days to 50% flowering. Interestingly, although E-173 had medium plant height, its test hybrid had the shortest plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aHelianthus petiolaris 3aanthocyanins 3acotyledons 3afemales 3aflowering 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aseed yield 3awild relatives 0aHelianthus 0aH. petiolaris 0aH. neglectus 0aH. annuus 0amorphology1 aGucer, T.0 tHelia.g2014 June 7, v. 33, no. 53 p.17-24dDe Gruyterx2197-04837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helia.2010.33.53.173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02212naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013300167300001600300520092700316592002801243650001101271650001601282650002501298650001501323650000901338650001301347650001401360650002201374650001301396650001201409651001401421653001401435653002001449653002401469653001701493653002101510700005901531773010601590856008501696852000901781655001201790IND60633389220221121060155.0200103e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063338922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.02.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zengkai10aImplications of using chemical dispersants to combat oil spills in the German Bight – Depiction by means of a Bayesian network  ap. 609-620.  aApplication of chemical dispersants is one option for combatting oil spills, dispersing oil into the water column and thereby reducing potential pollution to coastal areas. Efficiency of dispersant application depends on oil characteristics, sea and weather conditions. Potential environmental impacts must also be taken into account. Referring to the German Bight region (North Sea), we show how probabilistic Bayesian network (BN) technology can integrate all these aspects to support contingency planning. Expected effects of chemical dispersion on oil spill drift paths are quantified based on comprehensive numerical ensemble simulations. Ecological impacts are represented just in simplified terms focusing on nearshore seabird distributions. The intuitive and interactive BN summarizes expected benefits from chemical dispersion depending on where and under which weather conditions a hypothetical pollution occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3adispersants 3aenvironmental impact 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aplanning 3apollution 3apollution control 3aseabirds 3aweather 3aNorth Sea 0aOil spill 0aRisk assessment 0aChemical dispersant 0aGerman Bight 0aBayesian network1 aCallies, Ulrich1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4837-10060 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 May, v. 248 p.609-620dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.02.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001600293520187500309592002802184650002002212650001802232650002602250650001302276650001702289650000702306650001702313650002302330650001402353650001102367653001402378653001402392653001902406653002002425653002002445653002402465700001902489773009402508856008302602852000902685655001202694IND60479731920221123021821.0160123e19990501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047973192DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.28.1999.2.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKebary, K.

When dissolving pulps are produced from paper-grade pulps by cold caustic extraction (CCE), their reactivity is often inferior as compared to commercial prehydrolysis kraft dissolving pulps. It was hypothesized that pulp reactivity can be enhanced by the introduction of small amounts of substituents to facilitate interchain accessibility. In this study, CCE-treated Eucalyptus globulus kraft paper pulp was subjected to TEMPO-mediated oxidation to initiate partial oxidation of the C6-hydroxyl groups to carboxyl groups. The effect of this pulp modification on the reactivity towards xanthation and the subsequent dissolution in diluted aqueous alkali solution (viscose process) as well as the dissolution in complexing and non-complexing solvents, respectively, was thoroughly examined. The results revealed that the oxidized pulps rich in C6-carboxylate groups impeded the xanthation reaction obviously because of the reduced availability of hydroxyl groups. When N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide monohydrate was used as a direct solvent, a very high content of C6-carboxylate groups was found to reduce the solubility of the pulp fibers as less hydrogen bonds can be formed with NMMO·H2O. In the case of dissolution in the complexing solvent cupriethylenediamine, the dissolution mechanism of cellulose was not deteriorated by the high content of C6-carboxylate groups. Instead, the oxidation procedure increased the hydrophilic character and the swelling capacity of the outer cell wall layers allowed homogeneous dissolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aaqueous solutions 3acell walls 3acellulose 3aderivatization 3adissolving pulp 3ahydrogen bonding 3akraft pulp 3aoxidation 3apulp fiber 3asolubility 3asolvents 3aviscose 3awater1 aPotthast, Antje1 aSixta, Herbert0 tCellulose.g2012 Aug., v. 19, no. 4 p.1125-1134dSpringer-Verlagx0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-012-9729-x  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245006500165300001600230520142800246592002801674650002201702650002501724650001401749650001701763650001001780650001001790650001301800650001201813650001701825650001801842650003001860650001001890650001401900650001501914650001501929651001101944653001401955653001701969653000901986653001101995653001602006700001602022700001502038700002102053700001602074773007802090856008402168852000902252655001202261IND60481366820221118033008.0160204e20140607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048136682DNAL7 a10.1515/helia.2010.33.53.1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJocić, S.10aDevelopment of sunflower genotypes resistant to downy mildew  ap. 173-180.  aSunflower is attacked by more than 40 different diseases of which only a certain number causes serious reduction of seed yield. One of the most damaging diseases is downy mildew, which is caused by the fungus Plasmopara halstedii (Farl.) Berl. et de Toni (syn. Plasmopara helianthi Novot.). Sunflower downy mildew has great economic importance in all countries where sunflower is grown. When the meteorological conditions during the vegetation period of sunflower become favourable for disease development, the damages produce considerable reducing of the seed yield and the oil content. The best way of controlling the fungus is to grow resistant cultivars and because of that the major objective of this study was to develop sunflower genotypes genetically resistant to dominant races of downy mildew in Serbia. During this work two co-dominant CAPS markers for Pl₆gene were developed which can also be used for Pl₇gene. For introduction of these genes in breeding program marker assisted selection (MAS) was used. Developed commercial sunflower inbred lines exhibit resistance to all known races of downy mildew in Serbia indicated incorporation of resistance to downy mildew in well-known and widely produced hybrids. Besides that, Pl-genes were introduced to a large number of new inbred lines and new downy mildew resistant hybrids. These new hybrids reach higher seed and oil yields then hybrids widely produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aPlasmopara halstedii 3acultivars 3adowny mildew 3afungi 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3ainbred lines 3alipid content 3amarker-assisted selection 3araces 3aseed oils 3aseed yield 3avegetation 3aSerbia 0asunflower 0adowny mildew 0arace 0ahybrid 0ainbred line1 aCvejić, S.1 aHladni, N.1 aMiladinović, D.1 aMiklič, V.0 tHelia.g2014 June 7, v. 33, no. 53 p.173-180dDe Gruyterx2197-04837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helia.2010.33.53.1733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02314naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245011000209300001800319520123600337592002801573650001501601650001501616650000801631650001901639650001101658650001301669650002801682650002201710650001101732700001701743773011901760856008801879852000901967655001201976IND60765869120221118001229.0220203e20220125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076586912DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c037882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Yanfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8408-734710aProgress in Amine-Functionalized Silica for CO₂ Capture: Important Roles of Support and Amine Structure  ap. 1252-1270.  aIn the past decades, huge developments in rational design, synthesis, and application of solid amine CO₂ adsorbents have been reported. Since the reports on polyethylenimine impregnated silica adsorbents, there has been tremendous growth in this area along with the increase of supported amine adsorbent related publications. Owing to high adsorption capacity, a facile synthesis procedure and low cost, amine-functionalized silica adsorbents demonstrate great promise for CO₂ capture technologies. To push their industrial application forward, their stability must be improved further to mitigate acidic impurities and CO₂, O₂, and thermal-induced deactivation. Furthermore, fundamental understanding of the relationship between amine / support structure and adsorption performance is needed to guide the design of stable amine silica adsorbents. This review summarizes recent research that mainly focuses on important roles of support and amine structure in CO₂ adsorption performance and improved stability. The recent progress in promising reactor design for solid amine adsorbents is discussed to provide insights on developing the continuous CO₂ capture process for separating CO₂ from flue gas and ambient air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3aindustrial applications 3apolyethyleneimine 3asilica1 aJia, Xiaohao0 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 36, no. 3 p.1252-1270dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c037883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03536naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009900170300001600269520139000285536038401675592002802059596005802087596005502145596006302200596009802263596009302361650002202454650001302476650001702489650002802506650002202534650000802556650001702564653001602581653003002597653002002627653001902647700001602666700001702682700001702699700001502716700002102731700001602752700001502768773015202783856008602935852000903021655001203030IND60795022220221123002123.0220929e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079502222DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2022.20283982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArhin, Ishmael10aLooking into the future of organic tea production and sustainable farming: a systematic review  ap. 942-954.  aThe organic movement have considered itself the growing drive for today’s consumers purchasing behaviour and growing attention from mainstream media. However, it has not fully received the attention to increase the organic tea industry to benefit humanity and natural ecosystems. The effect is that the future is uncertain as current challenges continue to pose threats to the industry. A systematic review was done to examine the overview of organic tea production challenges and prospects within the scope of sustainable farming. The findings showed that the unprecedented challenges are currently facing the global organic tea industry, which includes high competition for agricultural land, convention of organic lands for other purposes and urbanization activities in tea-growing countries. Biotic and abiotic stresses are major limits to agricultural production. Lack of knowledge on organic practices and high input costs affect the adoption of organic farming. However, the growth and new marketing trends in Asia-Pacific is an excellent sustainable indicator. Besides, stakeholders commitment is needed to implement and comply with applicable laws and supports to ensure industry development and sustainability. The current study is the first to have put together literatures on the global challenges and prospects of the organic tea industry within sustainable agriculture.  aThis work was supported financially by the Expert Workstation of Yunnan Province (202105AF150045), the National International Joint Project (G20200010081), the China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA (CARS-19), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32172628) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (NJAUPAPD).  aPublisher supplied data  a202105AF150045cExpert Workstation of Yunnan Province  aG20200010081cNational International Joint Project  aCARS-19cChina Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA  a32172628cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aNJAUPAPDcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions 3aagricultural land 3aindustry 3astakeholders 3asustainable agriculture 3asystematic review 3atea 3aurbanization 0aorganic tea 0atea production challenges 0aorganic farming 0aclimate change1 aLi, Jianjie1 aMei, Huiling1 aAmoah, Mavis1 aChen, Xuan1 aJeyaraj, Anburaj1 aLi, Xinghui1 aLiu, Aijun0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 20, no. 5 p.942-954dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2022.20283983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001900167245007500186300001800261500002000279520186800299592002802167650001902195650001202214650002302226650001602249650001302265650001402278650002402292651001002316700001802326700002002344700001402364773013202378852000902510856010802519655001202627IND2206650320221123043431.0180321e200008  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220665032DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1074:CIVSNS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, Erle C.10aChanges in village‐scale nitrogen storage in china's tai lake region  ap. 1074-1089.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLong‐term change in nitrogen storage in densely populated rural landscapes of China's Tai Lake Region was investigated by comparing soil and sediment N storage within an entire village ecosystem under traditional vs. contemporary management. Contemporary data were gathered on site from 1993 to 1996 by field surveying and sampling. Traditional period data, ∼1930, were obtained from historical sources, interviews, and back estimation. N storage in the top 40 cm of soil and in low‐density sediments (depth to density >1.3 g/cm³) was estimated within 35 village landscape components that were then aggregated into village‐scale estimates and compared using Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis and a data quality index. Our results demonstrate with 76% probability that village soil and sediment N storage has increased from 1930 to 1994, most likely by 25% over the 1930s level, or ∼1.4 Mg N/ha on average. A 20% increase in agricultural soil N concentrations caused more than half of the increase, potentially improving soil fertility. Sediment accumulation in village canals, ponds, and marshes caused the remaining N storage increase, after sediment use for fertilizer ended in 1982, increasing the risk of flooding and impeding irrigation. Sedimentation at current rates will fill most canals within 25 years, and N concentration in agricultural soils may now be declining. Compounding these problems, village food security is threatened by a 30% decline in agricultural soil N per person since 1930 and a doubling in the proportion of village soil N under buildings and infrastructure, from 5% in 1930 to 11% in 1994. Village landscapes in the Tai Lake Region sequestered 1.7 Tg N and 16 Tg C between 1930 and 1994, forming a significant regional sink that may become a source of atmospheric C and N emissions, if organic N use continues to decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil fertility 3atopsoil 3aagricultural soils 3arural areas 3avillages 3asediments 3asubsistence farming 3aChina1 aLi, Rong Gang1 aYang, Lin Zhang1 aCheng, Xu0 tEcological applications.g2000 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.1074-1089dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010%5B1074:CIVSNS%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02839naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245013600173300001800309520133200327592002801659650001501687650002601702650001401728650002201742650001001764650001701774650001501791650002801806650002601834650001001860650000901870650001801879650002401897650001101921650001101932650001301943650001001956653003601966653001302002653002002015653001302035700001802048700001502066700001502081700001502096700002002111773007902131856009002210852000902300655001202309IND60090493220221120213539.0161019e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009049322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.12.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Changhui14aThe absorption, distribution, excretion and toxicity of mesoporous silica nanoparticles in mice following different exposure routes  ap. 2565-2575.  aMesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are emerging as one of the promising nanomaterials for biomedical applications, but the nanomaterials–body interaction exposed by different administration routes remained poorly understood. In the present study, a systematic investigation of the absorption, distribution, excretion and toxicity of silica nanoparticles (SNs) with the average size of 110 nm after four different exposure routes including intravenous, hypodermic, intramuscular injection and oral administration to mice were achieved. The results showed that a fraction of the SNs administrated by the intramuscular and hypodermic injection could cross different biological barriers into the liver but with a low absorption rate. Exposing by oral administration, SNs were absorbed into the intestinal tract and persisted in the liver. And SNs administrated by intravenous injection were mainly present in the liver and spleen. In addition, SNs could cause inflammatory response around the injection sites after intramuscular and hypodermic injection. It was also found that SNs were mainly excreted through urine and feces after different exposure routes. This study will be helpful for selecting the appropriate exposed routes for the development of nanomaterials-based drug delivery system for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adrug delivery systems 3aexcretion 3aexposure pathways 3afeces 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3aintramuscular injection 3aintravenous injection 3aliver 3amice 3ananoparticles 3aoral administration 3asilica 3aspleen 3atoxicity 3aurine 0aMesoporous silica nanoparticles 0aToxicity 0aExposure routes 0aKinetics1 aLiu, Tianlong1 aLi, Linlin1 aLiu, Huiyu1 aChen, Dong1 aTang, Fangqiong0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Mar., v. 34 p.2565-2575dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.12.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245011100152300002000263500001900283520092200302592002801224650002101252650001801273650001601291650001501307650001601322650002001338650002401358650001501382650001401397650002001411700001701431700001801448700001401466700001301480773014401493856007401637852000901711655001201720IND60722255020221118104543.0201230e20201223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072225502DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb01766c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Jia10aHuman serum albumin templated MnO₂ nanosheets as an efficient biomimetic oxidase for biomolecule sensing  ap. 11090-11095.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHerein, we have proposed a colorimetric biosensor for detection of acid phosphatase based on human serum albumin (HSA) templated MnO₂ nanosheets (HSA-MnO₂ NSs). HSA-MnO₂ NSs as an efficient biomimetic oxidase could catalyze the oxidization of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to the coloured oxidation product (oxTMB). Acid phosphatase (ACP) could hydrolyze l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AAP) to produce ascorbic acid, and ascorbic acid could lead to the decomposition of MnO₂ NSs to Mn²⁺ ions, inhibiting the production of oxTMB. On the basis of this, we have demonstrated a novel colorimetric approach for the detection of acid phosphatase with the linear range from 50 μU mL⁻¹ to 1500 μU mL⁻¹ and a detection limit of 40 μU mL⁻¹. The MnO₂ NS-based colorimetric method has been successfully used to determine the content of acid phosphatase in real samples with satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3aascorbic acid 3abiomimetics 3abiosensors 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3ahuman serum albumin 3ananosheets 3aoxidation 3aoxidoreductases1 aYu, Jian-Hua1 aYang, Hongfen1 aYang, Dan1 aCai, Ren0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Dec. 23, v. 8, no. 48 p.11090-11095dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb01766c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014400172300001400316520173000330592002802060650001202088650001402100650001902114650003002133650002102163650001202184650002602196650001502222650001702237650002102254650001502275650002302290650002202313650001102335650001102346651001202357653003002369653002702399653001902426653001802445653002302463700002602486700001902512700002102531700002102552700002302573700001702596773012902613856008502742852000902827655001202836IND60543618420221123024352.0190411e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054361842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2015.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmstrup, Martin10aResponses of enchytraeids to increased temperature, drought and atmospheric CO2: Results of an eight-year field experiment in dry heathland  ap. 15-22.  aIn a long-term field trial we investigated the responses of enchytraeids to simulated future climatic conditions predicted for Denmark. At a semi-natural Danish heathland site we exposed 9.1 m2 plots to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (510 ppm), extended summer drought and passive night-time warming. Treatments and all possible combinations of treatments were replicated 6 times. The enchytraeid community was assessed after 8 years of treatment. Atmospheric CO2 did not have any significant effect on the enchytraeid community even though root biomass was increased in plots with elevated CO2. The warming treatment had a modest effect on soil temperatures (0.3 °C at 5 cm depth) and did not have significant effect on abundance or biovolume of enchytraeids. However, the individual body size of Chamaedrilus chlorophilus (= Cognettia sphagnetorum partim.) was negatively correlated with soil temperature in spring 2013, perhaps indicating that warming stimulates fragmentation (reproduction) rates at this time of the year. Increased drought in May–June 2012 did not have lasting effects on abundance or biomass 3 months after the termination of drought treatment. However, comparison with earlier assessments of enchytraeids in the CLIMAITE experiment shows that the severity of drought and the time elapsed since the last drought is the best predictor of the biovolume (or biomass) of enchytraeids. Moreover, species richness was significantly impacted by the average soil water content experienced by enchytraeids during the 8-year study. It seems, therefore, that the most important factor for enchytraeid abundance and species diversity in the projected future climate conditions is soil water content.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abody size 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimatic factors 3adrought 3afield experimentation 3aheathlands 3areproduction 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aspecies diversity 3aspring 3asummer 3aDenmark 0aChamaedrilus chlorophilus 0aCognettia sphagnetorum 0aClimate change 0aSoil moisture 0aEcosystem services1 aSchmelz, Rüdiger M.,1 aCarrera, Noela1 aDyrnum, Kristine1 aLarsen, Klaus S.1 aMikkelsen, Teis N.1 aBeier, Claus0 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2015 Sept.,  Oct., v. 70 p.15-22dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl597945x1164-55637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2015.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002200167245010500189300001800294500002000312520107600332592002801408650001601436650002501452650001801477650001901495650002201514650001201536650001501548651001101563651001201574773013201586852000901718856010801727655001201835IND2207697420221120215229.0180321e200010  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220769742DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1288:IRAESR]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabhan, Gary Paul10aInterspecific relationships affecting endangered species recognized by o'odham and comcáac cultures  ap. 1288-1295.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBecause certain indigenous peoples have lived in the same habitats for centuries, their languages often encode traditional ecological knowledge about interactions between plant and animal species that occur in those habitats. This local knowledge is sometimes complementary to more broadly derived knowledge accrued by academically trained field ecologists. In this analysis of recent ethnoecological studies from the Sonoran Desert, it is clear that O'odham and Comcáac foragers recognize, name, and interpret ecological interactions among locally occurring species, regardless of whether these species directly benefit them economically. It is demostrated how their knowledge of ecological interactions involving threatened species may offer Western‐trained scientists and resource managers hypotheses to test, and to apply to endangered species recovery efforts. It is proposed that endangered species recovery teams include local para‐ecologists from indigenous communities to aid in the integration of knowledge bases derived from various cultural perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aterminology 3aindigenous knowledge 3aplant ecology 3aanimal ecology 3acommunity ecology 3adeserts 3axerophytes 3aMexico 3aArizona0 tEcological applications.g2000 Oct., v. 10, no. 5 p.1288-1295dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010%5B1288:IRAESR%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02926naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245015000175300001600325520143400341592002801775650002901803650001501832650001301847650001601860650001401876650002101890650002001911650000901931650001101940650002501951650004401976700002002020700002602040700003002066700003102096700003002127700002202157700002102179700002202200700002302222700002802245773009302273856008102366852000902447655001202456IND60440310120221120033424.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044031012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11745-015-4062-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCopetti-Santos, Daniela10aU18666A Treatment Results in Cholesterol Accumulation, Reduced Na+, K+-ATPase Activity, and Increased Oxidative Stress in Rat Cortical Astrocytes  ap. 937-944.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the effect of U18666A, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis and its intracellular transport, on oxidative stress parameters in cortical astrocytes cultured from Wistar rats (0–3 days old). The cultures were incubated with U18666A (0.25 µg/mL) for 48 h, conditions that are considered ideal to mimic Niemann–Pick type C disease. A variety of indicators of oxidative stress were measured. U18666A treatment increased cholesterol 2-fold in treated compared to control astrocytes. Oxidative stress was significantly elevated in treated cells as demonstrated by a 1.7-fold increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, a 60 % decrease is sulfhydral groups, and a 3.7-fold increase in carbonyl groups, indicative of increased lipid and protein oxidation following U18666A treatment. Consistent with these changes, both catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were significantly reduced nearly 50 % in treated compared to control astrocytes. Collectively, these change resulted in a 50 % reduction in Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase specific activity following U18666A treatment, suggesting a significant alteration in its plasma membrane environment. Overall, these changes indicate that U18666A treatment results in increased cholesterol levels and an increased level of oxidative stress in cortical astrocytes, consistent with what is observed in Niemann–Pick type C disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticholesteremic agents 3aastrocytes 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aplasma membrane 3arats 3asodium 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances1 aMoraes, Vitoria1 aWeiler, Dácio Franco1 ade Mello, Alexandre Silva1 aMachado, Fernanda de Souza1 aMarinho, Jéssica Pereira1 aSiebert, Cassiana1 aKolling, Janaina1 aFunchal, Cláudia1 aWyse, Angela T.

For this, we developed a simple inferential model that helps to understand the basic underlying relationships and associations between lidar predictor metrics and forest understory shrub presence over a wide range of forest types and topographic conditions. The model (a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-based logistic regression model) had fair predictive performance (accuracy = 62%, kappa = 0.23). Hence, we were able to propose a set of biophysically meaningful predictor variables that represent understory (4), canopy (3), topographic conditions (1), and sensor characteristics (1). The single most important predictor variable was the understory layer canopy density, which is the ratio of lidar returns in the understory to those near the ground. Hence, we demonstrate that the interplay of several factors affects understory vegetation condition. Overall, our work highlights the potential value of using lidar to characterize understory conditions.  aThis work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA).  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3aforest types 3alidar 3amodels 3anational forests 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3ashrubs 3atopography 3aunderstory 3aSoutheastern United States1 aThomas, Valerie A.1 aWynne, Randolph H.1 aCoulston, John W.1 aFox, Thomas R.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2018 Feb. 16, v. 39, no. 4 p.1220-1242dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2017.13994763Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017500159300002000334520144500354592002801799650002201827650001501849650001601864650001801880650003701898700002101935773012401956856007402080852000902154655001202163IND60669041920221121053022.0190920e20150817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066904192DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra10658c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParastar, Hadi10aComparative study of partial least squares and multivariate curve resolution for simultaneous spectrophotometric determination of pharmaceuticals in environmental samples  ap. 70017-70024.  aThe potentials of partial least squares regression (PLSR) and multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) are evaluated for the simultaneous determination of diclofenac (DCF), naproxen (NAP), mefenamic acid (MEF) and carbamazepine (CBZ) as target analytes and gemfibrozil (GEM) as an interference in synthetic and real environmental samples. The analysis of first-order UV-Vis spectra is performed using PLSR with different variable selection methods, which include variable importance in projection (VIP), recursive weighted partial least squares (rPLS), regression coefficient (RV) and uninformative variable elimination (UVE), and using MCR-ALS with correlation constraint (MCR-ALS-CC). The obtained statistical parameters in terms of relative error (RE), regression coefficient (R²) and root mean square error (RMSE) were satisfactory for the calibration and validation sets. Furthermore, in real environmental samples, the obtained statistical parameters of PLSR using VIP and rPLS as well as MCR-ALS-CC were reasonable considering the heavy overlap of the target analytes and complex sample matrices. In general, PLSR showed a better performance for the determination of analytes in samples that are free of interference or contain calibrated interference(s).

We hypothesized that key factors for in vitro evaluation would be found by in vitro assessment of decellularized aortas that previously showed good performance in vivo, such as high patency. We chose porcine aortas, decellularized using three different decellularization methods: sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS), freeze–thawing, and high-hydrostatic pressurization (HHP). Immunohistological staining, a blood clotting test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, and recellularization of endothelial cells were used for the in vitro evaluation. There was a significant difference in the remaining extracellular matrix (ECM) components, ECM structure, and the luminal surface structure between the three decellularized aortas, respectively, resulting in differences in the recellularization of endothelial cells. On the other hand, there was no difference observed in the blood clotting test. These results suggested that the blood clotting test could be a key evaluation method for the prediction of in vivo performance. In addition, evaluation of the luminal surface structure and the recellularization experiment should be packaged as an in vitro evaluation because the long-term patency was probably affected. The evaluation approach in this study may be useful to establish regulations and a quality management system for a cardiovascular prosthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaorta 3ablood 3achemistry 3aextracellular matrix 3amanagement systems 3aprediction 3aprostheses 3asodium 3aswine1 aOhara, Masako1 aHashimoto, Yoshihide1 aNakamura, Naoko1 aFujisato, Toshiya1 aKimura, Tsuyoshi1 aKishida, Akio0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Dec. 23, v. 8, no. 48 p.10977-10989dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb01830a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169300001300309520140200322592002801724650000901752650001901761650000901780650001401789650000901803650001801812650001301830650001201843650002201855650001301877650002201890653001901912653002001931653001801951653002801969653002501997653002702022700003102049700001702080773011602097856008502213852000902298655001202307IND60543618520221123024255.0190411e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054361852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2014.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGanias, Kostas10aUnderstanding the determinate–indeterminate fecundity dichotomy in fish populations using a temperature dependent oocyte growth model  ap. 1-10.  aThe fecundity type (determinate vs. indeterminate) is still uncertain for many commercially important fish populations affecting accuracy in fecundity estimations and hindering the selection of appropriate egg production methods for stock assessment purposes. It is broadly considered that boreal fish populations living in colder habitats are determinate spawners whilst populations residing in warmer habitats tend to be indeterminate spawners. In the present study we modelled the determinate–indeterminate fecundity type in batch spawning fishes, i.e. fish that spawn several batches of eggs per spawning season, based on the relationship between oocyte growth period and the duration of the spawning period considering that both variables can be affected by water temperature and latitudinal distributions. Individual based models (IBMs) were developed to explore how the interaction of these variables can result in a series of patterns along the continuum from extreme determinacy, i.e. annual fecundity being recruited long before the onset of the spawning period, to indeterminacy. Model simulations showed that fish stocks with oocyte growth periods longer than the spawning period are predicted to exhibit determinate fecundity which provides a fair justification for why cold water species with slow oocyte growth and limited spawning periods are determinate spawners and vice versa.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aegg production 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afish 3agrowth models 3ahabitats 3aoocytes 3asimulation models 3aspawning 3awater temperature 0aFecundity type 0aSpawning season 0aOocyte growth 0aIndividual based models 0aDeterminate spawners 0aIndeterminate spawners1 aLowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.1 aCooper, Wade0 tJournal of sea research.g2015 Feb., v. 96 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2014.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100002800197245011800225300001800343506007600361520153000437592002801967506003701995650001902032650001802051650003302069650002002102650003202122650002102154650001202175650002402187650001702211650000902228650001402237650001402251653004302265653001802308653001402326653001802340653001302358653002902371700002002400700001802420700001802438700001902456700002302475773007902498856009002577852000902667655001202676IND60090493420221207094211.0161019e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009049342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.0592doi7 aPMC35575862pmcid7 a232740682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSittadjody, Sivanandane10aEngineered multilayer ovarian tissue that secretes sex steroids and peptide hormones in response to gonadotropins  ap. 2412-2420.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough hormone replacement therapy is an option for the loss of ovarian function, hormone delivery through pharmacological means results in various clinical complications. The present study was designed to deliver sex steroids by a functional construct fabricated using encapsulation techniques. Theca and granulosa cells isolated from ovaries of 21-day old rats were encapsulated in multilayer alginate microcapsules to recapitulate the native follicular structure. Cells encapsulated in two other schemes were used as controls to assess the importance of the multilayer structure. The endocrine functions of the encapsulated cells were assessed in vitro for a period of 30 days. Encapsulated cells showed sustained viability during long-term in vitro culture with those encapsulated in multilayer capsules secreting significantly higher and sustained concentrations of 17 β-estradiol (E2) than the two other encapsulation schemes (p < 0.05, n = 6) in response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In addition, cells in the multilayer microcapsules also secreted activin and inhibin in vitro. In contrast, when granulosa and theca cells were cultured in 2D culture, progesterone (P4) secretion increased while E2 secretion decreased over a 30-day period. In summary, we have designed a multilayer engineered ovarian tissue that secretes sex steroids and peptide hormones and responds to gonadotropins, thus demonstrating the ability to recapitulate native ovarian structure ex vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acultured cells 3aencapsulation 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3agranulosa cells 3ahormone replacement therapy 3ain vitro culture 3ainhibin 3aluteinizing hormone 3aprogesterone 3arats 3asecretion 3aviability 0aCell-based hormone replacement therapy 0aOvarian cells 0aFollicles 0aEncapsulation 0aAlginate 0aMultilayer microcapsules1 aSaul, Justin M.1 aJoo, Sunyoung1 aYoo, James J.1 aAtala, Anthony1 aOpara, Emmanuel C.0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Mar., v. 34 p.2412-2420dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008800170300001400258520131400272592002801586650001201614650001101626650001201637651001801649651001401667653001901681653002501700653002301725653001201748653002801760773008701788856008101875852000901956655001201965IND60519907820221117065553.0160511e20121019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051990782DNAL7 a10.2478/v10279-012-0003-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, Eric Steen10aLichens from two inland localities in west Greenland and their climatic preferences  ap. 19-26.  aHansen E.

Eighty three lichen taxa were collected in Eqaluit ilorliit in the Ameralik Fjord area in 2000 and 120 lichen taxa were collected in Utaap kuua, east of Sisimiut, in 1998. The two localities share 58 lichen taxa. Almost three fourths of the 143 lichens are more or less equally distributed in continental and oceanic areas in Greenland. About one sixth of the lichens occur most frequently in oceanic areas and more rarely in continental areas, while less than one tenth of the lichens occur frequently in continental areas and more rarely in oceanic areas. The climate of the two localities is low arctic, oceanic. Although they are situated at some distance from the outer coast and close to the continental zone, they are poor in lichens with a mainly continental distribution in Greenland compared to, for example, Kangerlussuaq, which is located in the continental inland region in the southernmost West Greenland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acoasts 3alichens 3aArctic region 3aGreenland 0aWest Greenland 0aclimatic preferences 0adistribution types 0aecology 0alichenized ascomycetes.0 tBotanica Lithuanica.g2012 Oct. 19, v. 18, no. 1 p.19-26dVersitax2029-932X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10279-012-0003-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245015000180300001600330520120100346592002801547650001301575650001101588650001501599650001501614650002001629653001801649653001701667653002201684653003101706653002501737653003601762700002401798700002501822700005801847773010601905856008602011852000902097655001202106IND60629721220221118224247.0190206e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062972122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.03.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-Consuegra, David10aExamining consumer luxury brand-related behavior intentions in a social media context: The moderating role of hedonic and utilitarian motivations  ap. 104-110.  aLuxury brand marketers have recently turned their attention to customer-driven social media devoted to their brands. The key concepts of involvement, interaction and behavioral intention provide the theoretical foundation to investigate luxury brands. The purpose of this study is to test a model that analyzes the relationship among brand involvement, consumer-brand interaction and behavioral intention in the context of luxury brand-related activities on social media. Based on content value theory, the present research identifies the moderating role of utilitarian/hedonic motivations on the relationships proposed. Data were collected from 326 social media users who look for information on internet about luxury brands before purchasing a specific brand. We provide evidence indicating positive relationships between brand involvement, consumer-brand interaction and behavioral intention. The results also confirm the moderating role of the utilitarian/hedonic motivations. This study provides recommendations to luxury brands to understand the nature of consumer involvement and brand-customer relationship in order to forecast the behavioral intention of their consumers more accurately.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3amodels 3amotivation 3apurchasing 3asocial networks 0aLuxury brands 0aSocial media 0aBrand involvement 0aConsumer-brand interaction 0aBehavioral intention 0aUtilitarian/hedonic motivations1 aDíaz A., Estrella,1 aGómez Gallego, Mar,1 aMolina, Arturo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6537-24680 tPhysiology & behavior.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 200 p.104-110dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2018.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010100172300001600273520137100289592002801660650001101688650001301699650002601712650001001738650001101748650002701759650001801786650001801804650001701822650001101839650002101850650001201871653001401883653001701897653002301914653002801937653002801965653001801993700002202011700001802033700002002051700002002071700002002091700002502111700002002136700001602156773011402172856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60714930420221118220724.0210401e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071493042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.10.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavakoli, Shirin10aOcular barriers to retinal delivery of intravitreal liposomes: Impact of vitreoretinal interface  ap. 952-961.  aDrug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye is challenging due to several anatomical and physiological barriers. Thus, there is a need for prolonged action and targeted drug delivery to treat retinal diseases. Intravitreal injections avoid anterior eye barriers, but the vitreoretinal interface and inner limiting membrane (ILM) may prevent access of drug delivery systems to the retina. Existing data on retinal permeation of intravitreal nanoparticles are sparse and probably misleading due to the inter-species differences of retinal structures in rodents and humans. To bridge this gap, retinal permeation of light-activated liposomes was studied in an ex vivo bovine explant system that simulates the structure of vitreoretinal interface and intact ILM. Our findings indicate that the particle size plays a significant role in determining the retinal penetration as the liposomes of >100 nm sized failed to overcome the ILM and could not permeate into the retina. In addition, our results demonstrate the impact of surface charge and PEG-coating on retinal penetration. Small (≈ 50 nm) anionic liposomes with PEG coating showed the most extensive distribution and cellular localization in the retina. In summary, this study extends understanding of ocular barriers, and provides valuable information to augment design of retinal drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3acoatings 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3ahumans 3aliposomes (artificial) 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3aretina 3aretinal diseases 3arodents 0aLiposomes 0aIntravitreal 0aRetinal permeation 0aVitreoretinal interface 0aInner limiting membrane 0aAnimal models1 aPeynshaert, Karen1 aLajunen, Tatu1 aDevoldere, Joke1 adel Amo, Eva M.1 aRuponen, Marika1 aDe Smedt, Stefaan C.1 aRemaut, Katrien1 aUrtti, Arto0 tJournal of controlled release.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 328 p.952-961dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.10.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245011500191300001600306520125900322592002801581653001301609653001501622653001401637653003201651700002201683700002801705773009801733856011701831852000901948655001201957IND60131202220221119021502.0151127e200303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013120222DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0200:SAWPCI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPulatsüü, Serap10aSediment and water phosphorus characteristics in a pond of spring origin, sakaryabaşşi springs basin, turkey  ap. 200-204.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the changes in concentrations of phosphorus and iron in pondwater and porewater in the littoral zone of Sakaryabaşşi-Kirkgiz pond in central Turkey. The pond supplies water to the Rainbow Trout Fish Culture and Research Station in four months in which temperatures do not show a strong variation (16°°C-22°°C). Concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus were 4- to 5- fold higher in porewater than in pondwater; thus, diffusion of SRP from porewater to pondwater might be possible. Water content of the sediment was high, although loss on ignition ranged from 13 to 18 %% and iron content ranged from 0.16 to 0.22 mg/gdw. The total phosphorus content of the sediment was high, with a range 0.64 to 1.70 mg/gdw, and organic phosphorus was the dominant sedimentary phosphate pool in October, January, and April. Despite having calcerous sediment in the drainage area, a relatively low quantity of phosphorus was bound to calcium and aluminium. In April and October, sediment phosphorus and SRP in porewater and overlying water were greater than in other months. Our results suggest that it would be more appropriate to control phosphorus concentration in spring and autumn than in the warm summer months.  aPublisher supplied data 0asediment 0aphosphorus 0aporewater 0aSakaryabaşşi-Kirkgiz Pond1 aAkççora, Akasya1 aToksoy Kööksal, Fatma0 tWetlands.g2003 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.200-204dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282003%29023%5B0200%3ASAWPCI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245015700170520134200327592002801669650000801697650001901705650001601724650001401740650002001754650001801774650001401792650001601806653001101822653001501833653001401848653001101862653001701873653001501890700002401905700002301929700001801952700002001970700002501990773013902015856008402154852000902238655001202247IND60754666020221122055606.0211206e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075466602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2021.1073322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuissa, Jacob S.10aHomoploid hybrids, allopolyploids, and high ploidy levels characterize the evolutionary history of a western North American quillwort (Isoëtes) complex  aPolyploidy and hybridization are important processes in seed-free plant evolution. However, a major gap lies in our understanding of how these processes affect the evolutionary history of high-ploidy systems. The heterosporous lycophyte genus Isoëtes is a lineage with many putative hybrids and high-level polyploid taxa (ranging from tetraploid to dodecaploid). Here, we use a complex of western North American Isoëtes, to understand the role of hybridization and high-level polyploidy in generating and maintaining novel diversity. To uncover these processes, we use restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), multiple alleles of a single low-copy nuclear marker, whole plastomes, cytology (genome size estimates and chromosome counts), and reproductive status (fertile or sterile). With this dataset, we show that hybridization occurs easily between species in this complex and is bidirectional between identical, but not different, cytotypes. Furthermore, we show that fertile allopolyploids appear to have formed repeatedly from sterile homoploid and interploid hybrids. We propose that low prezygotic reproductive barriers and a high frequency of whole-genome duplication allow for high-level polyploid systems to generate novel lineages, and that these mechanisms may be important in shaping extant Isoëtes diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aallopolyploidy 3achromosomes 3acytotypes 3adata collection 3ahybridization 3aphylogeny 3atetraploidy 0aHybrid 0aLycophytes 0aPolyploid 0aRADseq 0aReticulation 0aSpeciation1 aKinosian, Sylvia P.1 aSchafran, Peter W.1 aBolin, Jay F.1 aTaylor, W.

The ∆⁹ acids were not as effective towards HIV-RT with the (9Z)-9-pentacosenoic acid displaying an IC₅₀ = 54 µM and the 9-pentacosynoic acid not inhibiting the enzyme at all. Fatty acid chain length and position of the unsaturation was important for the observed inhibition.

No further reports of natural GALV infections in grapevine have been published in the last two decades, and artificial inoculations of grapevine plants have not been reported. We developed and tested a synthetic GALV construct for the inoculation of Nicotiana benthamiana plants and different grapevine genotypes to investigate the ability of this virus to infect and spread systemically in different hosts. METHODS: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of all known GALV sequences and an epidemiological survey of grapevine samples to detect the virus. A GALV-Nf clone under the control of the T7 promoter was chemically synthesized based on the full-length sequence of the nipplefruit isolate GALV-Nf, the only available sequence at the time the project was conceived, and the infectious transcripts were tested in N. benthamiana plants. A GALV-Nf-based binary vector was then developed for the agroinoculation of N. benthamiana and grapevine plants. Infections were confirmed by serological and molecular analysis and the resulting ultrastructural changes were investigated in both species. RESULTS: Sequence analysis showed that the GALV coat protein is highly conserved among diverse isolates. The first epidemiological survey of cDNAs collected from 152 grapevine plants with virus-like symptoms did not reveal the presence of GALV in any of the samples. The agroinoculation of N. benthamiana and grapevine plants with the GALV-Nf binary vector promoted efficient infections, as revealed by serological and molecular analysis. The GALV-Nf infection of grapevine plants was characterized in more detail by inoculating different cultivars, revealing distinct patterns of symptom development. Ultrastructural changes induced by GALV-Nf in N. benthamiana were similar to those induced by tombusviruses in other hosts, but the cytopathological alterations in grapevine plants were less severe. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report describing the development of a synthetic GALV-Nf cDNA clone, its artificial transmission to grapevine plants and the resulting symptoms and cytopathological alterations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aTombusvirus 3aVitis 3abioactive properties 3acoat proteins 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3aepidemiological studies 3agenotype 3ahosts 3aphylogeny 3asampling 3asequence analysis 3aviruses1 aFaoro, Franco1 aGambino, Giorgio1 aMaffi, Dario1 aBracale, Marcella1 aPolverari, Annalisa1 aSanti, Luca0 tVirology journal.g2014 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.186-186dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-11-1863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03200naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010700169300001600276520183600292592002802128650002302156650002202179650002002201650002702221650001802248650001502266650001802281650001302299650001402312650001202326651001102338653001702349653001902366653002102385653003602406653001102442700002602453700001502479700002002494700002802514773010602542856008502648852000902733655001202742IND60633389520221121074651.0200103e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063338952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.02.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, Marcus10aBaseline and power analyses for the assessment of beach litter reductions in the European OSPAR region  ap. 555-564.  aMarine litter pollution is a global environmental problem. Beach litter is a part of this problem, and is widely monitored in Europe. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires a reduction of beach litter. A reduction of 30% has been proposed in the European Plastics Strategy. The aims of this study are to develop (a) a method to calculate sufficiently stable and precise baseline values for beach litter, and (b) to derive a method of power analysis to estimate the number of beach litter surveys, necessary to detect a given reduction, using these baseline values. Beach litter data from the OSPAR (Oslo Paris Convention) region were used, and tailor-made statistical methods were implemented in open source software, litteR. Descriptive statistics and Theil-Sen and Mann-Kendall trend analyses were calculated for the most abundant beach litter types, for 14 survey sites. The length of a baseline period necessary to obtain a specified precision of the mean baseline value, expressed as Coefficient of Variation (CV), was calculated. Power analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulations combined with Wilcoxon tests to determine significant deviations of the simulated datasets from the baseline mean values. For most survey sites, the mean length of monitoring periods necessary to achieve a CV < 10% amounts to four to five years with four surveys a year. The mean number of surveys necessary to detect a statistically significant reduction of 30% with 80% power ranges from 14 to 20. Power analyses show that a reduction of 10% is difficult to detect, because more than 24 surveys are needed. In contrary, a reduction of 40–50% can be detected easily with a small (<12) number of surveys. The new methods could also be applied to other areas where similar beach litter surveys are performed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adescriptive statistics 3amarine debris 3amonitoring 3anormal values 3aplastics 3apollution 3asurveys 3aEurope 0aBeach litter 0aBaseline value 0aReduction target 0aNon-parametrical power analysis 0alitteR1 aWalvoort, Dennis J.J.1 aBarry, Jon1 aFleet, David M.1 avan Loon, Willem M.G.M.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 May, v. 248 p.555-564dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04010naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002100184245007600205300001800281506007600299520174900375592002802124506003702152650002202189650000802211650001302219650002502232650002002257650001802277650000902295650002702304650001802331650002102349650001402370650002702384650001302411650002202424650002202446650005202468650001202520650003402532650002202566650003902588650000902627650006102636650001802697650003302715650003702748650003702785700002002822700001802842700001702860700001802877700002102895700001902916700002202935700001602957700002102973700001802994700001903012700002903031773017303060856004603233852000903279655001203288IND4481196720221207131246.0120502e20120403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448119672DNAL7 a224214332pmid7 aPMC33256982pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.11214231092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, David N.10aLipid-derived nanoparticles for immunostimulatory RNA adjuvant delivery  ap. E797-E803.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe specific activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has potential utility for a variety of therapeutic indications including antiviral immunotherapy and as vaccine adjuvants. TLR7 and TLR 8 may be activated by their native ligands, single-stranded RNA, or by small molecules of the imidazoquinoline family. However the use of TLR7/8 agonists for in vivo therapy is limited by instability, in the case of RNA, or systemic biodistribution and toxicity in the case of small molecule agonists. We hypothesized that unique lipid-like materials, termed "lipidoids," could be designed to efficiently deliver immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA) to TLR-expressing cells to drive innate and adaptive immune responses. A library of lipidoids was synthesized and screened for the ability to induce type I IFN activation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells when combined with isRNA oligonucleotides. Effective lipidoid-isRNA nanoparticles, when tested in mice, stimulated strong IFN-α responses following subcutaneous injection, had robust antiviral activity that suppressed influenza virus replication, and enhanced antiovalbumin humoral and cell-mediated responses when used as a vaccine adjuvant. Further, we demonstrate that whereas all immunological activity was MyD88-dependent, certain materials were found to engage both TLR7-dependent and TLR7-independent activity in the mouse suggestive of cell-specific delivery. These lipidoid formulations, which are materials designed specifically for delivery of isRNA to Toll-like receptors, were superior to the commonly used N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate–RNA delivery system and may provide new tools for the manipulation of TLR responses in vitro and in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA 3aagonists 3aantiviral properties 3aimmune response 3aimmunotherapy 3amice 3amononuclear leukocytes 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 3areceptors 3asubcutaneous injection 3atoxicity 3avaccine adjuvants 3avirus replication 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxadministration & dosage 2aAnimals 2aInterferon Type Ixmetabolism 2aLipidsxchemistry 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxphysiology 2aMice 2aMyeloid Differentiation Factor 88xgeneticsxphysiology. 2aNanoparticles 2aRNAxadministration & dosage 2aRNA, Small Interferingxgenetics 2aToll-Like Receptor 7xphysiology1 aMahon, Kerry P.1 aChikh, Ghania1 aKim, Phillip1 aChung, Hattie1 aVicari, Alain P.1 aLove, Kevin T.1 aGoldberg, Michael1 aChen, Steve1 aKrieg, Arthur M.1 aChen, Jianzhu1 aLanger, Robert1 aAnderson, Danq(Dan G.),0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Apr. 3, v. 109, no. 14 p.E797-E803dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1121423109  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001800169245010500187300001600292520177000308592002802078653002602106653001902132653001702151653001602168700002402184700002302208773009802231856011702329852000902446655001202455IND60131202420221119021636.0151127e200306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013120242DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0386:TCAPRO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiangbo10aTissue culture and plant regeneration of spartina alterniflora: implications for wetland restoration  ap. 386-393.  aA tissue culture and plant regeneration protocol for the salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora, has been developed. Callus was efficiently induced on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1 mg L⁻⁻¹ 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 1 mg L⁻⁻¹ indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Callus initiation from 6-day-old seedlings was faster and occurred with a greater frequency than callus initiation from coleoptile-covered segments from the same age seedlings. However, only the coleoptile-covered segments produced regenerable callus, which was maintained on MS medium supplemented with 1 mg L⁻⁻¹ 2,4-D and 1 mg L⁻⁻¹ naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The regenerable callus differentiated into shoots upon transfer to shoot regeneration medium. A high frequency of shoot regeneration was obtained when the medium contained 3 mg L⁻⁻¹ 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) or Thidiazuron (TDZ), with or without the addition of 0.2 mg L⁻⁻¹ IAA. Regenerated shoots were transferred to root regeneration medium, the optimal of which was determined to be half-strength MS medium supplemented with 1 mg L⁻⁻¹ indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). TDZ in the shoot regeneration medium inhibited root formation in the root regeneration medium, making BA rather than TDZ the optimal hormone for the shoot regeneration medium. The mode of plant regeneration was organogenesis. Upon transfer to soil, the most successful growth of plants occurred in a mixture of commercially available potting soil and natural marsh mud. The development of a tissue culture and regeneration protocol for S. alterniflora provides the possibility of selecting lines of this species, via somaclonal variation, with characteristics desirable for wetland creation and restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSpartina alterniflora 0atissue culture 0aregeneration 0arestoration1 aSeliskar, Denise M.1 aGallagher, John L.0 tWetlands.g2003 June, v. 23, no. 2 p.386-393dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282003%29023%5B0386%3ATCAPRO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015200159300002000311500001900331520192700350592002802277650001202305650002802317650002302345650001202368650002302380650001702403650003102420650001802451650001902469650001302488650001602501650001102517650001202528700002402540700002102564700002102585700002402606773014402630856007402774852000902848655001202857IND60722255420221118104436.0201230e20201223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072225542DNAL7 a10.1039/d0tb01945c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChhipa, Hemraj10aSelf-assembled nanostructures of phosphomolybdate, nucleobase and metal ions synthesis and their in vitro cytotoxicity studies on cancer cell lines  ap. 11044-11054.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe ability of the multidentate nucleobases, adenine and thymine, to coordinate polyoxometalate and metal ions leading to the formation of self-assembled nanostructures and their strong cytotoxicity toward cancer cell lines have been demonstrated. A unique synthetic approach is developed to make a series of functional nanoscale hybrid materials consisting of nucleobases (adenine and thymine) and phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) through solid state chemical reaction and self-assembly process. Adenine was protonated through its ring nitrogen, while the ketone group in thymine was protonated during the addition of PMA to these nucleobases. The self-assembled nanostructures formed as a result of the electrostatic interaction between the protonated nucleobases and polyanionic PMA. To promote the base pairing between the nucleobases, chloroaurate ions and silver ions were added to each PMA/adenine and PMA/thymine nanostructures. The complexation between the nucleobases and the added metal ions was found to drive the formation of subsequent self-assembled nanostructures. All the materials were screened for their anticancer activity against breast (MDAMB-231) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells, and non-cancerous keratinocyte cells HaCaT. PMA/adenine/[AuCl₄]⁻ and PMA/thymine/Ag⁺ nanostructures were found to have strong anti-cancer activity, while PMA/adenine/Ag⁺, PMA/thymine/[AuCl₄]⁻, and PMA/pdenine, PMA/thymine nanostructures did not exhibit such activity. The unique redox properties of these materials and the self-assembly of the PMA and metal ions were the major factors responsible for the cytotoxicity. This unique approach of making functional nanomaterials incorporate the nucleobase, PMA and metal ions using solid state self-assembly and their anti-cancer applications are considered to be an effective approach for the development of inorganic nucleoside analogue bio-pharmaceutical agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenine 3aantineoplastic activity 3abiopharmaceuticals 3abreasts 3achemical reactions 3acytotoxicity 3aelectrostatic interactions 3akeratinocytes 3aneoplasm cells 3anitrogen 3anucleosides 3asilver 3athymine1 aSrinivasa Reddy, T.1 aSoni, Sarvesh K.1 aSelvakannan, PR.1 aBhargava, Suresh K.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2020 Dec. 23, v. 8, no. 48 p.11044-11054dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0tb01945c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001600169245008600185300001600271520145900287592002801746650002901774650001701803650002201820650001301842650001701855650001901872650001101891650003701902650001501939650000901954650002701963650001401990650001302004650002502017650001502042650002002057650001802077650001202095650002702107650001602134650001102150650002302161650002902184650003402213650002002247650001102267650004202278651001602320653001502336653002802351653002002379653000802399653001402407653002102421700002202442700002802464700001802492700001902510700001602529700002102545773008202566856008402648852000902732655001202741IND60088308320221118032545.0160901e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008830832DNAL7 a231111282pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Luca10aSediment contamination assessment in urban areas based on total suspended solids  ap. 339-350.  aSediment represents an important compartment in surface waters. It constitutes a habitat or spawning site for many organisms and is an essential trophic resource for higher level organisms. It can be impacted by anthropogenic activities, particularly through urban wet-weather discharges like stormwater and combined sewer overflows. An approach was presented for assessing the risks caused by urban wet-weather discharges to the sediment compartment based on total suspended solids (TSS). TSS is routinely measured in field surveys and can be considered as a tracer for urban wet-weather contamination. Three assessment endpoints linked with TSS were proposed: a) siltation of the riverbed, b) oxygen demand due to organic matter degradation and c) accumulation of ecotoxic contaminants on the riverbed (heavy metals, PAHs). These criteria were translated in terms of the maximal TSS accumulation load and exposure time (percentage of time exceeding the accumulation criteria) to account for sediment accumulation dynamics and resuspension in streams impacted by urban wet-weather discharges. These assessment endpoints were implemented in a stochastic model that calculates TSS behavior in receiving waters and allows therefore an assessment of potential impacts. The approach was applied to three Swiss case studies. For each, good agreement was found between the risk predictions and the field measurements confirming the reliability of the approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3aexposure duration 3ahabitats 3aheavy metals 3aorganic matter 3aoxygen 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aprediction 3arisk 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3aspawning 3astochastic processes 3astormwater 3astream channels 3asurface water 3asurveys 3atotal suspended solids 3aurban areas 2aCities 2aDrainage, Sanitary 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aRisk Assessment 2aRivers 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 0aSwitzerland 0aStormwater 0aCombined sewer overflow 0aRisk assessment 0aTSS 0aSediments 0aStochastic model1 aChèvre, Nathalie1 aFankhauser, R.q(Rolf),1 aMargot, Jonas1 aCurdy, Romuald1 aBabut, Marc1 aBarry, D.

The study was carried out under natural rainfed conditions at the Thrace Agricultural Research Institute in Edirne-Turkey between 1999 and 2001. The experiments were set up in split-split plots in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The main plot treatments were three different-height sunflower hybrids, DW-1, DW-2, and Trakya-80. The sub plots were three levels of nitrogen, 0, 60, and 120 kg N/ha. The sub-sub plots were three planting densities, 10 × 70 (142,850 plants/ha), 15 × 70 (95,230 plants/ ha), and 20 × 70 cm (71,430 plants/ha). Based on marginal economic analyses, the economically optimal seed yield per hectare was obtained at 50 kg N/ ha for DW-1 and at 80 kg N/ha for DW-2 and Trakya-80. In all three hybrids, increasing plant densities decreased 1000-seed weight, hull percentage, and head diameter but increased test weight in natural rainfed conditions. The highest seed yield in both dwarf hybrids was obtained with the spacing of 15 × 70 cm (95,230 plants/ha). The results of this research show that nitrogen and plant density have significant effects on seed yield and some yield components of different-height sunflower hybrids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3aeconomic analysis 3ahybrids 3anitrogen 3aplant density 3aplanting 3aseed yield 3ayield components 3aTurkey (country) 0asunflower 0adwarf 0anitrogen 0aplant density0 tHelia.g2014 June 7, v. 33, no. 53 p.207-214dDe Gruyterx2197-04837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helia.2010.33.53.2073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009000168300001600258520149000274536010801764592002801872596010501900650001202005650001802017650001202035650001802047650002802065651001502093653002302108653001702131653002602148653001802174653002402192773011802216856008602334852000902420655001202429IND60753565420221119160020.0211015e20210914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075356542DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2020.18529092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Carla10aTrusted land: land deals, climate vulnerability and adaptation in Northern Mozambique  ap. 685-696.  aThe surge of private land concessions in Sub-Saharan Africa carries the potential to push local populations to marginal areas, aggravating their climate vulnerability. This paper analyses the effects of resettlement on the vulnerability of relocated rural communities in Mozambique, from the perspective of environmental justice. The research seeks to understand how land concessions interfere with autonomous processes of adaptation that are not recognised within land distribution policies. The findings draw on a qualitative field research in two locations, in the provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado, where levels of poverty have persisted despite national trends of economic growth. The paper highlights how climate events inflluence perceptions of fairness amongst resettled populations, and how resettlements constrain their adaptative capabilities. The findings raise concern that misrecognition of adaptation practices can exacerbate the vulnerability of households to environmental change and to food insecurity, thereby hindering the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially SDG1 (No Poverty), SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG13 (Climate Action). The author argues for the centrality of recognition within environmental justice, while contributing recommendations to ensure that land deals fulfil principles of distributional and procedural justice, which take into consideration the compound pressures of land use changes and climate vulnerability.  aThis work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [grant number SFRH/BD/84785/2012].  aPublisher supplied data  aSFRH/BD/84785/2012cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologiadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001871 3aclimate 3afood security 3apoverty 3aprivate lands 3asustainable development 3aMozambique 0aSub-Saharan Africa 0acapabilities 0aenvironmental justice 0aresettlements 0asmallholder farmers0 tClimate and development.g2021 Sept. 14, v. 13, no. 8 p.685-696dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19683x1756-55377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2020.18529093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245006400209300001400273520192600287592002802213650001302241650003602254650001202290650001502302650001002317650001602327650001102343650001102354650002002365650002202385650001202407650000902419653001102428653001902439653001602458653001202474653001302486653002202499700002102521773010402542856008602646852000902732655001202741IND60629721520221118224331.0190326e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062972152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuisoto, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1252-047914aThe role of stress in drug addiction. An integrative review  ap. 62-68.  aThe high prevalence and burden to society of drug abuse and addiction is undisputed. However, its conceptualisation as a brain disease is controversial, and available interventions insufficient. Research on the role of stress in drug addiction may bridge positions and develop more effective interventions.The aim of this paper is to integrate the most influential literature to date on the role of stress in drug addiction.A literature search was conducted of the core collections of Web of Science and Semantic Scholar on the topic of stress and addiction from a neurobiological perspective in humans. The most frequently cited articles and related references published in the last decade were finally redrafted into a narrative review based on 130 full-text articles.First, a brief overview of the neurobiology of stress and drug addiction is provided. Then, the role of stress in drug addiction is described. Stress is conceptualised as a major source of allostatic load, which result in progressive long-term changes in the brain, leading to a drug-prone state characterized by craving and increased risk of relapse. The effects of stress on drug addiction are mainly mediated by the action of corticotropin-releasing factor and other stress hormones, which weaken the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and strengthen the amygdala, leading to a negative emotional state, craving and lack of executive control, increasing the risk of relapse. Both, drugs and stress result in an allostatic overload responsible for neuroadaptations involved in most of the key features of addiction: reward anticipation/craving, negative affect, and impaired executive functions, involved in three stages of addiction and relapse.This review elucidates the crucial role of stress in drug addiction and highlights the need to incorporate the social context where brain-behaviour relationships unfold into the current model of addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamygdala 3acorticotropin-releasing hormone 3acraving 3adrug abuse 3adrugs 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3amodels 3aneurophysiology 3aprefrontal cortex 3arelapse 3arisk 0aStress 0aDrug-addiction 0aHippocampus 0aCraving 0aAmygdala 0aPrefrontal cortex1 aContador, Israel0 tPhysiology & behavior.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 202 p.62-68dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11731x0031-93847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01821naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245012200161300001800283520051300301592002800814650001600842650002300858650002300881650001500904650002100919650001900940650001200959650003100971650001901002650001401021650001501035650002201050650002401072650002701096700002001123700005501143773012101198856008301319852000901402655001201411IND60647818620221122001636.0190621e20190603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064781862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b015302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hui10aPreparation of a Multiple-Targeting NIR-Based Fluorogenic Probe and Its Application for Selective Cancer Cell Imaging  ap. 4628-4631.  aTo improve cancer selectivity of imaging agents, we synthesized the triple-targeting, near-infrared (NIR) based fluorogenic probe, Oct-FK(PBA)-NIR.

The diversity of alpine stream biota is largely reflective of environmental heterogeneity stemming from varying hydrological sources. Globally, alpine stream diversity is under threat as meltwater sources recede and stream conditions become increasingly homogeneous. Much attention has been devoted to macroinvertebrate diversity in alpine headwaters, yet to fully understand the breadth of climate change threats, a more thorough accounting of microbial diversity is needed. We characterized microbial diversity (specifically Bacteria and Archaea) of 13 streams in two disjunct Rocky Mountain subranges through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our study encompassed the spectrum of alpine stream sources (glaciers, snowfields, subterranean ice, and groundwater) and three microhabitats (ice, biofilms, and streamwater). We observed no difference in regional (γ) diversity between subranges but substantial differences in diversity among (β) stream types and microhabitats. Within‐stream (α) diversity was highest in groundwater‐fed springs, lowest in glacier‐fed streams, and positively correlated with water temperature for both streamwater and biofilm assemblages. We identified an underappreciated alpine stream type—the icy seep—that are fed by subterranean ice, exhibit cold temperatures (summer mean <2°C), moderate bed stability, and relatively high conductivity. Icy seeps will likely be important for combatting biodiversity losses as they contain similar microbial assemblages to streams fed by surface ice yet may be buffered against climate change by insulating debris cover. Our results show that the patterns of microbial diversity support an ominous trend for alpine stream biodiversity; as meltwater sources decline, stream communities will become more diverse locally, but regional diversity will be lost. Icy seeps, however, represent a source of optimism for the future of biodiversity in these imperiled ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Wyoming‐National Park Service  cTeton Conservation District  a52008116cHHMI Sustaining Excellence Award  cUniversity of Kentucky Gertrude Flora Ribble Graduate Research Fellowship 3aArchaea 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3abiofilm 3aclimate change 3acold 3aecosystems 3aglaciers 3agroundwater 3aice 3amacroinvertebrates 3amicrohabitats 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asnowmelt 3astreams 3asummer 3awater temperature1 aFoley, Mary E.1 aZeglin, Lydia H.1 aFinn, Debra S.1 aTronstad, Lusha M.1 aGiersch, J.

The aim of this study was to examine pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) and heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) as biomarkers of dairy foods intake. METHODS AND RESULTS: The data used in the present study were obtained as part of the Food4me Study. Estimates of C15:0 and C17:0 from dried blood spots and intakes of dairy from a Food Frequency Questionnaire were obtained from participants (n = 1180) across seven countries. Regression analyses were used to explore associations of biomarkers with dairy intake levels and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to evaluate the fatty acids. Significant positive associations were found between C15:0 and total intakes of high‐fat dairy products. C15:0 showed good ability to distinguish between low and high consumers of high‐fat dairy products. CONCLUSION: C15:0 can be used as a biomarker of high‐fat dairy intake and of specific high‐fat dairy products. Both C15:0 and C17:0 performed poorly for total dairy intake highlighting the need for caution when using these in epidemiological studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3adairy consumption 3aepidemiological studies 3afatty acids 3afood frequency questionnaires 3ahigh fat dairy products 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition research 3aregression analysis1 aCelis‐Morales, Carlos1 aMarsaux, Cyril F.

Between 1923 and 1997, there were only six reports of the species in Oregon. Small broomrape is a holoparasitic weed that attaches to the root of its host and can lead to crop failure depending on the level of infestation. Small broomrape was identified in a red clover field in Oregon in 1998. In 2000 and 2001, the Oregon Department of Agriculture surveyed red and white clover fields in Oregon for the presence of small broomrape; 15 infested fields were identified in 2000 and 22 in 2001. The source of the small broomrape seed was not identified although there was speculation that small broomrape seed may have been contaminated clover seed stock. In 2000, a quarantine was established for small broomrape in red clover seed. Research identified effective, easy to implement management strategies for small broomrape including the use of false host crops and imazamox. In 2003, the ODA amended the quarantine to eliminate the mandatory seed sampling and testing and the requirement of reporting infested fields and seed lots. In 2011, there are still populations of small broomrape present in red clover fields in Oregon.Nomenclature: Small broomrape, Orobanche minor Sm.; red clover, Trifolium pratense L.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrobanche 3aTrifolium pratense 3aTrifolium repens 3ahost plants 3aimazamox 3anoxious weeds 3aquarantine 3aOregon 0aChemical control 0aeradication 0afalse host 0agrowing degree-day model 0aholoparasitic 0aparasitic plant 0aquarantine1 aColquhoun, Jed0 tWeed science.g2012 Apr., v. 60, no. 2 p.277-282dWeed Science Society of Americax0043-17457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2FWS-D-11-00078.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245011300203300001600316500001400332500002000346520194500366592002802311650001702339650001402356650001502370650003002385650001602415650001202431650002402443650001502467650002602482650001402508650001702522650001202539650002402551650001302575650001102588650001802599650002202617650001502639650001502654650001802669650001602687650001602703650001402719650001902733650001002752650001002762650002102772650001302793700001902806773011002825856007302935852000903008655001203017IND60704219020221119131831.0200722e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070421902DNAL7 a10.1111/btp.127802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabel, Jan Christian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1378-938110aEcosystem functions in natural and anthropogenic ecosystems across the East African coastal forest landscape  ap. 598-607.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHabitat identity and landscape configuration significantly shape species communities and affect ecosystem functions. The conservation of natural ecosystems is of particular relevance in regions where landscapes have already been largely transformed into farmland and where habitats suffer under resource exploitation. The spillover of ecosystem functions from natural ecosystems into farmland may positively influence agricultural productivity and human livelihood quality. We measured three proxies of ecosystem functioning: Pollinator diversity (using pan traps), seed dispersal (with a seed removal experiment), and predation (using dummy caterpillars). We assessed these ecosystem functions in three forest types of the East African dry coastal forest (Brachystegia forest, Cynometra forest, and mixed forest), as well as in adjoining farmland and in plantations of exotic trees (Eucalyptus mainly). We measured ecosystem functions at 20 plots for each habitat type, and along gradients ranging from the forest into farmland. We also recorded various environmental parameters for each study plot. We did not find significant differences of ecosystem functions when combining all proxies assessed, neither among the three natural forest types, nor between natural forest and plantations. However, we found trends for single ecosystem functions. We identified highest pollinator diversity along the forest margin and in farmlands. Vegetation cover and blossom density affected the level of predation positively. Based on our findings, we suggest that flowering gardens around housings and woodlots across farmland areas support ecosystem functioning and thus improve human livelihood quality. We conclude that levels of overall ecosystem functions are affected by entire landscapes, and high landscape heterogeneity, as found in our case, might blur potential negative effects and trends arising from habitat destruction and degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachystegia 3aCynometra 3aEucalyptus 3aagricultural productivity 3adegradation 3adensity 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3aforest types 3agardens 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ainsect larvae 3aintroduced plants 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3amixed forests 3aplantations 3apollinators 3apredation 3aseed dispersal 3ashape 3atraps 3avegetation cover 3awoodlots1 aUlrich, Werner0 tBiotropica.g2020 July, v. 52, no. 4 p.598-607dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45461x0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.127803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245013400206300001600340520204800356592002802404650002002432650001902452650002502471650002502496650002602521650002402547650001102571650001402582650003002596650002202626650001302648650001902661650000902680650002302689650002102712650001702733651001902750653002502769653001502794653001102809653001502820653002002835653002302855700001902878700001802897700001802915773010502933856008603038852000903124655001203133IND60589455120221117000125.0200427e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058945512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHynds, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1260-268810aEfficacy of a national hydrological risk communication strategy: Domestic wastewater treatment systems in the Republic of Ireland  ap. 205-213.  aA significant body of research has focused on the role of domestic wastewater treatment systems (DWWTSs) as sources of human-specific aquatic contaminants in both developed and developing regions. However, to date few studies have sought to investigate the awareness, attitudes and behaviours of DWWTS owners and the efficacy of associated communication initiatives. The current study provides an examination of a public national engagement campaign undertaken in the Republic of Ireland which seeks to minimise the impact of DWWTSs on human and ecological health via concurrent inspection and information dissemination. Overall, 1634 respondents were surveyed using a “before and after” study design to capture if and how awareness, attitudes and behaviours evolved over time. Findings suggest that whilst the campaign provided a modest baseline to raise general awareness associated with the basic operational and maintenance requirements of DWWTS, there has been little or no behavioural engagement as a result, suggesting a significant awareness-behaviour gap. Accordingly, efforts to minimise potential human and ecological impacts have been unsuccessful. Moreover, results suggest that public attitudes towards water-related regulation and policy became increasingly negative over the study period due to parallel political and economic issues, further complicating future engagement. Future strategies, both in Ireland and further afield, should focus on health-based demographically-focused message framing to achieve significant knowledge and attitudinal shifts amongst specific population cohorts, and thus bring about significant behavioural change. Study findings and recommendations may be used by myriad stakeholders including local, provincial and national authorities to effectively engage with individuals and communities prior to and during implementation of legislative and policy-based instruments within numerous spheres including climate change adaptation, environmental quality, hydrological risk, and hydro-ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental quality 3aexperimental design 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3ainformation dissemination 3aissues and policy 3apolitics 3apublic opinion 3arisk 3arisk communication 3asewage treatment 3astakeholders 3aIrish Republic 0aWastewater treatment 0aRegulation 0aPolicy 0aEngagement 0aSocio-hydrology 0aRisk communication1 aNaughton, Owen1 aO'Neill, Eoin1 aMooney, Simon0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Mar., v. 558 p.205-213dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012000166300001600286520219300302592002802495650001202523650001202535650001602547650001102563650002202574650001202596650001102608650001802619650001902637650002302656650001102679650001102690650001902701650001102720651002102731700002202752700002102774773009302795856008102888990002302969852000902992655001203001IND60096221620221119070030.0141104e20130201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009622162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csr.2012.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachado, Irene10aVariability of chlorophyll-a in the Southwestern Atlantic from satellite images: Seasonal cycle and ENSO influences  ap. 102-109.  aSeasonal and interannual satellite chlorophyll-a variability (CSAT) was assessed in the Southwestern Atlantic based on over 11 years (1997–2008) of Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor data. An Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis of the seasonal CSAT cycle showed strong variability and the spatial structure of the leading pattern revealed an opposite behavior over the continental shelf north and south of 37°S with low (high) biomass south (north) of 37°S during wintertime. This distribution is related to the lack of stratification of the water column in the southernmost region during winter due to heat loss to the atmosphere as well as wind induced and convective mixing, in contrast to a vertically stable water column north of 37°S induced by the fresh Río de la Plata discharge. High variability in CSAT between 47 and 51°S in the inner and outer shelves could be related to the southern Patagonian fronts. On interannual time scales the influence of El Niño-Southern Oscillation on CSAT during spring was estimated and related to wind stress, vertical velocities and Río de la Plata discharge. During El Niño events the continental shelf north of 45°S is characterized by high CSAT values (anomalies>0.5mgm⁻³) while low values are found to the south (anomalies<−0.5mgm⁻³), except for positive anomalies near to the Malvinas Islands. The opposite pattern occurred in La Niña years. Conversely, the Brazil–Malvinas confluence has a lower CSAT in El Niño years in comparison with La Niña years. The higher chlorophyll-a of some areas over the shelf north of 45°S during El Niño was supported by increased Río de la Plata discharges, northerly winds anomalies and upwelling generated in the shelf between 33 and 39°S. The winds tend to retain the patch of high chlorophyll-a off Río de la Plata in spring, but advect it toward the Brazilian coast in summer. This result indicates the extreme importance of wind variability for the spreading or retention of phytoplankton in this area. No support was found for a mechanism linking Ekman pumping and CSAT variability over the continental shelf south of 45°S and in the Malvinas–Brazil confluence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEl Nino 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3acontinental shelf 3aislands 3amixing 3aphytoplankton 3aremote sensing 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awind direction 3awinter 3aFalkland Islands1 aBarreiro, Marcelo1 aCalliari, Danilo0 tContinental shelf research.g2013 Feb. 1, v. 53 p.102-109dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2012.11.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245017200129300001400301500001900315520106200334592002801396650001501424650001901439650001101458650001501469650001601484650001201500650001501512650001101527650001501538650001201553653003201565653002401597653002701621700002001648700001801668700001601686700001901702700002001721773014501741852000901886655001201895IND60706259520221118054031.0201107e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070625952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButtar, M.S.10aHaematological alterations in bovine subjected to administration of epinephrine and dobutamine for maintenance of cardiovascular emergencies during general anaesthesia  ap. 21-24.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe study was conducted in 50 bovine patients affected with diaphragmatic hernia. General anaesthesia was induced using butorphanol-midazolam-ketamine protocol and maintained with isoflurane. Animals in which blood pressure did not vary much and was above the critical range throughout the anaesthetic period were categorized in group I. Animals that exhibited lowered blood pressure during anaesthesia were subjected to the treatment with epinephrine (group II) or dobutamine (group III) for maintenance of arterial blood pressure. Non significant decrease in Haemoglobin and PCV, no change in TLC and DLC were the important haematological changes. Non significant increase in glucose, decrease in plasma proteins, BUN and creatinine were the major biochemical changes during the period of anaesthesia. Base values of creatinine in groups II (4.28±1.78) and III (3.20±1.52) were higher than the normal values. From the results of present study it was concluded that these drugs could be administered safely in animals suffering from diaphragmatic hernia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanesthesia 3ablood pressure 3acattle 3acreatinine 3aepinephrine 3aglucose 3ahemoglobin 3ahernia 3aisoflurane 3asurgery 0aDiaphragmatic herniorrhaphy 0aGeneral anaesthesia 0aHaematological changes1 aSingh, Tarunbir1 aMohindroo, J.1 aSaini, N.S.1 aVerma, Pallavi1 aSingh, Chanchal0 tIndian journal of veterinary surgery.g2015 June, v. 36, no. 1 p.21-24dIndian Society for Veterinary SurgerywJournal:2007x0973-97267nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011600169300002000285500001900305520132600324592002801650650001301678650002601691650001401717700006001731700002001791773012401811856008201935852000902017655001202026IND60736552920221122125659.0210510e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073655292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-06001-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanazawa, Shuhei10aInfrared spectroscopy of graphene nanoribbons and aromatic compounds with sp3C–H (methyl or methylene groups)  ap. 12285-12314.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGraphene nanoribbon (GNR) has attracted attention because of the adjustable band gap, depending on the width and functional groups. The introduction of sp³C–H on edges is one of the choices to reduce the agglomeration between GNRs and to change their various properties. Infrared spectroscopy is among the powerful tools to analyze the edge structures of carbon materials, but the number of detailed reports is almost nonexistent for sp³C–H in carbon materials. In this work, the influence of the presence of sp³C–H on the peak position of sp²C–H on zigzag and armchair edges of GNR was revealed by comparing experimental and computational infrared spectra of aromatic compounds. The introduction of methylene and methyl groups next to sp²C–H affected peak positions of in-plane stretching and out-of-plane bending vibration of sp²C–H. The peak position of sp²C–H was further shifted by introducing methylene and methyl groups on both sides of sp²C–H. The presence of either methylene or methyl groups can be clearly distinguished from the difference in coupled vibration of out-of-plane vibration of sp²C–H and quadrant stretching vibration of C=C because the presence of methylene groups affects the conjugated system significantly, whereas methyl groups did not affect the conjugated system.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3avibration1 aYamada, Yasuhiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4974-51481 aSatō, Satoshi,0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 July, v. 56, no. 21 p.12285-12314dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-06001-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245013100208300001200339520223900351592002802590650001302618650001302631650001802644650002402662650002202686650001802708650002102726650001102747650001502758650001402773650001502787650001402802650001002816650001502826700001602841773010502857856008302962852000903045655001203054IND60720479520221119103804.0210921e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072047952DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-020-02780-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarker, Umakanta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6814-881610aNutraceuticals, phytochemicals, and radical quenching ability of selected drought-tolerant advance lines of vegetable amaranth  ap. 564.  aBACKGROUND: Vegetable amaranth is a source of natural phytopigments and functional components of the commercial food industry for sustainable health benefits across the globe. It is guessed that recently identified amaranth (drought-tolerant) genotypes may contain ample phytopigments and phytochemicals suitable to extract juice as drinks. Hence, phytopigments and phytochemicals content of amaranth were assessed in detail for suitability as drinks to feed the phytochemicals deficient community across the globe. RESULTS: The selected amaranth contained adequate carbohydrates, protein, moisture, and dietary fiber, phytopigments, minerals, phytochemicals including the ability to scavenge radicals. Nine flavonoids compounds were estimated in amaranth genotypes including six flavonols, one flavanol, one flavone, and one flavanone. It is the first effort in which we identified one flavonol such as myricetin, one flavanol, such as catechin, one flavone i. e., apigenin, and one flavanone, like naringenin in drought-tolerant vegetable amaranth. Across six flavonols, quercetin and rutin were the most noteworthy compounds followed by myricetin and isoquercetin. Across the accessions, AT7 and AT15 had abundant phytochemicals, and radical quenching ability including considerable proximate, nutraceuticals, and phytopigments in comparison to the accessions AT3 and AT11. AT15 demonstrated the maximum total flavonols including the highest rutin and hyperoside. AT7 showed high total flavonols including the highest quercetin, isoquercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol. The association of values revealed that studied phytopigments and phytochemicals of vegetable amaranth accessions demonstrated good radical quenching ability of 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and 2,2- Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl equivalent to Trolox. CONCLUSIONS: These advance lines AT7 and AT15 had abundant nutraceuticals, phytopigments, and phytochemicals including radical quenching ability. These lines might significantly contribute to the promotion of health benefits and feeding the community across the globe deficit in nutraceuticals and antioxidants. Identified flavonoid compounds open the new route for pharmacological study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapigenin 3acatechin 3adietary fiber 3adietary supplements 3adrought tolerance 3afood industry 3ahealth promotion 3ajuices 3akaempferol 3amyricetin 3anaringenin 3aquercetin 3arutin 3avegetables1 aOba, Shinya0 tBMC plant biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.564-564dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02780-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245016800185300001800353520114800371592002801519650001501547650001801562650001601580650002001596650001501616650001201631650001901643650002201662650001301684650001401697650003701711650007501748650002901823650001801852650003901870650006101909650001701970650001101987650001201998650005602010650001302066650002402079650003602103700001802139700001702157700002202174773011002196856008102306990002302387852000902410655001202419IND60090836920221119021823.0141102e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009083692DNAL7 a238306952pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2013.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaraki, Fumika10aStructure–activity relationship studies of Niemann-Pick type C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) ligands identified by screening assay monitoring pharmacological chaperone effect  ap. 5297-5309.  aA number of hereditary diseases are caused by defective protein trafficking due to a folding defect resulting from point mutations in proteins. Ligands that bind to the folding intermediates of such mutant proteins and rescue their trafficking defects, known as pharmacological chaperones, have promise for the treatment of certain genetic diseases, including Fabry disease, cystic fibrosis, and Niemann-Pick disease type C. Here we show that this pharmacological chaperone effect can be used for ligand screening, that is, binding of candidate ligands can be detected by monitoring the ligand-mediated correction of a localization defect caused by artificially introduced point mutations of the protein of interest. Using this method, we discovered novel steroidal ligands of Niemann-Pick type C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), an intestinal cholesterol transporter that is the target of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, and conducted structure–activity relationship studies. We also present data indicating that the binding site of the new ligands is distinct from both the N-terminal sterol-binding domain and the ezetimibe-binding site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abinding sites 3acholesterol 3acystic fibrosis 3amonitoring 3amutants 3apoint mutation 3aprotein transport 3aproteins 3ascreening 3astructure-activity relationships 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aAzetidinesxpharmacology 2aBinding Sites 2aBiological Transportxdrug effects 2aCarbamatesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHumans 2aLigands 2aMembrane Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aSteroidsxchemistry 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aOhgane, Kenji1 aDodo, Kosuke1 aHashimoto, Yuichi0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2013 Sept. 1, v. 21, no. 17 p.5297-5309dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2013.06.0223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245013400206300001800340506007600358520168200434592002802116506003702144650001502181650001002196650001302206650001902219650001102238650002502249650001502274650002802289650003302317650001402350650002202364650001602386700005902402773013302461856008202594852000902676655001202685IND60675315320221207144017.0191105e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067531532DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-03961-w2doi7 aPMC68289012pmcid7 a317415152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRani, Poonam10aEffect of ultrasound and chemical pretreatment on drying characteristics and quality attributes of hot air dried pineapple slices  ap. 4911-4924.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDrying of food materials is a time consuming activity making the process cost and energy intensive and hence, several pretreatments are used to improve the drying rate. The present study aims to study the effect of potassium metabisulphite (KMS solution, 0.25% w/v) and ultrasound (20 and 30 min) pretreatment on hot air drying characteristics and quality of pineapple slices. The results indicated that pretreated samples provided higher drying rate, enhanced moisture diffusivity, brighter color and lower hardness than that of untreated dried sample. It was observed that KMS and ultrasound pretreatment for 20 and 30 min reduced the drying time by 23.8%, 19% and 14.3%, respectively. Further, ten thin layer drying models were applied to the experimental drying data and logarithmic model was best fitted to explain the drying behavior of pretreated and untreated samples. Additionally, the effect of shrinkage on moisture transfer mechanism was also studied. Results highlighted that instantaneous moisture diffusivity was increased during drying while shrinkage was not accounted. However, shrinkage consideration reduced the average moisture diffusivity values by 72–83%. Overall color change (13.95 ± 0.92) and browning index (36.02 ± 2.45) were found to be lowest in ultrasound (30 min) pretreated dried sample, highlighting better color stability. Scanning electron microscopy presented noticeable effects of pretreatment on alterations of microstructure of pineapple slices. It can be interpreted that KMS pretreatment was found to be more effective for improvement of drying characteristics of pineapple slices as compared to ultrasound pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair drying 3acolor 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3amoisture diffusivity 3apineapples 3apotassium metabisulfite 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashrinkage 3athin-layer drying 3aultrasonics1 aTripathy, P.

Identifiability is improved if diverse data types are used for parameter estimation. However, some models, including detailed solute transport models, are further limited by prohibitive computation times. This often precludes the use of concentration data for parameter estimation, even if those data are available. In the case of surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) models, concentration data can provide SW-GW mixing ratios, which efficiently constrain the estimate of exchange flow, but are rarely used. We propose to reduce computational limits by simulating SW-GW exchange at a sink (well or drain) based on particle tracking under steady state flow conditions. Particle tracking is used to simulate advective transport. A comparison between the particle tracking surrogate model and an advective–dispersive model shows that dispersion can often be neglected when the mixing ratio is computed for a sink, allowing for use of the particle tracking surrogate model. The surrogate model was implemented to solve the inverse problem for a real SW-GW transport problem with heads and concentrations combined in a weighted hybrid objective function. The resulting inversion showed markedly reduced uncertainty in the transmissivity field compared to calibration on head data alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3amixing 3asurface water 3auncertainty 0aParticle-tracking 0aSurrogate model 0aStream-aquifer 0aNull-space Monte carlo1 aPryet, Alexandre1 aAtteia, Olivier1 aFerré, Ty P.A.1 aDelbart, Célestine1 aValois, Rémi1 aDupuy, Alain1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1723-91090 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Mar., v. 558 p.356-365dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010400168300001600272520190500288592002802193650002502221650002302246650001402269650002002283650001002303650002002313650001502333650002102348650001502369650002402384650002602408650001002434650001202444650002002456650001402476650001002490653001902500653002002519653001502539653003002554653002002584653001202604653002902616653001802645700002702663700001502690700003302705700002102738700002202759700002002781700002302801700001902824773010302843856008102946852000903027655001203036IND60130953320221122002319.0151127e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013095332DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-11-00113.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestwood, James H.14aThe Parasitic Plant Genome Project: New Tools for Understanding the Biology of Orobanche and Striga  ap. 295-306.  aThe Parasitic Plant Genome Project has sequenced transcripts from three parasitic species and a nonparasitic relative in the Orobanchaceae with the goal of understanding genetic changes associated with parasitism. The species studied span the trophic spectrum from free-living nonparasite to obligate holoparasite. Parasitic species used were Triphysaria versicolor, a photosynthetically competent species that opportunistically parasitizes roots of neighboring plants; Striga hermonthica, a hemiparasite that has an obligate need for a host; and Orobanche aegyptiaca, a holoparasite with absolute nutritional dependence on a host. Lindenbergia philippensis represents the closest nonparasite sister group to the parasitic Orobanchaceae and was included for comparative purposes. Tissues for transcriptome sequencing from each plant were gathered to identify expressed genes for key life stages from seed conditioning through anthesis. Two of the species studied, S. hermonthica and O. aegyptiaca, are economically important weeds and the data generated by this project are expected to aid in research and control of these species and their relatives. The sequences generated through this project will provide an abundant resource of molecular markers for understanding population dynamics, as well as provide insight into the biology of parasitism and advance progress toward understanding parasite virulence and host resistance mechanisms. In addition, the sequences provide important information on target sites for herbicide action or other novel control strategies such as trans-specific gene silencing.Nomenclature: Egyptian broomrape, Orobanche aegyptiaca (Pers.)

Pre-hormones are stored in the follicular colloid before being reabsorbed. Following lysosomal proteolysis of its precursor, thyroid hormone (TH) is released from thyroid follicles. Although the suppressive effects of follicular Tg on each step of pre-hormone biosynthesis have been extensively characterized, whether follicular Tg accumulation also affects hormone reabsorption, proteolysis, and secretion is unclear. In this study we explored whether follicular Tg can regulate the expression and function of the lysosomal endopeptidases cathepsins. We found that in the rat thyroid cell line FRTL-5 follicular Tg induced cathepsin H mRNA and protein expression, as well as cathepsin H enzyme activity. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that Tg endocytosis promoted cathepsin H translocalization into lysosomes where it co-localized with internalized Tg. These results suggest that cathepsin H is an active participant in lysosome-mediated pre-hormone degradation, and that follicular Tg stimulates mobilization of pre-hormones by activating cathepsin H-associated proteolysis pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiosynthesis 3acathepsin H 3aendocytosis 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aiodine 3alysosomes 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteolysis 3arats 3asecretion 3astaining 3athyroglobulin 3athyroid hormones 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aThyroglobulin 0aCathepsin H 0aThyroid hormone1 aLuo, Yuqian1 aYoshihara, Aya1 aIshido, Yuko1 aSekihata, Kengo1 aUsukura, Kensei1 aSue, Mariko1 aHiroi, Naoki1 aHirose, Takahisa1 aSuzuki, Kōichi,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Jan. 29, v. 483 p.541-546dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.12.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011800168300001400286520159000300592002801890650001501918650001101933650001101944650001101955650001501966650000901981650001401990650001102004650001602015650001602031650000902047651001302056653001902069653002302088653002002111653002102131700001802152700001602170700001602186773010302202856008602305852000902391655001202400IND60589455420221117000440.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058945542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadler, J.M.10aModeling urban coastal flood severity from crowd-sourced flood reports using Poisson regression and Random Forest  ap. 43-55.  aSea level rise has already caused more frequent and severe coastal flooding and this trend will likely continue. Flood prediction is an essential part of a coastal city’s capacity to adapt to and mitigate this growing problem. Complex coastal urban hydrological systems however, do not always lend themselves easily to physically-based flood prediction approaches. This paper presents a method for using a data-driven approach to estimate flood severity in an urban coastal setting using crowd-sourced data, a non-traditional but growing data source, along with environmental observation data. Two data-driven models, Poisson regression and Random Forest regression, are trained to predict the number of flood reports per storm event as a proxy for flood severity, given extensive environmental data (i.e., rainfall, tide, groundwater table level, and wind conditions) as input. The method is demonstrated using data from Norfolk, Virginia USA from September 2010 to October 2016. Quality-controlled, crowd-sourced street flooding reports ranging from 1 to 159 per storm event for 45 storm events are used to train and evaluate the models. Random Forest performed better than Poisson regression at predicting the number of flood reports and had a lower false negative rate. From the Random Forest model, total cumulative rainfall was by far the most dominant input variable in predicting flood severity, followed by low tide and lower low tide. These methods serve as a first step toward using data-driven methods for spatially and temporally detailed coastal urban flood prediction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoasts 3afloods 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3asea level 3astorms 3aurban areas 3awater table 3awind 3aVirginia 0aFlood modeling 0aData-driven models 0aUrban hydrology 0aCoastal flooding1 aGoodall, J.L.1 aMorsy, M.M.1 aSpencer, K.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Apr., v. 559 p.43-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008800166300001600254520148700270592002801757650001701785650001501802650001101817650001201828650001501840651001801855700002001873773012501893856007902018852000902097655001202106IND60439536020221117224852.0151024e200110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043953602DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10175897259142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScholz, Jenna G.10aMonitoring Urban Streams: Strategies and Protocols for Humid-Region Lowland Systems  ap. 143-164.  aGovernmental mandates and public awareness have forcedprogressively smaller and less sophisticated agencies andorganizations to initiate stream monitoring programs,particularly in urban and urbanizing areas. Yet many of thesemonitoring efforts lack either a coherent conceptual frameworkor appropriately chosen methods, and they rely on monitoringtechniques that are simply infeasible for these institutionalsettings. We propose a monitoring strategy, and specificexisting monitoring protocols, that will be useful for themanagement and rehabilitation of streams in urbanizing watersheds.A monitoring strategy must be developed by 1) identifying the management question(s) being addressed, 2) determining theinstitional level of effort required (and available) toeffectively make particular kinds of measurements, and 3) identifying what specific parameters should and can be measured.Only a limited set of parameters show much utility orfeasibility in addressing the most common management questionsbeing faced by municipalities in urbanizing, humid-area regionsof the United States. These include measures of riparian canopy,bank erosion and bank hardening, and in-stream large woodydebris. With some additional expertise useful data can also beincluded on channel gradient, substrate composition, and pools.Nearly all of the other myriad parameters that have beenmeasured historically on rivers and streams show little apparentvalue in these watershed and institutional settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abank erosion 3amonitoring 3arivers 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aUnited States1 aBooth, Derek B.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2001 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.143-164dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10175897259143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245009300209300002000302500001900322520117400341592002801515650002201543650001501565650002601580650001101606650001601617650001701633650001701650650001301667700002001680700001801700773012401718856008201842852000901924655001201933IND60736553220221121020050.0210510e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073655322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-06051-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Lafi, Abdul G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3329-977X10aSpectroscopic investigations of gamma-ray irradiation effects on metal organic framework  ap. 12154-12170.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe chemical and physical features of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) at a molecular level are of great merit to understand structure–property relationships and, consequently, to aid in the design of improved high value products. This paper reports on the processing of one MOF-type material, namely MIL-101(Cr), by γ-ray irradiation at low doses up to 30 kGy. The optimum dose is determined to be 15 kGy, at which an increase in the adsorption of iodine of more than 40% is achieved in comparison with thermally activated un-irradiated MIL-101(Cr). Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and the Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET) isotherms indicate a significant particle agglomeration and a preservation of both the unit cell topology as well as the mesoporous structure of MOF. Two-dimensional correlation Fourier transformation infrared and X-ray diffraction reveals that orientation is the driving force for structural alterations including water type, bonding and contents. These effects account for the increasing adsorption capacity of MOF after irradiation and suggest further exploitation of irradiation as a promising method for MOFs activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3aiodine 3airradiation 3aporous media 3aspectroscopy 3atopology1 aAssfour, Bassem1 aAssaad, Thaer0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 July, v. 56, no. 21 p.12154-12170dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-06051-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01920naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008100164300001800245520097200263592002801235650002001263650001701283650002501300650001501325651001401340700001601354700001801370773010501388856008101493990002301574852000901597655001201606IND60093377720221121090513.0141103e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009337772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2011.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Zhiqiang10aTwo-dimensional Bayesian monitoring method for nonlinear multimode processes  ap. 5173-5183.  aNonlinear and multimode are two common behaviors in modern industrial processes, monitoring research studies have been carried out separately for these two natures in recent years. This paper proposes a two-dimensional Bayesian method for monitoring processes with both nonlinear and multimode characteristics. In this method, the concept of linear subspace is introduced, which can efficiently decompose the nonlinear process into several different linear subspaces. For construction of the linear subspace, a two-step variable selection strategy is proposed. A Bayesian inference and combination strategy is then introduced for result combination of different linear subspaces. Besides, through the direction of the operation mode, an additional Bayesian combination step is performed. As a result, a two-dimensional Bayesian monitoring approach is formulated. Feasibility and efficiency of the method are evaluated by the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process case study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acase studies 3achemical engineering 3amonitoring 3aTennessee1 aGao, Furong1 aSong, Zhihuan0 tChemical engineering science.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 66, no. 21 p.5173-5183dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.07.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245013300198500002000331520092400351592002801275596007001303650001301373650001601386650002101402650002401423650001301447650001601460700005501476700006001531700005801591700006001649700005501709773013101764856007701895852000901972655001201981IND60788175020221118162710.0220811e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078817502DNAL7 a10.1029/2020WR0276552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Eungyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2293-468612aA Method for Integrating Delayed Recharge Flux Through Unsaturated Zones into Analytical and Numerical Groundwater Flow Modeling  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe temporal delay in the water table's response to precipitation is a common phenomenon. Using a mathematical model, we developed a function that represents the recharge flux through unsaturated zones of varying thickness to model the delayed response of groundwater level due to precipitation. The recharge flux from the developed function was integrated into the analytical and numerical models to estimate the actual groundwater levels in the unsaturated zone. The analytical and numerical models accurately determined the actual groundwater levels. Additionally, calibrated hydraulic parameters from numerical estimates reflected the values measured in the actual aquifer, thereby highlighting the potential application of the developed function to wide‐ranging groundwater problems. Based on the recharge function, a recharge module can be developed for existing flow simulators to enhance groundwater modeling.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2020R1A2C2013606cNational Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3amathematical models 3aresearch 3awater table1 aJeong, Jina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5903-24941 aChoung, Sungwook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8849-71401 aHan, Weon Shik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7282-62531 aKim, Kue‐Young1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1202-88391 aSuk, Heejun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6353-00310 tWater resources research.g2021 Mar., v. 57, no. 3 p.e2020WR027655-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR0276553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01214naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245002000187300001800207520029300225592002800518650001100546650001100557650001500568650001200583650001100595650001100606650003400617700001800651773009400669856008100763990002300844852000900867655001200876IND60094037320221118183354.0141104e20130909xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009403732DNAL7 a240289552pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2013.07.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaland, Kevin N.10aCultural memory  ap.

NMDA receptors are present in the human neurons and erythrocyte membranes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of memantine on human erythrocytes. With this purpose, the drug was developed to in vitro interact with human red cells and bilayers built-up of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE). The latter represent lipids respectively present in both outer and inner monolayers of the red cell membrane. Results obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that memantine changed the normal biconcave shape of red cells to cup-shaped stomatocytes. According to the bilayer-couple hypothesis the drug intercalated into the inner monolayer of the erythrocyte membrane. Experimental results obtained by X-ray diffraction on multibilayers of DMPC and DMPE, and by differential scanning calorimetry on multilamellar vesicles indicated that memantine preferentially interacted with DMPC in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, it can be concluded that in the low therapeutic plasma concentration of circa 1 μM memantine is located in NMDA receptor channel without affecting the erythrocyte shape. However, at higher concentrations, once the receptors became saturated excess of memantine molecules (20 μM) would interact with phosphoinositide lipids present in the inner monolayer of the erythrocyte membrane inducing the formation of stomatocytes. However, 40–50 μM memantine was required to interact with isolated phosphatidylcholine bilayers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantagonists 3acell membranes 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrugs 3aerythrocytes 3ahumans 3amolecular models 3aneurons 3aphosphatidylcholines 3areceptors 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aMemantine 0aHuman erythrocyte 0aCell membrane 0aPhospholipid bilayer 0aSEM 0aDSC 0aDMPC 0aDMPE1 aSuwalsky, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8289-978X1 aVillena Villegas, Fernando,1 aJemiola-Rzeminska, Malgorzata1 aStrzałka, Kazimierz,0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Jan. 29, v. 483 p.528-533dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.12.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245013400157300001400291520109200305592002801397650000801425650001801433650002601451650001501477650002301492650001201515650001501527650002001542650002501562650001601587650001601603650001301619650001101632651001901643700001901662700001701681700001901698773014001717856007201857852000901929655001201938IND60661846320221119100355.0190904e20030127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066184632DNAL7 a10.1039/b207255f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopkins, J.

Site evaluation and correlations between species  ap. 14-20.  aAmbient concentrations of C₆–C₈ aromatic hydrocarbons and n-heptane, determined by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection, are presented from a winter campaign during January 1999 at a rural site near Leeds. Absolute concentrations are significantly lower than those obtained from the only designated UK rural site (Harwell) in the automated UK hydrocarbon network. Both absolute and relative concentrations of hydrocarbons measured at the site have been interpreted in terms of the arriving back-trajectories. The site is subject to two main airflows during the winter months; relatively polluted air from the southwest and much cleaner air from the northwest. Ratios of hydrocarbon concentrations show evidence of significant chemical processing consistent with chemical removal by OH. Uncertainties in the ages of the trajectories prevent a reliable estimation of the average OH concentration over the trajectory. The dependence of the variance of the hydrocarbon concentrations with their lifetime with respect to removal by OH does not show the expected behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3aautomation 3agas chromatography 3aheptane 3aionization 3aland evaluation 3aprocessing chemistry 3arural areas 3auncertainty 3avariance 3awinter 3aUnited Kingdom1 aBarnett, C.

Monitoring weeds at a regional scale and relating their occurrence with abiotic factors will assist in the control of these species. Purple nutsedge, field bindweed, bermudagrass, and johnsongrass were studied in cotton crops for three consecutive growing seasons (2007 through 2009) in a large area of central Greece. Weed densities and uniformities per sampling site were assessed in relation to soil and climatic data. Abundance index (AI), which is highly dependent on abiotic factors, was also estimated, and revealed purple nutsedge to the most persistent and damaging species among the recorded weeds. Field bindweed showed the highest correlation with soil properties and especially with clay content. Furthermore, correlation analysis was used over the sampling years in order to assess the stability of weed occurrence in the sampling sites. Purple nutsedge, field bindweed, and bermudagrass proved to be stable in location and intensity. The weed density spatial distribution was evaluated by using local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) statistics, and was mapped by ordinary kriging and co-kriging interpolation methods. Only 1 to 3 spatial outliers were identified in each 1 of the 3 yr. Between the two interpolation methods co-kriging delivered better results for field bindweed and purple nutsedge, indicating that soil data could improve the estimation of weed occurrence. These co-kriging interpolated weed maps would be a very useful tool for decision makers in taking appropriate weed control measures.Nomenclature: Purple nutsedge, Cyperus rotundus L.

An effective vaccine should be able to prevent both, the horizontal and vertical transmission of N. caninum. In this study, the immune vaccinal response of the recombinant protein rNcSRS2 of N. caninum expressed in Pichia pastoris and formulated with water-in-oil emulsion, xanthan gum, and alum hydroxide was assessed in an experimental murine model. Groups of 10 Balb/c mice were subcutaneously inoculated with two doses of prNcSRS2 twenty-one days apart. After the second immunization, four mice from each group were euthanized, and splenocytes were stimulated ex vivo with recombinant protein. The IgG dynamics were evaluated by indirect ELISA, and the splenocytes cytokines transcription by qPCR. All groups elicited specific antibodies against prNcSRS2, with the water-in-oil group showing significantly (p ≤ .05) elevated titers compared to the other groups. The prNcSRS2 protein alone did not induce a significant ex vivo splenic transcription level of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 cytokines, except for IL-17A, and the adjuvant associations with the prNcSRS2 protein induced different cytokine transcription profiles. The water-in-oil emulsion modulated the expression of TNF-α; the xanthan gum modulated IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12; and alum hydroxide modulated IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12. In conclusion, it was found that the association of the recombinant prNcSRS2 protein with different adjuvants induced different levels of specific antibody, and a distinct splenic cytokine profile in an adjuvant-dependent manner.

A previous study has reported that BRG1, a component of the SWI/SNF complex, is a coactivator for AHR and is recruited to the promoter region of the CYP1A1 gene in mouse hepatocytes. Recent data suggest that AHR is also expressed in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19), which play a crucial role in retinal physiology and the visual cycle. Multiple studies have shown that the AHR plays an important role in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration. However, the mechanism of AHR transcriptional activation in retinal pigment cells has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that the AHR signaling pathway is active in ARPE-19 cells, as in hepatocytes, but with different target gene specificity. We also found that chromatin remodeling by the BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complex is required for the AHR-mediated expression of target genes in ARPE-19 cells. We identified a novel enhancer region (−12 kb) of the CYP1A1 gene in ARPE-19 cells, to which both AHR and BRG1 are recruited in a ligand-dependent manner. BRG1 is associated with the AHR in ARPE-19 cells, and the C-terminal activation domain of the AHR directly interacts with BRG1. Furthermore, depletion of BRG1 caused a reduction in chromatin accessibility at the CYP1A1 enhancer. These results suggest that ARPE-19 cells possess an AHR-mediated transcription pathway with different target gene specificity, and that BRG1 is required for AHR-mediated transcription in ARPE-19 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromatin 3aepithelial cells 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3amacular degeneration 3ametabolism 3amice 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3apleiotropy 3apromoter regions 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 0aAryl hydrocarbon receptor 0aARPE-19 0aBRG1 0aAMD1 aJeong, Kwang Won0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 472 p.366-372dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001800189245009000207300001400297506007600311520105300387592002801440506003701468650002001505650002101525650001601546650001301562650002301575650001801598650002401616650002501640650002401665650002401689650001101713650001801724650001501742650003001757650003001787650002501817653001401842653001301856653000901869653000801878653003601886653002501922653006301947653003302010700001902043700002002062700001902082700001902101700001702120700002002137700002402157700002102181700001702202700001702219773009902236856008202335852000902417655001202426IND60555177420221207073123.0180905e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055517742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.btre.2015.08.0042doi7 aPMC49807012pmcid7 a283525682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Nam Kyu10aHeterologous overexpression of sfCherry fluorescent protein in Nannochloropsis salina  ap. 10-15.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOleaginous microalgae of the Nannochloropsis genus are considered excellent candidates for biofuels and value-added products owing to their high biomass productivity and lipid content. Here, we report the first overexpression and detection of a heterologous sfCherry fluorescent protein in Nannochloropsis salina in order to develop a transformation toolbox for future genetic improvements. Particle bombardment was employed for transformation, and expression of Shble under the control of TUB and UEP promoters, cloned from N. salina, was used to confer resistance to Zeocin antibiotics, resulting in 5.9 and 4.7 transformants per 10⁸ cells, respectively. Stable integration of the markers into the genome was confirmed using a restriction enzyme site-directed amplification (RESDA) PCR. The expression of sfCherry fluorescent protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy. These results suggest new possibilities of efficient genetic engineering of Nannochloropsis for the production of biofuels and other biochemicals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNannochloropsis 3aWestern blotting 3aantibiotics 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3abiotechnology 3aconfocal microscopy 3afluorescent proteins 3agenetic engineering 3agenetic improvement 3agenome 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3avalue-added products 0aRESDA PCR 0aTAIL PCR 0aMARs 0aEPA 0aHeterologous protein expression 0aParticle bombardment 0aRestriction enzyme site-directed amplification (RESDA) PCR 0asfCherry fluorescent protein1 aChoi, Gang-Guk1 aKim, Eun-Kyung,1 aShin, Sung-Eun1 aJeon, Seungjib1 aPark, Min S.1 aChŏng, Ki-jun,1 aJeong, Byeong-ryool1 aChang, Yong Keun1 aYang, Ji-Won1 aLee, Bongsoo0 tBiotechnology reports.g2015 Dec., v. 8 p.10-15dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2015.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245005200164300001600216520124900232592002801481650002501509650002201534650002201556650002001578650000901598650002001607650002601627650001601653650002101669650001101690650001501701650001501716650002301731650001001754650001601764650002001780650001701800650001001817651001001827653002201837653002501859653001301884653001701897700001801914700002301932700001701955700002001972773010301992856008102095852000902176655001202185IND60130953720221122002046.0151127e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013095372DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-D-11-00124.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasin, Roberta10aModeling Weed Emergence in Italian Maize Fields  ap. 254-259.  aA hydrothermal time model was developed to simulate field emergence for three weed species in maize (common lambsquarters, johnsongrass, and velvetleaf). Models predicting weed emergence facilitate well-timed and efficient POST weed control strategies (e.g., chemical and mechanical control methods). The model, called AlertInf, was created by monitoring seedling emergence from 2002 to 2008 in field experiments at three sites located in the Veneto region in northeastern Italy. Hydrothermal time was calculated using threshold parameters of temperature and water potential for germination estimated in previous laboratory studies with seeds of populations collected in Veneto. AlertInf was validated with datasets from independent field experiments conducted in Veneto and in Tuscany (west central Italy). Model validation resulted in both sites in efficiency index values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99. AlertInf, based on parameters estimated in a single region, was able to predict the timing of emergence in several sites located at the two extremes of the Italian maize growing area.Nomenclature: common lambsquarters, Chenopodium album L.,CHEAL; johnsongrass, Sorghum halepense L.

A Brayton cycle is configured so that its output stream conveys to the pre-combustion chamber reacting with biogas generated by the biomass digester. This integration exhibits an opportunity to combine a Kalina cycle, a multi-effect desalination, and a heating unit with the top system. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization is employed to obtain the optimal working conditions of the system in different optimization scenarios. The investigation results reveal that the compressor inlet pressure variation mainly impacts the metric performance indicator. For the mass flow rate of 15 gr/s of methane at the base condition, the biomass flow rate is obtained 13.23 kg/s, and the exergetic efficiency is evaluated to be 42.53%. Also, at the optimum operation mode of the first scenario, the exergetic efficiency and heating output are obtained at 45.51% and 531.41 kW, respectively. Moreover, the second scenario that employs exergetic efficiency and levelized total emission as objectives leads to values of 45.69% and 69.17 ton/kW for the objectives, respectively. Besides, the first scenario possesses the highest profitability with a payback period of 5.05 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abiogas 3abiomass 3adesalination 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3amass flow 3amethane 3aprofitability 3athermodynamics 0aBiomass digestion unit 0aTri-generation system 0aMulti-effect desalination 0aLevelized total emission 0aMulti-objective optimization1 aHu, Guang1 aZeng, Zhi0 tEnergy.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 261 p.125222-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1252223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03213naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011000164300001600274520170000290592002801990650001302018650001702031650002502048650001102073650001002084650002002094650001502114650000902129650001602138650001402154650002402168650001202192650001202204650001502216650003002231650001502261650001702276650000902293650001102302650001302313650001502326650001402341650001702355650001302372650001302385651001002398700001802408700002002426773012502446856007902571852000902650655001202659IND60439536320221117224900.0151024e200110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043953632DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10175459322192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMañosa, Santi12aA Review of the Effects of Agricultural and Industrial Contamination on the Ebro Delta Biota and Wildlife  ap. 187-205.  aThe Ebro delta (NE Spain) is a 320 km² wetland area ofinternational importance for conservation. The area is devotedto rice farming and receives large amounts of pesticides.Industrial pollutants are also carried to the delta by the river.The information accumulated during the last 25 year on the effectof such pollution on the biota is reviewed in order to identifythe existing gaps and needs for management. Organochlorinepesticides were legally used until 1977, which has resulted inthe widespread presence of these compounds in the Ebro deltabiota. Lethal, sublethal or other detrimental effects of thesepesticides on wildlife in the area were poorly investigated, butnegative effects on the reproduction of ducks and herons werereported. Nowadays, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are themain responsible of organochlorine pollution in the area:concentrations in biota samples are higher than levels observedin nearby coastal areas, as a result of the significant PCBinputs by the river which, in 1990, were evaluated at 126 kgyr⁻¹. The massive use of herbicides is thought to havecontributed to the elimation of macrophyte vegetation in thelagoons during the eighties, which had strong consequences ondiving ducks and coot populations. Weed control is also relatedto the loss of biodiversity held by rice fields. The massive andinadequate use of organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides(involving more than 20 000 t yr⁻¹) has produced somewaterbird mortality events, and may have direct and indirecteffects on other non-target organisms. The accumulation in thesoil of lead pellets used in waterfowl shooting is estimated tokill some 16 300 waterbirds in the Ebro delta every year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArdeidae 3abiodiversity 3acarbamate pesticides 3acoasts 3aducks 3afarming systems 3aherbicides 3alead 3amacrophytes 3amortality 3anontarget organisms 3apaddies 3apellets 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apopulation 3areproduction 3arice 3arivers 3asampling 3avegetation 3awaterfowl 3aweed control 3awetlands 3awildlife 3aSpain1 aMateo, Rafael1 aGuitart, Raimon0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2001 Oct., v. 71, no. 2 p.187-205dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:10175459322193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008800166300001800254520157700272592002801849650001501877650002301892650002501915650001701940650001801957650001101975650001501986650001602001650001602017700002202033773010502055856008102160990002302241852000902264655001202273IND60093378120221121053513.0141103e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009337812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2011.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDugas, Ross E.10aModeling CO₂ absorption into concentrated aqueous monoethanolamine and piperazine  ap. 5212-5218.  aDugas and Rochelle (2011) measured CO₂ mass transfer rates in 7–13 molal aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) and 2–12 molal piperazine (PZ) from 40 to 100°C over a large range of CO₂ loading. They observed that the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient (k′g) was almost independent of amine concentration and temperature. In this paper models are created to explain this behavior. CO₂ reaction rates in MEA and PZ are represented with termolecular (base catalysis) kinetics with activity-based rate expressions. Solving the activity-based rate expressions with a shell balance and implementing diffusion resistance using film theory yielded an expression for the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient, k′g. Parameters in the k′g expression were estimated from existing literature data. Two pre-exponential rate constants (kMEA and kPZ) are the only parameters that were adjusted to match experimental data. Estimates from independent sources of parameters in the model for k′g fully account for the observed effects of CO₂ loading, temperature, and amine concentration. The k′g expressions match the 93 wetted wall column experimental rates measured by Dugas and Rochelle (2011) with average deviations of 13% for MEA and 19% for PZ. The mass transfer expressions also match experimental data obtained by other researchers. This model shows that complex rate behavior in MEA and PZ systems can be fully explained using existing literature data. It also shows that the MEA and PZ systems can be represented by termolecular kinetics on an activity basis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acatalytic activity 3achemical engineering 3aethanolamine 3amass transfer 3amodels 3apiperazine 3aresearchers 3atemperature1 aRochelle, Gary T.0 tChemical engineering science.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 66, no. 21 p.5212-5218dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.07.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03075naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013400187300001600321520145900337592002801796650001701824650000901841650002501850650001901875650001601894650001401910650001001924650001101934650001701945650001801962650001401980650002401994650001902018650003202037650001202069650001002081650001102091653002002102653001702122653003702139653002102176700002202197700001902219700002402238700002502262700002602287773012902313856008202442852000902524655001202533IND60516376520221121201358.0190727e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051637652DNAL7 a241247302pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299130004592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoutoial, Khalid10aEffect of feeding goats with distilled and non-distilled thyme leaves (Thymus zygis subp. gracilis) on milk and cheese properties  ap. 448-456.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of feeding goats with distilled and non-distilled thyme leaves (Thymus zygis subsp. gracilis) on the physicochemical composition and technological properties of pasteurised goat milk, and on the physicochemical composition, phenolic content, oxidative stability, microbiology, sensory and texture profile of Murcia al Vino goat cheese. One group of goats was fed the basal diet (control), the second and third groups were fed with different levels of distilled (10 and 20%) or non-distilled (3·75 and 7·5%) thyme leaves. Goat milk physicochemical composition was significantly affected by the substitution of 7·5% of basal goat diet with non-distilled thyme leaves (increase in fat, protein, dry matter and PUFA content), while goat milk clotting time was increased significantly by the introduction of 20% distilled thyme leaves, which reduces its technological suitability. Microbiology, sensory and texture profiles were not affected by the introduction of distilled thyme leaves. The introduction of distilled and non-distilled thyme leaves as an alternative feed to diet can lead to an inhibition of lipids oxidation. The introduction of distilled and non-distilled thyme leaves into goat's diet can be successfully adopted as a strategy to reduce feeding costs and to take advantage of the waste from the production of essential oils, minimising waste removing costs and the environmental impact.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThymus zygis 3adiet 3aenvironmental impact 3aessential oils 3agoat cheese 3agoat milk 3agoats 3aleaves 3amicrobiology 3amilk clotting 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apasteurization 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3atexture 3athyme 3awastes 0aSupplementation 0athyme leaves 0apasteurised goat milk and cheese 0asensory analysis1 aGarcía, Víctor,1 aRovira, Silvia1 aFerrandini, Eduardo1 aAbdelkhalek, Oussama1 aLópez, María Belén0 tJournal of dairy research.g2013 Nov., v. 80, no. 4 p.448-456dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299130004593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014400182300001600326520172300342592002802065650001702093650001202110650001602122650001902138650001302157650001402170650002002184650003002204650002802234650000902262650003502271650002302306650001602329650003702345650002202382650002102404650003102425650003002456650001302486650002102499650003802520650005202558650002302610650002702633700001302660700001702673700001802690700001502708773010802723856004802831852000902879655001202888IND4477966220221122194117.0120727e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447796622DNAL7 a221135912pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-011-1758-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirasawa, S.10aDelimitation of a QTL region controlling cold tolerance at booting stage of a cultivar, ‘Lijiangxintuanheigu’, in rice, Oryza sativa L.  ap. 937-946.  aLow temperature at the booting stage of rice causes male sterility resulting in severe yield loss. Cold tolerance has long been an important objective in rice breeding. We identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for cold tolerance on the long arm of chromosome 3 from the cold-tolerant breeding line ‘Ukei 840’ by using F2 and BC1F2 populations from crosses between ‘Ukei 840’ and ‘Hitomebore’. The cold tolerance of ‘Ukei 840’ is derived from the Chinese cultivar ‘Lijiangxintuanheigu’. The effect of this QTL on cold tolerance was confirmed by developing ‘Hitomebore’ chromosome segment substitution lines having ‘Lijiangxintuanheigu’ alleles on chromosome 3. By producing recombinants in chromosome 3, the QTL region for cold tolerance was delimited to the region of about 1.2-Mb region between RM3719 and RM7000. All lines heterozygous for the QTL showed seed fertilities as low as that of ‘Hitomebore’, suggesting that the ‘Lijiangxintuanheigu’ allele for cold tolerance in the QTL region is recessive. Determination of a 1.2-Mb nucleotide sequence of ‘Ukei 840’ and comparison with the published genomic sequence of ‘Nipponbare’ showed 254 SNPs, of which 11 were in coding regions of genes, seven in five genes being non-synonymous. SNPs were detected in the 5-kb upstream regions of 89 genes, but no differences of gene expression levels were detected between alleles of these genes. Although further delimitation is required to identify the gene responsible for cold tolerance of ‘Lijiangxintuanheigu’, SNP markers developed here will be useful for marker-assisted selection in a breeding program using ‘Lijiangxintuanheigu’ as a donor of cold tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3achromosomes 3acold tolerance 3acrossing 3acultivars 3agene expression 3amarker-assisted selection 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asubstitution lines 3atemperature 2aAdaptation, Biologicalxgenetics 2aBreedingxmethods 2aCold Temperature 2aGenes, Recessivexgenetics 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aEndo, T.1 aNakagomi, K.1 aYamaguchi, M.1 aNishio, T.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2012 Mar., v. 124, no. 5 p.937-946dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-011-1758-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245014300201300001800344500001900362500002000381520139700401592002801798596013501826596004101961650000802002650003002010650001602040650002702056650001902083650001102102650001402113650001902127650001702146650002502163700006602188700006002254700006102314773013002375856007302505852000902578655001202587IND60704219720221119132149.0200722e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070421972DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.138072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathare, Varsha S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6220-753110aC4 grasses adapted to low precipitation habitats show traits related to greater mesophyll conductance and lower leaf hydraulic conductance  ap. 1897-1910.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn habitats with low water availability, a fundamental challenge for plants will be to maximize photosynthetic C‐gain while minimizing transpirational water‐loss. This trade‐off between C‐gain and water‐loss can in part be achieved through the coordination of leaf‐level photosynthetic and hydraulic traits. To test the relationship of photosynthetic C‐gain and transpirational water‐loss, we grew, under common growth conditions, 18 C₄ grasses adapted to habitats with different mean annual precipitation (MAP) and measured leaf‐level structural and anatomical traits associated with mesophyll conductance (gₘ) and leaf hydraulic conductance (Kₗₑₐf). The C₄ grasses adapted to lower MAP showed greater mesophyll surface area exposed to intercellular air spaces (Sₘₑₛ) and adaxial stomatal density (SDₐdₐ) which supported greater gₘ. These grasses also showed greater leaf thickness and vein‐to‐epidermis distance, which may lead to lower Kₗₑₐf. Additionally, grasses with greater gₘ and lower Kₗₑₐf also showed greater photosynthetic rates (Aₙₑₜ) and leaf‐level water‐use efficiency (WUE). In summary, we identify a suite of leaf‐level traits that appear important for adaptation of C₄ grasses to habitats with low MAP and may be useful to identify C₄ species showing greater Aₙₑₜ and WUE in drier conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aDE‐SC0001685cDivision of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Department of Energy  a0923562cNational Science Foundation 3aair 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aenvironment 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aleaf thickness 3aleaves 3amesophyll 3aphotosynthesis 3asurface area 3awater use efficiency1 aSonawane, Balasaheb V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6539-51791 aKoteyeva, Nouria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7507-45601 aCousins, Asaph B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2424-714X0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2020 Aug., v. 43, no. 8 p.1897-1910dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.138073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245014700166300001600313520150900329592002801838650002701866650000801893650001501901650001501916650002101931650002501952650001501977650002801992650002902020650002802049650001502077650002002092650001002112650002202122650001602144650001202160650001502172650002402187650001602211650004002227650001402267650001702281650001202298650001302310650000902323650002502332650002902357650002502386700001802411700002102429700002202450700003402472700002402506700002102530773010402551856007802655852000902733655001202742IND60519169220221119183038.0160420e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051916922DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2015008192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtbauer, Martina10aFolate deficiency and over‐supplementation causes impaired folate metabolism: Regulation and adaptation mechanisms in Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 949-956.  aSCOPE: Impaired folate metabolism increases the risk of birth defects, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and cancer. We used Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate impaired folate metabolism by RNA interference of key enzymes in the methionine synthase (MS) and thymidylate synthase (TS) cycle and by folate deficiency and over‐supplementation feeding studies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Folate status is influenced by genetic variations (polymorphisms), folate deficiency and supplementation. Single RNAi of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and MS revealed that gene regulation is largely affected in both folate cycles. Adaptation requires a close transcriptional connection between TS and MS cycle. Coupled DHFR and MS expression is required to balance both cycles, but seems to reduce the overall rate of folate conversion. Feeding studies showed that folate over‐supplementation to functioning metabolism inactivates MS and MTHFR expression and enhances TS activity, which favors DNA synthesis over methylation reactions. Folate deficiency disrupted homeostasis by favoring TS cycle and led to malformation in C. elegans offspring. Embryos show aneuploidy and are nonviable lacking DNA repair during meiotic stage of diakinesis. CONCLUSION: Single gene silencing alters gene expression in both cycles and disrupts folate homeostasis. Folate over‐supplementation and deficiency favors TS over MS cycle and causes prophase DNA damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aRNA interference 3aabnormal development 3aaneuploidy 3acardiovascular diseases 3acongenital abnormalities 3adihydrofolate reductase 3afolic acid 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahomeostasis 3ameiosis 3ametabolism 3amethionine synthase 3amethylation 3amethylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 3aneoplasms 3aosteoporosis 3aprogeny 3aprophase 3arisk 3athymidylate synthase 3atranscription (genetics) 3avitamin B deficiency1 aRipper, Doris1 aFuhrmann, Thomas1 aLassi, Maximilian1 aAuernigg‐Haselmaier, Sandra1 aStiegler, Christina1 aKönig, Jürgen,0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2016 Apr., v. 60, no. 4 p.949-956dWiley-VCHx1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2015008193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04251naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015100168300001100319520232300330592002802653650001102681650001302692650002002705650002402725650002002749650003702769650001202806650001602818650001002834650001202844650001902856650001202875650002402887650002002911650001102931650002202942650001602964700002402980700002103004700002503025700002203050700002203072700002003094700002203114700002303136700001903159700002503178700001803203700001703221700002503238700002203263700002103285700002103306700006303327773014303390856008303533852000903616655001203625IND60720480420221119103746.0210731e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072048042DNAL7 a10.1186/s12970-020-00397-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamb, Donald A.14aThe effects of resistance training with or without peanut protein supplementation on skeletal muscle and strength adaptations in older individuals  ap. 66.  aSeveral studies suggest resistance training (RT) while supplementing with various protein supplements can enhance strength and muscle mass in older individuals.

Right leg vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies were obtained prior to and 24 h following the first training bout in all participants to assess the change in myofibrillar protein synthetic rates (MyoPS) as measured via the deuterium-oxide (D₂O) tracer method. Pre- and Post-intervention testing in all participants was conducted using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), VL ultrasound imaging, a peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) scan at the mid-thigh, and right leg isokinetic dynamometer assessments. Integrated MyoPS rates over a 24-h period were not significantly different (p < 0.05) between supplement groups following the first training bout. Regarding chronic changes, there were no significant supplement-by-time interactions in DXA-derived fat mass, lean soft tissue mass or percent body fat between supplementation groups. There was, however, a significant increase in VL thickness in PP versus CTL participants when the 6- and 10-week cohorts were pooled (interaction p = 0.041). There was also a significant increase in knee flexion torque in the 10-week PP group versus the CTL group (interaction p = 0.032). In conclusion, a higher-protein, defatted peanut powder supplement in combination with RT positively affects select markers of muscle hypertrophy and strength in an untrained, older adult population. Moreover, subanalyses indicated that gender did not play a role in these adaptations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3acomputed tomography 3adeuterium oxide 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afemales 3ahypertrophy 3amales 3amuscles 3apeanut protein 3apeanuts 3aprotein supplements 3askeletal muscle 3atorque 3atracer techniques 3aultrasonics1 aMoore, Johnathon H.1 aSmith, Morgan A.1 aVann, Christopher G.1 aOsburn, Shelby C.1 aRuple, Bradley A.1 aFox, Carlton D.1 aSmith, Kristen S.1 aAltonji, Olivia M.1 aPower, Zade M.1 aCerovsky, Annsley E.1 aRoss, C.

Mechanisms of shoreward transport in this region have long been a topic of interest, since many commercially important species spawn on the outer shelf, but utilize the adjacent Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds for nurseries, requiring some physical transport mechanism to move the eggs and larvae from the outer shelf to these nursery areas. One mechanism providing such shoreward transport is strong shoreward velocity along the cross-shelf oriented ‘nose’ of the Hatteras Front. The Frontal Interactions near Cape Hatteras (FINCH) project used shipboard ADCP and a towed undulating CTD to examine Hatteras Front property, density and velocity fields in August 2004, January 2005, and July 2005. Strong property gradients were encountered across the nose of the Hatteras Front in all cases, but the density gradient evolved in time, and along with it the dynamic height gradient driving the observed along-front cross-shelf velocities in the nose of the Front. In August and January FINCH data, MAB shelf waters on the north side of the Hatteras Front are less dense than SAB shelf waters, driving shoreward velocities along the Hatteras Front. By July, MAB shelf waters are slightly more dense than SAB shelf waters, with areas of weak seaward and shoreward velocities within the Hatteras Front. As Part 1 of a pair of contributions, this article focuses on FINCH data to illustrate the range of density gradients encountered and resulting cross-shelf velocities. Whether these observations are typical of variability in the Hatteras Front is explored in a second article, Part 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontinental shelf 3aeggs 3alarvae 3asalinity 3atemperature profiles1 aAustin, Jay A.1 aBlanton, Brian O.0 tContinental shelf research.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 54 p.93-105dElsevier Ltdx0278-43437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2012.11.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245013700212300001800349506007600367520102100443592002801464506003701492650002501529650002701554650001601581650001201597650001701609650002501626650001801651650001601669650001501685650001301700650001401713650001401727700002501741700002901766700001901795700003201814700002401846700003101870773013301901856008202034852000902116655001202125IND60675316020221207141212.0191105e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067531602DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-03985-22doi7 aPMC68288752pmcid7 a317415372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchittler, Liziane10aIsolation of Enterococcus faecium, characterization of its antimicrobial metabolites and viability in probiotic Minas Frescal cheese  ap. 5128-5137.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe aim of this study was to isolate Enterococcus faecium from raw milk samples, to characterize its antimicrobial metabolites, and to evaluate its viability in a probiotic Minas Frescal cheese. For this, antagonist activity against Listeria monocytogenes, safety aspects and biochemical, genotypic, and probiotic characteristics of the isolates were evaluated. Minas Frescal cheese was manufactured with the isolate that showed the best characteristics in vitro, and its viability in the product was evaluated. It was observed that of the 478 lactic acid bacteria isolates, only isolate E297 presented antagonist activity, genes encoding for enterocin production and absence of virulence factors. Besides that, E297 presented probiotic characteristics in vitro, and maintained its viability (8.09 log CFU mL⁻¹) for 14 days of cold storage, when it was added to cheese. Therefore, isolate E297 can be considered a promising microorganism for the manufacture of probiotic foods, especially Minas Frescal cheese.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantagonists 3acheeses 3acold storage 3alactic acid bacteria 3amanufacturing 3ametabolites 3aprobiotics 3araw milk 3aviability 3avirulence1 aPerin, Luana Martins1 ade Lima Marques, Juliana1 aLando, Vanessa1 aTodorov, Svetoslav Dimitrov1 aNero, Luis Augusto,1 ada Silva, Wladimir Padilha0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2019 Nov., v. 56, no. 11 p.5128-5137dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-03985-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245015800165300001800323500001900341520156000360592002801920650001601948650001101964650001901975650001501994650002102009650002902030650001702059700002302076700002202099700002402121700002102145700002602166773012902192856007402321852000902395655001202404IND60722253720221118104352.0201230e20201223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072225372DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay01643h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoud, D.

The nucleophilic substitution reaction of cyanide with S-phenyl benzenethiosulfonate results in the formation of phenyl thiocyanate as a cyanide derivative and it was found that the relative response of the resultant cyanide derivative was much higher than that of the cyanide derivatives resulting from disulfide based derivatizing agents. The sample preparation protocol for the identification of cyanide in aqueous samples was also optimized with the new derivatizing agent. Derivatization followed by liquid–liquid extraction was employed for the preparation of aqueous samples containing cyanide salts. The resultant samples were subjected to GC-MS analysis for the identification of the cyanide derivative. Under optimized conditions, the detection and quantification limits for cyanide aqueous samples were found to be 0.075 μg mL⁻¹ and 0.25 μg mL⁻¹ respectively. The calibration curve had a linear relationship with y = 0.086x − 0.076 and r² = 0.997 for the working range of 0.25 μg mL⁻¹ to 50 μg mL⁻¹. The intraday RSDs were between 2.24 and 8.17%, and the interday RSDs were between 2.22 and 12.85%. The method can also be successfully employed for the identification of hydrogen cyanide in aqueous medium. The applicability of the present method was demonstrated by analysing a real sample from apple seed extraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aapples 3aderivatization 3adisulfides 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3athiocyanates1 aSinha Roy, Kanchan1 aPardasani, Deepak1 aPurohit, Ajay Kumar1 aTak, Vijay Kumar1 aDubey, Devendra Kumar0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 Dec. 23, v. 12, no. 48 p.5839-5845dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01643h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245009900169300001600268520101000284592002801294650002201322650001901344650001701363650002601380650002001406650001501426650002401441650002201465650002001487651001001507651001501517653001901532653002201551653001501573653001501588653002401603700001801627700001901645700001401664700001701678700001701695700001401712700005801726773010601784856008801890852000901978655001201987IND60629719820221122024204.0190326e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062971982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.01.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Mingzhu10aBuoyancy potential of dominant green macroalgal species in the Yellow Sea's green tides, China  ap. 301-307.  aLarge-scale green tides caused by Ulva prolifera, occurred for 12 consecutive years in the Yellow Sea of China. To resolve the abrupt shift in species composition between attached and floating macroalgal assemblages, field experiments were conducted from May to July 2017 to quantify the net buoyancy force and compare the floating potential of the common green macroalgae from the red algal seaweed Pyropia yezoensis rafts. At the same time, U. prolifera from different sampling locations were tested to study variable buoyancy of this species and the associated influencing factors. Our results illustrated a stronger positive buoyant force and a proportionally greater buoyancy capacity of U. prolifera, compared to the other co-occurring species. Buoyancy is a dynamic trait and is closely correlated with light intensity, morphology and physiological status. The positive buoyancy of U. prolifera is an important factor that helps explain its predominance in the Yellow Sea's large-scale green tides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyropia yezoensis 3aUlva prolifera 3aalgal blooms 3afield experimentation 3alight intensity 3amacroalgae 3aphysiological state 3aspecies diversity 3awater pollution 3aChina 3aYellow Sea 0aUlva prolifera 0aBuoyancy capacity 0aGreen tide 0aYellow Sea 0aInfluencing factors1 aFan, Shiliang1 aWang, Zongling1 aSong, Wei1 aSun, Kaiming1 aHan, Hongbin1 aXiao, Jie1 aShen, Songdong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5731-16810 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Mar., v. 140 p.301-307dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.01.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013800155300002000293520166800313592002801981650001602009650002102025650001502046650001502061650001502076650001202091650000902103650001002112650001702122650001602139650003002155650001202185650001502197650001002212650001602222650001702238650001502255650002102270650000902291650001802300650002202318650002802340650001702368650001702385700001702402700001702419700001502436700001402451700002002465700001602485700002002501700002002521773012402541856007402665852000902739655001202748IND60669040520221120194219.0190920e20150731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066904052DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra10626e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Manna10aDynamic metabonomic and microbiological response of rats to lincomycin exposure: an integrated microbiology and metabonomics analysis  ap. 65415-65426.  aHumans are associated with a consortium of gut microbiome and individual variations in the microbes influence host metabolism. To probe the relationship between microbiome and the host metabolic changes, we analyzed the metabonomic and microbiological response of rats exposed to lincomycin (LM) by an integrated approach combining 16S rRNA gene sequencing and ¹H NMR-based metabolomics profiling. LM exposure resulted in decreased levels of hippurate, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and primary bile acids and increased levels of choline and oligosaccharides. Levels of Barnesiella and Prevotella decreased sharply, whereas level of Clostridium cluster XIVa increased slightly. In addition, strong correlations were observed between metabolites and the levels of Barnesiella, Prevotella and Escherichia coli. Meanwhile, some metabolites, such as N-methylnicotinate and trigonelline, showed association with osmotic homeostasis and nucleic acid synthesis. These results suggest that LM exposure lead to significantly suppressed fermentation, gut microbial modification of bile acids and influenced liver and kidney homeostasis. This applicable method reveals the effects regarding metabonomic and microbiological responses of LM, and the combination of microbiology and metabonomics as a powerful approach offers a non-invasive means to elucidate the progression of drugs and diet. The correlation between the host and gut microbiota identifies potential biomarkers and provides substantial insight into the bacterial function, which in turn could provide a rationale for development of potential microbiota-based early prevention and therapeutic interventions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aEscherichia coli 3aPrevotella 3abile acids 3abiomarkers 3acholine 3adiet 3adrugs 3afermentation 3ahomeostasis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3akidneys 3alincomycin 3aliver 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amicrobiome 3aoligosaccharides 3arats 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3ashort chain fatty acids 3atherapeutics 3atrigonelline1 aXie, Zhiyong1 aZhou, Yuting1 aLi, Yemeng1 aRen, Jian1 aPeng, Xuan-xian1 aYao, Meicun1 aYang, Zhongzhou1 aLiao, Qiongfeng0 tRSC advances.g2015 July 31, v. 5, no. 80 p.65415-65426dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra10626e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245006600164520170700230592002801937650001801965650002901983650002302012650001602035650001102051650001502062650001802077650001102095650002402106650001602130650002602146650001502172650001602187650000902203650001902212650001402231650002102245650002902266650002902295650002002324650001502344700002002359700002002379700002302399773011902422856007802541852000902619655001202628IND60703662420221120101447.0200721e20200103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070366242DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90100672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVecchi, Valeria 10aPotential and Challenges of Improving Photosynthesis in Algae  aSunlight energy largely exceeds the energy required by anthropic activities, and therefore its exploitation represents a major target in the field of renewable energies. The interest in the mass cultivation of green microalgae has grown in the last decades, as algal biomass could be employed to cover a significant portion of global energy demand. Advantages of microalgal vs. plant biomass production include higher light-use efficiency, efficient carbon capture and the valorization of marginal lands and wastewaters. Realization of this potential requires a decrease of the current production costs, which can be obtained by increasing the productivity of the most common industrial strains, by the identification of factors limiting biomass yield, and by removing bottlenecks, namely through domestication strategies aimed to fill the gap between the theoretical and real productivity of algal cultures. In particular, the light-to-biomass conversion efficiency represents one of the major constraints for achieving a significant improvement of algal cell lines. This review outlines the molecular events of photosynthesis, which regulate the conversion of light into biomass, and discusses how these can be targeted to enhance productivity through mutagenesis, strain selection or genetic engineering. This review highlights the most recent results in the manipulation of the fundamental mechanisms of algal photosynthesis, which revealed that a significant yield enhancement is feasible. Moreover, metabolic engineering of microalgae, focused upon the development of renewable fuel biorefineries, has also drawn attention and resulted in efforts for enhancing productivity of oil or isoprenoids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae culture 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass production 3abiorefining 3acarbon 3acell lines 3adomestication 3aenergy 3agenetic engineering 3aisoprenoids 3ametabolic engineering 3amicroalgae 3amutagenesis 3aoils 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytomass 3aproduction costs 3aradiation use efficiency 3arenewable energy sources 3asolar radiation 3awastewater1 aBarera, Simone 1 aBassi, Roberto 1 aDall’Osto, Luca 0 tPlants.g2020 Jan. 03, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90100673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04223naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002300167245009400190300001800284500002000302500001500322520297300337592002803310650002403338650002303362650002303385650001603408650002203424650002503446650001203471653002203483700002203505700002103527700002303548700001703571773013203588852000903720856010803729655001203837IND2206653520221122200353.0180321e200008  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220665352DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1230:AIUHFI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolger, Douglas T.10aArthropods in urban habitat fragments in southern california: area, age, and edge effects  ap. 1230-1248.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aThe distribution of non‐ant arthropods was examined in 40 urban habitat fragments in coastal San Diego County, California, USA, to look for effects of fragmentation, proximity to developed edge, and the non‐native Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Arthropods were sampled with pitfall traps and by vacuum sampling from California buckwheat shrubs (Eriogonum fasciculatum). Individual arthropods were identified to order and Recognizable Taxonomic Unit (RTU), or morphospecies. At the fragment scale we looked for correlations in the point diversity and abundance of arthropods as a function of the age and area of the fragment being sampled. At the scale of the individual sample points we looked for correlations of abundance and diversity with variables that describe the species composition of the shrub vegetation and disturbance. As indicators of disturbance we used the cover of native woody and exotic non‐woody vegetation, the distance to the nearest developed edge, and the abundance of Argentine ants. The following patterns were found: (1) In general, arthropods showed a fragmentation effect with point diversity and abundance positively correlated with fragment area and negatively correlated with fragment age. (2) The pitfall samples were dominated by three primarily non‐native orders, Isopoda (pillbugs), Dermaptera (earwigs), and Blattaria (roaches). Over 35% of all pitfall‐captured arthropods belonged to four species in these orders. Dermaptera and Blattaria increased in abundance in smaller and older fragments, respectively. Isopod abundance, in contrast, was unrelated to fragment attributes. None of these groups appeared to be associated with edges, but were distributed throughout the fragments. (3) Point diversity and abundance in ground‐active spiders appears to be enhanced by fragmentation. (4) Total pitfall RTU richness and abundance, and abundance or richness in the Coleoptera (vacuum), Diptera, non‐ant Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Microcoryphia, and Acarina had significant partial negative correlations with Argentine ant abundance. The Diptera and Coleoptera had this negative partial relationship with the Argentine ants despite the fact that both they and the ants were positively associated with edges. (5) In general, diversity in most orders was higher in sampling locations dominated by coastal sage scrub habitat than in those with appreciable cover of chaparral shrub species. (6) There was a strong seasonal variation in abundance and diversity in most orders. Diversity and abundance were highest in spring, intermediate in winter, and lowest in the fall. (7) Although higher trophic levels are often considered to be more sensitive to fragmentation, two groups of arthropod predators, spiders and carabid beetles, increased in abundance in older fragments. Abundance of these predators was positively correlated with the abundance of Argentine ants and the non‐native Isopods, Dermaptera, and Blattaria.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitat destruction 3aLinepithema humile 3aintroduced species 3aurban areas 3aspecies diversity 3aenvironmental impact 3ainsects 0acommunity ecology1 aSuarez, Andrew V.1 aCrooks, Kevin R.1 aMorrison, Scott A.1 aCase, Ted J.0 tEcological applications.g2000 Aug., v. 10, no. 4 p.1230-1248dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010%5B1230:AIUHFI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02764naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009500158520185600253592002802109653002602137653001302163653002302176653002202199653002502221653001902246700001402265773011202279856007402391852000902465655001202474IND60655775320221117180837.0190805s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065577532DNAL7 a10.1017/jan.2015.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeski, S.S.M.10aEffect of a processed soy protein product on growth and gut physiology of broiler chickens  aA 4 × 2 factorial experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of a processed soy protein (PSP) on broiler performance and digestive physiology. Four inclusion levels of PSP (0, 25, 50 or 100 g/kg in either corn or wheat-based diets) were used in the starter diets. Feed intake was significantly lower (P < 0.01) on corn-based diets than those on wheat-based diets at 35 d. Over the first 10 d, chicks on corn-based diets tended (P < 0.09) to have higher body weight (BW) than wheat-based diet chicks. Across the 35 d trial, PSP level showed a strong tendency (P < 0.06) to be related to higher BW in birds, regardless of grain type. Both grain and PSP experimental factors significantly (P < 0.01, and P < 0.001) interacted at an early age, improving BW and feed conversion ratio (FCR) for birds received high PSP on wheat-based diets. Significantly heavier (P < 0.01) small intestine and gizzard + proventriculas weights at an early age, and heavier (P < 0.001) gizzard + proventriculas and pancreas during the grower stage were recorded in birds fed the corn-based diets. At 24 d, pancreatic chymotrypsin amidase and lipase enzymes were significantly (P < 0.01) more active in chickens fed the wheat-based diet. The interaction of PSP level and the type of the grain was significant (P < 0.01) for pancreatic chymotrypsin amidase and lipase as well as jejunal maltase (P < 0.05). Both experimental factors had a significant influence on jejunum histomorphology at 24 d of age (P < 0.001). There was a significant interaction between level of PSP and the type of grain (P < 0.05) resulting in the highest villus surface areas being seen for birds fed the corn-based diet and receiving the medium level of PSP. The trial demonstrated that PSP supplement can be included at between 50 and 100 g/kg of starter diets, depending on the basal diet.  aPublisher supplied data 0aProcessed soy protein 0abroilers 0agrowth performance 0adigestive enzymes 0aintestinal histology 0agut physiology1 aIji, P.A.0 tJournal of applied animal nutrition.g2015, v. 3dCambridge University PresswJournal:2269x2049-257X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jan.2015.53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245009800159300001800257520137100275592002801646650002201674650002501696650001301721650001901734650001101753650001101764650003301775650001201808650003701820650001101857700001401868700001801882700001401900773010901914856008102023852000902104655001202113IND60548235620221116173549.0160903e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054823562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-010-3036-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAi, Bin10aGrowth behavior of polycrystalline silicon thin films deposited by RTCVD on quartz substrates  ap. 2057-2062.  aPolycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin films were prepared on quartz substrates by rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system, and their structures were studied by XRD, SEM and TEM, respectively. XRD spectra exhibit a single strong (220) diffraction peak, which indicates that the poly-Si films are preferentially <110> oriented. Plane-view SEM images show that the surface of the poly-Si films is composed of large numbers of polygonal pyramid grains with different sizes, and cross-section SEM images further indicate that they are columnar grains with growth direction perpendicular to substrate surface. TEM observation results demonstrate that there are a lot of twin crystals including one-order, two-order and high-order (⩾3) twin crystals in the poly-Si films. The above experimental results can not be elucidated by the conventional opinion on growth behavior of poly-Si films prepared by atmosphere pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD), but can be explained by the Ino’s multiply twinned particles (MTPs) model found in the face centered cubic metal films. According to the above experimental results and Ino’s model, we tend to think that nucleation and grain growth of poly-Si films deposited by RTCVD on quartz substrates are based on the formation of MTPs, and then these MTPs form the continuous films in an island growth mode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatmospheric pressure 3acrystals 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aquartz 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicon 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors1 aLiu, Chao1 aLiang, XueQin1 aShen, Hui0 tChinese science bulletin.g2010 July, v. 55, no. 19 p.2057-2062dSP Science China Pressx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-010-3036-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245012400169300001600293520136700309592002801676650002101704650001301725650001401738650001401752650002701766650002201793650001901815650002101834650001501855650002901870650001901899650002201918650002001940650002001960650001801980651001001998651001302008653002002021653002302041653001902064653003702083653001802120653002502138653002502163653001302188700002502201700002202226700002302248700001802271700001502289773010002304856008002404852000902484655001202493IND60519906320221123002105.0160511e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051990632DNAL7 a10.1515/botcro-2016-00082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Giuseppina G.10aEpilithic diatom assemblages and environmental quality of the Su Gologone karst spring (centraleastern Sardinia, Italy)  ap. 129-143.  aKarst springs are considered among the most vulnerable groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Despite their ecological value and importance as strategic water sources, Mediterranean karst springs are still poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to analyse the epilithic diatom assemblages and to test their usefulness as indicators of environmental quality on the Su Gologone spring (central-eastern Sardinia, Italy), a biotope of great natural value and a precious source of drinking water. A total of 89 diatom taxa were found with 25 new records for Sardinian running waters. Species richness, Shannon-Wiener and Pielou indices showed good biotic integrity. The dominant taxa were alkaliphilous, halophobous-oligohalobous exigent, xeno- oligosaprobic and characteristic of oligotrophic waters. The eutrophication/pollution index − diatom based (EPI-D) and the Navicula Nitzschia Surirella indices indicated respectively an excellent/good biological water quality and a low physical disturbance. However, the biological and chemical oxygen demand, and the microbiological variables (E. coli, fecal and total coliforms) revealed an organic contamination of the water, although moderate. The judgment provided by the EPI-D should be verified after updating of the index. In fact, 10 taxa found in this study are not currently considered by the EPI-D method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aNavicula 3aNitzschia 3aSurirella 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoliform bacteria 3adrinking water 3aecological value 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3aeutrophication 3aspecies diversity 3asprings (water) 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3aItaly 3aSardinia 0aBacillariophyta 0abiological quality 0adiatom indices 0agroundwater-dependent ecosystems 0akarst springs 0aMediterranean region 0aphysical disturbance 0aSardinia1 aPadedda, Bachisio M.1 aWetzel, Carlos E.1 aLugliè, Antonella1 aSechi, Nicola1 aEctor, Luc0 tActa botanica Croatica.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 75, no. 1 p.129-143dDe Gruyter Openx0365-05887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/botcro-2016-00083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02346naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245016600155520131600321592002801637653002101665653000801686653001601694653000901710653000901719653001401728653001201742653001501754700001301769700001701782700001401799773011201813856007401925852000901999655001202008IND60655775420221117162339.0190805s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065577542DNAL7 a10.1017/jan.2015.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpring, P.12aA review of 733 published trials on Bio-Mos®, a mannan oligosaccharide, and Actigen®, a second generation mannose rich fraction, on farm and companion animals.  aMannan-oligosaccharides (MOS), as zootechnical feed ingredients, are widely used in animal nutrition. MOS has been commercially available since the launch of Bio-Mos® in the early 1990's and has a substantial body of scientific papers and practical examples of its efficacy. Since 1999, the use of MOS in animal feed has become more prominent, mainly due to the European ban on prophylactic antibiotic growth promoters in animal feed. MOS, with its ability to bind and limit the colonisation of gut pathogens, has proven to be an effective solution for antibiotic-free diets, as well as providing support for immunity and digestion. MOS has been shown to improve gastrointestinal health, thus improving wellbeing, energy levels and performance. Most MOS products, particularly those that have been scientifically developed, derive from the cell wall of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In 2009, a mannose-rich fraction (MRF) product was commercially launched as a ‘second generation’ of these MOS-type products, with enhanced activities in immune modulation and intestinal health. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing data on the benefits of MOS for all species of animals, discuss its mechanisms of action in vivo and compare the benefits of using second generation MRF to original MOS.  aPublisher supplied data 0aoligosaccharides 0agut 0aperformance 0apets 0afish 0alivestock 0apoultry 0aprebiotics1 aWenk, C.1 aConnolly, A.1 aKiers, A.0 tJournal of applied animal nutrition.g2015, v. 3dCambridge University PresswJournal:2269x2049-257X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jan.2015.63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03476naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245014800181300001600329520146600345536031301811592002802124596006802152596005502220596006402275650001502339650001702354650002102371650002902392650002502421650003002446650001002476650002602486650002802512653001502540653002102555653001602576700002102592700002202613700002702635700002902662700002402691700003202715773015202747856008602899852000902985655001202994IND60795021320221122150410.0220929e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079502132DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2021.19841082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVásquez-Ibarra, Leonardo12aA wide environmental analysis of beekeeping systems through life cycle assessment: key contributing activities and influence of operation scale  ap. 790-805.  aAgri-food has become an economic sector under increasing pressure in order to support food demand and decrease environmental impacts. One valuable methodology to evaluate environmental impacts is life cycle assessment (LCA), which has been employed in different economic sectors, however, beekeeping has been scarcely explored. In this context, this article investigates the environmental profile of 31 Chilean beekeeping systems reporting 15 environmental impact categories with a cradle to gate approach. In this way, this study identifies key contributing activities, variability in the environmental impacts, differences among operation scales, and provided efficient management practices for policy-makers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that conducts a wide environmental analysis of beekeeping systems through LCA. The results show that feeding is the most impacting activity in all categories, followed by hives transport. Otherwise, medication, consumption of disposable inputs and honey extraction contribute less than 5% in average across all categories. Regarding the operation scale, the results suggest that small-scale beekeepers have the lowest environmental performance. Otherwise, medium-scale beekeepers have better environmental performance than the large-scale ones, depending on the environmental impact category evaluated.

However, the generation of a huge volume of toxic colored effluent is a major environmental concern. Azo dyes are extensively used for textile dyeing and are thus found in the wastewater. In this article, bacterial bioremediation of azo dyes was studied. Acinetobacter baumannii strain VITVB, a gram-negative bacterium aerobically decolorized 500 mg L⁻¹ of two textile azo dyes Reactive Blue 221 (RB-221) and Reactive Black 5 (RB-5) with 90% and 87% efficiency after 48 h under static condition. Dye degradation was further maximized by optimization studies. A. baumanii VITVB exerted maximum dye degradation within 24 h under optimized conditions of pH 9, temperature at 45 °C, 5% NaCl concentration, and supplementation of 1% starch (Carbon source) and 1% peptone (Nitrogen source) in growth media. Dye Degradation was then analyzed. Fourier transform infrared spectra of pure and degraded dyes revealed that the potential bacterial strain targeted the characteristic chromophore group (N = N) during the break down of dyes. High-performance liquid chromatography of pure and degraded dyes presented the emergence of different peaks at altered retention times, which also indicates the degradation of dyes. Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry chromatogram revealed probable end products as diphenylmethane from RB-221 degradation and benzene,1,1'-Pentylidenebis from RB-5 degradation. Finally, phytotoxicity and biotoxicity assays implied the nontoxicity of the degraded metabolites of RB-221 and RB-5. Pure dyes inhibited seed germination, showed marked phenotypic changes and cellular damages in plants (Cicer arietinum and Tagetes erecta) while the degraded metabolites promoted a healthy seed germination rate and no marked cellular damages or phenotypic changes in plants. Artemia salina cysts also showed a similar pattern as major hatchability inhibition occurred with pure dyes compared to degraded dye metabolites.  aThis work was financially supported by the Council of scientific and industrial research (CSIR), Delhi (24/0332/14/EMR-II).

The objective of the present study is to find a more effective and safe biological control agent against T. pityocampa. Thus, we investigated the bacterial flora of the pest insect, collected from the Middle Black Sea Region of Turkey from 2003 to 2004. Based on morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular methods, 14 different bacterial isolates were determined. The identified bacterial flora of T. pityocampa consisted of bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae (Tp1), Arthrobacter sp. (Tp2), Staphylococcus spp. (Tp3 and 10), Bacillus subtilis (Tp4), Serratia liquefaciens (Tp5), Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni (Tp6 and 14), an acrystalliferous form Bacillus thuringiensis (Tp7), Staphylococcus cohnii (Tp8), Bacillus licheniformis (Tp9), Bacillus pumilus (Tp11), Brevibacterium sp. (Tp12) and Bacillus simplex (Tp13). After analysing the conclusions of conventional and molecular tests Tp1 (Enterobacteriaceae), Tp2 (Arthrobacter sp.) and Tp12 (Brevibacterium sp.) were assigned as novel bacterial species. Isolate Tp5 had a promising insecticidal effect on third instar larvae of T. pityocampa (up to 70% mortality within 10 days).  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrobacter 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus pumilus 3aBacillus simplex 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBacillus thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni 3aBrevibacterium 3aSerratia 3aStaphylococcus cohnii 3aThaumetopoea pityocampa 3abacteria 3abiological control agents 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3amortality 3aBlack Sea 3aMediterranean region1 aKatı, Hatice1 aYılmaz, Hüseyin,1 aDemir, ismail1 aDemirbağ, Zihni0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2008 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.3005-3015dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-008-9845-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016700159300001800326500001900344520153400363592002801897650001301925650003001938650002101968650002501989650002202014650002002036650001202056650003202068650001302100650001702113650001802130650001502148700002102163700002302184700002302207773012902230856007402359852000902433655001202442IND60722253920221118104329.0201230e20201223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072225392DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay01736a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMine, Masanori10aKinetic analysis of an enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate with carboxylesterase by pressure-assisted capillary electrophoresis/dynamic frontal analysis  ap. 5846-5851.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate with carboxylesterase was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis/dynamic frontal analysis (CE/DFA). A plateau signal was expected with the anionic product of p-nitrophenol by the CE/DFA applying in-capillary reaction and the continuous CE resolution of the product from the substrate zone. However, the plateau height was not sufficient, and/or the plateau signal fluctuated and drifted. Therefore, a pressure assist was utilized in the CE/DFA to detect the product zone fast and to average the fluctuated plateau signal by mixing in a laminar flow. The plateau signal became relatively flat and its height was developed by the pressure-assisted capillary electrophoresis/dynamic frontal analysis (pCE/DFA). The plateau height was used for the Michaelis–Menten analysis, and a Michaelis–Menten constant was determined as KM = 0.83 mmol L⁻¹. An enzyme inhibition was also examined with bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate by adding it in the separation buffer. The height of the plateau signal decreased by the inhibition, and a 50% inhibitory concentration was determined as IC₅₀ = 0.79 μmol L⁻¹. The values of KM and IC₅₀ obtained in this study agreed well with the reported values. Since the proposed pCE/DFA includes electrophoretic migration of the substrate zone in a capillary, it is also noticed that the deactivation of the enzyme by ethanol on the preparation of the substrate solution can be avoided, as well as the exclusion of the inhibition by the product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acarboxylesterase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme kinetics 3aethanol 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akinetics 3alaminar flow 3ap-nitrophenol 3aphosphates1 aMatsumoto, Naoya1 aMizuguchi, Hitoshi1 aTakayanagi, Toshio0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 Dec. 23, v. 12, no. 48 p.5846-5851dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01736a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012200154300001800276520144700294592002801741650001501769650001101784650001301795650001101808650001401819650002301833650001401856650002101870650001601891650001501907650002001922650001801942650001501960650000901975650001901984650001402003650001402017650001202031650001802043650001702061650001702078700001202095700002502107700001102132700002002143700001602163773012502179856007402304852000902378655001202387IND60662738920221123015123.0190906e20140224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066273892DNAL7 a10.1039/c3gc42254b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Yang10aIntegrated electrocatalytic processing of levulinic acid and formic acid to produce biofuel intermediate valeric acid  ap. 1305-1315.  aHerein, we report integrated electrocatalytic processing of simulated acid-catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis downstream (levulinic acid + formic acid) to the biofuel intermediate valeric acid (VA). This green electro-biorefining process does not require complex steps to separate levulinic acid and formic acid (FA) from H₂SO₄; instead it couples electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of levulinic acid (LA) in a single electrocatalytic flow cell reactor and electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid in a proton exchange membrane-direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC). The presence of FA has shown no negative effect on the ECH of LA and a high VA selectivity of >90% can be achieved on a non-precious Pb electrode while the Faradaic efficiency remains >47% during 8 hours of reaction in the single electrocatalytic flow cell reactor. This stream is fed directly to the DFAFC with a Pd/C anode catalyst to self-sustainably remove FA where 47% conversion of FA can be reached in 6 hours. However, electro-oxidation of FA over Pd/C appears to be reversibly inhibited by the product VA produced during ECH of LA. The electro-oxidation of FA + C₂–C₅ alkyl carboxylic acid in the half cell study shows that such an inhibition effect could have originated from the –COOH adsorption on the Pd surface. Higher carboxylic acid concentration and longer carbon chain lead to more serious loss of the electrocatalytic surface area (ECSA) of Pd/C.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3abiofuels 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3aelectrochemistry 3aformic acid 3afuel cells 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogenation 3ahydrolysis 3alead 3alevulinic acid 3aoxidation 3apalladium 3astreams 3asulfuric acid 3asurface area 3avaleric acid1 aXin, Le1 aChadderdon, David J.1 aQi, Ji1 aLiang, Changhai1 aLi, Wenzhen0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 Feb. 24, v. 16, no. 3 p.1305-1315dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3gc42254b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04328naa a2201213 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006100166500001900227520162800246592002801874650001201902650001201914650002501926650001201951650001301963650001501976650001501991650001602006650002302022650001802045650000902063650001302072650001502085650003002100650001002130653000702140653001002147653000902157653000902166653000802175653000902183653000802192653000902200653001002209653000902219653000902228653000802237653000702245653000902252653000802261653000802269653001002277653001002287653001002297653001002307653000802317653000902325653000802334653000902342653000802351653000902359653000702368653000902375653000802384653001002392653001302402653000902415653001202424653001002436653000802446653000902454653001202463653001002475653001002485653000802495653000902503653000802512653001102520653000902531653000802540653001002548653000702558653000902565653001002574653001502584653000802599653000802607653000802615653000902623653001002632653000802642653000902650653000802659653000902667653000902676653000702685653001102692653001102703653002602714653002402740653001402764700005902778700005902837700002002896773009502916856008203011852000903093655001203102IND60735700220221118071250.0210610e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073570022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2021.1528032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbuawad, Ahlam10aNutrition, one-carbon metabolism and arsenic methylation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExposure to arsenic (As) is a major public health concern globally. Inorganic As (InAs) undergoes hepatic methylation to form monomethyl (MMAs)- and dimethyl (DMAs)-arsenical species, facilitating urinary As elimination. MMAsᴵᴵᴵ is considerably more toxic than either InAsᴵᴵᴵ or DMAsⱽ, and a higher proportion of MMAs in urine has been associated with risk for a wide range of adverse health outcomes. Efficiency of As methylation differs substantially between species, between individuals, and across populations. One-carbon metabolism (OCM) is a biochemical pathway that provides methyl groups for the methylation of As, and is influenced by folate and other micronutrients, such as vitamin B₁₂, choline, betaine and creatine. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that OCM-related micronutrients play a critical role in As methylation. This review will summarize observational epidemiological studies, interventions, and relevant experimental evidence examining the role that OCM-related micronutrients have on As methylation, toxicity of As, and risk for associated adverse health-related outcomes. There is fairly robust evidence supporting the impact of folate on As methylation, and some evidence from case-control studies indicating that folate nutritional status influences risk for As-induced skin lesions and bladder cancer. However, the potential for folate to be protective for other As-related health outcomes, and the potential beneficial effects of other OCM-related micronutrients on As methylation and risk for health outcomes are less well studied and warrant additional research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abetaine 3abiochemical pathways 3acholine 3acreatine 3afolic acid 3ametabolism 3amethylation 3anutritional status 3apublic health 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 3aurine 0aAs 0aAS3MT 0aBHMT 0aBHMT 0aCBS 0aCHDH 0aCVD 0aDMAs 0aDMAsV 0adTMP 0adUMP 0aEPA 0aFA 0aFACT 0aFDA 0aFDR 0aFolbp 0aFOLH1 0aFOLR1 0aFOLR2 0aFOX 0aFTCD 0aGAA 0aGAMT 0aGDM 0aGENI 0aGM 0aGNMT 0aHcy 0aHEALS 0aHOMA2-IR 0aInAs 0aInAsIII 0aInAsV 0aLOD 0aMMAs 0aMMAsIII 0aMMAsV 0aMTHFR 0aMTR 0aMTRR 0aNAD 0aNHANES 0aNTDs 0aOCM 0aPBMCs 0aPC 0aPEMT 0aPTHMs 0aRBC folate 0aRCT 0aSAH 0aSAM 0aSHMT 0aSHMT1 0aSHS 0aSHFS 0aTHF 0aTMAO 0aTYMS 0aUS 0aUNICEF 0aFolate 0aOne-carbon metabolism 0aArsenic methylation 0aNutrition1 aBozack, Anne K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0046-57671 aSaxena, Roheeni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4421-62521 aGamble, Mary V.0 tToxicology.g2021 June 15, v. 457 p.152803-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1528033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245010700167300001600274520133400290592002801624650001201652650001201664650001801676650001401694650001901708650002201727650001301749650001101762650002201773650001501795651001501810653002201825653003301847653001701880653002701897653001601924700001801940700001801958700002101976773010001997856008002097852000902177655001202186IND60519906520221123002227.0160511e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051990652DNAL7 a10.1515/botcro-2016-00102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNowak, Arkadiusz10aDwarf shrub vegetation of rock ledges and clefts in the Pamir Alai Mountains (Middle Asia: Tajikistan)  ap. 109-120.  aThe paper presents the results of phytosociological researches on rocky slope vegetation in Tajikistan with the aim to establish a comprehensive syntaxonomical classification system. Field studies were conducted in 2010-2014 in Pamir Alai ranges and Pamirian plateau. Nearly 500 relevés documenting rock and scree vegetation were made according to the Braun-Blanquet method. Numerical analyses of selected 58 relevés representing dwarf shrub vegetation on rock ledges made it possible to distinguish: Ephedro glaucae- Spiraeion baldschuanicae and Ephedrion regeliano-fedtschenkoi alliances, as well as Spiraeetum baldschuanicae, Rhamnetum coriaceae, Pentaphylloidetum parvifoliae and Pentaphylloidetum dryadanthoidis associations, community of Ephedra glauca and community of Rhamnus minuta. The classification of vegetation of dwarf shrubs on rock walls occurring in the Pamir Alai Mts is proposed. Because of the species composition, physiognomy and microhabitat conditions, the plant communities were included into Artemisio santolinifoliae- Berberidetea sibiricae class Ermakov et al. 2006. The main factors determining the species composition of the classified associations seem to be the elevation above sea level.The newly described syntaxa are largely defined by species restricted to very narrow ranges in Middle Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEphedra 3aRhamnus 3amicrohabitats 3amountains 3aphytosociology 3aplant communities 3aplateaus 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation 3aTajikistan 0aalpine vegetation 0aCampanuletalia incanescentis 0achasmophytes 0asaxicolous communities 0asyntaxonomy1 aNowak, Sylwia1 aNobis, Marcin1 aNobis, Agnieszka0 tActa botanica Croatica.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 75, no. 1 p.109-120dDe Gruyter Openx0365-05887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/botcro-2016-00103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245005400170300001600224520094300240592002801183650001701211650002301228650001001251650002001261650001101281650001901292650001701311650001901328650001401347650001301361650001401374650001801388650002301406650001401429650000901443650002301452650001501475653002101490653001401511653001101525653001401536653002301550700001601573700001401589700003201603773009501635856008101730852000901811655001201820IND60479731020221123032804.0160124e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047973102DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.2010.00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-López, A.

Besides, consumers demand organic products because they are believed to be more flavourful, healthier, and more respectful to the environment. The effects of organic farming on CIEL*a*b* colour, minerals contents, carotenoids composition and sensory quality of Clemenpons mandarin juices were studied. Organic farming of mandarins resulted in juices with higher mineral and carotenoid contents and of better sensory quality. For instance, organic juice contained a total concentration of carotenoids of 17.3 mg l<sup>−1</sup> compared to 13.5 mg l<sup>−1</sup> of conventional juice. Finally and in general, mandarin juices are good source of some important elements, such as potassium and antioxidants, e.g. β-cryptoxanthin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abeta-cryptoxanthin 3acolor 3aconsumer demand 3afruits 3aheart diseases 3ahypertension 3amandarin juice 3amandarins 3aminerals 3aneoplasms 3aorganic foods 3aorganic production 3apotassium 3arisk 3asensory properties 3avegetables 0aβ-cryptoxanthin 0aCIEL*a*b* 0acitrus 0apotassium 0asensory evaluation1 aNavarro, P.1 aSoler, A.1 aCarbonell-Barrachina, A.

In-fire video of flame-front passage and time series data from very fine exposed thermocouples were used to estimate the duration of passage of the main flaming front in these experimental fires. Flame temperature measured at points within the flame was found to vary with height; maximum flame temperature was greater in the tall shrub fuel than in the low shrub fuel sites. A model to estimate flame temperature at any height within a flame of a specific height was developed. The maximum flame temperature observed was ~1100°C near the flame base and, when observation height was normalised by flame height, flame temperature exponentially decreased to the visible flame tip where temperatures were ~300°C. Maximum flame temperature was significantly correlated with rate of spread, fire intensity, flame height and surface fuel bulk density. Average flame-front residence time for eucalypt forest fuels was 37s and did not vary significantly with fine fuel moisture, fuel quantity or bulk density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage structure 3abulk density 3adry forests 3afire intensity 3afires 3afuels 3afuels (fire ecology) 3ashrubs 3atemperature profiles 3athermocouples 3atime series analysis 0abushfire 0aEucalyptus marginata 0afire behaviour 0aflame measurement 0afuel age 0ajarrah forest 0aVesta1 aGould, James S.1 aMcCaw, W.

Such changes in hair colour are related to an alteration in the proportions of two types of pigments produced by melanocytes; black eumelanin and brown pheomelanin. In black cats, it has been demonstrated that higher levels of phenylalanine + tyrosine (Phe+Tyr) than those recommended for growth are required to support eumelanin synthesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a similar observation could be made in dogs. Twelve black coated puppies (Black Labrador retrievers and Newfoundlands) were divided into 3 groups of 4 and fed 3 diets with increasing concentrations of Phe+Tyr (A: 4 g/Mcal; B: 5.8 g/Mcal; C: 7 g/Mcal) for a period of 6 months. Quantification of plasma amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Cys) and spectrocolourimetry of hair samples from the Labrador retrievers (as the a* dimension of CIE Lab system) were performed at the beginning, during and at the end of the study. There was a significant negative linear relationship between plasma Tyr levels and a* values of hair in Labrador dogs on diets A and B, suggesting that a diet with total Phe+Tyr content of 6 g/Mcal (higher than the growth recommended allowance) was necessary to ensure an optimal black coat colour in these puppies and that levels up to 7 g/Mcal can lead to a more intense black coat colour. Moreover, similar to what was found in kittens, plasma levels of Tyr up to 54 μmol/l did not guarantee an optimal black colour coat and led to the “reddish hair” appearance in black coated puppies.  aPublisher supplied data 0adog 0anutrition 0ablack coat 0ared coat syndrome 0atyrosine 0aphenylalanine 0amelanin 0amelanocytes1 aServet, Eric1 aHervera, Marta1 aBiourge, Vincent C.0 tJournal of applied animal nutrition.g2015, v. 3dCambridge University PresswJournal:2269x2049-257X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jan.2015.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03626naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002300167245006800190300001800258500002000276500001500296520256300311592002802874650001202902651001102914651001002925651001502935700002102950700002302971700002202994700002303016773013203039852000903171856010803180655001203288IND2207743020221120112506.0180321e200010  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220774302DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1478:HCIPHI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcIntosh, Bruce A.10aHistorical changes in pool habitats in the columbia river basin  ap. 1478-1496.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aAn historical stream survey (1934–1945) was compared with current surveys (1987–1997) to assess changes in pool frequencies in the Columbia River Basin. We surveyed 2267 km of 122 streams across the basin, representing a wide range of lithologies, stream sizes, land use histories, ownerships, and ecoregions. Based on pool classes inherited from the historical surveys, the frequencies of large (≥20 m² and ≥0.9 m depth) and deep (≥20 m² and ≥1.8 m depth) pools have decreased significantly (P < 0.01) since the 1930s. We classified streams as natural or commodity based on their watershed management and land use histories. Natural streams were in watersheds minimally affected by human activities (e.g., wilderness or roadless designation, limited entry), with only 12% having roads in riparian areas. Commodity streams were defined as having watersheds managed predominantly for extraction of resources via timber harvest, livestock grazing, and other human activities. Ninety percent of these streams had roads in the riparian areas. In natural streams, large‐pool frequencies increased or remained the same in 96% of the streams (88% for deep pools). In commodity streams, large‐ and deep‐pool frequencies decreased in 52% and 54% of the streams, respectively. Despite differences in stream size and the level of human activities, the magnitude and direction of these changes were consistent. Land ownership did not influence trends; pools decreased significantly on both private and public lands. Only where entire watersheds or headwaters were designated as wilderness or roadless areas did pools consistently remain unchanged or increase. Pool frequencies decreased in all ecoregions except the North Cascades ecoregion. We developed regional histories of human activities for the Columbia River Basin. Human activity histories were typically of low spatial resolution and available for broad geographic areas only; we rarely were able to obtain information at the scale of individual watersheds. Consequently, we were unable to test the relationship between temporal and spatial patterns in human activities and their influence on site‐specific trends in pools. Despite our inability to isolate causal mechanisms, management emphasis and human activities clearly influenced trends in pools. We conclude that the persistent effects of human activities have simplified stream channels and reduced large‐ and deep‐pool frequencies in watersheds outside of designated wilderness and roadless areas in the Columbia River Basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3astreams 3aOregon 3aIdaho 0aWashington1 aSedell, James R.1 aThurow, Russell F.1 aClarke, Sharon E.1 aChandler, Gwynn L.0 tEcological applications.g2000 Oct., v. 10, no. 5 p.1478-1496dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010%5B1478:HCIPHI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04597naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100003100182245020000213300001800413506007600431520275700507592002803264506003703292650002103329650002703350650001203377650002203389650002203411650002003433650001203453650001403465650001103479650001603490650001203506650001203518650001103530650001403541650002003555650002903575650002603604650003303630650001403663700003103677700002103708700002203729700003303751700002103784700002203805773012003827856007503947852000904022655001204031IND60128169220221207114918.0150501e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012816922DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.02522-142doi7 aPMC44036592pmcid7 a256915252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZébréé, Arthur Constant10aInteraction with Enzyme IIBᴹᵖᵒ (EIIBᴹᵖᵒ) and Phosphorylation by Phosphorylated EIIBᴹᵖᵒ Exert Antagonistic Effects on the Transcriptional Activator ManR of Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 1559-1572.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aListeriae take up glucose and mannose predominantly through a mannose class phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS ᴹᵃⁿ), whose three components are encoded by the manLMN genes. The expression of these genes is controlled by ManR, a LevR-type transcription activator containing two PTS regulation domains (PRDs) and two PTS-like domains (enzyme IIA ᴹᵃⁿ [EIIA ᴹᵃⁿ]- and EIIB ᴳᵃᵗ-like). We demonstrate here that in Listeria monocytogenes , ManR is activated via the phosphorylation of His585 in the EIIA ᴹᵃⁿ-like domain by the general PTS components enzyme I and HPr. We also show that ManR is regulated by the PTS ᴹᵖᵒ and that EIIB ᴹᵖᵒ plays a dual role in ManR regulation. First, yeast two-hybrid experiments revealed that unphosphorylated EIIB ᴹᵖᵒ interacts with the two C-terminal domains of ManR (EIIB ᴳᵃᵗ-like and PRD2) and that this interaction is required for ManR activity. Second, in the absence of glucose/mannose, phosphorylated EIIB ᴹᵖᵒ (P∼EIIB ᴹᵖᵒ) inhibits ManR activity by phosphorylating His871 in PRD2. The presence of glucose/mannose causes the dephosphorylation of P∼EIIB ᴹᵖᵒ and P∼PRD2 of ManR, which together lead to the induction of the manLMN operon. Complementation of a Δ manR mutant with various manR alleles confirmed the antagonistic effects of PTS-catalyzed phosphorylation at the two different histidine residues of ManR. Deletion of manR prevented not only the expression of the manLMN operon but also glucose-mediated repression of virulence gene expression; however, repression by other carbohydrates was unaffected. Interestingly, the expression of manLMN in Listeria innocua was reported to require not only ManR but also the Crp-like transcription activator Lin0142. Unlike Lin0142, the L. monocytogenes homologue, Lmo0095, is not required for manLMN expression; its absence rather stimulates man expression. IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes is a human pathogen causing the foodborne disease listeriosis. The expression of most virulence genes is controlled by the transcription activator PrfA. Its activity is strongly repressed by carbohydrates, including glucose, which is transported into L. monocytogenes mainly via a mannose/glucose-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS ᴹᵃⁿ). Expression of the man operon is regulated by the transcription activator ManR, the activity of which is controlled by a second, low-efficiency PTS of the mannose family, which functions as glucose sensor. Here we demonstrate that the EIIB ᴹᵖᵒ component plays a dual role in ManR regulation: it inactivates ManR by phosphorylating its His871 residue and stimulates ManR by interacting with its two C-terminal domains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aalleles 3adephosphorylation 3afoodborne illness 3agene expression 3aglucose 3ahistidine 3ahumans 3alisteriosis 3amannose 3amutants 3aoperon 3apathogens 3aphosphorylation 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3avirulence1 aAkééé, Francine Moussan1 aVentroux, Magali1 aKoffi-Nevry, Rose1 aNoirot-Gros, Marie-Francoise1 aDeutscher, Josef1 aMilohanic, Eliane0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2015 May 1, v. 197, no. 9 p.1559-1572dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.02522-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245014700172300001600319520140700335592002801742650001601770650002101786650000901807650002601816650001301842650001101855650001201866650002201878650001901900650001001919650001801929650002201947650002101969650001001990650000902000650001102009650001602020651001102036653002402047653002002071653002202091653001802113653002102131653001702152700002302169700003302192700002602225773010002251856008002351852000902431655001202440IND60519906620221122231345.0160511e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051990662DNAL7 a10.1515/botcro-2016-00112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSavković, Željko D.10aComparison of anti-Aspergillus activity of Origanum vulgare L. essential oil and commercial biocide based on silver ions and hydrogen peroxide  ap. 121-128.  aThe antifungal activities of Origanum vulgare essential oil (EO) and of a biocide based on silver and hydrogen peroxide (Sanosil S003) against seven Aspergillus species isolated from different substrata (stone, brick, silk and paper) of cultural heritage objects in Serbia were evaluated. Microdilution, agar dilution and microatmosphere methods were used to determine minimal fungistatic and minimal fungicidal concentrations (MIC and MFC), and light microscopy to determine structural abnormalities. MIC and MFC values for O. vulgare EO ranged from 0.2 to 5 mg mL⁻¹ and for Sanosil S003 from 5 to 250 mg mL⁻¹. Aspergillus sp. sect. fumigati was the most susceptible isolate, where MIC and MFC values were achieved at 0.5 mg mL⁻¹ for O. vulgare EO, while MIC and MFC values for Sanosil S003 were achieved at 5 and 10 mg mL⁻¹, respectively. Morpho-physiological changes were documented in all isolates, including lack of sporulation, depigmentation of conidiogenous apparatus and conidia, and presence of aberrant fungal structures. O. vulgare EO exhibited stronger anti-Aspergillus activity than Sanosil S003, as demonstrated by the higher MIC and MFC values and fewer morpho-physiological changes observed in the tested Sanosil S003 concentrations. O. vulgare EO could be an excellent alternative to commercial biocides, with high potential in the field of cultural heritage conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus 3aOriganum vulgare 3aagar 3aantifungal properties 3abiocides 3abricks 3aconidia 3acultural heritage 3aessential oils 3afungi 3ahydrogen ions 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alight microscopy 3apaper 3asilk 3asilver 3asporulation 3aSerbia 0aantifungal activity 0aAspergllus spp. 0acultural heritage 0aessential oil 0aOriganum vulgare 0aSanosil S0031 aStupar, Miloš Č.1 aGrbić, Milica V.

In restoring these landscapes, it is important to understand their historical condition and biological function. Synthesizing historical primary accounts (from explorers, travelers, settlers, and farmers) with contemporary knowledge of these wetland systems, we developed a profile of the wetlands and their use by nonbreeding waterbirds (e.g., waterfowl, wading birds, and shorebirds) within the Willamette Valley, Oregon, ca. 1840. We found evidence for three types of wetlands used by non-breeding waterbirds in fall, winter, and spring: emergent wetlands, riverine wetlands, and wetland prairie. The most extensive wetland type was wetland prairie, which functioned as fall/winter habitat for waterbirds, but only while native Kalapuyans managed the region with fire. Since the mid-1800s, four species, in particular, have decreased their use of the Willamette Valley: trumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator), snow goose (Chen caerulescens), sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), and long-billed curlew (Numenius americanus). Information suggests that ca. 1840, waterbirds and their habitats were more abundant in the Willamette Valley than today. Restoration of the Willamette Valley landscape is warranted, and today's agricultural wetlands——former wetland prairie——hold highest restoration potential.  aPublisher supplied data 0aagricultural landscape 0afire 0ahistorical wetlands 0aKalapuya 0aland use 0aOregon 0ashorebirds 0awading birds 0awaterfowl 0awetland loss 0awetland prairie 0awetland restoration 0aWillamette Valley1 aHaig, Susan M.0 tWetlands.g2003 Mar., v. 23, no. 1 p.51-64dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282003%29023%5B0051%3AHWIOWV%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04887naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245019200173300001600365520257200381592002802953650002802981650003703009650003303046650002003079650001303099650001403112650002403126650001703150650002203167650002103189650001403210650001703224650002103241650002003262650001303282650002003295650002803315650001903343650001503362650002103377650002703398650001603425650001903441650001603460650002803476650001903504650001503523650001103538653001303549653001803562653002703580653002303607653002903630700001903659700002503678700002003703700003403723700002303757700002203780700002003802700003003822700001803852700003203870700001903902773012603921856008504047852000904132655001204141IND60689223420221122235525.0200420e20170818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922342DNAL7 a10.1080/07388551.2016.12605252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValdiani, Alireza10aGenoproteomics-assisted improvement of Andrographis paniculata: toward a promising molecular and conventional breeding platform for autogamous plants affecting the pharmaceutical industry  ap. 803-816.  aAndrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Wall. ex Nees. (AP) is a hermaphroditic, self-compatible, and habitual inbreeding plant. Its main bioactive component is andrographolide, which is capable of inducing autophagic cell death in some human cancer cells and helps fight HIV/AIDS. Increasing the andrographolide content by investigating the genetic mechanisms controlling its biosynthesis in order to improve and develop high-yielding cultivars are the main breeding targets for AP. However, there might exist some limitations or barriers for crossability within AP accessions. Recently, this problem was addressed in AP by using a combination of crossbreeding and biotechnology-aided genetic methods. This review emphasizes that development of a breeding platform in a hard-to-breed plant, such as AP, requires the involvement of a broad range of methods from classical genetics to molecular breeding. To this end, a phenological stage (for example, flowering and stigma development) can be simplified to a quantitative morphological trait (for example, bud or stigma length) to be used as an index to express the highest level of receptivity in order to manage outcrossing. The outcomes of the basic crossability research can be then employed in diallel mating and crossbreeding. This review explains how genomic data could produce useful information regarding genetic distance and its influence on the crossability of AP accessions. Our review indicates that co-dominant DNA markers, such as microsatellites, are also capable of resolving the evolutionary pathway and cryptic features of plant populations and such information can be used to select the best breeding strategy. This review also highlights the importance of proteomic analysis as a breeding tool. In this regard, protein diversification, as well as the impact of normal and stress-responsive proteins on morphometric and physiological behaviors, could be used in breeding programs. These findings have immense potential for improving plant production and, therefore, can be regarded as prospective breeding platforms for medicinal plants that have an autogamous mode of reproduction. Finally, this review suggests that novel site-directed genome editing approaches such as TALENs (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease) systems together with other new plant breeding technologies (NPBT) should simultaneously be taken into consideration for improvement of pharmaceutical plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrographis paniculata 3aCRISPR-associated endonuclease 9 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aandrographolide 3aautogamy 3aautophagy 3abioactive compounds 3abiosynthesis 3abreeding programs 3adiallel analysis 3aflowering 3agene editing 3agenetic distance 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 3ahermaphroditism 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3ahuman diseases 3ainbreeding 3amedicinal plants 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amorphometry 3aneoplasm cells 3aoutcrossing 3apharmaceutical industry 3aplant breeding 3aproteomics 3astigma 0axenogamy 0acrossbreeding 0atranscriptome analysis 0ametabolic pathways 0amolecular plant breeding1 aTalei, Daryush1 aLattoo, Surrinder K.1 aOrtiz, Rodomiro1 aRasmussen, Søren Kjærsgaard1 aBatley, Jacqueline1 aRafii, Mohd Yusop1 aMaziah, Mahmood1 aSabu, Kallevettankuzhy K.1 aAbiri, Rambod1 aSakuanrungsirikul, Suchirat1 aTan, Soon Guan0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2017 Aug. 18, v. 37, no. 6 p.803-816dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2016.12605253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245008400208300001800292520158900310592002801899650001801927650001101945650001601956650002701972650002301999650001202022650001802034650001102052650002602063653001302089653003202102653002602134700002302160700002102183700001902204700001702223700001702240773014302257856008502400852000902485655001202494IND60685827120200410000000.0200309e20200214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068582712DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b074142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xueming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4009-981010aModeling of Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthesis from Biogas by Methylocystis hirsuta  ap. 3906-3912.  aMethylocystis hirsuta, a type II methanotroph, has been experimentally demonstrated to be able to efficiently synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from biogas under nutrient-limited conditions. A mechanistic model capable of describing the relevant processes of M. hirsuta, which is currently not available, would therefore lay a solid foundation for future practical demonstration and optimization of the PHA synthesis technology using biogas. To this end, dedicated batch tests were designed and conducted to obtain experimental data for different mechanistic processes of M. hirsuta. Through utilizing the experimental data of well-designed batch tests and following a step-wise model calibration/validation protocol, the stoichiometrics and kinetics of M. hirsuta are reported for the first time, including the yields of growth and PHA synthesis on CH₄ (0.14 ± 0.01 g COD g–¹ COD and 0.25 ± 0.02 g COD g–¹ COD), the CH₄ and O₂ affinity constants (5.1 ± 2.1 g COD m–³ and 4.1 ± 1.7 g O₂ m–³), the maximum PHA consumption rate (0.019 ± 0.001 g COD g–¹ COD d–¹), and the maximum PHA synthesis rate on CH₄ (0.39 ± 0.05 g COD g–¹ COD d–¹). Through applying the developed model, an optimal O₂:CH₄ molar ratio of 1.6 mol O₂ mol–¹ CH₄ was found to maximize the PHA synthesis by M. hirsuta. Practically, the model and parameters obtained would not only benefit the design and operation of bioreactors performing PHA synthesis from biogas, but also enable specific research on selection for type II methanotrophs in diverse environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethylocystis 3abiogas 3abioreactors 3achemical oxygen demand 3amechanistic models 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3aoxygen 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 0amodeling 0apolyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) 0atype II methanotrophs1 aRodríguez, Yadira1 aLópez, Juan C.,1 aMuñoz, Raúl,1 aNi, Bing-Jie1 aSin, Gürkan0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Feb. 14, v. 8, no. 9 p.3906-3912dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b074143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008600174300001400260500001900274520094400293592002801237650002101265650000901286650001601295651001101311653001601322653001901338653002801357653001801385773011401403856008501517852000901602655001201611IND60728029120221119093557.0210216e20210102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072802912DNAL7 a10.1080/17565529.2020.17117002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesselbaum, Dennis10aRevisiting the climate driver and inhibitor mechanisms of international migration  ap. 10-20.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, we add to the literature on the driving forces of international migration out of Africa. We particularly focus on the direct effect of climate variables: temperature, rainfall, and weather-related disaster. We revisit the question whether climate is a driver or inhibitor of migration using migration flows out of all African countries from 1980 to 2015 into 16 OECD countries. Our findings show that climate can be a driver and an inhibitor of migration depending on the size of the temperature shock. We show that temperature has non-linear effects on migration. We observe a U-shaped relationship for temperature at destination and an inverted U-shaped relationship at origin. We also find that the agricultural pathway does quantitatively matter: countries relying more heavily on agriculture experience larger migration flows. Finally, weather-related disaster also have a significant effect on international migration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3arain 3atemperature 3aAfrica 0aAgriculture 0aclimate change 0ainternational migration 0anon-linearity0 tClimate and development.g2021 Jan. 2, v. 13, no. 1 p.10-20dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19683x1756-55377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2020.17117003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03896naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245013300213300001800346500002000364506007600384520229400460592002802754506003702782650001902819650002202838650001702860650001202877650001002889650001502899650001102914650001102925650001102936650001302947650001302960650002002973650001102993650001303004650000903017650002503026650001103051651001603062700002703078700002403105700002103129773012803150856007903278852000903357655001203366IND60587338420221207120829.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058733842DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.128252doi7 aPMC55107182pmcid7 a287172552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurnik Šturm, Martina10aSequential stable isotope analysis reveals differences in dietary history of three sympatric equid species in the Mongolian Gobi  ap. 1110-1119.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCompetition among sympatric wild herbivores is reduced by different physiological, morphological and behavioural traits resulting in different dietary niches. Wild equids are a rather uniform group of large herbivores which have dramatically declined in numbers and range. Correlative evidence suggests that pasture competition with livestock is one of the key factors for this decline, and the situation may be aggravated in areas where different equid species overlap. The Dzungarian Gobi is currently the only place where two wild equid species coexist and share the range with the domesticated form of a third equid species. In the winter‐cold Gobi desert pasture productivity is low, highly seasonal, and wild equids additionally face increasing livestock densities. We used stable isotope chronologies of tail hairs to draw inferences about multi‐year diet seasonality, isotopic dietary niches and physiological adaptations in the Asiatic wild ass (khulan), re‐introduced Przewalski's horse, and domestic horse in the Mongolian part of the Dzungarian Gobi. Our results showed that even in the arid Gobi, both horse species are predominantly grazers, whereas khulan are highly seasonal, switching from being grazers in summer to mixed feeders in winter. The isotopic dietary niches of the two horse species were almost identical, did not vary with season as in khulan and were narrower than in the latter. Higher δ¹⁵N values point towards higher water use efficiency in khulan, which may be one reason why they can exploit pastures further away from water. Synthesis and applications. The high degree of isotopic dietary niche overlap in the two horse species in the Mongolian Gobi points towards a high potential for pasture competition during the critical nutritional bottleneck in winter and highlights the need to severely restrict grazing of domestic horses on the range of the Przewalski's horses. The evolutionary more distant khulan are less constrained by water and seem more flexible in their choice of diet or less successful in exploiting grass‐dominated habitats in winter due to human presence. Providing additional water sources could increase the competition between khulan and livestock and should, therefore, only be done following careful consideration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEquus hemionus 3aEquus przewalskii 3adiet history 3agrazing 3ahairs 3aherbivores 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aniches 3anitrogen 3apastures 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3asympatry 3atail 3awater use efficiency 3awinter 3aGobi Desert1 aGanbaatar, Oyunsaikhan1 aVoigt, Christian C.1 aKaczensky, Petra0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2017 Aug., v. 54, no. 4 p.1110-1119dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.128253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245015700153300002000310520108000330592002801410650001701438650002601455650003301481650001301514650002401527650001501551650001101566650001301577650003001590650001601620700001701636700002101653700001701674700001501691700001701706773012801723856007501851852000901926655001201935IND60759881020221121144654.0211214e20211213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075988102DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo02729h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yi10aLycopene prevents DEHP-induced testicular endoplasmic reticulum stress via regulating nuclear xenobiotic receptors and unfolded protein response in mice  ap. 12256-12264.  aLycopene (LYC) is a potent antioxidant synthesized by red vegetables or plants. Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is frequently detected in diverse agricultural environments and considered as a reproductive toxicant. The present research was designed to assess the potential mechanisms of DEHP-induced testicular toxicity and the treatment efficacy of LYC. In this study, after the oral administration of LYC at the dose of 5 mg per kg b.w. per day, mice were given 500 or 1000 mg per kg b.w. per day of DEHP. This research suggested that LYC prevented the DEHP-induced disorder at the levels of activity and content of CYP450 enzymes. LYC attenuated DEHP-caused enhancement in nuclear xenobiotic receptors (NXRs) and the phase I metabolizing enzymes (CYP1, CYP2, CYP3, etc.) levels. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was induced by DEHP and triggered unfolded protein response (UPR). Interestingly, LYC could effectively ameliorate these “hit”. The present study suggested that LYC prevents DEHP-induced ER stress in testis via regulating NXRs and UPRᴱᴿ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3alycopene 3aoral administration 3aphthalates 3atestes 3atoxicity 3aunfolded protein response 3axenobiotics1 aCui, Ling-Ge1 aTalukder, Milton1 aCui, Jia-Gen1 aZhang, Hao1 aLi, Jin-Long0 tFood & function.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 12, no. 24 p.12256-12264dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo02729h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015300169520151800322592002801840650001101868650001901879650001101898650001401909650001101923650001101934650001901945650002901964650002701993650001302020650001402033650001402047650001902061650001102080651001202091653002802103653002502131653002702156653003102183653003002214653003402244653000702278653001002285653000802295653000702303653000702310653001102317653000902328653000902337653000802346653000702354653000802361700002602369700002202395773011302417856008602530852000902616655001202625IND60724257320221119075139.0220103e20210410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1258502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaker, Mazia10aExploring the performances of urban local symbiosis strategy in Algiers, between a potential of energy use optimization and CO2 emissions mitigation  aAlgeria’s interest in the global warming issue and its commitment to reduce its GHG emissions by 2030 requires research for operational solutions to support this effort. That entails establishing new urban planning tools, especially at the local urban scale. At the root of harmful Climate Change, cities must exploit their full potential to set up mitigation strategies.The interest of Industrial Symbioses in optimizing the industrial metabolism led us to explore such a potential for the operational urban planning needs focused on reducing CO₂ emissions. This article aims to study the performances of a Low Carbon Urban Symbiosis (LC-UrS) at Algiers local scale. Based on a systemic approach, the study defines, firstly, the concerned urban system. Secondly, it explores its perimeter’s symbiotic potential to build a database allowing develop the possible symbiotic scenarios and quantify their performance in energy optimization and CO₂ emissions reduction. The gains are then estimated for each scenario. An urban design strategy for the considered optimal scenario is proposed under an action plan for LC-UrS.The results bring interesting answers for energy optimization and CO₂ emissions reduction, with estimated rates of 30.5% and 13.27% per year, in Algerian’s capital city case. This optimizing potential will be even more significant for other cities in the world, particularly with the increase in urban waste. However, implementing such a strategy would require background conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acities 3adatabases 3adesign 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amaterial flow analysis 3aresearch 3asolutions 3asymbiosis 3aurban planning 3awastes 3aAlgeria 0aCO2 emissions reduction 0aLocal urban planning 0aSymbiotic urban system 0aLow carbon urban symbiosis 0aCircular urban metabolism 0aWaste- energy metabolic flows 0aCC 0aEH-OS 0aHSW 0aIE 0aIS 0aLC-UrS 0aPDAU 0aSNAT 0aTLC 0aUM 0aUrS1 aBerezowska-Azzag, Ewa1 aPerrotti, Daniela0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 10, v. 292 p.125850-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1258503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006400151245006300215300001800278520137300296592002801669650001701697650001201714650001001726650001901736650002601755650002401781650001201805653001401817653002301831653002401854653003101878700002201909700002301931700006301954700002302017700001502040700006002055700002302115700006302138773014302201856008502344852000902429655001202438IND60685827220221119134202.0200309e20200213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068582722DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b074152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiesielski, Peter N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3360-921010aAdvances in Multiscale Modeling of Lignocellulosic Biomass  ap. 3512-3531.  aApplications and associated processing technologies of lignocellulosic biomass are becoming increasingly important as we endeavor to meet societal demand for fuels, chemicals, and materials from renewable resources. Meanwhile, the rapidly expanding availability and capabilities of high-performance computing present an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate development of technologies surrounding lignocellulose utilization. In order to realize this potential, suitable modeling frameworks must be constructed that effectively capture the multiscale complexity and tremendous variety exhibited by lignocellulosic materials. In our assessment of previous endeavors toward this goal, several important shortcomings have been identified: (1) the lack of multiscale integration strategies that capture emergent properties and behaviors spanning different length scales and (2) the inability of many modeling approaches to effectively capture the variability and diversity of lignocellulose that arise from both natural and process-induced sources. In this Perspective, we survey previous modeling approaches for lignocellulose and simulation processes involving its chemical and mechanical transformation and suggest opportunities for future development to enhance the utility of computational tools to address barriers to widespread adoption of a renewable bioeconomy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioeconomics 3abiomass 3afuels 3alignocellulose 3aprocessing technology 3arenewable resources 3asurveys 0aBioenergy 0aBiobased materials 0aMultiscale modeling 0aHigh-performance computing1 aPecha, M.

With respect to all the indicators of basic amenities, improvement was observed between 1993 to 2008–2009 with acceleration during 2002 and 2008–2009. Basic amenities such as drinking water facility, sanitation facilities and drainage arrangement require special attention in both rural and urban areas with more focus towards rural areas. Even for identical economic groups (poor and non-poor), SCs and STs were found lagging behind in reducing the gap with lower rate of improvement than others and also in the existing levels in 2008–2009. It indicates that even if same economic conditions prevail there is variation in attainment by different social groups. Results suggest that there are factors acting as constraints based on social backgrounds leading to denial on access to basic amenities. Findings of this study implies that various policies on basic amenities needs to be supplemented with pro poor and group specific policies (social) for raising the overall standard of life and well-being.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrainage 3adrinking water 3aelectricity 3aissues and policy 3arural areas 3asanitation 3asocial class 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aIndia0 tJournal of land and rural studies.g, v. 2, no. 1 p.127-148dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26867x2321-02497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23210249135151133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003900113040001800152100002300170245009200193300001400285520171500299592002802014650001302042650001602055650001602071650003002087650002102117650002402138650001702162650001902179650001602198650001202214650002102226650001002247650001902257650001602276650002802292650002802320650004602348650001602394650002402410650002002434650004102454651002102495651001102516653001802527653002602545653002602571653002302597700002102620773011502641856008602756852000902842655001202851IND50066551220221118122413.0190318e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006655122DNAL7 a236808272pmid7 a10.1016/j.jconhyd.2013.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSengor, S.

A numerical modeling study was carried out to analyze the groundwater flow and contaminant (AN) transport at the spill site. This study presents the application of a numerical groundwater model to determine the hydrogeological parameters of the site, where such data were not available during the field surveys prior to the simulation studies. The two- and three-dimensional transient flow and transport models were first calibrated using the first 266days of observed head and concentration data and then verified using the remaining 540-day observed data set. Off-site migration of the contaminant plume was kept under control within the site boundaries owing to the favorable geology of the site, the characteristics of the local groundwater flow regime and the pumping operations. As expected, the applied pump-and-treat system was effective at high-permeability zones, but not fully effective at low-permeability zones. The results of long-term simulations for unconfined aquifer showed that the size of the plume in the high permeability zone shrank significantly due to the dilution by natural recharge. However, in the low permeability zone, it was not significantly affected. The study showed that accurate and sufficient data regarding the source characteristics, concentration and groundwater level measurements, groundwater pumping rates and their durations at each of the extraction points involved in the pump-and-treat system along with the hydrogeological site characterization are the key parameters for successful flow and transport model calibrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aearthquakes 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater flow 3amathematical models 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3aremediation 3asurveys 3asynthetic fibers 3atanks 3atransient flow 3awater table 2aAcrylonitrilexanalysis 2aChemical Hazard Release 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediation 2aGroundwater 2aModels, Theoretical 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkey 0aAcrylonitrile 0aContaminant transport 0aPump-and-treat system 0aNumerical modeling1 aÜnlü, Kahraman0 tJournal of contaminant hydrology.g2013 July, v. 150 p.77-92dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl42311x0169-77227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2013.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011500169500001900284520239700303592002802700650002802728650001302756650001602769650001002785650001602795650003002811650001302841650002102854650001502875650001802890650001902908650001302927650001502940650001402955650001802969650003002987650001803017651001903035653001003054653003003064653002503094653002103119700002603140700002103166700002003187700002503207700002303232773011403255856008203369852000903451655001203460IND60707394520221122231932.0201104e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070739452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeLuca, Nicole M.10aEvaluation of remotely sensed prediction and forecast models for Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the Chesapeake Bay  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOver the last decade, an increase of gastrointestinal illness due to Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the consumption of raw shellfish has been reported in multiple regions around the United States. Studies mainly attribute this increase to rising sea surface temperatures and prolonged warm seasons in the mid-latitudes. Historically, temperature has been the main environmental determinant used to predict V. parahaemolyticus concentrations in shellfish and surface water. However, studies using in situ sampling campaigns have shown that additional water quality parameters can be useful in predicting the bacterium. While the time and cost of obtaining in situ samples throughout the Chesapeake Bay at regular time intervals can exceed available resources, satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide predictions at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. This study uses satellite ocean color remote sensing and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the utility of remotely sensed information for Vibrio parahaemolyticus predictions in the Chesapeake Bay and whether additional remotely sensed information can improve predictions over conventional SST-based models. We find that the addition of remotely sensed salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-a generally improves presence and abundance predictions compared to SST-only models. Models using remote sensing reflectances and SST also show potential for V. parahaemolyticus predictions, which could bypass the intermediary step of deriving water quality products from reflectances. Remotely sensed ocean color products and SST from one week prior to in situ V. parahaemolyticus measurements are evaluated and shown to be useful in bacterium predictions, which could provide lead-time for management decisions. The forecast models using ocean color products in addition to SST showed improvement over SST-only forecast models. The results of this study suggest that remote sensing can be a valuable tool to aid in higher resolution V. parahaemolyticus predictions and forecasts in the Chesapeake Bay, particularly when multiple environmental predictors are employed. However, the complexities of using remotely sensed data for ecological modeling applications and evaluating model performance also highlight the need for more research in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3abacteria 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aenvironment 3agastrointestinal diseases 3alatitude 3amodel validation 3aprediction 3araw shellfish 3aremote sensing 3asalinity 3asatellites 3ashellfish 3asurface water 3asurface water temperature 3awater quality 3aChesapeake Bay 0aMODIS 0aOcean color,public health 0aStatistical analysis 0aMachine learning1 aZaitchik, Benjamin F.1 aGuikema, Seth D.1 aJacobs, John M.1 aDavis, Benjamin J.K.1 aCurriero, Frank C.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 250 p.112016-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01875naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245006400169300001600233520078200249592002801031650001101059650002501070653004801095653004801143653001301191653003701204653001901241653002301260700002201283700002001305773012101325856008201446852000901528655001201537IND60610022520221116163859.0180824e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061002252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2016.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaek, Changryong10aSparse seasonal and periodic vector autoregressive modeling  ap. 103-126.  aSeasonal and periodic vector autoregressions are two common approaches to modeling vector time series exhibiting cyclical variations. The total number of parameters in these models increases rapidly with the dimension and order of the model, making it difficult to interpret the model and questioning the stability of the parameter estimates. To address these and other issues, two methodologies for sparse modeling are presented in this work: first, based on regularization involving adaptive lasso and, second, extending the approach of Davis et al.

The methods are shown to work well on simulated data, and to perform well on several examples of real vector time series exhibiting cyclical variations.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3atime series analysis 0aSeasonal vector autoregressive (SVAR) model 0aPeriodic vector autoregressive (PVAR) model 0aSparsity 0aPartial spectral coherence (PSC) 0aAdaptive lasso 0aVariable selection1 aDavis, Richard A.1 aPipiras, Vladas0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2017 Feb., v. 106 p.103-126dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2016.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01956naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245006700155300001800222520061300240592002800853650001400881650001200895650002300907650002300930650002300953650000900976700001500985700001301000700001301013700001201026700001701038700001701055700001701072700001801089700001701107700001701124700001401141700001501155700001201170700001401182700001801196700001701214700001301231700001801244773010401262856007501366852000901441655001201450IND60578683720180316000000.0170813e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057868372DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400822m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Ruizhi10aBimetallic Enantioselective Approach to Axially Chiral Allenes  ap. 2254-2257.  aAn efficient bimetallic Zn(II)/Cu(I)-mediated asymmetric synthesis of simple axially chiral allenes from terminal alkynes and aldehydes was realized by taking advantage of the chiral amine (S)-α,α-diphenylprolinol 3.

While the growth in the production of silk has contributed towards more sustainable livelihoods, it has not translated into enhanced empowerment.

The sensing system includes three diverse concentrations of chloroauric acid (HAuCl₄) as receptors and silver nanospheres (AgNPs) as colorimetric probes. In the assay, Au³⁺ was reduced into Au atoms and deposited on surfaces of AgNPs. Meanwhile, the AgNPs were oxidized to Ag⁺ by HAuCl₄ and separated from the AgNPs. However, in the presence of different antioxidants, HAuCl₄ was reduced by different degrees, causing varying degrees of AgNP etching and gold deposition, which would result in distinctive colorimetric signal patterns for pattern differentiation of target antioxidants via linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The above results indicated that at least three HAuCl₄/AgNP sensors can successfully recognize five kinds of antioxidants at the 10 nM level. In addition, selective experiments and practical application tests have shown that the sensing strategy has outstanding anti-interference ability and excellent application in human serum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acolorimetry 3adiscriminant analysis 3agold 3ahumans 3ananosilver 3ananospheres 3aoxidation 3areceptors 3asilver 0asilver nanospheres 0asensor array 0achloroauric acid 0aantioxidant 0asilver etching 0alinear discriminant analysis1 aChen, Zhengbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9443-79291 aZuo, Xia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5205-53000 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Feb. 12, v. 8, no. 9 p.3922-3928dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b075233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009900167520113300266592002801399650002101427650001101448650001901459650001301478650001801491650002301509650001601532650000701548650001501555650001601570653002401586653002101610700001201631700001801643700001301661700001801674700001501692773010601707856008701813852000901900655001201909IND60743016620221122204847.0211017e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074301662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1254552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Hao10aCharacteristics of in-situ hydrogen biomethanation at mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures  aIn-situ hydrogen biomethanation is a promising technology to upgrade biogas. The efficiency of biomethanation relies on various parameters, e.g. gas supplement, temperature and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Therefore, it is important to investigate the characteristics of in-situ hydrogen biomethanation under different conditions. In this study, two experiments (lasted for 91 days and 105 days) were carried out to investigate the impacts of feeding gas and operating conditions on performances of reactors and microorganisms. During the whole experiment, no obvious fluctuation of pH and limitation of gas–liquid mass transfer were found. Results showed that the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis performed better at thermophilic condition, while the dominant archaea genera at mesophilic and thermophilic temperature was determined to be Methanobacterium and Methanothermobacter, respectively. The highest CH₄ content (greater than 90%) was obtained when H₂ and CO₂ was feeding at ratio of 4:1 and Methanothermobacter was dominant. These findings can provide useful information for promoting hydrogen biomethanation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobacterium 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3ahydrogen 3amass transfer 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3apH 3atechnology 3atemperature 0aAnaerobic Digestion 0aBiogas Upgrading1 aWu, Fan1 aWang, Yuchang1 aFeng, Lu1 aZhou, Hongjun1 aLi Yeqing,0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Oct., v. 337 p.125455-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1254553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011300170300001400283520157100297592002801868650001901896650001601915650001601931650001101947650001101958650001101969650001801980650002401998650001802022650002402040650001302064650001302077650001602090650002102106653000702127653000602134653000902140653000902149653000902158653000902167653000702176653000702183653000702190653000702197653002402204653001802228653001702246653001002263653001402273700002502287773013002312856008402442852000902526655001202535IND60539660120221118022833.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053966012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivest, Emily B.10aEffects of temperature and pCO2 on lipid use and biological parameters of planulae of Pocillopora damicornis  ap. 43-52.  aThe successful dispersal and recruitment of coral larvae depend on endogenous energy stores that fuel swimming, the search for optimal habitat, and metamorphosis. Ocean acidification and warming threaten to disrupt this critical process within the life cycle of reef-building corals by increasing maintenance costs in the energy budgets of larvae. In this study, lipid utilization and biological parameters of planula larvae of the cauliflower coral Pocillopora damicornis under future ocean conditions were examined using manipulative CO2 experiments. For the first 24h following their release, planulae were cultured in seawater controlled to mimic a future ocean scenario (1030μatm pCO2, 30.7°C) as well as present-day, ambient ocean conditions (475μatm pCO2, 28.1°C; confirmed by autonomous sensors deployed at our study site). Abundance of wax ester, triacylglycerol, and phospholipids as well as traits of physiological status were measured before and after incubations. High temperature and pCO2 conditions did not elicit changes in wax ester composition of larvae. Triacylglycerol content increased with temperature but was not sensitive to pCO2. In general, larvae consumed more total lipid and protein in response to conditions of warming but not high pCO2, and the day the larvae were released often played a large role in the biological patterns observed. Our results suggest that future ocean warming may influence some organismal properties of coral larvae. High pCO2 may not have a strong effect on the physiology of this early life history stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acauliflower 3acoral reefs 3acorals 3aenergy 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3aocean acidification 3aphospholipids 3aphysiological state 3aseawater 3aswimming 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols 0aOA 0aT 0aLTLC 0aHTLC 0aLTHC 0aHTHC 0aWE 0aTG 0aPL 0aAT 0aOcean acidification 0aOcean warming 0aCoral larvae 0aLipid 0aWax ester1 aHofmann, Gretchen E.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 473 p.43-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03767naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005200155245016800207520204800375592002802423650001602451650001502467650002202482650001302504650001602517650001902533650001602552650001202568650001302580650001102593650002302604650001702627650001702644650002802661650001402689650000902703650001402712650002402726650002302750650001402773650001902787650002102806650000902827653001202836700001302848700001602861700001902877700001302896700001802909700005402927700001802981773009102999856009003090852000903180655001203189IND60672159120221122010256.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067215912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1250392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ding1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6721-668010aDiscovery of a novel native bacterium of Providencia sp. with high biosorption and oxidation ability of manganese for bioleaching of heavy metal contaminated soils  aHeavy metal removal from contaminated soils is a long-term challenging problem important for global economics, environment, and human health. Marine and freshwater-originated Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria are considered as the promising bioremediation agents for environmental applications. However, practical application of soil-originated Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria remains to be developed for contaminated soil remediation. In this work, the Mn(II) biosorption/oxidation mechanism of a new soil-originated bacterium and its bioleaching efficiency of heavy metals from soils was studied in detail. First, we found, isolated and identified a new highly Mn(II)-tolerant bacterial strain Providencia sp. LLDRA6 from heavy metal-contaminated soils. Next, strain LLDRA6 demonstrated its high Mn(II) biosorption capacity in aqueous solution. Then, Mn(II) adsorption by LLDRA6 was largely proven to be a synergistic effect of (i) Mn(II) precipitation on the cell surface, (ii) oxidation of Mn(II) into BioMnOₓ on the cell surface, and (iii) intracellular accumulation of insoluble MnCO₃. Finally, combination bioleaching by the bacterium of Providencia sp. LLDRA6 and its formed BioMnOₓ was proposed to develop a potential environment-friendly and cost-effective technique to remediate severely heavy metal-contaminated soils. The bioleaching tests demonstrated that the combination of Providencia sp. LLDRA6 and BioMnOₓ exhibited an excellent removal efficiency for heavy metals of Pb (81.72%), Cr (88.29%), Cd (90.34%), Cu (91.25%), Mn (56.13%), and Zn (59.83%) from contaminated soils, resulting in an increase of removal efficiency in the range of 1.68–26.4% compared to Providencia sp. LLDRA6 alone. Moreover, the bacterial leachate facilitated the residual fraction of metals to transform into the easily migratory fractions in soils. These findings have demonstrated that strain LLDRA6 has high adsorption ability to remove heavy metals from contaminated soils, thus providing a promising bio-adsorbent for environmental bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProvidencia 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abacteria 3abioleaching 3abioremediation 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3acost effectiveness 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ainternational economics 3aleachates 3alead 3amanganese 3amanganese carbonate 3amigratory behavior 3aoxidation 3apolluted soils 3asoil remediation 3azinc 0aBioMnOx1 aLi, Ruyi1 aDing, Zhexu1 aRuan, Xiaofang1 aLuo, Jun1 aChen, Jinyuan1 aZheng, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1547-36121 aTang, Jianxin0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 241 p.125039-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1250393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245016300164500001400327520121500341592002801556650002201584650002101606650002601627650002901653650001301682650001901695650001201714650001201726650001201738650001801750650001701768650001901785650001801804650001301822650001701835650001101852650001001863650001601873653003301889653002901922653001801951700001701969700001801986773011302004856008602117852000902203655001202212IND60724257720221119075306.0210226e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1259222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Kai10aDendritic fibrous nanosilica loaded chitosan for improving water vapor permeability and antibacterial properties of waterborne polyurethane acrylate membranes  aNAL-light  aFunctional membranes with both water vapor permeability (WVP) and antibacterial properties are not only important in scientific research but are also increasingly required by leather applications. However, creating polymer membranes with both of these properties is still a significant challenge. In this work, dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS) loaded with chitosan (CS) nanoparticles was mixed with waterborne polyurethane acrylate (WPUA) to prepare DFNS@CS/WPUA membranes via in-situ polymerization. Due to the high surface area, V-shaped pore structure, large pore volume and guest molecule accessibility of DFNS, the chitosan was well-encapsulated and showed good dispersibility. As a result, the WPUA/DFNS@CS hybrid membrane not only exhibited a clear increase in WVP, from 121.8 g/m²·24 h to 278.8 g/m²·24 h, but also showed outstanding antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus niger. In addition, the stress of the membrane increased from 27.3 MPa to 35.9 MPa and its water resistance also improved. This study demonstrates a new method for preparing multifunctional membranes with potential applications in wearable fabrics and leather coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3achitosan 3adispersibility 3afabrics 3ahybrids 3aleather 3ananoparticles 3apermeability 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3aresearch 3asurface area 3avolume 3awater 3awater vapor 0aDendritic fibrous nanosilica 0aWater vapor permeability 0aAntibacterial1 aLiu, Chenyan1 aMa, Jianzhong0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 291 p.125922-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1259223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03510naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245015400174300001600328520223100344592002802575650001902603650002402622650001502646650002502661650001002686650001202696651001102708653001602719653001902735653001102754653001602765653001502781653001302796700002102809700002302830700002202853773013202875856008403007852000903091655001203100IND60539660220221118022902.0190318e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053966022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2015.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarpovich, Shawna A.10aCombined physiological and behavioral observations to assess the influence of vessel encounters on harbor seals in glacial fjords of southeast Alaska  ap. 110-120.  aMost studies examining disturbance of seals define disturbance as entry into the water. However, behavior alone may not be an accurate indicator of the timing, magnitude, or physiological cost of disturbances. This study examines changes in harbor seal heart rates in response to two levels of vessel disturbances; 1) ‘incidental traffic’ defined as presence of vessels in the area while seals were hauled out; and 2) ‘experimental disturbance’ defined as direct vessel approaches to seals until the seal entered the water. Incidental traffic resulted in a 4bpmvessel−1 increase in heart rate while seals were hauled out. Mean incidental traffic during haulouts was 0.26 (range 0 to 8.95) vessels, and small vessels caused the largest increase in heart rate. Experimental disturbances resulted in a 5bpm increase in heart rate upon initiation of vigilance, defined as the head-lift behavior. In-water heart rate was significantly lower after an experimental disturbance compared to other water entries, suggesting that seals shift to an energetically conservative mode in response to disturbances. During the haulout following an experimental disturbance, seal heart rate was significantly higher than other haulouts, suggesting that there is an added energetic cost of disturbance. Also, sex, mass, current and previous haul-out duration, in-water duration, day of year, hour of day, ambient temperature, and light level were found to have significant influence on harbor seal heart rates; demonstrating that a complex assortment of factors affect heart rate and careful consideration of these factors must be included in disturbance studies. Whereas previous findings have shown that vessel encounters alter seal behavior, this study presents evidence that encounters have energetic and physiological consequences while the seals are hauled out and these consequences persist for some time after the water entry behavior. Accordingly, exposure of harbor seals to increased vessel traffic may result in altered behavior, increased energetic expenditures, and increased exposure to stress, negatively affecting the health, condition, and reproductive success of harbor seal populations that reside in glacial fjords.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoca vitulina 3aambient temperature 3aheart rate 3areproductive success 3aseals 3atraffic 3aAlaska 0aHarbor seal 0aPhoca vitulina 0aVessel 0aDisturbance 0aHeart rate 0aBehavior1 aSkinner, John P.1 aMondragon, Jeff E.1 aBlundell, Gail M.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 473 p.110-120dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2015.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001200172245006500184300001600249520147600265592002801741650001901769650001201788650001501800650002001815650001501835650001401850650004301864650001501907650002201922650001201944650001601956650001501972650001501987650002702002650001402029650002902043650005102072650002702123650003902150650001302189650002202202650004502224650002002269650003602289700001502325700002002340700001702360773008302377856008902460852000902549655001202558IND4466398520221120052014.0141110e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446639852DNAL7 a210742452pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cun10aResidues and dynamics of pymetrozine in rice field ecosystem  ap. 901-904.  aThe fate of pymetrozine was studied in rice field ecosystem, and a simple and reliable analytical method for determination of pymetrozine in soil, rice straw, paddy water and brown rice was developed. Pymetrozine residues were extracted from samples, cleaned up by solid phase extraction (SPE) and then determined by high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI–MS–MS). The average recovery was 81.2–88.1% from soil, 83.4–88.6% from rice straw, 87.3–94.1% from paddy water and 82.9–85.3% from brown rice. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 15%. The limits of detection (LODs) of pymetrozine calculated as a sample concentration were 0.0003mgkg⁻¹ (mg L⁻¹) for soil and paddy water, 0.001mgkg⁻¹ for brown rice and rice straw. The results of kinetics study of pymetrozine residue showed that pymetrozine degradation in water, soil, and rice straw coincided with C=0.194e⁻⁰.⁹⁸⁶ᵗ, C=0.044e⁻⁰.⁰⁹⁹ᵗ, and C=0.988e⁻⁰.⁷⁸⁰ᵗ, respectively; the half-lives were about 0.70d, 7.0d and 0.89d, respectively. The degradation rate of pymetrozine in water was the fastest, followed by rice straw. The highest final pymetrozine residues in brown rice were 0.01mgkg⁻¹, which was lower than the EU’s upper limit of 0.02mgkg⁻¹ in rice. Therefore, a dosage of 300–600ga.i.hm⁻² was recommended, which could be considered as safe to human beings and animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanimals 3abrown rice 3adetection limit 3aecosystems 3ahalf life 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3apaddies 3apymetrozine 3arice straw 3asoil water 3asolid phase extraction 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aInsecticidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aKinetics 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aTriazinesxanalysisxchemistry.1 aYang, Ting1 aHuangfu, Weiguo1 aWu, Yinliang0 tChemosphere.g2011 Feb., v. 82, no. 6 p.901-904dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008500172300001600257520114300273592002801416650001901444650001701463650001201480650002201492650001101514650002901525650001701554650001001571650001901581650002401600700001901624700001901643700002601662773008901688856008501777852000901862655001201871IND60635159620221122030046.0190425e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063515962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimeoni, Patrizia10aIntegrating industrial waste heat recovery into sustainable smart energy systems  ap. 941-951.  aTo achieve the EU climate and energy objectives, a transition towards a future sustainable energy system is needed. The integration of the huge potential for industrial waste heat recovery into smart energy system represents a main opportunity to accomplish these goals. To successfully implement this strategy, all the several stakeholders' conflicting objectives should be considered. In this paper an evolutionary multi-objective optimization model is developed to perform a sustainability evaluation of an energy system involving an industrial facility as the waste heat source and the neighbourhood as district heating network end users. An Italian case study of heat recovery from a steel casting facility shows how the model allows to properly select the district heating network set of users to fully exploit the available waste energy. Design directions such as the thermal energy storage capacity can be also provided. Moreover, the model enables the analysis of the trade-off between the stakeholders’ different perspectives, allowing to identify possible win-win solutions for both the industrial sector and the citizenship.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acase studies 3aclimate 3aindustrial wastes 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3astakeholders 3asteel 3athermal energy 3awaste heat recovery1 aCiotti, Gellio1 aCottes, Mattia1 aMeneghetti, Antonella0 tEnergy.g2019 May 15, v. 175 p.941-951dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.03.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03966naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245019200206500001900398520239100417592002802808650001502836650001702851650001702868650001602885650001602901650001202917650002002929650004002949650002402989650001903013650001803032650002503050653001703075653002203092653004103114653001503155653001703170653002803187700007303215700001803288773011103306856008203417852000903499655001203508IND60707394920221121110852.0200913e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070739492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOchtyra, Adrian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4799-809310aThreshold- and trend-based vegetation change monitoring algorithm based on the inter-annual multi-temporal normalized difference moisture index series: A case study of the Tatra Mountains  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNumerous algorithms are used in remote sensing to detect changes in vegetation. Majority of them require several tunable parameters or can only detect abrupt forest disturbances. The aim of this study was to develop a new threshold- and trend-based vegetation change monitoring algorithm (TVCMA) that can detect abrupt and gradual changes in vegetation within forested and non-forested areas. To test the algorithm, the Polish and Slovak Tatra Mountains were used as the study area. Strong winds and bark beetle outbreaks (BBOs) are the primary causes of vegetation disturbances in this region. An annual time series of vegetation indices from 1984 to 2016 was used as the input. The long time span necessitated the use of scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fifty-one images were atmospherically and topographically corrected. The collected in situ data included the chlorophyll content, leaf area index, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and spectral signatures of non-forest vegetation, dwarf pine, and forest stands in 190 sample plots. To select the vegetation indices (VIs) most suitable for disturbance detection, ten satellite-based VIs were correlated with the acquired field data. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) was found to be more sensitive to vegetation disturbances and more resistant to data noise than any other tested index. The TVCMA uses two separate approaches, namely, thresholding, which indicates where and when the disturbances occurred, and a regression analysis, which presents the general trend in the time series for each pixel. The number of detected disturbances, the Spearman's correlation coefficient between the modeled trend line and satellite observations, and p-values were calculated. Different threshold values were tested to identify the value that yielded the most accurate results. By using 200 randomly selected validation points, we achieved an 83.3% producer's accuracy for disturbances (PAD), 46.3% user's accuracy for disturbances (UAD), and 97.8% overall accuracy (OA). These results confirm the potential of TVCMA for monitoring abrupt and gradual changes in vegetation. Moreover, the simplicity and data-driven character of the proposed algorithm make it suitable for multi-temporal analyses of other types of satellite data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abark beetles 3acase studies 3achlorophyll 3aenvironment 3aforests 3aleaf area index 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3athematic maps 3atime series analysis 0aIn situ data 0aVegetation change 0aNormalized difference moisture index 0aRegression 0aThresholding 0aMulti-temporal analysis1 aMarcinkowska-Ochtyra, Adriana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9080-38991 aRaczko, Edwin0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Nov., v. 249 p.112026-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01904naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245005000165300001300215520097900228592002801207650002801235650001501263653003001278653002201308653002401330653002001354700001901374773011801393856008201511852000901593655001201602IND60610023020221116163830.0180824e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061002302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2016.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, Tyrus10aDensity estimation on manifolds with boundary  ap. 1-17.  aDensity estimation is a crucial component of many machine learning methods, and manifold learning in particular, where geometry is to be constructed from data alone. A significant practical limitation of the current density estimation literature is that methods have not been developed for manifolds with boundary, except in simple cases of linear manifolds where the location of the boundary is assumed to be known. This limitation is overcome by developing a density estimation method for manifolds with boundary that does not require any prior knowledge of the location of the boundary. To construct an appropriate estimator, statistics are introduced that provably approximate the distance and direction of the boundary, which allows us to apply a cut-and-normalize boundary correction. Then, multiple cut-and-normalize estimators are used to build a consistent kernel density estimator that has uniform bias, at interior and boundary points, on manifolds with boundary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3astatistics 0aKernel density estimation 0aManifold learning 0aBoundary correction 0aGeometric prior1 aSauer, Timothy0 tComputational statistics & data analysis.g2017 Mar., v. 107 p.1-17dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3109x0167-94737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2016.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01548naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013200162300001800294520051600312592002800828650002500856650001500881650002300896650002300919650002200942700002600964700003100990700002501021773010401046856007501150852000901225655001201234IND60578684120180316000000.0170813e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057868412DNAL7 a10.1021/ol40084752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastelli, Riccardo10a2,2-Dimethyl-4-(4-methoxy-phenoxy) butanoate and 2,2-Dimethyl-4-azido Butanoate: Two New Pivaloate-ester-like Protecting Groups  ap. 2270-2273.  aThe title compounds were developed to extend the available orthogonalities within the class of protecting groups removed by assisted cleavage.

In this study, we developed an algorithm to estimate Rᵣₛ(41×) and Rᵣₛ(443) when the satellite Rᵣₛ(λ) in blue bands suffer from large uncertainties. The algorithm first determines the Rᵣₛ(λ) spectral shape from the satellite-measured Rᵣₛ(λ) values at three wavelengths of 48× (486, 488, or 490), 55× (547, 551, or 555), and 67× (667, 670, or 671) nm. The algorithm then derives Rᵣₛ(41×) and Rᵣₛ(443) from the estimated Rᵣₛ(λ) spectral shape with algebraic formulations. We assessed the algorithm performance with satellite (SeaWiFS, MODISA, and VIIRS-SNPP) and in situ Rᵣₛ(λ) matchups from global waters. It is shown that the uncertainties of estimated Rᵣₛ(41×) and Rᵣₛ(443) are substantially smaller than the original satellite products when applicable. Besides, implementation of the algorithm contributes to a significant increase in the number of utilizable Rᵣₛ(41×) and Rᵣₛ(443) values. The algorithm is relatively stable and is best applicable to the satellite Rᵣₛ(λ) spectra for which the Rᵣₛ(48×) and Rᵣₛ(55×) measurements are subject to small uncertainties. The demonstrations support the application of the blue-band estimation algorithm to a wide range of coastal waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3aenvironment 3areflectance 3asatellites 0aRemote sensing reflectance 0aBlue bands 0aSpectral shape 0aAtmospheric correction 0aSeaWiFS 0aMODIS 0aVIIRS1 aYu, Xiaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2813-08541 aLee, ZhongPing,1 aWang, Menghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7019-31251 aJiang, Lide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9883-44110 tRemote sensing of environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 250 p.112029-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.1120293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245014900169520162500318592002801943650004401971650002302015650002202038650003702060650001202097650001302109650002102122650002202143650003702165650001802202650000902220650001602229650001202245650001302257650001402270650003302284650001602317650003702333653001702370653002602387653001102413653001402424653002302438700001702461700005802478700001302536700001702549773009102566856009002657852000902747655001202756IND60672159420221121235529.0191231e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067215942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1250442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kun10aAqueous Cr(VI) removal by a novel ball milled Fe0-biochar composite: Role of biochar electron transfer capacity under high pyrolysis temperature  aA novel ball milled Fe⁰-biochar composite was synthesized by ball milling the mixture of biochar (pyrolyzed at 300 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C) and micron grade iron powder. FTIR, SEM, TEM-EDS, XRD, and XPS were applied to characterize this composite. XRD results showed that iron carbide phase was formed during the ball milling process. The ability of this synthesized composited to remove aqueous Cr(VI) was tested. Removal rates of Cr(VI) (49.6%, 65.8%, and 97.8%, respectively) by ball milled Fe⁰-biochar composite consisting of biochar pyrolyzed at 300 °C (300BMFe⁰-BC), 500 °C (500BMFe⁰-BC), and 700 °C (700BMFe⁰-BC) were much higher than those (19%, 11%, and 4%, respectively) by pristine biochar pyrolyzed at 300 °C (300BC), 500 °C (500BC), and 700 °C (700BC). Cr(VI) removal rate by 700BMFe⁰-BC increased from 15.4% to 97.8% when prolonging ball milling time from 6 h to 48 h. Ball milling promoted the combination of Fe⁰ and biochar as well as reduced the hydrodynamic diameter of the composite. Acidic conditions favored Cr(VI) removal. Ball milling exposed the functional groups of biochar and improved its Cr(VI) removal rate. Raman spectra showed that the degree of graphitization in 700 °C ball milled biochar (700BMBC) was the highest. Electrochemical analysis demonstrated that 700BMBC had the highest electron transfer capacity. In the presence of Fe⁰, graphitized structure in 700BMBC acted as an electron conductor, facilitating electron transfer from Fe⁰ to Cr(VI). Ball milling also destroyed the surface iron oxide layer to regenerate the composite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiochar 3achromium 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3ahydrodynamics 3airon 3airon oxides 3amilling 3amoieties 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aBall milling 0aFe0-biochar composite 0aCr(VI) 0aReduction 0aElectron conductor1 aSun, Yuebing1 aTang, Jingchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7633-17011 aHe, Juan1 aSun, Hongwen0 tChemosphere.g2020 Feb., v. 241 p.125044-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.1250443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007200171300001600243520147100259536018501730592002801915596001701943596007401960596007802034596004702112650002502159650002102184650001802205650002302223650001902246650002202265650001002287650002302297650002002320650002302340650001302363650003002376650001002406650002402416650001802440650002702458650001902485650001302504650001902517650002402536650002902560653001302589653001802602653002202620653002102642700002102663700002402684773012602708856008502834852000902919655001202928IND60689224220221120044838.0200420e20170217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922422DNAL7 a10.1080/07388551.2016.12717672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbuQamar, Synan10aMechanisms and strategies of plant defense against Botrytis cinerea  ap. 262-274.  aBiotic factors affect plant immune responses and plant resistance to pathogen infections. Despite the considerable progress made over the past two decades in manipulating genes, proteins and their levels from diverse sources, no complete genetic tolerance to environmental stresses has been developed so far in any crops. Plant defense response to pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea, is a complex biological process involving various changes at the biochemical, molecular (i.e. transcriptional) and physiological levels. Once a pathogen is detected, effective plant resistance activates signaling networks through the generation of small signaling molecules and the balance of hormonal signaling pathways to initiate defense mechanisms to the particular pathogen. Recently, studies using Arabidopsis thaliana and crop plants have shown that many genes are involved in plant responses to B. cinerea infection. In this article, we will review our current understanding of mechanisms regulating plant responses to B. cinerea with a particular interest on hormonal regulatory networks involving phytohormones salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET) and abscisic acid (ABA). We will also highlight some potential gene targets that are promising for improving crop resistance to B. cinerea through genetic engineering and breeding programs. Finally, the role of biological control as a complementary and alternative disease management will be overviewed.  aThis work was supported by the UAEU Program for Advanced Research (Grant #: 21S091); and the Khalifa Center for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering-UAEU (Grant #: 31R081) to SAQ.  aPublisher supplied data  a21S091cUAEU  a31R081cKhalifa Center for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering-UAEU  a31R081cThe Khalifa Center for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering-UAEU  a21S091cUAEU Program for Advanced Research 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aabscisic acid 3abiological control 3abiotic factors 3abreeding programs 3acrops 3adefense mechanisms 3adisease control 3adisease resistance 3aethylene 3afungal diseases of plants 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3ajasmonic acid 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant response 3aproteins 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 0ahormones 0aplant defense 0astress resistance 0atransgenic crops1 aMoustafa, Khaled1 aTran, Lam-son Phan,0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2017 Feb. 17, v. 37, no. 2 p.262-274dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2016.12717673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010900169500002200278520180900300592002802109650003002137650001102167650002502178650002202203650001702225650002102242650002002263650002102283650001702304650001702321653001902338653002002357653002102377653002102398653002102419700002402440700002702464700002202491700002002513700002102533700002102554773010102575856008302676852000902759655001202768IND60777178620221119144753.0220523s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077717862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAware, Chetan B.10aNatural bioactive products as promising therapeutics: A review of natural product-based drug development  aPre-press version  aSince ancient times, natural medicines have had paramount importance in bolstering biotherapeutics to treat various diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) revealed that more than 80% of the population of developing countries relies on traditional medicines, predominately herbal medicine, for their immediate medications. The drugs derived from medicinal plants have tremendous diversity with superfluous potency for managing communicable and non-communicable diseases, which diminishes the burden of modern pharmacopoeias in low and middle-developed countries. With the increasing importance and prevalence of herbal drugs, the appropriate evaluations are being implemented for their utilization. Most herbal medicines are prescribed by practical shreds of evidence and recommended in crude and semi-standardized forms. The inadequacy in pharmacological evaluation, preclinical and clinical examination of herbal drugs impedes their integration into contemporary medicinal practices. The preclinical investigation, prominently in-vivo and in-vitro studies, explores various attributes consisting of cell cytotoxicity, cell-cell interactions, intracellular activity, cell-environment interaction, gene expression studies, and metabolomics fingerprints of induced natural drugs. These pre-clinical evaluations and robust evidence consent to the safe and long-term utilization of herbal medicine to treat hideous diseases. Further, several modern practises are being considered for the precise and effective production of bioactive compounds at the commercial level. With this connection, this review illustrates the prominent sources of natural drugs, their pre-clinical assessments, the development of active drug molecules, and their commercialization in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3abotany 3aclinical examination 3acommercialization 3acytotoxicity 3adrug development 3agene expression 3aherbal medicines 3ametabolomics 3atherapeutics 0aBioprospecting 0aBiotherapeutics 0aChronic diseases 0aDrug development 0aNatural products1 aPatil, Devashree N.1 aSuryawanshi, Suresh S.1 aMali, Pratibha R.1 aRane, Manali R.1 aGurav, Ranjit G.1 aJadhav, Jyoti P.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022, dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013700155300001600292500002000308520165300328592002801981650001002009650001402019651001402033700002102047700005502068700002302123700002002146773010202166856007402268852000902342655001202351IND60787249820221116154700.0220808e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078724982DNAL7 a10.1002/tax.122822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhen10aPhylogenetic reconstruction of Ficus subg. Synoecia and its allies (Moraceae), with implications on the origin of the climbing habit  ap. 927-945.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe infrageneric classification of Ficus (Moraceae) has raised concerns since Berg put forward his six subgenera system. Molecular analyses have revealed some unnatural groups within this system. The status of F. subg. Synoecia and the relationships between this subgenus and its allies are among the major challenges facing classification within the genus. To resolve these problems, we reconstructed the phylogenetic trees with three nuclear markers from 147 ingroup taxa (including approximately half of F. subg. Synoecia species and three‐fifths of F. subg. Ficus) and implemented ancestral area and life‐form reconstructions to trace the evolutionary history. Results showed that F. subg. Synoecia and F. subg. Ficus (except F. subsect. Ficus) constituted a well‐supported monophylum, which is sister to F. subg. Terega. This monophylum comprises two clades: one clade covers F. subsect. Frutescentiae of F. sect. Ficus and F. subsect. Plagiostigma of F. sect. Pogonotrophe, and the other covers F. sect. Eriosycea, F. sect. Apiosycea and the rest of F. sect. Pogonotrophe. Ancestral area reconstruction revealed that the first clade has a distinct origin in East Asia, but the second one shows fewer obvious signs. Ancestral life‐form reconstruction suggested that the climbing habit, a key trait used to divide F. subg. Ficus and F. subg.

It argues that farm animals have started to occupy a central position in landscape studies, opening up many new pastures for research. Using the example of cattle in the UK, we consider how livestock have been understood as text, as social constructions and as beings with their own lives. In each case, we note how the position of farm animals is contested and there is a need for a diversity of theoretical approaches to understand these differences. The article calls for academics, practitioners and policy-makers to pay greater attention to the myriad ways in which livestock and landscape are intertwined.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3agrazing 3alandscape position 3alandscapes 3apastures 3aUnited Kingdom 0aLivestock 0alandscape 0asocial constructions 0apost-human 0ahybridity1 aYarwood, Richard0 tLandscape research.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 38, no. 4 p.404-420dRoutledgex1469-97107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2012.7306113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03172naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245014400152300001800296520163100314592002801945650002201973650001001995650002502005650001402030650001302044650002502057650001602082650001302098650001702111650001602128650001902144650001702163650001902180650001802199650002402217650001002241650001202251650002402263650002202287650002302309650002502332700001302357700001302370700001502383700001702398700001702415773012602432856007502558852000902633655001202642IND60783278620221122225601.0220719e20220718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078327862DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo04212b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tao10aAntifibrotic effect of AD-1 on lipopolysaccharide-mediated fibroblast injury in L929 cells and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice  ap. 7650-7665.  a20(R)-25-methoxyl-dammarane-3β,12β,20-triol (25-OCH₃–PPD, AD-1) is a dammarane ginsenoside that is isolated from Panax notoginseng. The present study aimed to explore its anti-pulmonary fibrosis (PF) effect in vitro and in vivo. L929 cells were treated with 10 μg mL⁻¹ lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish a PF model in vitro and mice were administered with 3.5 mg kg⁻¹ bleomycin (BLM) by endotracheal intubation to establish a PF model in vivo for investigating the anti-PF effect and its potential mechanism. The results demonstrated that AD-1 reduced the injury, extracellular matrix (ECM) buildup and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expression levels of L929 induced by LPS. Oral administration of AD-1 downregulated the expression of interleukins (such as IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-18), increased the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), reduced the lung coefficient and the content of hydroxyproline (HYP), and mediated the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio and P-p53, β-catenin and SIRT3 expression in the lung tissue of mice. Furthermore, AD-1 inhibited the expression levels of TGF-β1, TIMP-1 and α-SMA and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition in the lung tissue of PF mice. These results indicated that AD-1 could alleviate PF both in vitro and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism may be related to the decrease in ECM deposition and inflammation, the enhancement of antioxidant capacity, and the mediation of lung cell apoptosis and the TGF-β1/TIMP-1/α-SMA signaling pathway, which provide a theoretical basis for the rehabilitation treatment of PF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax notoginseng 3aactin 3aantioxidant activity 3aapoptosis 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3aginsenosides 3aglutathione 3ahydroxyproline 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3alungs 3amuscles 3aoral administration 3aprotein synthesis 3apulmonary fibrosis 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aChen, Yu1 aLi, Yuan1 aChen, Gang1 aZhao, Yuqing1 aSu, Guangyue0 tFood & function.g2022 July 18, v. 13, no. 14 p.7650-7665dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo04212b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03391naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245012600173300001500299520158100314592002801895650001101923650001701934650001601951650002701967650001101994650001502005650001802020650001502038650001202053650000902065650002202074650006602096650000702162650001602169650001602185650001602201650002302217650001102240650001902251650002302270650001102293650000902304653003402313653003402347653002102381653002202402700001902424700002302443700002202466700002002488700001802508700002202526700003302548700001902581773007102600856008502671852000902756655001202765IND60545085020221119152857.0161019e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054508502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurtović, Tihana10aVaSP1, catalytically active serine proteinase from Vipera ammodytes ammodytes venom with unconventional active site triad  ap. 93-104.  aVaSP1, a serine proteinase from Vipera ammodytes ammodytes venom, is a glycosylated monomer of 31.5 kDa, as determined by MALDI mass spectrometry, showing multiple isoelectric points between pH 6.5 and pH 8.5. Partial amino acid sequencing of VaSP1 by Edman degradation and MS/MS analysis identified sequences which allowed its classification among the so-called snake venom serine proteinase homologues, members of the peptidase S1 family, however being devoid of the canonical catalytic triad. Only few representatives of this group have been identified so far with just two of them characterised in detail at the protein level. Despite substitution of His57 with Arg, VaSP1 possesses proteolytic activity which can be inhibited by Pefabloc, benzamidine, Zn2+ ions, DTT and trypsin inhibitor II, a Kunitz/BPTI group member. It hydrolyses Nα-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-p-NA, exhibiting Michaelis–Menten behaviour with Km = 48.2 μM and Vm = 0.019 nM s−1. The pH for optimal activity on tested substrate is around 9.0. VaSP1 also cleaves insulin B-chain, digesting it at positions His10-Leu11, Ala14-Leu15 and Tyr16-Leu17. Furthermore, the novel serine proteinase is active towards wide array of proteins involved in haemostasis where its degradation of fibrinogen, fibrin, prothrombin, factor X and plasminogen in vivo probably results in depletion of coagulation factors in blood circulation. The possibility that VaSP1 possesses anticoagulant properties has been further indicated by its ability to prolong prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVipera 3aactive sites 3aamino acids 3aanticoagulant activity 3afibrin 3afibrinogen 3aglycosylation 3ahemostasis 3ainsulin 3aions 3aisoelectric point 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3apH 3aplasminogen 3aproteolysis 3aprothrombin 3aserine proteinases 3asnakes 3athromboplastin 3atrypsin inhibitors 3avenoms 3azinc 0aSnake venom serine proteinase 0aNon-canonical catalytic triad 0aVipera ammodytes 0aMass spectrometry1 aBrgles, Marija1 aLeonardi, Adrijana1 aLang Balija, Maja1 aSajevic, Tamara1 aKrižaj, Igor1 aAllmaier, Günter1 aMarchetti-Deschmann, Martina1 aHalassy, Beata0 tToxicon.g2014 Jan., v. 77 p.93-104dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245006100177300001600238520138000254592002801634650001101662650001801673650002601691650001001717650001301727650001201740650001101752650001601763650001901779651000901798700002201807773008001829856008601909852000901995655001202004IND60085031820221119120443.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008503182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilera, Roberto F.10aModeling primary energy substitution in the Asia Pacific  ap. 219-224.  aA Global Energy Market model (GEM) is used to analyze the market shares (i.e. the primary energy mix) of gases, liquids and solids in the Asia Pacific. The model is successful in matching the historical energy mix from 1850 to 2009. The model also provides a good match of the hydrogen to carbon ratio, which is a proxy for environmental quality. Given these validations, the GEM is then used to present scenarios of the Asia Pacific energy mix and hydrogen to carbon ratio until the year 2030. Three energy mix scenarios are presented – reference case; alternative case 1; alternative case 2. The reference case assumes limited divergence from current policies and technologies. It indicates that Asia Pacific energy needs will be met by approximately 46% solids, 34% liquids, and 20% gases by 2030. Alternative cases 1 and 2 represent policies and technologies that either encourage or discourage the use of gases. The good matches observed for historical data suggest the GEM can be used cautiously for evaluating outcomes and opportunities in the region. Although the model can be used for projecting far into the future, it is currently calibrated to what we consider a reasonable time horizon – until the year 2030. Given appropriate energy policies and sufficient technological advancement, the importance of natural gas in the region could increase significantly.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental quality 3agases 3ahydrogen 3amarkets 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aprimary energy 3aAsia1 aRipple, Ronald D.0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.219-224dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009300158520087700251592002801128650001701156650001101173650002101184650003301205650002801238650002201266651001001288700001801298700001401316700001601330773012601346856007301472852000901545655001201554IND60651786020221119123454.0190712e20160318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065178602DNAL7 a10.3390/su80302702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Xuedong10aSustainable Urban Development Capacity Measure—A Case Study in Jiangsu Province, China  aMeasuring the success of sustainable urban development has been difficult in the past.

First, PCA is used to extract the main components that affect a city’s sustainable development capacity. Then, the actual sustainable development capacity level is measured using Grey TOPSIS, from which the sustainable development capacity measurement value is then calculated. To prove the model’s effectiveness and operability, it is then applied to measure the sustainable development capacity in 13 cities in Jiangsu province, China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3amodel validation 3aprincipal component analysis 3asustainable development 3aurban development 3aChina1 aZhang, Weiwei1 aChen, Lei1 aDeng, Fumin0 tSustainability.g2016 Mar. 18, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80302703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003700151245010000188300001600288520050600304592002800810650001900838650001000857650000900867650001400876650001800890650001500908650000900923650001300932653002500945653001600970653002600986653001401012653002401026700002301050700002201073700001701095773007201112856008501184852000901269655001201278IND60545085120221119152754.0161019e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054508512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalicia Curiel, María Fernanda,10aMast cells respond to urticating extract from lepidoptera larva Morpheis ehrenbergii in the rat  ap. 121-124.  aMast cells and histamine participate in toxic effects of hairs from some caterpillars.

To characterize R-loops in fission yeast, we used the S9.6 antibody-based DRIPc-seq method to sequence the RNA strand of R-loops and obtain strand-specific R-loop maps at near nucleotide resolution. Surprisingly, preliminary DRIPc-seq experiments identified mostly RNase H-resistant but exosome-sensitive RNAs that mapped to both DNA strands and resembled RNA:RNA hybrids (dsRNAs), suggesting that dsRNAs form widely in fission yeast. We confirmed in vitro that S9.6 can immuno-precipitate dsRNAs and provide evidence that dsRNAs can interfere with its binding to R-loops. dsRNA elimination by RNase III treatment prior to DRIPc-seq allowed the genome-wide and strand-specific identification of genuine R-loops that responded in vivo to RNase H levels and displayed classical features associated with R-loop formation. We also found that most transcripts whose levels were altered by in vivo manipulation of RNase H levels did not form detectable R-loops, suggesting that prolonged manipulation of R-loop levels could indirectly alter the transcriptome. We discuss the implications of our work in the design of experimental strategies to probe R-loop functions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aantibodies 3achromatin 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agenome 3amessenger RNA 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aribonucleases 3atranscriptome 0aR-loops 0aS9.6 0adsRNA 0aDRIPc-seq 0aRNAse H1 0adsRNAs 0aIN 0aFT 0aW4 0aIP 0aGO 0aDRIP1 aMalapert, Amélie1 aLegros, Pénélope1 aBernard, Pascal1 aChédin, Frédéric1 aVanoosthuyse, Vincent0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2018 Feb. 02, v. 430, no. 3 p.272-284dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2017.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245013800174520104000312592002801352653001501380653002201395653001501417653001201432653001301444653001501457700006001472700002601532700002301558700002001581773010601601856008801707852000901795655001201804IND60661506320221119081326.0200106e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066150632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCipro, Caio V.Z.10aDo population parameters influence the role of seabird colonies as secondary pollutants source? A case study for Antarctic ecosystems  aPollutants in Antarctic ecosystems are largely attributed to long range atmospheric transport. However, previous studies confirmed seabird colonies as relevant secondary sources of organic and inorganic pollutants. When comparing these data, higher trophic level seabird colonies, small and sparse, did not influence results as strongly as lower trophic level birds large dense colonies. Thus, we cross examined results of stable isotopes and pollutants from lichens, moss and soil samples from Antarctic seabird colonies with their data for population parameters to understand how these variables influence each other. Results showed colonies clearly supplying As, Cd, Hg, Se, Zn, HCB and PCBs and corroborated other local sources. Penguin colonies were the most important pollutants sources hereby studied due to their sheer size and also their recent relative growth. Finally, results suggest climate change should likely increase the concentration of contaminants and the overall burden trapped in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPollutants 0aSecondary sources 0aAntarctica 0aSeabird 0aColonies 0aPopulation1 aBustamante, Paco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3877-93901 aMontone, Rosalinda C.1 aOliveira, Lucas C.1 aPetry, Maria V.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Dec., v. 149 p.110534-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245016300175300001600338520071200354592002801066650001501094650001701109650002101126650001101147650001501158650001701173653001601190653000801206653000801214653000901222653000901231653000801240653000701248653002901255653000901284653000901293653000801302653001601310700002101326700001701347773011901364856008101483852000901564655001201573IND60628943620221120103601.0190131e20190104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062894362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2018.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayavaradhan, Rajeswari12aA Versatile Tool for the Quantification of CRISPR/Cas9-Induced Genome Editing Events in Human Hematopoietic Cell Lines and Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells  ap. 102-110.  aThe efficient site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) created by CRISPR/Cas9 has revolutionized genome engineering and has great potential for editing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs).

Yet, their global patterns and ecology remain far less studied, limiting our capacity to identify the main environmental drivers of these important organisms across biomes. To fill this knowledge gap, we analysed topsoils from 235 terrestrial ecosystems across and within globally distributed climate groups (i.e. dry, temperate and continental). We found that soils are important repositories of black yeasts, and that ultraviolet light, fine soil texture, and precipitation seasonality are the most consistent environmental factors associated with their diversity across biomes. Finally, we identified Exophiala and Cladophialophora as the most dominant black yeasts genera in soils across the globe. These findings provide novel evidence of global distribution of black yeasts and their key environmental predictors, giving new insights for speculating the evolution and spreading of these extreme‐tolerant organisms throughout both natural and human associated extreme environments.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP190103714cAustralian research Council  aP20_00879cJunta de Andalucía  aPID2020‐115813RA‐I00cSpanish Ministry of Science and Innovation 3aExophiala 3aclimate 3ageographical distribution 3ahumans 3asoil texture 3aultraviolet radiation1 aSelbmann, Laura1 aSingh, Brajesh K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4413-41851 aDelgado‐Baquerizo, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6499-576X0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2022 Apr., v. 24, no. 4 p.1988-1999dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.159693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009200167300001400259520111600273592002801389650002101417650002901438650001901467650001901486650002201505650000801527650001801535650001501553650001101568650001401579650001901593650001801612650001501630653002901645653001701674653002101691653001101712653001301723653001101736700001501747700001401762700002001776700001601796700001501812773011201827856008601939852000902025655001202034IND60611947120221122050039.0180911e20190105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061194712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.08.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Shuang10aEffect of dissolved organic matter fractions on photodegradation of phenanthrene in ice  ap. 30-36.  aThe effect of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions on photodegradation of phenanthrene (PHE) in ice was investigated. DOM in surface water and wastewater samples was fractionated using XAD-8/XAD-4 resins into five fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The photodegradation rate of PHE in ice was about 40% greater than that in water. The screening effect and quenching effect contributed 3–12% and 88–97% toward the inhibition of DOM fractions on PHE photodegradation in ice, respectively. The contribution ratios of singlet oxygen (¹O2) and hydroxyl radical (OH) produced from DOM fractions to PHE photodegradation rates in ice were 9–31% and 2–13%, respectively. Among five DOM fractions, HPO-A was most efficient in advancing PHE photodegradation in ice through ¹O2 mechanism. When excluding the photosensitized effect of ¹O2 and OH produced from DOM fractions, the quencing effect of DOM fractions on PHE photodegradation in ice was closely related to their PHE binding ability.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3adissolved organic matter 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aice 3aphenanthrenes 3aphotolysis 3aresins 3ascreening 3asinglet oxygen 3asurface water 3awastewater 0aDissolved organic matter 0aPhenanthrene 0aPhotodegradation 0aIn ice 0aQuencing 0aEffect1 aSun, Jijun1 aLiu, Ying1 aZhang, Zhaohong1 aLin, Yingzi1 aLiu, Qiang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Jan. 05, v. 361 p.30-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.08.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02298naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245012400169520122100293592002801514653001301542653001801555653000901573653002301582653001301605700001801618700002001636700001901656700001701675700001601692700001701708700002001725773010601745856008801851852000901939655001201948IND60661506620221119081459.0200106e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066150662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ling14aThe benthic fluxes of nutrients and the potential influences of sediment on the eutrophication in Daya Bay, South China  aNutrient concentrations in porewater and their benthic fluxes were investigated in Daya Bay, South China, to study the accumulation and transfer of nutrients at sediment-water interface, as well as the impact of human activities on nutrients. The contributions of sediment to nutrients in water column and the potential influences on eutrophication were also discussed. Nutrients in porewater and overlying water changed in different seasons and areas, which was mainly attributed to human activities, hydrodynamic force and biogeochemical conditions. Mean concentrations of DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen), PO₄ and SiO₃ were 70 ± 61, 3.1 ± 4.3, 103 ± 105 μmol/L, and 234 ± 166, 15.6 ± 4.0, 353 ± 48 μmol/L in overlying water and porewater, respectively. Annual mean DIN, PO₄ and SiO₃ fluxes were 330 ± 249, −1.3 ± 16 and 549 ± 301 μmol/(m²d), respectively, indicating that sediment was generally the source of DIN and SiO₃, but was the sink of PO₄.

Consumption of contaminated food and feed can cause a severe health risk to humans and animals. A novel biological method could reduce the health risks of aflatoxins through inhibiting mold growth and binding aflatoxins. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are commonly used in fermented food production. LAB are known to inhibit mold growth and, to some extent, to bind aflatoxins in different matrices. Reduced mold growth and aflatoxin production may be caused by competition for nutrients between bacterial cells and fungi. Most likely, binding of aflatoxins depends on environmental conditions and is strain-specific. Killed bacteria cells possess consistently better binding abilities for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) than viable cells. Lactobacilli especially are relatively well studied and provide noticeable possibilities in binding of aflatoxin B1 and M1 in food. It seems that binding is reversible and that bound aflatoxins are released later on (Haskard et al., 2001; Peltonen et al., 2001). This literature review suggests that novel biological methods, such as lactic acid bacteria, show potential in mitigating toxic effects of aflatoxins in food and feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus 3aaflatoxin B1 3acell viability 3aenvironmental factors 3afermented foods 3afood contamination 3afood production 3afungi 3ahumans 3alactic acid bacteria 3anutrients 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3atoxicity 0aAflatoxin B1 (PubChem CID: 14403) 0aAflatoxin M1 (PubChem CID: 15558498) 0aAF 0aAFB1 0aAFM1 0aA 0aBb 0aCYP 0aCFU 0aDNA 0aELISA 0aEU 0aFAO 0aFB1 0aFB2 0aFDA 0aHACCP 0aHCl 0aLAB 0aLb 0aLc 0aL 0aNaCl 0aMIC 0aPBS 0aP 0aP 0aS 0aW 0aWHO 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aAflatoxins 0aBinding 0aFungal growth1 aJoutsjoki, Vesa1 aKorhonen, Hannu J.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2015 Aug. 17, v. 207 p.87-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.04.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03251naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245019100175300001400366520137000380592002801750650002001778650002201798650002201820650002101842650002801863650001401891650002101905650001801926650001001944650001001954650002101964650001701985650002802002650001102030650002302041650001202064650002802076650002702104650001102131650001402142650001602156650001602172650001302188650002202201653001302223653003602236653002202272653003802294653001402332653002202346700002202368700002702390700002502417700001902442773007002461856008502531852000902616655001202625IND60545085520221119152803.0161019e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054508552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aH., Vishwanathreddy10aSclerotium rolfsii lectin exerts insecticidal activity on Spodoptera litura larvae by binding to membrane proteins of midgut epithelial cells and triggering caspase-3-dependent apoptosis  ap. 47-57.  aThe insect pest Spodoptera litura is considered a major threat to many economically important food and commercial crops. The present study establishes the toxic effects of Sclerotium rolfsii lectin (SRL) against S. litura larvae fed an artificial diet containing the purified lectin. The toxicity of SRL, as determined by feeding assays using different concentrations of the lectin, showed marginal effects on larval growth but a remarkable mortality rate of 68.52 ± 8.48% at the highest lectin concentration, 0.06% (600 μg/g), with an LC50 value of 430 μg/g of artificial diet. SRL is resistant to proteolysis by larval gut proteases even after 24-h incubation. Histochemical studies and western blot analyses of lectin binding revealed the interaction of the lectin with specific membrane glycoproteins on epithelial cells of the midgut. Identification of SRL-interacting midgut membrane proteins using lectin affinity chromatography and ESI-Q-TOF analysis revealed the involvement of these proteins in immunomodulatory responses in insects. Active caspase-3-like activity and DNA fragmentation observed in the midgut epithelial cells of larvae fed a lectin-containing diet supported the mechanism of apoptosis-induced death. These findings suggested that SRL can be a valuable tool in plant biotechnology for developing insect-resistant transgenic crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aDNA fragmentation 3aSpodoptera litura 3aWestern blotting 3aaffinity chromatography 3aapoptosis 3aartificial diets 3abiotechnology 3acrops 3adeath 3aepithelial cells 3ainsect pests 3ainsecticidal properties 3alarvae 3alarval development 3alectins 3alethal concentration 50 3amembrane glycoproteins 3amidgut 3amortality 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3atoxicity 3atransgenic plants 0aToxicity 0aSclerotium rolfsii lectin (SRL) 0aSpodoptera litura 0aGal/GalNAc-specific fungal lectin 0aApoptosis 0aDNA fragmentation1 aBhat, Ganapati G.1 aInamdar, Shashikala R.1 aGudihal, Ravindra K.1 aSwamy, Bale M.0 tToxicon.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.47-57dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245012300203300001800326500002000344520161000364592002801974650001302002650002002015650003302035650001202068650001402080650001402094650001102108650002502119651002002144651000902164700006102173700001802234773010402252856007402356852000902430655001202439IND60787250420221121233703.0220808e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078725042DNAL7 a10.1002/tax.123632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoğru‐Koca, Aslı1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7477-022510aInvestigations on the phylogenetic position of the ditypic genus Froriepia reveal Yildirimlia, a new genus of Apiaceae  ap. 1259-1272.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFroriepia is a ditypic genus in the subfamily Apioideae. Froriepia subpinnata occurs in Iran and the Caucasus, while F. gracillima is a species endemic to Turkey that is known only from the type specimen collected near the country's eastern border. Although many comprehensive phylogenetic studies of members of the family Apiaceae have been conducted, the phylogenetic position of Froriepia has remained unknown. When we examined this genus in detail, we suspected that the two species assigned to it may in fact belong to separate genera because of morphological differences between them. To understand the tribal classification of this genus and to reveal its infrageneric phylogenetic relationships, we examined its members morphologically and phylogenetically. We obtained phylogenetic relationships by Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and rps16 intron gene sequences. We also examined pollen ornamentation and seed surface sculpturing with scanning electron microscopy. We found that, while F. subpinnata is a member of the tribe Pyramidoptereae, F. gracillima is a member of the tribe Selineae, and this conclusion was supported by our analyses of both the ITS and rps16 intron sequences. When we evaluated all of our results together, we deduced that F. gracillima should be removed from Froriepia. Ultimately, in light of both differences in morphological characteristics and phylogenetic evidence, we describe a new genus, Yildirimlia. The taxonomical diagnosis, detailed description, and illustrations of the new genus are provided herein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApiaceae 3aBayesian theory 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintrons 3anew genus 3aphylogeny 3apollen 3astatistical analysis 3aCaucasus region 3aIran1 aBāqirī, ʻAlī,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2580-97761 aMoradi, Aiuob0 tTaxon.g2020 Dec., v. 69, no. 6 p.1259-1272dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:1964x0040-02627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tax.123633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009200159300001800251520059900269592002800868650001100896650001300907650002100920650001800941650001200959650002200971650002400993650003101017700001801048700001701066700001801083773013501101856007501236852000901311655001201320IND60783279220221120100408.0220719e20220718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078327922DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cs00288d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Zhongtao10aRecent advances in stable main group element radicals: preparation and characterization  ap. 5930-5973.  aRadical species are significant in modern chemistry.

To overcome this drawback, the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) process was used to convert SS into clean solid fuel without prior drying. Different carbonization times were applied in order to produce hydrochars possessing better fuel properties. After the carbonization process, fuel characteristics and combustion behaviors of hydrochars were evaluated. Elemental analysis showed that 88% of carbon was recovered while 60% of nitrogen and sulfur was removed. Due to dehydration and decarboxylation reactions, hydrogen/carbon and oxygen/carbon atomic ratios reduced to 1.53 and 0.39, respectively. It was found that the fuel ratio increased to 0.18 by prolonging the carbonization process. Besides, longer carbonization time seemed to decrease oxygen containing functional groups while carbon aromaticity structure increased, thereby rendering hydrochars highly hydrophobic. The thermogravimetric analysis showed that the combustion decomposition was altered from a single stage for raw sludge to two stages for hydrochars. The combustion reaction was best fitted to the first order for both raw sludge and hydrochars. The combustion of hydrochars is expected to be easier and more stable than raw sludge because of lower activation energy and pre-exponential factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acarbon 3acombustion 3adecarboxylation 3adrying 3afuels 3ahydrochars 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3asulfur 3athermogravimetry 3awater content1 aGiannis, Apostolos1 aWang, Jing-Yuan0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.257-266dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245010400202300001800306520143300324592002801757650001201785650001701797650001301814650001401827650002001841650002601861650001101887650002501898650003101923650002301954653002201977653002301999653002302022653003802045653001902083653002502102700003802127700001702165700002702182700002602209700002402235700002602259700001802285773013902303856007802442852000902520655001202529IND60680968120221120200736.0200110e20191213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068096812DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b194312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunwar, Puskal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5668-641410aHigh-Resolution 3D Printing of Stretchable Hydrogel Structures Using Optical Projection Lithography  ap. 1640-1649.  aDouble-network (DN) hydrogels, with their unique combination of mechanical strength and toughness, have emerged as promising materials for soft robotics and tissue engineering. In the past decade, significant effort has been devoted to synthesizing DN hydrogels with high stretchability and toughness; however, shaping the DN hydrogels into complex and often necessary user-defined two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) geometries remains a fabrication challenge. Here, we report a new fabrication method based on optical projection lithography to print DN hydrogels into customizable 2D and 3D structures within minutes. DN hydrogels were printed by first photo-crosslinking a single network structure via spatially modulated light patterns followed by immersing the printed structure in a calcium bath to induce ionic cross-linking. Results show that DN structures made by this method can stretch four times their original lengths. We show that strain and the elastic modulus of printed structures can be tuned based on the hydrogel composition, cross-linker and photoinitiator concentrations, and laser light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating quick lithography and high-resolution printing of DN (covalent and ionic) hydrogels within minutes. The ability to shape tough and stretchable DN hydrogels in complex structures will be potentially useful in a broad range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acrosslinking 3ageometry 3ahydrogels 3alight intensity 3amodulus of elasticity 3arobots 3astrength (mechanics) 3athree-dimensional printing 3atissue engineering 0aadditive printing 0aphoto-crosslinking 0aionic-crosslinking 0adigital micromirror devices (DMD) 0adouble network 0astretchable hydrogel1 aJannini, Alexander Vincent Struck1 aXiong, Zheng1 aRansbottom, Mark James1 aPerkins, Jamila Shani1 aHenderson, James H.1 aHasenwinkel, Julie M.1 aSoman, Pranav0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 13, v. 12, no. 1 p.1640-1649dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b194313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03948naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245005200188300001800240520154700258592002801805650001301833650002401846650002201870650002401892650002901916650001001945650001701955650001701972650001501989650000902004650002002013650000902033650001402042650003202056650001302088650000902101650002002110650001402130650000702144650002402151650001302175650001602188650001102204650001202215650003702227650002402264650003302288650004002321650003102361650003902392650003102431650002402462650007502486650001402561650007302575650003102648650002602679650002802705650002102733650003302754650002502787650003102812650003402843650001602877650002402893700001402917773014402931856008203075852000903157655001203166IND4384496720221121004515.0200207e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438449672DNAL7 a168046952pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-006-0406-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNgai, Patrick H. K.12aA hemolysin from the mushroom Pleurotus eryngii  ap. 1185-1191.  aA monomeric 17-kDa hemolysin designated as eryngeolysin was isolated from fresh fruiting bodies of the mushroom Pleurotus eryngii, using a protocol that involved gel filtration on Superdex 75, ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q and gel filtration on Superdex 75. Its N-terminal sequence demonstrated striking homology to that of its counterparts ostreolysin from the oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus and aegerolysin from the mushroom Agrocybe cylindracea. Its hemolytic activity was unaffected over the pH range 4.0–12.0, but no activity was observed at pH 13 and at and below pH 2. The hemolysin was stable between 0 and 30 °C. At 40 °C, only residual activity was detectable. At and above 50 °C, activity was indiscernible. Eryngeolysin exhibited cytotoxicity toward leukemia (L1210) cells but not toward fungi. The hemolysin was inactivated by treatment with trypsin. It exhibited antibacterial activity against Bacillus sp. but not against other species. It inhibited basal as well as ConA-stimulated mitogenic response of murine splenocytes. N-Glycolyneuraminic acid was the only sugar capable of inhibiting the hemolytic activity. Eryngeolysin-induced hemolysis was osmotically protected by polyethylene glycol (PEG) 10000 with a mean hydrated diameter dose to 9.3 nm. However, no protection was offered by PEG 10000 to the anti-mitogenic and antiproliferative activities of eryngeolysin. The susceptibility of erythrocytes from different classes of vertebrates to eryngeolysin was mammalian > avian > reptilian > piscine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrocybe 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aPleurotus eryngii 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aantibacterial properties 3abirds 3acytotoxicity 3aerythrocytes 3afiltration 3afish 3afruiting bodies 3agels 3ahemolysis 3aion exchange chromatography 3aleukemia 3amice 3amushroom bodies 3amushrooms 3apH 3apolyethylene glycol 3areptiles 3asplenocytes 3asugars 3atrypsin 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aErythrocytesxdrug effects 2aFruiting Bodies, Fungalxchemistry 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistry 2aFungixdrug effects 2aHemolysin Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aHemolysis 2aHemolytic Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMitosisxdrug effects 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aNeuraminic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPleurotusxchemistry 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTemperature 2aTrypsinxmetabolism1 aNg, T.

We exposed Black Sea Bass Centropristis striata (BSB) embryos to varied levels of ρCO₂ (microatmospheres [μatm]) for 48 h during seasonal experiments conducted in 2013–2015 to compare embryonic response among multiple broodstocks. The relationship between ρCO₂ concentration and hatching success was inconsistent among years, with a nonlinear, inverse relationship noted in 2014 only, explaining 13% of observed variance. Conversely, ρCO₂ was a good predictor of unhatched BSB embryos after 48 h for all years combined (39%) and for 2013 (38%). The ρCO₂ concentration was a good predictor of the frequency of vertebral column anomalies for individual years (2013: 40%; 2014: 12%; 2015: 38%) but not when data were pooled for all years. In 2013 and 2015, vertebral column anomalies were relatively consistent below 1,000 μatm and were elevated above that threshold. Preliminary results suggest that BSB embryos may demonstrate resilience to future ρCO₂ levels, but the results also highlight the challenges associated with drawing broad conclusions given observed variability in results obtained from different broodstocks and study years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentropristis striata 3aacidification 3abreeding stock 3adissolved carbon dioxide 3afish 3aspine (bones) 3avariance1 aRedman, Dylan H.1 aMercaldo‐Allen, Renee1 aClark, Paul1 aRose, Julie M.1 aPerry, Dean M.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2022 Apr., v. 14, no. 2 p.e10200-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2254x1942-51207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mcf2.102003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04064naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245017000199300001800369500002000387520250200407592002802909650001502937650001402952650001702966650002002983650001303003650002203016650001303038650001203051650001803063650001603081650001103097650001403108650001403122650001503136651002903151700006403180700006003244700002103304700002103325700006103346773010403407856007403511852000903585655001203594IND60787250520221121222312.0220808e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078725052DNAL7 a10.1002/tax.123652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarbstein, Kevin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1424-655710aPhylogenomics supported by geometric morphometrics reveals delimitation of sexual species within the polyploid apomictic Ranunculus auricomus complex (Ranunculaceae)  ap. 1191-1220.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpecies are the basic units of biodiversity and evolution. Nowadays, they are widely considered as ancestor‐descendant lineages. Their definition remains a persistent challenge for taxonomists due to lineage evolutionary role and circumscription, i.e., persistence in time and space, ecological niche, or a shared phenotype. Recognizing and delimiting species is particularly methodically challenging in fast‐evolving, evolutionary young species complexes often characterized by low genetic divergence, hybrid origin, introgression, and incomplete lineage sorting. Ranunculus auricomus is a large Eurasian apomictic polyploid complex that probably has arisen from the hybridization of a few sexual progenitor species. However, even delimitation of and relationships among diploid sexual progenitors are unclear, ranging from 2 to 12 species. Here, we present an innovative workflow combining phylogenomic methods based on 86,782 parameter‐optimized RADseq loci and target enrichment of 663 nuclear genes accompanied by geometric morphometrics to delimit sexual species in this evolutionary young complex (<1 Mya). For the first time, we revealed a fully resolved and well‐supported maximum likelihood tree phylogeny congruent to neighbor‐net network and STRUCTURE results based on RADseq data. In a few clades, we found evidence of discordant patterns indicated by quartet sampling, and reticulation events in the neighbor‐net network probably caused by introgression and incomplete lineage sorting. Together with coalescent‐based species delimitation approaches based on target enrichment data, we found five main genetic lineages, with an allopatric distribution in central and southern Europe. A concatenated geometric morphometric dataset including data from basal and stem leaves, as well as receptacles, revealed the same five main clusters. We accept those five morphologically differentiated, geographically isolated, genetic main lineages as species: R. cassubicifolius s.l. (incl. R. carpaticola), R. envalirensis s.l. (incl. R. cebennensis), R. flabellifolius, R. marsicus, and R. notabilis s.l. (incl. R. austroslovenicus, R. calapius, R. mediocompositus, R. peracris, and R. subcarniolicus). Our comprehensive workflow combing phylogenomic methods supported by geometric morphometrics proved to be successful in delimiting closely related sexual taxa and applying an evolutionary species concept. This workflow is also applicable to other evolutionarily young complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRanunculus 3aallopatry 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3adiploidy 3agenetic variation 3ageometry 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amorphometry 3aniches 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3apolyploidy 3aSouthern European region1 aTomasello, Salvatore1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5201-11561 aHodač, Ladislav1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6885-13171 aDunkel, Franz G.1 aDaubert, Mareike1 aHörandl, Elvira,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7600-11280 tTaxon.g2020 Dec., v. 69, no. 6 p.1191-1220dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:1964x0040-02627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tax.123653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010900165300001800274520104200292592002801334650002301362650001401385650000901399650001901408650002301427650002401450650002101474650001601495700002101511700002101532700002301553700002401576773012701600856008101727852000901808655001201817IND50069571720221122092437.0150209e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006957172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-013-2292-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorn, Anna F.10aHomogenization Pressure and Temperature Affect Protein Partitioning and Oxidative Stability of Emulsions  ap. 1541-1550.  aThe oxidative stability of 10 % fish oil-in-water emulsions was investigated for emulsions prepared under different homogenization conditions. Homogenization was conducted at two different pressures (5 or 22.5 MPa), and at two different temperatures (22 and 72 °C). Milk proteins were used as the emulsifier. Hence, emulsions were prepared with either a combination of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin or with a combination of sodium caseinate and β-lactoglobulin. Results showed that an increase in pressure increased the oxidative stability of emulsions with caseinate and β-lactoglobulin, whereas it decreased the oxidative stability of emulsions with α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin. For both types of emulsions the partitioning of proteins between the interface and the aqueous phase appeared to be important for the oxidative stability. The effect of pre-heating the aqueous phase with the milk proteins prior to homogenization did not have any clear effect on lipid oxidation in either of the two types of emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3aemulsions 3afish 3ahomogenization 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stability 3asodium caseinate 3atemperature1 aBarouh, Nathalie1 aNielsen, Nina S.1 aBaron, Caroline P.1 aJacobsen, Charlotte0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2013 Oct., v. 90, no. 10 p.1541-1550dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-013-2292-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009600174300001600270520128200286592002801568650002201596650001201618650001501630650001401645650002301659650002001682650001001702650001801712650002201730650002101752650001301773650001101786650001401797650001101811650001801822650003701840700002201877700002001899700002401919773008001943856008602023852000902109655001202118IND60085032520221119120722.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008503252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Satyen Kumar10aCO-hydrogenation over silica supported iron based catalysts: Influence of potassium loading  ap. 267-276.  aFive different Fe–Cu/SiO₂ catalysts were prepared by a combination of co-precipitation and wet impregnation technique at different K-loading ranging from 0 to 5wt.% for the conversion of syngas to liquid fuel. The physiochemical characterization of these catalysts was performed by using N₂ adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H₂-TPR, NH₃-TPD, TEM, Inductive Couple Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS), and SEM–EDX to study the effect of potassium on the textural properties, structural change, reduction behavior, acidity and morphological change to the above K-loading catalysts. The effect of addition of potassium promoter was studied for CO-Hydrogenation in a fixed bed reactor simultaneously with the effect of promoter on the CO-conversion, selectivity and deactivation. The maximum catalytic activity was obtained from 1% K-loading and the catalytic activity decreased thereafter. The activity for water–gas shift (WGS) also enhanced with increasing K loading. The results revealed that increasing K loading decreases gaseous hydrocarbon formation and shifts selectivity to higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. Incorporation of potassium suppresses the hydrogenation activity of the Fe–Cu/SiO₂ catalyst, leading to higher olefin yield in the products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acoprecipitation 3afuels 3ahydrogenation 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3aolefin 3apotassium 3asilica 3asynthesis gas 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aMohanty, Pravakar1 aMajhi, Sachchit1 aPant, Kamal Kishore0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.267-276dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008700157520103300244592002801277650002301305650001901328650001901347650003201366650002801398700002101426700001301447700001501460700001801475773012601493856007301619852000901692655001201701IND60651786720221119123553.0190712e20160322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065178672DNAL7 a10.3390/su80302892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Li Yin,10aImproving Sustainability Performance for Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) Projects  aImproving sustainability performance in developing infrastructure projects is an important strategy for pursuing the mission of sustainable development. In recent years, the business model of public-private-partnership (PPP) is promoted as an effective approach in developing infrastructure projects. It is considered that the distribution of the contribution on project investment between private and public sectors is one of the key variables affecting sustainability performance of PPP-type projects. This paper examines the impacts of the contribution distribution between public and private sectors on project sustainability performance. A model named the sustainability performance-based evaluation model (SPbEM) is developed for assisting the assessment of the level of sustainability performance of PPP projects. The study examines the possibility of achieving better sustainability through proper arrangement of the investment distribution between the two primary sectors in developing PPP-type infrastructure projects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3ainfrastructure 3aprimary sector 3apublic-private partnerships 3asustainable development1 aTam, Vivian W.Y.1 aGan, Lin1 aYe, Kunhui1 aZhao, Zongnan0 tSustainability.g2016 Mar. 22, v. 8, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su80302893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02014naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011800171300001600289500001400305520090200319592002801221650002201249650001601271650003101287650001501318650001801333650001401351653002001365653001601385653001401401653001301415653002301428700001901451773007901470856008201549852000901631655001201640IND60711033320221123001436.0200915s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071103332DNAL7 a10.1163/1568541027602904552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, James F.10aVariation in entomopathogenic nematode (Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) infective-stage jumping behaviour  ap. 471-482.  aNAL-light  aSpecies and strains of entomopathogenic nematodes (Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae) were assessed for the expression of standing and jumping behaviour. Jumping occurred in 11 species of Steinernema, but the rate of jumping varied considerably among the species. Variation in the duration of crawling bouts, the tendency to body wave, the rate of standing, the duration of standing bouts, and the tendency to jump after standing contributed to the differences in frequency of jumping among species. Within a species, nematodes that jumped were similar in size, infectivity and sex ratio to those that did not jump, but jumpers tended to be more infective and to have lost their sheath (i.e., the second stage cuticle). This comparison of species is an important first step in assessing the adaptive value of jumping behaviour as part of the foraging strategies of entomopathogenic nematodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHeterorhabditidae 3aSteinernema 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3anematology 3apathogenicity 3asex ratio 0aHETERORHABDITIS 0aHOST SEARCH 0aNICTATION 0aFORAGING 0aSTANDING BEHAVIOUR1 aKaya, Harry K.0 tNematology.g, v. 4, no. 4 p.471-482dBrillwJournal:2154x1388-55457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568541027602904553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009900160500002000259520169700279592002801976596005602004650002902060650002002089650002302109650001402132650001702146650001202163650001102175651001402186700006202200700001902262700002002281773012402301856007502425852000902500655001202509IND60775771920221118022312.0220428e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077577192DNAL7 a10.1002/mcf2.101952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, David R.10aEconomic Values of Potential Regulation Changes for the Southern Flounder Fishery in Louisiana  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPopulation declines of Southern Flounder Paralichthys lethostigma have reached levels that present management concerns in Louisiana waters. As the need for regulatory change in this fishery approaches, we conducted a survey to better characterize the Southern Flounder fishery in Louisiana, with two primary goals: (1) determining a value for the economic welfare provided by the fishery and (2) evaluating how this value might change in response to hypothetical regulation scenarios. Based on total travel cost estimates, the aggregate economic value of the Southern Flounder fishery among coastal Louisiana anglers reached an estimated US$119.7 million; however, this value primarily stems from anglers targeting multiple species during their coastal angling trips, as the value of the Southern Flounder fishery while only accounting for anglers that solely targeted this species amounted to an estimated $8.4 million. Respondents revealed strong levels of supportiveness for all regulation scenarios that increased limitations on allowable harvest for Southern Flounder. None of the hypothetical regulation scenarios led to significant behavioral responses in the expected number of coastal angling trips taken, leaving the economic value of coastal Louisiana fisheries unchanged. The results of our study illustrate the relatively inconsequential nature of Southern Flounder regulations upon the behavior of coastal Louisiana anglers. The information gathered by this survey can be used to guide the decision‐making process in developing a sustainable management strategy that is supported by stakeholders and that keeps the strong economic values of coastal Louisiana fisheries intact.  aPublisher supplied data  aNA18OAR4170098cLouisiana Sea Grant College Program 3aParalichthys lethostigma 3adecision making 3aeconomic valuation 3afisheries 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3atravel 3aLouisiana1 aMidway, Stephen R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0162-19951 aCaffey, Rex H.1 aPenn, Jerrod M.0 tMarine and coastal fisheries.g2022 Apr., v. 14, no. 2 p.e10195-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:2254x1942-51207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mcf2.101953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245007300166300001400239520125500253592002801508650002401536650002401560650001101584650001201595650001101607650001101618650001601629650001501645700001601660700001701676700001801693700001901711700001501730700001701745773007801762856008601840852000901926655001201935IND60085032720221119120538.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008503272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Liang10aMultiphase modeling of settling and suspension in anaerobic digester  ap. 28-39.  aEffective suspension and settling are critical for controlling biomass retention in a bioreactor. In this paper, a multi-fluid model with kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) was established to describe these phenomena in the biowaste particles flow in anaerobic digesters. Solid retention time (SRT) was added as a parameter into anaerobic digestion No.1 (ADM1) model to evaluate its effect on the biogas productivity. The model was experimentally validated in a liquid–gas–solid column reactor with gas and solid volume fraction and granular temperature as the major variables. The wastewater residence time distribution was also determined through modeling and measurement to evaluate the mixing pattern in the pilot column reactor. The effect of restitution coefficient on flow behavior of biowaste particles, particles settling and suspension were predicted. Settling and suspension processes of anaerobic digesters were simulated for lab and pilot-scale reactors with comparisons made for reactor configuration and geometry model, respectively. This study demonstrated that the multi-fluid model with KTGF could provide better understanding of impact of suspension and settling upon retaining biomass particles in the anaerobic digesters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digesters 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3abiomass 3amixing 3amodels 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aMa, Jingwei1 aFrear, Craig1 aZhao, Quanbao1 aDillon, Robert1 aLi, Xiujin1 aChen, Shulin0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.28-39dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.04.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009600169300001400265520118900279592002801468650001601496650002901512650002101541650001301562650001301575650001001588650001001598650001401608650001801622650001601640650001301656650001101669651001201680653002601692653002401718653002001742653002601762700001401788700001701802700001901819700001801838700002101856700001201877773007001889856008501959852000902044655001202053IND60545085920221119152735.0161019e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054508592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAboumaâd, B.10aCardiac involvement and its complications about three cases of severe scorpion envenomation  ap. 78-82.  aFor several decades, Morocco is confronted to medico-social problem of scorpion stings and envenomations. In 2009, epidemiological data established by the Poison Control Center recorded 29,816 stung patients, with an incidence of 1.1‰ and a fatality rate of 0.18%. The neurotoxins from scorpion venom are potent activators of the autonomic nervous system resulting a physiopathological disorder of vital systems. The most serious clinical manifestations are neurotoxic effects, pulmonary edema and cardiovascular distress. This present work reports the cases of three children (4 years and 6 months, 8 months and 15 days, 4 years), hospitalized in intensive care for an envenomation by Androctonus mauritanicus (the most fatal scorpion specie). The children presented cardiac dysfunction where pulmonary edema and state of shock were complications resultants. Two cases survived after supportive and symptomatic treatment based on dobutamine as primordial treatment in cardiovascular and pulmonary correction and other drugs. The third case died. The objective of this work was to detect the limit of the effectiveness of symptomatic treatment during a severe scorpion envenomation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndroctonus 3aautonomic nervous system 3abites and stings 3achildren 3adistress 3adrugs 3aedema 3amortality 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotoxins 3apatients 3avenoms 3aMorocco 0aScorpion envenomation 0aCardiac dysfunction 0aPulmonary edema 0aSymptomatic treatment1 aTiger, A.1 aKhattabi, A.1 aSoulaymani, R.1 aLahssaini, M.1 aBenhassain, S.M.1 aIba, N.0 tToxicon.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.78-82dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245009100212300001600303500002000319520187800339592002802217596004202245596006902287596004402356596005002400596005702450596005902507650002302566650001802589650001302607650002302620650002502643700005602668700001902724700001802743700006402761700002002825773012102845856008002966852000903046655001203055IND60771943620221122055959.0220330e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077194362DNAL7 a10.1111/1440-1703.122142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoss, Samuel R.

These assumptions limit our ability to reach a generalizable and mechanistic understanding of stability under global environmental change. Moving towards a multiscale approach—across space, time and environment—will allow us to better understand the intrinsic (e.g., demographic) and extrinsic (environmental) drivers of ecological stability. In this perspective, we review multiple sources of variation responsible for shaping ecological dynamics, and how scale affects our observation of these dynamics through its confounding effect on drivers of variation in ecosystems. We discuss the effect of temporal scale when combining empirical dynamic modeling with high‐resolution population time series to consider the time‐varying nature of multispecies interaction networks, highlighting interspecific interactions as an intrinsic driver of community dynamics. Next, we examine energy landscape analysis as a method for inferring stability and transience during community assembly and its interaction with spatial scale, emphasizing the intrinsic role of compositional variability in assembly dynamics. We then examine population dynamics at species' range margins and show how considering the interaction between spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity, an extrinsic driver of population dynamics, can facilitate a nuanced understanding of population expansions, range shifts, and species invasions. Finally, we discuss broadly how the sources of intrinsic and extrinsic variation interact with each other and with spatiotemporal scale to shape ecological dynamics. Better recognition of the scale‐dependent nature of the relationship between drivers of variation and ecological dynamics will be invaluable to illuminate the dynamics influencing ecological stability across scales.  aPublisher supplied data  aTT19/1029cBritish Ecological Society  aJPMJCR13A2cCore Research for Evolutional Science and Technology  aGOIPG/2018/3023cIrish Research Council  a19H05641cJapan Science and Technology Agency  a16H04846cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP20J10699cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aecological balance 3aglobal change 3aresearch 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis1 aSuzuki, Yuka1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0930-55911 aKondoh, Michio1 aSuzuki, Kenta1 aVilla Martín, Paula1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2664-75611 aDornelas, Maria0 tEcological research.g2021 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.364-378dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3870047x0912-38147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.122143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011900170300001600289520109100305592002801396650001701424650001101441650001301452650001501465650001901480650001501499651001201514653002601526653002201552653001601574653002801590653001201618700001901630700001601649773008901665856008401754852000901838655001201847IND60121756420221120073406.0150324e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175642DNAL7 a10.1080/01426397.2012.7420462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnt, Anna-Liisa10aBlank Space: Exploring the Sublime Qualities of Urban Wilderness at the Former Fishing Harbour in Tallinn, Estonia  ap. 267-286.  aThe gradual relocation of industry and other related activities out of the core areas of cities often results in voids in the urban structure—spaces that are ‘left over’. These places—in transition between their past and future functions—are landscapes with no formal spatial arrangement or current use. Their state of limbo often allows for a variety of informal and spontaneous uses that may enrich the urban structure, albeit temporarily, with their diversity. However, they are usually shown as blank areas on city planning maps with a status of awaiting some future use: thus the space is considered to be empty. As a case study, the temporary in-between status of a disused and abandoned fishing harbour in Tallinn, Estonia, is documented, in order to present and discuss ways of analysing both positive and negative aspects of dereliction in a post-Soviet context. This blankness, the paper concludes, is an opportunity and a quality, not always a vice but in some cases a virtue and that the rich content of derelict places is worthy of consideration in city planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3aindustry 3alandscapes 3aurban planning 3awilderness 3aEstonia 0aurban derelict places 0aunregulated space 0athe sublime 0awaterfront regeneration 0aEstonia1 aTravlou, Penny1 aBell, Simon0 tLandscape research.g2014 June 1, v. 39, no. 3 p.267-286dRoutledgex1469-97107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2012.7420463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011400164300001600278520082300294592002801117650001301145650001001158650004201168650002501210650001401235650001801249650001701267700001901284700001701303700002001320773013201340856008201472852000901554655001201563IND60608913420221120102842.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060891342DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-017-0824-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiu, Yu-Wen14aThe complete mitogenome of the winged argonaut Argonauta hians and its phylogenetic relationships in Octopoda  ap. 359-362.  aThe mitogenome of the winged argonaut Argonauta hians (Argonautidae) was decoded using next generation sequencing. The de novo assembled mitogenome consists of 16,130 bp, including 13 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs and 22 transfer RNA genes. The gene arrangement is identical to the other available Octopodidae octopus sequences submitted to NCBI. The overall base composition of the A. hians mitogenome is 29.1% A, 6.9% C, 13.2% G and 40.9% T. The phylogenetic analysis of the A. hians mitogenome suggests an ancestral position in the order Octopoda, compared to species in the Amphioctopus, Cistopus and Octopus (Octopodidae) genera.

However, the antibacterial mechanism of the Cu-bearing SS is still not accurately understood and recognized. On the one hand, the concentration of released antibacterial Cu ions from its surface is insufficient to generate such an effect. On the other hand, due to the limited Cu content, the area of copper toxicity that can be contacted with bacteria is also much less than that of pure Cu. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the way of bacterial inactivation caused by Cu-bearing SS from the view of the charge transfer. The results showed that the continuous and effective contact between bacteria and Cu-bearing SS is the key to induce the bacteria-killing effect so that the cathode electrons generated by the potential difference of the material microdomain can cause the proton depletion in the bacterial cells, thereby disturbing the respiratory chain and energy generation of the bacterial cells. The proton depletion reaction also catalyzed the conversion of Cu(II) into Cu(I). Cu(I) not only destroys the iron–sulfur protein but also undergoes the redox reaction with Cu(II) to produce reactive oxygen species, causing oxidative damage to cells, eventually accelerating the bacterial death.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3acopper 3adeath 3aelectron transport chain 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aions 3areactive oxygen species 3aredox reactions 3astainless steel 3atoxicity 0aCu-bearing stainless steel 0acontact killing 0acharge transfer 0asurface potential 0aCu(I) 0aCu(II)1 aYang, Chunguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5621-52251 aYang, Ke0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 12, no. 1 p.361-372dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b195963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245016000179300001400339520113800353592002801491650002501519650001601544650001501560650001501575650001401590650002001604650001301624650001101637650001101648650001901659650002101678650002001699650002101719650002101740650002601761650001301787650001301800650001101813653002501824653002201849653001601871653001601887653002601903653001901929653000801948653000801956653001001964653001001974653000801984653000801992653000802000653000702008653001102015653001002026653000802036700002802044700003002072700002502102700002302127700006202150773007002212856008502282852000902367655001202376IND60545086020221119152620.0161019e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054508602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe-Simone, Salvatore G.10aIgE and IgG epitope mapping by microarray peptide-immunoassay reveals the importance and diversity of the immune response to the IgG3 equine immunoglobulin  ap. 83-93.  aThe presence of whole horse IgG in therapeutic snake antivenom preparations of high purity is a contamination that can cause IgE-mediated allergic reactions in patients. In this study, the immunodominant IgE and IgG-binding epitopes in horse heavy chain IgG3 were mapped using arrays of overlapping peptides synthesized directly onto activated cellulose membranes. Pooled human sera from patients with and without horse antivenom allergies were used to probe the membrane. We have demonstrated that, for both cases, individuals produce antibodies to epitopes of sequential amino acids of horse heavy chain IgG3, although the signal strength and specificity appear to be distinct between the two groups of patients. A single region was found to contain the dominant allergic IgE epitope. The critical residues involved in the binding of human IgE to the epitope were determined to include four hydrophobic amino acids followed by polar and charged residues that formed a coil structure. This is the first study to describe the specific amino acid sequences involved with the immune recognition of human IgG and IgE to horse antivenom.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aantibodies 3aantivenoms 3acellulose 3aepitope mapping 3aepitopes 3ahorses 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin E 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amicroarray technology 3apatients 3apeptides 3asnakes 0aHorse immunoglobulin 0aB-linear epitopes 0aIgE epitope 0aIgG epitope 0aAnaphylactic reaction 0aSpot-synthesis 0aCBS 0ahIg 0aELISA 0ahhcIg 0aHCS 0aHRP 0aNST 0aST 0aTBS-CT 0aTBS-T 0aTMB1 aNapoleão-Pêgo, Paloma1 aTeixeira-Pinto, Luiz A.L.1 aMelgarejo, Anibal R.1 aAguiar, Aniesse S.1 aProvance, David W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9824-06720 tToxicon.g2014 Feb., v. 78 p.83-93dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2013.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02256naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245013900179300001600318520110900334592002801443650001901471650001601490650002201506650001901528651001101547651001001558653002201568653001901590653002201609653002601631700001801657700002201675773010401697856008401801852000901885655001201894IND60121756620221120065730.0150324e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012175662DNAL7 a10.1080/03066150.2011.6526192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Ploeg, Jan Douwe10aRural development through the construction of new, nested, markets: comparative perspectives from China, Brazil and the European Union  ap. 133-173.  aThis article discusses and compares the rural development processes and practices currently occurring in China, Brazil and the European Union. Although these are strongly rooted in the specificities of time and space, they also share important commonalities. We argue that rural development can be viewed as an evolving set of responses to market failures. A key element of these responses is that they are unfolding through the construction of new markets: a seemingly contradictory phenomenon that has, as yet, hardly been scrutinized or theoretically elaborated. We describe these newly emerging markets as ‘nested markets’ and support our argument with a careful reconsideration of the dynamics of long-established nested markets. We then extend this analysis, firstly, by arguing that the construction of such new markets occurs through a process of social struggle and, secondly, by exploring the strength of these newly emerging constellations in relation to the hegemony exerted by food empires. Our analysis puts common-pool resources, which underlie these new, nested markets, centre stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3anew markets 3arural development 3aspace and time 3aBrazil 3aChina 0arural development 0anested markets 0aeveryday politics 0acommon-pool resources1 aJingzhong, Ye1 aSchneider, Sergio0 tJournal of peasant studies.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 39, no. 1 p.133-173dTaylor & Francisx1743-93617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2011.6526193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006000172300001800232520108300250592002801333650001801361650001701379650001601396650002101412650002101433650001601454653000801470653000901478653002801487653002001515653001801535653002101553700002401574700002201598700002401620773012101644856008201765852000901847655001201856IND60628944320221120103501.0190613e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062894432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2019.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInda, María Eugenia10aReverse Engineering of a Thermosensing Regulator Switch  ap. 1016-1024.  aTo address the mechanism of thermosensing and its implications for molecular engineering, we previously deconstructed the functional components of the bacterial thermosensor DesK, a histidine kinase with a five-span transmembrane domain that detects temperature changes. The system was first simplified by building a sensor that consists of a single chimerical transmembrane segment that retained full sensing capacity. Genetic and biophysical analysis of this minimal sensor enabled the identification of three modular components named determinants of thermodetection (DOTs). Here we combine and tune the DOTs to determine their contribution to activity. A transmembrane zipper represents the master DOT that drives a reversible and activating dimerization through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Our findings provide the mechanism and insights to construct a synthetic transmembrane helix based on a poly-valine scaffold that harbors the DOTs and regulates the activity. The construct constitutes a modular switch that may be exploited in biotechnology and genetic circuitry.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3adimerization 3aengineering 3ahistidine kinase 3ahydrogen bonding 3atemperature 0aTMS 0aDOTs 0atransmembrane signaling 0ahistidin-kinase 0aserine zipper 0areverse engineer1 aVazquez, Daniela B.1 aFernández, Ariel1 aCybulski, Larisa E.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 431, no. 5 p.1016-1024dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245013200177300001600309520151900325592002801844650002001872650001201892650001501904650001401919650001201933650001301945650001301958650001501971650001601986650002502002700002702027773008002054856008602134852000902220655001202229IND60085033020221119120625.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008503302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaurya, Rakesh Kumar10aExperimental investigation of cyclic variations in HCCI combustion parameters for gasoline like fuels using statistical methods  ap. 310-323.  aHomogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines have potential for excellent fuel economy and extremely low emissions of NOₓ and PM. HCCI engines however do not have any direct control on the start of combustion timings, which makes HCCI combustion control extremely challenging. Characterization of cyclic variations of various combustion parameters is required for design and development of closed loop control of HCCI engines. Combustion stability and cycle-to-cycle variations of HCCI combustion parameters using gasoline like fuels (methanol, ethanol and butanol) were investigated in a modified four-cylinder, four-stroke engine. The experiments were conducted by varying the intake air temperature (Tᵢ) and relative air–fuel ratio (λ) as well as engine speed. In the steady state engine operation, cylinder pressure signals for 2000 consecutive engine cycles were acquired for each test condition. From this large volume of experimental data collected, cyclic variations of various combustion parameters were analyzed. To evaluate the cycle-to-cycle variations of HCCI combustion parameters, statistical parameters such as coefficient of variation (COV) and standard deviation of each parameter were calculated for all test conditions. Combustion phasing was also analyzed by fitting different probability density functions (statistical distributions). Best-fit distribution for all test conditions can then be used for predicting and controlling the HCCI combustion timing for engine control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3abutanol 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aethanol 3agasoline 3amethanol 3aprediction 3aprobability 3astatistical analysis1 aAgarwal, Avinash Kumar0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.310-323dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008900172300001800261520190800279592002802187650001502215650001702230650001202247650002002259650002202279650001102301650001402312650000802326650001802334650001102352650002402363650001602387650001202403700001902415700001802434773008202452856008602534852000902620655001202629IND60085033120221119120519.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008503312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.05.0812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandanedo, J.A.10aModel-based predictive control of an ice storage device in a building cooling system  ap. 1032-1045.  aThis paper describes an approach to the formulation of a model-based predictive control (MPC) algorithm for the cooling plant of a building under a time-dependent electricity price profile. The mechanical system includes a three-stage chiller and an ice bank used for thermal energy storage (TES). Cooling can be provided to the indoor space either by directly using the chiller or by discharging the ice bank when electricity prices are high. The chiller is also used to charge the ice bank at night. By applying system identification techniques, a simplified linear thermal model for the building was derived from a detailed building simulation previously developed in EnergyPlus. The use of a simplified linear model – along with weather and internal gains forecasts – allows to readily calculate the required cooling power for a given temperature setpoint trajectory. By making use of simple parametric models for the chiller and the ice bank, an optimization algorithm is applied to decide on the optimal combination of chiller and ice bank cooling power contributions at discrete hourly intervals over the prediction horizon. The length of the prediction horizon alternates between 24 and 30h in order to coincide with the beginning or end of charge/discharge periods. The formulation of the optimization problem is considerably facilitated by using cooling power as the main working variable and then writing the equations accordingly. The proposed MPC strategy is compared with two rule-based control strategies: a modified storage-priority algorithm (similar to the one currently used in the case study building) and a chiller-priority algorithm. With the considered pricing structure and mechanical system, the MPC algorithm results in typical savings of about 5–20% with respect to the modified storage-priority strategy and about 20–30% with respect to the chiller-priority strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3acooling 3acooling systems 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3aequations 3aice 3alinear models 3aprices 3asystem optimization 3atemperature 3aweather1 aDehkordi, V.R.1 aStylianou, M.0 tApplied energy.g2013 Nov., v. 111 p.1032-1045dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2013.05.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01770naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245009900170300001400269520052000283592002800803650001600831650001400847650001000861650001000871650001200881650001600893650001300909650001000922651002000932651001100952653001000963653003000973653001301003653000801016700002901024700002801053700003301081700002801114773010701142856007801249852000901327655001201336IND60127343920221121215539.0151110e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012734392DNAL7 a10.1653/024.096.01042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCruz, Javier Ruiz-De La12aA New Species of Aeolothrips (Thysanoptera: Aeolothripidae) from Mango Crops in Oaxaca, Mexico  ap. 29-35.  aWe describe Aeolothrips romanruizi sp. nova that has been recently discovered in mango orchards in the Isthmus region of Oaxaca in southern Mexico.

However, it remains great challenge to prepare such kind of new two-dimensional (2D) polymer nanosheets without using any templates. In this work, thiadiazole-containing expanded heteroazaporphyrinoid was designed as the building blocks for preparation of free-standing N/S-containing polymer nanosheets (PN) without using any templates. Most importantly, such PN can coordinate with transition metal ions to prepare Fe, N, and S containing PN-Fe. By using these PN-Fe as precursors, Fe/N/S co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (PCN-FeNS) can be facilely prepared by direct pyrolysis under inert condition. The N and S contents of PCN-FeNS can reach up to 6.4 at.% and 0.8 at.%, respectively. For proof-of-concept, PCN-FeNS were further used as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and neutral media. Benefiting from the high surface area and rich-doping character, PCN-FeNS exhibited relatively high half-wave potential of down to 0.71 V, via a four-electron transfer mechanism (n = 3.87 at 0.65 V), as well as high diffusion limiting current density (JL = 5.02 mA cm−2), which are comparable to commercial precious metal based electrocatalysts. This study not only offers a new method to prepare conjugated polymer nanosheets, but also provides a new strategy to fabricate Fe/N/S co-doped porous carbon nanosheets for versatile energy-related applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3airon 3ametal ions 3ananosheets 3apolymers 3apyrolysis 3asurface area 0aHeteroazaporphyrinoid 0aPolymer nanosheet 0aPorous carbon nanosheet 0aCo-doping 0aOxygen reduction reaction1 aSun, Sai1 aYang, Lingyun1 aLu, Chenbao1 aHe, Yafei1 aZhang, Chao1 aCai, Ming1 aYao, Yefeng1 aZhang, Fan1 aZhuang, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4090-04200 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 516 p.9-15dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01850naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245006900171520088100240592002801121653002101149653001701170653001501187653002801202653002501230700001801255700001501273700005701288773010601345856008801451852000901539655001201548IND60661507620221119081557.0200106e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066150762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Yujeong10aSoutheastern Yellow Sea as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide  aThe seawater fugacity of carbon dioxide (CO₂; fCO₂SW) was investigated over four seasons in the southeastern Yellow Sea (YS). The seasonal variation in sea surface temperature (SST)-normalized fCO₂SW in the study area was largely explained by sea surface concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon modulated by the water column stability in association with biological carbon fixation and remineralization. Overall, our study area acted as a sink for atmospheric CO₂, absorbing a regional average of ~2.8 mmol C m⁻² day⁻¹. This result contrasts sharply with the large CO₂ effluxes reported in other parts of the YS, implying considerable spatiotemporal variations in fCO₂SW in this region. Since the YS is significantly influenced by human activity, our data will serve as a baseline to record the human impact on ocean carbon cycles in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAir-sea CO2 flux 0aCarbon cycle 0aYellow Sea 0aEast Asian marginal sea 0aKorean coastal water1 aKim, Dongseon1 aCho, Sosul1 aKim, Tae-Wook1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4236-07200 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2019 Dec., v. 149 p.110550-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2019.1105503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011300171300001600284520137000300592002801670650002501698650001501723650001101738653002101749653001801770653001501788653002001803700002201823773012201845856008501967852000902052655001202061IND60517705220221120041312.0160405e20160217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051770522DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2015.10543912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, Svenja10aRobust flood statistics: comparison of peak over threshold approaches based on monthly maxima and TL-moments  ap. 457-470.  aFlood quantile estimation based on partial duration series (peak over threshold, POT) represents a noteworthy alternative to the classical annual maximum approach since it enlarges the available information spectrum. Here the POT approach is discussed with reference to its benefits in increasing the robustness of flood quantile estimations. The classical POT approach is based on a Poisson distribution for the annual number of exceedences, although this can be questionable in some cases. Therefore, the Poisson distribution is compared with two other distributions (binomial and Gumbel-Schelling). The results show that only rarely is there a difference from the Poisson distribution. In the second part we investigate the robustness of flood quantiles derived from different approaches in the sense of their temporal stability against the occurrence of extreme events. Besides the classical approach using annual maxima series (AMS) with the generalized extreme value distribution and different parameter estimation methods, two different applications of POT are tested. Both are based on monthly maxima above a threshold, but one also uses trimmed L-moments (TL-moments). It is shown how quantile estimations based on this “robust” POT approach (rPOT) become more robust than AMS-based methods, even in the case of occasional extraordinary extreme events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoisson distribution 3aestimation 3afloods 0apartial duration 0aannual maxima 0arobustness 0aPoisson process1 aSchumann, Andreas0 tHydrological sciences journal.g2016 Feb. 17, v. 61, no. 3 p.457-470dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2013x2150-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2015.10543913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017800166300001600344520127200360592002801632650002201660650001301682650000901695650001101704650001501715650001601730650001001746650002001756650002501776650001901801650001901820650001501839650001401854650001701868650001501885650001901900650001301919650002101932650002001953653003301973653000902006653002102015653001802036653002402054700001602078700001602094700001802110700001402128700001602142700001802158773012502176856008202301852000902383655001202392IND60644840620221118233718.0190523e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064484062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.01.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yuanqing12aA facile strategy for the synthesis of ferroferric oxide/titanium dioxide/molybdenum disulfide heterostructures as a magnetically separable photocatalyst under visible-light  ap. 138-144.  aSemiconductor photocatalysts is a promising approach to combat both environmental pollution and global energy shortage despite the challenges of recycling and stability. In this paper, magnetic Fe3O4 particle is introduced in the system and Fe3O4/TiO2/MoS2 heterostructures can be formed in a facile strategy. The morphology and structure of Fe3O4/TiO2/MoS2 can be controlled by adjusting the hydrolysis rate of the titanium source. MoS2 is designed to fill in the mesoporous of TiO2 core, forming heterojunction on the surface and near-surface of TiO2 under solvothermal conditions. With respect to the decomposition of a rhodamine B (RhB) solution under visible light, the Fe3O4/TiO2/MoS2 heterostructures display highly photocatalytic activities in aqueous solutions, and they can be easily recovered to realize cyclic utilization by applying an external magnetic field. Thus, the effective magnetic recycle of the catalyst is achieved, and high visible light catalytic activity is ensured simultaneously. Since the current method is simple and flexible to create recyclable catalysts with high stability in this way, it could promote the practicability of semiconductor photocatalysts in water treatment, degradation of dye pollutants, and environmental cleaning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acleaning 3adyes 3aenergy 3ahydrolysis 3airon oxides 3alight 3amagnetic fields 3amolybdenum disulfide 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3apollution 3aporous media 3arhodamines 3asemiconductors 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 3awater treatment 0aSemiconductor photocatalysts 0aMoS2 0aHeterostructures 0aVisible-light 0aRecycle utilization1 aTan, Junbin1 aLin, Huihui1 aWang, Xiaojie1 aLiu, Jian1 aLi, Yunxing1 aWang, Chuanxi0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 516 p.138-144dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.01.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02428naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245010400166300001200270520117600282592002801458650000801486650001501494650002201509650002001531650002001551650004301571650002501614650003001639650002401669650001301693650004301706700001801749700001801767700001701785700001401802700001901816773009401835856008001929852000902009655001202018IND60083071220221118184453.0141101e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008307122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2012.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Xuecheng10aComparison of oligonucleotide-labeled antibody probe assays for prostate-specific antigen detection  ap. 1-7.  aAs a specific tumor marker, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely used for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Sensitive and specific methods are required to improve the diagnostic accuracy of PSA detection. In the current study, we compared the immuno-polymerase chain reaction (immuno-PCR) method with the solid-phase proximity ligation assay (SP–PLA) with respect to the detection of PSA. Using oligonucleotide-labeled antibody probes, we used both immuno-PCR and SP–PLA to detect trace levels of PSA. The nucleic acid sequences can be monitored using real-time PCR. SP–PLA, however, was found to be superior in terms of both the detection limit and the dynamic range. To detect even lower levels of PSA, we used the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to measure the levels of reporter DNA molecules in SP–PLA. The sensitivity of the LAMP method is 0.001pM, which is approximately 100-fold higher than the sensitivities of the other assays. The results suggest that an SP–PLA- and LAMP-based protocol with oligonucleotide-labeled antibody probes may have great application in detecting PSA or other proteins present at trace levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aantibodies 3aantigen detection 3adetection limit 3aearly diagnosis 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3anucleotide sequences 3aprostate-specific antigen 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aproteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction1 aCheng, Shuyan1 aChen, Weiqing1 aWang, Luming1 aShi, Feng1 aZhu, Chenggang0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2012 May 1, v. 424, no. 1 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2012.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011800167300001800285520188000303592002802183650001302211650000902224650000902233650001802242650002002260650003102280650001002311650002002321650001702341650001402358650001102372650001802383650002402401650001602425650002102441650001302462653001502475653001902490653001302509653002002522700001902542700006302561700001602624773010902640856008202749852000902831655001202840IND60707391820221117190908.0210311e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070739182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.07.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDayan, Jonathan10aIncubation temperature affects yolk utilization through changes in expression of yolk sac tissue functional genes  ap. 6128-6138.  aThe yolk sac tissue (YST) is a multifunctional metabolic organ supporting chicken embryonic development. This study examined whether incubation temperatures (ITs) affect YST functions. For this purpose, 300 eggs were assigned to 3 groups and incubated at control IT of 37.8°C, at 1.5°C below, 36.3°C (cold IT), and at 1.5°C above, 39.3°C (hot IT). For each group, 6 embryos' whole body mass and residual yolk (RSY) weights were recorded during incubation, and YST was sampled for both histology and gene expression analysis. YST functionality during incubation was examined by regression analysis, comparing changes in expression patterns of genes involved in lipid uptake and metabolism (LRP2, ApoA1), oligopeptides uptake (PepT1), gluconeogenesis (FBP1), glycogenesis (GYS2), and thyroid hormones regulation (TTR, DIO1, DIO2). Results show that hot and cold ITs affected YST gene expression and yolk utilization. PepT1 expression decreased towards hatch, in both hot and cold ITs, while in the Control IT, it reached a plateau. ApoA1 and DIO2 expression showed a moderate linear fit compared to polynomial fit in the control. GYS2 expression had no change along incubation, while in the control IT, it showed a polynomial fit. Expression of LRP2, FBP1, and DIO1 genes was affected by either cold or hot IT's. TTR expression patterns were similar in all IT groups. The variations in gene expression patterns observed in the 3 ITs can explain the changes in yolk utilization, an important parameter for hatchling quality. While the control IT showed optimal utilization, with an RSY value of 11.12% at the day of hatch, the cold and hot IT groups exhibited lower utilization with an RSY value of 18.18 and 29.99%, respectively. These findings are the first to show that ITs change the expression of key YST genes, leading to variations in yolk utilization by the embryo.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3acold 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agluconeogenesis 3aglycogenesis 3ahistology 3alipids 3aoligopeptides 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3athyroid hormones 3ayolk sac 0aincubation 0abroiler embryo 0ayolk sac 0agene expression1 aReicher, Naama1 aMelkman-Zehavi, Tal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3176-52981 aUni, Zehava0 tPoultry science.g2020 Nov., v. 99, no. 11 p.6128-6138dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.07.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008100157300001800238520052800256592002800784650001100812650002300823650002300846650002100869650001300890650001300903650002900916700002300945700002000968773010400988856007501092852000901167655001201176IND60578681020221121033045.0170813e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057868102DNAL7 a10.1021/ol40067572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaoka, Yuuki10aMetal-Free Fluorination of C(sp3)–H Bonds Using a Catalytic N-Oxyl Radical  ap. 2160-2163.  aA direct conversion of C(sp³)–H bonds to C(sp³)–F bonds has been developed.

The amount of plastics accumulating in the environment is growing rapidly, yet our understanding of its persistence is very limited. This Perspective summarizes the existing literature on environmental degradation rates and pathways for the major types of thermoplastic polymers. A metric to harmonize disparate types of measurements, the specific surface degradation rate (SSDR), is implemented and used to extrapolate half-lives. SSDR values cover a very wide range, with some of the variability arising due to degradation studies conducted in different natural environments. SSDRs for high density polyethylene (HDPE) in the marine environment range from practically 0 to approximately 11 μm year–¹. This approach yields a number of interesting insights. Using a mean SSDR for HDPE in the marine environment, linear extrapolation leads to estimated half-lives ranging from 58 years (bottles) to 1200 years (pipes). For example, SSDRs for HDPE and polylactic acid (PLA) are surprisingly similar in the marine environment, although PLA degrades approximately 20 times faster than HDPE on land. Our study highlights the need for better experimental studies under well-defined reaction conditions, standardized reporting of rates, and methods to simulate polymer degradation using.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottles 3aenvironmental degradation 3ahalf life 3amarine environment 3apipes 3apolyethylene 3apolylactic acid 3athermoplastics 3awastes 0aPlastic waste 0aPolymer degradation rate 0aCommodity plastic 0aBiodegradable plastic 0aEnvironmental influences 0aShape dependence1 aMoon, Hyunjin1 aZheng, Jiajia1 aQiu, Yang1 aTabassum, Tarnuma1 aJang, Jun Hee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1879-05441 aAbu-Omar, Mahdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4412-19851 aScott, Susannah L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1161-04991 aSuh, Sangwon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8290-62760 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 Feb. 03, v. 8, no. 9 p.3494-3511dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b066353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008500173300001600258520145100274592002801725596006101753650002301814650003701837650000801874650001901882650002001901650001701921650001001938650001301948650002901961650002601990650002202016653002302038653002402061653003802085653004102123653003102164653004502195653001702240700002202257773012502279856008502404852000902489655001202498IND60689221020221117025240.0200420e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922102DNAL7 a10.3109/07388551.2016.11651802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiatek, Agnieszka10aTargeted genome regulation via synthetic programmable transcriptional regulators  ap. 429-440.  aRegulation of gene transcription controls cellular functions and coordinates responses to developmental, physiological and environmental cues. Precise and efficient molecular tools are needed to characterize the functions of single and multiple genes in linear and interacting pathways in a native context. Modular DNA-binding domains from zinc fingers (ZFs) and transcriptional activator-like proteins (TALE) are amenable to bioengineering to bind DNA target sequences of interest. As a result, ZF and TALE proteins were used to develop synthetic programmable transcription factors. However, these systems are limited by the requirement to re-engineer proteins for each new target sequence. The clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated 9 (Cas9) genome editing tool was recently repurposed for targeted transcriptional regulation by inactivation of the nuclease activity of Cas9. Due to the facile engineering, simplicity, precision and amenability to library construction, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is poised to revolutionize the functional genomics field across diverse eukaryotic species. In this review, we discuss the development of synthetic customizable transcriptional regulators and provide insights into their current and potential applications, with special emphasis on plant systems, in characterization of gene functions, elucidation of molecular mechanisms and their biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRG4cKing Abdullah University of Science and Technology 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCRISPR-associated endonuclease 9 3aDNA 3abioengineering 3aenzyme activity 3agene editing 3agenes 3agenomics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif 0aCRISPR/Cas9 system 0afunctional genomics 0asynthetic site-specific nucleases 0asynthetic transcriptional regulators 0atargeted genome regulation 0atranscriptional activator-like effectors 0azinc fingers1 aMahfouz, Magdy M.0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2017 May 19, v. 37, no. 4 p.429-440dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3109/07388551.2016.11651803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245014400162300002000306520152000326592002801846650002001874650002701894650002401921650002601945650001001971650001601981650001301997650001602010650001902026650002302045650000702068650001602075650001602091650001902107700002202126700001702148700002202165700002402187700001802211700002202229773012802251856007502379852000902454655001202463IND60759878820221122054310.0211214e20211213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075987882DNAL7 a10.1039/d1fo01982a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaitta, Francesca10aGrapevine stilbenoids as natural food preservatives: calorimetric and spectroscopic insights into the interaction with model cell membranes  ap. 12490-12502.  aFood contamination with pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, is a common health concern. Natural products, which have been the main source of antimicrobials for centuries, may represent a turning point in alleviating the antibiotic crisis, and plant polyphenolic compounds are considered a promising source for new antibacterial agents. Resveratrol and resveratrol-derived monomers and oligomers (stilbenoids) have been shown to exert a variegated pattern of efficacy as antimicrobials depending on both the polyphenols’ structure and the nature of the microorganisms, and the bacterial cell membrane seems to be one of their primary targets. In this scenario and based on the thermodynamic information reported in the literature about cell membranes, this study aimed at the investigation of the direct interaction of selected stilbenoids with a simple but informative model cell membrane. Three complete stilbenoid “monomer/dimer/dehydro-dimer” sets were chosen according to different geometries and substitution patterns. Micro-DSC was performed on 2 : 3 DPPC : DSPC small unilamellar vesicles with incorporated polyphenols at physiological pH and the results were integrated using complementary NMR data. The study highlighted the molecular determinants and mechanisms involved in the stilbenoid–membrane interaction, and the results were well correlated with the microbiological evidence previously assessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella enterica 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVitis 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3acalorimetry 3acell membranes 3afood contamination 3apH 3apolyphenols 3aresveratrol 3athermodynamics1 aMazzini, Stefania1 aMattio, Luce1 aSignorelli, Marco1 aDallavalle, Sabrina1 aPinto, Andrea1 aFessas, Dimitrios0 tFood & function.g2021 Dec. 13, v. 12, no. 24 p.12490-12502dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26907x2042-650X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1fo01982a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010600166520151400272592002801786650001501814650001501829650002201844650002001866650002001886650001601906650002501922650001101947650001301958650001901971653002201990653002502012653001702037653001402054653002202068700001802090700001802108700001802126700002002144700001902164700002002183700002202203700006002225700001702285700001802302700005802320773011202378856008302490852000902573655001202582IND60724254720221119075035.0220321e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1129962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBong, Ji-Hong10aSwitching-peptides for one-step immunoassay and its application to the diagnosis of human hepatitis B  aHerein, we present switching-peptides for a one-step immunoassay, without the need for additional antibody treatment or washing steps to detect antigen–antibody interactions. Fluorescently labeled switching-peptides were dissociated from the immobilized antibody soon after the antigens were bound to the binding pockets. In this study, four different parts of the antibody (IgG) frame regions were chemically synthesized, and these peptides were bound to immobilized antibodies as switching-peptides. We presented the design principle of switching-peptides and used Pymol software, based on the changes in thermodynamic parameters, to study the interaction between antibodies and switching-peptides. The binding properties of switching-peptides were analyzed based on Förster resonance energy transfer between switching-peptides as well as between switching-peptides and antibodies (IgGs) isolated from different animals. The binding constants of the four switching-peptides to antibodies were estimated to be in the range of 1.48–3.29 μM. Finally, the feasibility of using switching-peptides for the quantitative one-step immunoassay was demonstrated by human hepatitis B surface antigen (hHBsAg) detection and statistical comparison of the assay results with those of conventional ELISA. The limit of detection for HBsAg was determined to be 56 ng/mL, and the dynamic range was estimated to be 136 ng/mL–33 μg/mL. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the one-step immunoassay for HBsAg.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3acomputer software 3adetection limit 3aenergy transfer 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahumans 3apeptides 3athermodynamics 0aSwitching-peptide 0aOne-step immunoassay 0aFrame region 0aHepatitis 0aMedical diagnosis1 aKim, Hong-Rae1 aJung, Jaeyong1 aPark, Jun-Hee1 aSung, Jeong Soo1 aLee, Chang Kyu1 aChoi, Kyung-Hak1 aShin, Seong-Shick1 aKang, Min-jŏng,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1398-20371 aKim, Hyun Ok1 aLee, Do Young1 aPyun, Jae-Chul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9954-68600 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 178 p.112996-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1129963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005500147245008200202300001600284520130300300592002801603650002201631650001601653650001501669650001301684650001601697650001301713650002401726650001201750650002301762650001301785650002001798650001601818650002101834700001201855700001601867700002201883700001601905700001801921700002401939773012401963856008102087852000902168655001202177IND60606208720221117235736.0180724e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060620872DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-018-9659-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosen, Carl1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0098-223010aImpact of Agronomic and Storage Practices on Acrylamide in Processed Potatoes  ap. 319-327.  aAcrylamide is a probable carcinogen found in processed potato products. The compound is formed at elevated temperatures by the Maillard reaction from two primary precursors - reducing sugars (fructose and glucose) and asparagine. Significant advances have been made in reducing acrylamide formation by selecting varieties with low precursor concentrations through conventional breeding or genetic modification techniques. However, acrylamide in many of the traditional varieties processed for fries or chips is sometimes found at elevated levels. Both agronomic and storage practices can significantly influence glucose, fructose, and asparagine concentrations and therefore the potential to form acrylamide during processing. This summary of a symposium presentation given at the 99th Annual Potato Association of American Meeting is to provide a general overview of previous studies that have examined the effects of agronomic factors such as nutrient and water management and storage factors such as temperature and duration on acrylamide precursors and/or acrylamide in processed potato products. A better understanding of how these factors affect acrylamide precursors is a first step in minimizing acrylamide formation during processing and improving the quality of processed potato products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3aacrylamides 3aasparagine 3abreeding 3acarcinogens 3afructose 3agenetic engineering 3aglucose 3aheirloom varieties 3apotatoes 3areducing sugars 3atemperature 3awater management1 aSun, Na1 aOlsen, Nora1 aThornton, Michael1 aPavek, Mark1 aKnowles, Lisa1 aRichard Knowles, N.0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2018 Aug., v. 95, no. 4 p.319-327dSpringer USwJournal:jnl56713x1099-209X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-018-9659-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002600192245008800218300001600306506007600322520086400398592002801262596008501290506003701375650001201412650001001424650001601434650002601450650002901476650001801505650002601523650001301549653001801562653002401580653002501604653002501629653004301654653001801697653001901715700001801734700002101752700001701773700002301790700001801813700001901831773012501850856008501975852000902060655001202069IND60689221120221207075742.0200420e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922112DNAL7 a10.3109/07388551.2016.11676672doi7 aPMC50832212pmcid7 a270934732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafavieh, Mohammadali10aAdvances in Candida detection platforms for clinical and point-of-care applications  ap. 441-458.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInvasive candidiasis remains one of the most serious community and healthcare-acquired infections worldwide. Conventional Candida detection methods based on blood and plate culture are time-consuming and require at least 2–4 days to identify various Candida species. Despite considerable advances for candidiasis detection, the development of simple, compact and portable point-of-care diagnostics for rapid and precise testing that automatically performs cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, purification and detection still remains a challenge. Here, we systematically review most prominent conventional and nonconventional techniques for the detection of various Candida species, including Candida staining, blood culture, serological testing and nucleic acid-based analysis.

Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags (or microchips) generally have high retention rates; however, tag loss rates for small mammals such as insectivorous bats are poorly understood. We double‐marked a population of Gould's wattled bats (Chalinolobus gouldii) with forearm bands and PIT tags (with the injection site sealed with surgical adhesive) in January and February 2020 to determine rates of subsequent tag loss over the short‐ (1–2 months) and medium‐ (13–14 months) term. Loss of PIT tags occurred in 4 (2.7%) of 146 recaptured individuals, all within 2 months of microchipping. We also recorded 1 occurrence of band loss 11 months after banding. Our study supports assertions that PIT‐tag retention rates in small mammals are high, and suggests that rates of tag loss in small bat species are low when surgical adhesive is applied. Quantifying the rate of tag loss enables this variable to be incorporated into mark‐recapture models. © 2021 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aarms (limbs) 3ainjectable transponders 3ainjection site 3ainsectivores 3amark-recapture studies 3awildlife 3awildlife management1 aLentini, Pia E.1 aEastick, Danielle L.1 aBender, Robert1 aLumsden, Lindy F.1 aVisintin, Casey1 aGriffiths, Stephen R.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2021 Nov., v. 85, no. 8 p.1739-1743dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.221143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245007700209520156800286592002801854650001501882650002101897650001301918650002101931650001401952650001201966650001401978650002201992650001602014650002002030650002002050650001102070650001302081650001602094653002702110653001402137653003402151653002002185653002202205700006002227773011202287856008302399852000902482655001202491IND60724254820221119075218.0220321e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1129972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Nicole L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9970-116X10aOxidase-loaded hydrogels for versatile potentiometric metabolite sensing  aContinuous monitoring of biological metabolites of interest necessitates sensors that are robust, versatile, miniaturizable, and reliable. Electrochemical biosensors have dominated the field of biosensors for decades due to their robust and inexpensive nature. Classically, these sensors use amperometric and voltammetric methods as the sensing modality. One of the greatest limitations with these methods is the dependence of the signal (current, i) on the electrode size, which can change with respect to time due to fouling. Here, we present open circuit potential, an electrochemical technique that is relatively insensitive to electrode size, as a reliable alternative to amperometric and voltammetric techniques for monitoring metabolites of interest. The sensor operates by trapping an oxidase enzyme in a chitosan hydrogel. The oxidase enzyme is required for metabolite specificity. When the oxidase enzyme meets its substrate, oxygen is consumed, and hydrogen peroxide is generated. Hydrogen peroxide generation dominates a half reaction at the platinum surface, resulting in a change in potential. Using the above criteria, we demonstrate the efficacy, long lifetime, sensitivity, and ease of fabrication of glucose sensors, and miniaturize the sensors from macro- to microelectrodes. Additionally, we demonstrate the ease with which this platform can be extended to detect other analytes in the form of a galactose sensor. Our results set a foundation for the generalized use of potentiometric sensors for a broad range of metabolites and applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3achemical species 3achitosan 3aelectrochemistry 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ametabolites 3amicroelectrodes 3aoxidoreductases 3aoxygen 3aplatinum 3avoltammetry 0aOpen circuit potential 0aBiosensor 0aContinuous glucose monitoring 0aGlucose oxidase 0aGalactose oxidase1 aDick, Jeffrey E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4538-97050 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 178 p.112997-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1129973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245007400172300001600246520155500262592002801817650001401845650001001859650001601869650001001885650002401895650001401919650000901933650002201942650001501964650001301979650002001992650002502012650001402037650002102051650002702072700002502099700002502124773010502149856008202254852000902336655001202345IND60623987820221116141253.0181129e199307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062398782DNAL7 a10.1177/0260106093009003072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunnane, Stephen C.14aThe Importance of Energy and Nutrient Supply in Human Brain Evolution  ap. 219-235.  aCurrent evolutionary theories do not adequately address the question of how the human brain evolved to be larger and more sophisticated than that of other primates. The human brain/body weight ratio is 4–5 times higher than in primates and, relative to the rest of the body, requires up to 10 times as much energy as in other land-based mammals. Human brain evolution must therefore have required a stable food supply providing a reliable source of both high dietary energy and a cluster of ‘brain-specific’ nutrients over a long period of time. These nutrient and energy requirements are available in the marine and shore-based food chain but are difficult if not impossible to obtain in the terrestrial food chain. We suggest that marine and estuarine ecosystems provided hominids with the appropriate stimulus to develop a relatively large brain. This occurred in conjunction with the evolution of other uniquely human features, particularly relative hairlessness, bipedalism and abundant neonatal subcutaneous fat. Invertebrates, molluscs, small or slow-moving fish, and marine algae would have provided a stable, abundant supply of energy, long chain polyunsaturates and other nutrients essential for the brain and would have done so with comparatively little mammalian competition. The land-water interface would thus have allowed the hominid brain to develop sufficient neurological complexity to enable sophisticated tool and behaviour patterns to evolve in humans as a· natural sequel to such a biochemical and environmental stimulus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHominidae 3aalgae 3abody weight 3abrain 3aenergy requirements 3aestuaries 3afish 3afood availability 3afood chain 3amolluscs 3aneurophysiology 3anutrient utilization 3anutrients 3asubcutaneous fat 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aHarbige, Laurence S.1 aCrawford, Michael A.0 tNutrition and health.g, v. 9, no. 3 p.219-235dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl34213x0260-10607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0260106093009003073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03303naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014500163500001900308520178300327592002802110650002502138650002202163650003502185650001302220650001002233650002102243650001802264650001302282650001602295650001502311650001902326650001302345653005002358653002502408653002702433653002302460653003402483653001502517700001502532700001702547700001302564700001402577700001402591773011202605856008302717852000902800655001202809IND60724254920221119075110.0210212e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072425492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2021.1129982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZong, Chen10aImaging sensor array coupled with dual-signal amplification strategy for ultrasensitive chemiluminescence immunoassay of multiple mycotoxins  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel chemiluminescence (CL) immunosensor array in combination with a dual-signal amplification strategy was developed for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of multiple mycotoxins in herbal medicine. The multi-component immunosensor array was constructed by immobilizing different bovine serum albumin combined mycotoxins on the corresponding sites of the aldehyde-modified glass slide. After competitive immunoreactions, CL triggered by signal tags captured on all the sensing sites can be collected by a charge-coupled device simultaneously for joint detection of several mycotoxins. By assembling a high ratio of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and IgG on the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a biofunctionalized complex named HRP@AuNP-IgG was prepared and served as the primary signal tag to amplify the CL signals. Then, by introducing tyramine signal amplification (TSA) technique, a new round of HRP could deposit around the HRP@AuNP-IgG, which brought the secondary CL amplification. As a proof of concept, the CL imaging sensor array was applied to the trace detection of citrinin, aflatoxin B₁ and ochratoxins A in red yeast rice samples. Under optimal conditions, it exhibited wide linear ranges over 4 orders of magnitude and much lower limits of detection than previous works. Owing to the excellent sensitivity (50–57-fold signal amplification and detection limits down to sub-pM level), acceptable throughput (20 tests h⁻¹), small amounts of reagents (3.5 μL for each test), simple sample pretreatment (no necessary of separation for 3 mycotoxins), high selectivity, acceptable stability and accuracy, the proposed sensing platform showed broad prospects in the joint monitoring of low-abundant mycotoxins and safety evaluation of herbal medicines.  aPublisher supplied data 3abovine serum albumin 3achemiluminescence 3achemiluminescence immunoassays 3acitrinin 3aglass 3aherbal medicines 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3aochratoxins 3aperoxidase 3ared yeast rice 3atyramine 0aMulti-component chemiluminescence immunoassay 0aImaging sensor array 0aHorseradish peroxidase 0aGold nanoparticles 0aTyramine signal amplification 0aMycotoxins1 aJiang, Fan1 aWang, Xiaoyu1 aLi, Ping1 aXu, Linru1 aYang, Hua0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 177 p.112998-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.1129983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03497naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100001200185245009600197300001800293506007600311506003100387520184900418592002802267596008302295506003702378650002502415650001102440650001302451650002002464650003102484650001702515650001302532650001002545650002602555650001202581650001802593650001302611650001102624650001002635653002702645653002602672653001202698653001402710653001602724700001202740700001502752773010902767856008202876852000902958655001202967IND60707392220221207103605.0210311e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070739222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.07.0402chorus7 a10.1016/j.psj.2020.07.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, K.10aDelayed access to feed affects broiler small intestinal morphology and goblet cell ontogeny  ap. 5275-5285.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aBroilers are often deprived of feed and water for up to 48 h after hatch. This delayed access to feed (DAF) can inhibit small intestine development. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of DAF on small intestinal morphology, mRNA abundance of the goblet cell marker Muc2 and absorptive cell marker PepT1, and the distribution of goblet cells in young broilers. Cobb 500 chicks, hatching within a 12-h window, were randomly allocated into 3 groups: control with no feed delay (ND), 24-h feed delay (DAF24), and 36-h feed delay (DAF36). Morphology, gene expression, and in situ hybridization analyses were conducted on the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum at 0, 24, 36, 72, 120, and 168 h after hatch. Statistical analysis was performed using a t test for ND and DAF24 at 24 h. A 2-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test (P < 0.05) were used for ND, DAF24, and DAF36 from 36 h. At 24 to 36 h, DAF decreased the ratio of villus height/crypt depth (VH/CD) in the duodenum but increased VH/CD in the ileum due to changes in CD, whereas at 72 h, DAF decreased VH/CD due to a decrease in VH. The mRNA abundance of PepT1 was upregulated, while Muc2 mRNA was downregulated in DAF chicks. Cells expressing Muc2 mRNA were present along the villi and in the crypts. The ratio of the number of goblet cells found in the upper half to the lower half of the villus was greater in DAF chicks than in ND chicks, suggesting that DAF affected the appearance of new goblet cells. The number of Muc2 mRNA-expressing cells in the crypt, however, was generally not affected by DAF. In conclusion, DAF transiently affected small intestinal morphology, upregulated PepT1 mRNA, downregulated Muc2 mRNA, and changed the distribution of goblet cells in the villi. By 168 h, however, these parameters were not different between ND, DAF24, and DAF36 chicks.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3achicks 3aduodenum 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agoblet cells 3ahatching 3aileum 3ain situ hybridization 3ajejunum 3amessenger RNA 3aontogeny 3at-test 3avilli 0adelayed access to feed 0apeptide transporter 1 0amucin 2 0astem cell 0agoblet cell1 aJia, M.1 aWong, E.A.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Nov., v. 99, no. 11 p.5275-5285dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.07.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245007400166300001600240520161700256592002801873650001401901650003101915650001601946650002301962650002001985650001202005650002102017650001102038650001402049700002902063700003102092773009302123856004502216852000902261655001202270IND50069002720130904000000.0130904e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006900272DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2012002412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyakabau, Tatenda10aEffect of steeping additives on tef starch extraction and its quality  ap. 738-746.  aTef is an indigenous African cereal and considered as lost crop of Africa. There is no research on the effect of steeping additives on the quality of isolated tef starch. A white tef grain was milled and steeped in distilled water, sodium hydroxide, lactic acid, metabisulfite, and a combination of lactic acid and metabisulfite. A combination of metabisulfite and lactic acid improves the starch yield, but steeping with sodium hydroxide produces the highest starch purity (lowest protein content). Both the Rapid Visco Analyzer and a Rheometer showed similar pasting properties of starches independent of the treatment. The different steeping additives showed differences in pasting properties. Sodium hydroxide showed the highest peak, breakdown and set back viscosity compared to the other steeping additives. Extracted tef starches using sodium hydroxide as steeping additives also showed higher gelatinization temperatures. According to principle component analysis (PCA), the different properties of tef starch extracted with sodium hydroxide steeping is apparently due to its lower protein content. SEM and CLSM indicated that sodium hydroxide is a very effective solvent to solubilize the protein matrix surrounding the compound starch granule to produce more single starch granule during extraction. The low protein content probably result in faster water absorption and higher peak viscosity and lower pasting temperature. Different steeping additives can affect the functionality of tef starches and this need to be considered when comparing properties of starches extracted with different additives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3agelatinization temperature 3alactic acid 3apasting properties 3aprotein content 3asoaking 3asodium hydroxide 3astarch 3aviscosity1 aWokadala, Obiro Cuthbert1 aEmmambux, Mohammad Naushad0 tStärke =.g2013 Sept., v. 65, no. 9‐10 p.738-746dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201200241  aDNAL 7aarticle01429naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245013400153300001800287520037500305592002800680650001200708650002100720650002800741650001400769650001300783650002100796650002400817700001900841700002200860700002100882773010400903856007501007852000901082655001201091IND60578681520221121033148.0170813e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057868152DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400713t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Zuo10aRegioselective [2 + 2] Cycloaddition of a Fullerene Dimer with an Alkyne Triggered by Thermolysis of an Interfullerene C–C Bond  ap. 2176-2178.  aHeating of a singly bonded fullerene dimer in the presence of an alkyne forms a cyclobutene structure on only one of the two fullerene moieties, through a stereo- and regioselective [2 + 2] cycloaddition.

A total of one thousand one hundred fifty-two 30-wk-old, Hy-Line Brown hens were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 groups (192 laying hens per group) with 6 replicates of 32 birds each, fed a basal diet (without Se supplementation), basal diet with 0.3 mg/kg of Se from sodium selenite (SS) or basal diets with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 mg/kg of Se from SY, respectively. The results showed that the Se concentrations in the eggs and breasts from hens fed a SY-supplemented diet were significantly higher than those from hens fed a SS-supplemented diet or a basal diet (P < 0.001). There was a positive linear and quadratic correlation between Se concentrations in the eggs from hens fed a SY-supplemented diet and dietary Se supplementation on days 28, 56, and 84 (r² = 0.931, 0.932, 0.976, P < 0.001; r² = 0.946, 0.935, 0.976, P < 0.001), respectively. The Se deposition efficiency in whole eggs from hens fed a basal or SY-supplemented diet weresignificantly higher than those in eggs from hens fed a SS-supplemented diet on days 28, 56, and 84 (P < 0.001), respectively. In addition, there was a positive linear and quadratic correlation between Se concentrations in the eggs from hens fed SY-supplemented diet (r² = 0.655, 0.779, 0.874, 0.781, P < 0.001; r² = 0.666, 0.863, 0.944, 0.781, P < 0.001) or SS-supplemented diet (r² = 0.363, P = 0.002; r² = 0.440, P = 0.002) and number of feeding days. In conclusion, the organic Se from SY has higher bioavailability and deposition efficiency of Se in whole eggs as compared with inorganic Se from SS. The Se concentrations and Se deposition efficiency in the eggs increased from hens fed a SS- or SY-supplemented diet but decreased from hens fed a basal diet with the extension of the experimental duration. The results indicate that the dietary Se supplementation from SY should be limited to a maximum of 0.1 mg Se/kg complete feed when the eggs and meat produced from hens fed a SY-supplemented diet are used as food for humans directly, whereas up to 0.4 mg/kg organic Se from SY can be used to supplement the diets for laying hens when the products are used as raw materials for producing Se-enriched food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal performance 3abioavailability 3abreasts 3adietary mineral supplements 3aegg quality 3aeggs 3ahen feeding 3ahumans 3alaying hens 3ameat 3amineral content 3araw materials 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3ayeasts 0aselenium-enriched yeast 0aefficacy evaluation 0aegg selenium deposition 0adeposition efficiency 0alaying hens1 aQu, L.1 aMa, M.1 aLi, Y.F.1 aWang, X.G.1 aYang, Z.1 aWang, K.H.0 tPoultry science.g2020 Nov., v. 99, no. 11 p.6267-6277dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2020.07.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006200168300001600230520105800246592002801304650002601332650001601358650001101374650001301385650001301398650002601411650001201437650002301449650001301472650001801485650002401503653001801527653001801545653001501563653001201578653002501590653002701615653001301642700003001655700002101685700002101706700002101727700001701748700002101765773012501786856008501911852000901996655001202005IND60689221420221117024744.0200420e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922142DNAL7 a10.1080/07388551.2016.11853892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAssa, Farnaz10aChitosan magnetic nanoparticles for drug delivery systems  ap. 492-509.  aThe potential of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in drug delivery systems (DDSs) is mainly related to its magnetic core and surface coating. These coatings can eliminate or minimize their aggregation under physiological conditions. Also, they can provide functional groups for bioconjugation to anticancer drugs and/or targeted ligands. Chitosan, as a derivative of chitin, is an attractive natural biopolymer from renewable resources with the presence of reactive amino and hydroxyl functional groups in its structure. Chitosan nanoparticles (NPs), due to their huge surface to volume ratio as compared to the chitosan in its bulk form, have outstanding physico-chemical, antimicrobial and biological properties. These unique properties make chitosan NPs a promising biopolymer for the application of DDSs. In this review, the current state and challenges for the application magnetic chitosan NPs in drug delivery systems were investigated. The present review also revisits the limitations and commercial impediments to provide insight for future works.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3abiopolymers 3achitin 3achitosan 3acoatings 3adrug delivery systems 3aligands 3amagnetic materials 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3arenewable resources 0aBiocompatible 0abiodegradable 0abiomedical 0acarrier 0adrug delivery system 0amagnetic nanoparticles 0atoxicity1 aJafarizadeh-Malmiri, Hoda1 aAjamein, Hossein1 aVaghari, Hamideh1 aAnarjan, Navideh1 aAhmadi, Omid1 aBerenjian, Aydin0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2017 May 19, v. 37, no. 4 p.492-509dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2016.11853893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008300164300001400247520115200261592002801413650003201441650001501473650001301488650001901501650001401520650001901534650004201553650003001595650001201625650002001637650001201657650001901669650001401688650002401702650002101726650002901747650001101776700001501787700001901802700001801821700001901839773009601858856008001954852000902034655001202043IND60083071920221118184330.0141101e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008307192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2012.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyo, Shintaro10aTransplantation of the GAL regulon into G-protein signaling circuitry in yeast  ap. 27-31.  aHere we present a successful transplantation of the GAL genetic regulatory circuitry into the G-protein signaling pathway in yeast. The GAL regulon represents a strictly regulated transcriptional mechanism that we have transplanted into yeast to create a highly robust induction system to assist the detection of on–off switching in G-protein signaling. In our system, we engineered yeast to drive the positive GAL regulatory gene in response to agonist-promoted G-protein signaling and to induce transcription of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene under the control of the GAL structural gene promoter. Consequently, in response to agonist stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the engineered yeast achieved more than a 150-fold increase in reporter intensity in up to 98% of cells, as determined by flow cytometric sorting. Surprisingly, agonist-stimulated induction of the GFP reporter gene was higher than that by galactose. Our approach to boost reporter gene induction could be applicable in establishing more efficient yeast-based flow cytometric screening systems for agonistic ligands for heterogeneous GPCRs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aG-proteins 3aagonists 3aflow cytometry 3agalactose 3agene induction 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aligands 3aregulator genes 3aregulon 3areporter genes 3ascreening 3asignal transduction 3astructural genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aIshii, Jun1 aIguchi, Yusuke1 aFukuda, Nobuo1 aKondo, Akihiko0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2012 May 1, v. 424, no. 1 p.27-31dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2012.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008200166300001800248500002000266520170300286592002801989650001502017650001902032650001502051650002402066650001302090650001202103650001002115650001602125650001902141650001502160650001402175650002502189650003302214650001302247650001402260650002202274650001202296700002002308700002402328700002102352773012802373856007902501852000902580655001202589IND60587336620221122051421.0180102e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058733662DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.128312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClaflin, Suzi B.10aCrop‐dominated landscapes have higher vector‐borne plant virus prevalence  ap. 1190-1198.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLandscape composition affects local arthropod biodiversity, including herbivorous insects and their predators, yet to date landscape effects on insect‐vectored plant diseases have received little attention. Here, we examine how landscape composition affects the prevalence of a viral pathogen in host plants, and the role the arthropod vector assemblage plays in mediating landscape effects. We measured the effect of landscape composition (measured as percentage of cropland and unmanaged land) on the plant virus Potato virus Y (PVY), its aphid vectors, and their coccinellid predators during the 2012 and 2013 field seasons at 19–21 farms. In both years, we found a positive relationship between final virus prevalence and percentage of cropland within 500, 1000 and 1500 m surrounding study sites. Percentage of cropland also had a significant negative effect on aphid species richness, and the aphid community composition in turn affected PVY prevalence. By contrast, landscape composition had no measurable effect on coccinellid abundance or species richness in this study. Synthesis and applications. Our work demonstrates that landscape composition plays an important role in vector‐borne pathogen spread, and that pathogen spread appears to be mediated by the effects of the landscape on the insect vector community. The small spatial scale (≤1500 m) of the effects seen in our study indicates that on‐farm management practices have the potential to reduce virus prevalence on small‐scale farms. Farmers may be able to reduce Potato virus Y prevalence by on‐farm diversification, by isolating potato fields from other agricultural crops, and by not using saved potato seed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aPotato virus Y 3aarthropods 3acommunity structure 3acropland 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahost plants 3ainsect vectors 3alandscapes 3apathogens 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant diseases and disorders 3apotatoes 3apredators 3aspecies diversity 3aviruses1 aJones, Laura E.1 aThaler, Jennifer S.1 aPower, Alison G.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2017 Aug., v. 54, no. 4 p.1190-1198dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.128313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245013700207520131800344592002801662650001901690650002701709650001501736650001001751650003601761650001001797650002001807650003901827650001801866650001601884650002101900650001301921650000701934650001901941650001201960650002401972650002301996650001802019653001702037653001102054653001202065653002002077700002002097700001402117700001402131700001302145700001802158773009602176856008702272852000902359655001202368IND60743014520221122225004.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074301452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1083682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qian-Da1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0263-306910aPine needle extract from Cedrus deodara: Potential applications on hazardous chemicals and quality of smoked bacon and its mechanism  aEffect of pine needle extract from Cedrus deodara (PNE) on the quality and safety of Chinese traditional smoked bacon was observed, and its action mechanism was further investigated. With the treatment of PNE, the quality properties of smoked bacon, including moisture content, pH and titratable acidity values, color, texture and volatile compositions, were all ameliorated. Meanwhile, the peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid value (TBARS) and nitrite content of smoked bacon with PNE decreased. In addition, the content of N-nitrosodimethylamine in smoked bacon gradually decreased with the increased concentration of PNE. Moreover, the heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were not detected in smoked bacon with PNE, while the types and contents of light PAHs in smoked bacon were both reduced by PNE. With the measurement of fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy, the secondary and tertiary structures of myofibrillar protein in smoked bacon were both changed though the treatment of PNE. Furthermore, according to the analysis of molecular docking, hydrogen bond was the main molecular force between PNE and meat proteins in smoked bacon. All present results suggested that PNE had the potential value to improve the quality and safety of smoked bacon in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrus deodara 3aN-nitrosodimethylamine 3aacid value 3abacon 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acolor 3aconifer needles 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afood industry 3afood safety 3ahydrogen bonding 3anitrites 3apH 3aperoxide value 3atexture 3athiobarbituric acid 3atitratable acidity 3awater content 0aSmoked bacon 0aSafety 0aQuality 0aMolecular force1 aZhou, Zhi-Qiang1 aJing, Zan1 aHe, Qiang1 aSun, Qun1 aZeng, Wei-Cai0 tFood control.g2021 Dec., v. 130 p.108368-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1083683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245008500171300001300256520136800269592002801637650001101665650001501676650002901691650001501720650001101735650001601746650001601762650002101778651001001799651002001809653001101829653001701840653002001857653000901877653001701886653001701903773011201920856008002032852000902112655001202121IND60623988220221116142735.0181129e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062398822DNAL7 a10.1177/23210249134830402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarasimha Reddy, D.,10aFormal Credit and Rural Occupational Diversification: Recent Experience in India  ap. 1-24.  aDuring the past two decades, India has been acclaimed as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. But the pace of growth is not reflected in the expansion of employment opportunities, especially in rural areas. Vast majority of labour force in rural areas are concentrated in agriculture and other low productive activities. The kind of diversification in rural employment witnessed as a part of development process in rural South East Asia is hardly in evidence in India. This article analyzes the experience of promotion of rural occupational diversification with reference to credit flow with particular reference to the Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgari Yojana (SGSY). The article discusses the growing demographic pressure in rural areas and the crowding of workforce in the agriculture sector and analyzes broadly the role of non-farm sector in rural occupational diversification and discusses the state of rural non-farm sector and non-farm enterprises in India. It goes on to analyze the credit related problems of micro and small enterprises and concludes by referring to the need for not only improving the supply of credit flow to rural households for income generating activities but also strengthening the demand side by strengthening the capabilities of the rural household through capacity building and appropriate institutional arrangements.  aPublisher supplied data 3acredit 3aemployment 3aemployment opportunities 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alabor force 3arural areas 3asmall businesses 3aIndia 3aSouth East Asia 0acredit 0aoccupational 0adiversification 0aSGSY 0arural labour 0arural income0 tJournal of land and rural studies.g, v. 1, no. 1 p.1-24dSAGE PublicationswJournal:26867x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23210249134830403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245005000164300001800214520123900232592002801471650002001499650001201519650001001531650001901541650002301560650002201583650003301605650001901638653001001657653002101667653002001688700001501708700001701723700001401740773011301754856008001867852000901947655001201956IND60616622520221121111932.0181018e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061662252DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175124602972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Jinjiang10aCompressibility of the kapok fibrous assembly  ap. 1020-1029.  aIn this paper we study the compressibility of kapok fibrous assemblies via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image observations on kapok microstructures and measurements obtained from Kawabata Evaluation System (KES) compression testing. The assemblies, made of slightly carded kapok fibers, were treated in different levels of relative humidity (dry or wet) and pressure (0 or 100 kPa) conditions. The SEM images of the treated samples revealed that kapok fibers were initially hollow and circular, but could be crushed partially or totally to become thin ribbons after being pressed with a 100 kPa pressure. Over 80% of the fibers in the wet-pressure-treated assembly appeared to be crushed. In the KES testing, the compressional resilience, bulkiness and other parameters of the kapok assemblies were calculated from the compression curves. The results showed that the compressional resilience of the dry-treated kapok assemblies was better than that of the wet-treated assemblies; the bulkiness of both the dry- and wet-treated assemblies was reduced after the pressure treatment, but in the wet assemblies kapok hollow structures and interspaces among fibers were much easier to be squeezed than those of the dry assemblies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompressibility 3afabrics 3akapok 3amicrostructure 3apressure treatment 3arelative humidity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atextile fibers 0akapok 0afibrous assembly 0acompressibility1 aFang, Chao1 aWang, Fu-Mei1 aXu, Bugao0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 83, no. 10 p.1020-1029dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175124602973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010300162300001800265520053800283592002800821650001200849650001500861650003600876650002300912650002500935650001300960650001500973650001600988650001701004650002101021650001301042700001901055700002501074700002101099700002301120773010401143856007501247852000901322655001201331IND60578681720221121033129.0170813e20130503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057868172DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400729v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPayne, Philippa R.10aTantalum Catalyzed Hydroaminoalkylation for the Synthesis of α- and β-Substituted N-Heterocycles  ap. 2182-2185.  aUnprotected secondary amines are directly alkylated by C–H functionalization adjacent to nitrogen, thereby opening new routes toward the synthesis of α- and β-alkylated N-heterocycles. α-Alkylated piperidine, piperazine, and azepane products are prepared from heterocycles and alkenes in an atom-economic reaction with excellent regio- and diastereoselectivity. β-Alkylated N-heterocycles are synthesized via a scalable one-pot alkylation/cyclization procedure generating 3-methylated azetidines, pyrrolidines, and piperidines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aalkylation 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3achemical structure 3adiastereoselectivity 3anitrogen 3apiperazine 3apiperidines 3apyrrolidines 3asecondary amines 3atantalum1 aGarcia, Pierre1 aEisenberger, Patrick1 aYim, Jacky C.-H.1 aSchafer, Laurel L.0 tOrganic letters.g2013 May 03, v. 15, no. 9 p.2182-2185dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fol400729v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010100172300001600273520112600289592002801415650002601443650002601469650001301495650002501508650001201533650001901545650001701564650002901581650001801610650001901628653001801647653001701665653001901682653002101701700001701722700001901739700002001758700001801778700002001796700002501816700002301841700002601864700003001890700001901920773012501939856008502064852000902149655001202158IND60689221620221117024527.0200420e20170519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068922162DNAL7 a10.1080/07388551.2016.11990102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Brahma N.10aBactericidal, quorum quenching and anti-biofilm nanofactories: a new niche for nanotechnologists  ap. 525-540.  aDespite several conventional potent antibacterial therapies, bacterial infections pose a significant threat to human health because they are emerging as the leading cause of death worldwide. Due to the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, there is a pressing demand to discover novel approaches for developing more effective therapies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial strains and biofilm-associated infections. Therefore, attention has been especially devoted to a new and emerging branch of science “nanotechnology” to design non-conventional antimicrobial chemotherapies. A range of nanomaterials and nano-sized carriers for conventional antimicrobial agents have fully justified their potential to combat bacterial diseases by reducing cell viability, by attenuating quorum sensing, and by inhibiting/or eradicating biofilms. This communication summarizes emerging nano-antimicrobial therapies in treating bacterial infections, particularly using antibacterial, quorum quenching, and anti-biofilm nanomaterials as new approaches to tackle the current challenges in combating infectious diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3abiofilm 3acell viability 3ahuman health 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananomaterials 3aquorum sensing 0aAntibacterial 0aanti-biofilm 0ananotoxicology 0aquorum quenching1 aPrateeksha, 1 aUpreti, D.

The objective of this study was to investigate how SBs affect spatiotemporal relationships of these processes to better understand their impacts on soil water development at the smallholder farmer's field level. Study area was the Gumara‐Maksegnit Watershed in northern Ethiopia, where two representative transects were investigated: One transect crossed a 71 m‐long field intersected by 2 SBs traced along the contour. The second transect crossed a similar hillslope without conservation structures at a length of 55 m representing baseline (untreated) conditions (no stone bund). During the rainy season of 2012, bulk density and volumetric water content were monitored, and tension disc infiltrometer experiments were performed to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity and to derive soil water retention characteristics. Our observations show that SB decreased significantly soil bulk density in center and lower zones of SB transect compared with no stone bund. No temporal change was observed. Results targeting the surface soil moisture indicate that infiltration was higher with SB and happened earlier in the rainy season in the zones around the SBs. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was positively affected by SB and increased significantly. Improved soil hydrology by SB fields may increase crop yields by higher soil water contents but also by extending the growing season after the rainy season. Therefore, SBs are a successful measure to establish climate‐resilient agriculture in the Ethiopian Highlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abulk density 3abunds 3acrop yield 3afarmers 3agrowing season 3ahighlands 3ainfiltrometers 3arunoff 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil conservation 3asoil density 3asoil water 3asoil water retention 3atemporal variation 3atopographic slope 3awater conservation 3awater content 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aEthiopia1 aSchürz, Christoph1 aStrohmeier, Stefan1 aDemelash Melaku, Nigus1 aZiadat, Feras1 aSchwen, Andreas1 aZucca, Claudio0 tLand degradation & development.g2018 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.585-595dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.28933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010900171300001600280500001900296520131300315592002801628596008701656650002601743650002401769650001801793650001201811650001201823650001201835650001001847650001701857650001501874650001101889650001201900650001201912650000701924650001901931650001501950700006401965700001902029700001902048700001602067773012802083856008202211852000902293655001202302IND60698263320221119201049.0200610e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069826332DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-019-03215-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChikkerur, Jayaram10aProduction of Short Chain Fructo-oligosaccharides from Inulin of Chicory Root Using Fungal Endoinulinase  ap. 695-715.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aShort chain fructo-oligosaccharides (SC-FOS) are the potential prebiotics possessing diverse applications in both food and feed industries. The present study was aimed to extract inulin from chicory roots followed by its conversion into SC-FOS applying endoinulinase from Aspergillus fumigatus. The inulin was extracted from chicory roots through boiling in hot water, followed by precipitation with ethanol at room temperature or freezing condition. Maximum yield (42%) of inulin was obtained with three volumes of chilled absolute ethanol at room temperature. HPLC analysis of enzymatic hydrolysate detected kestose (GF2), nystose (GF3), and other FOS having higher degree of polymerization (DP). Maximum GF2 (5.79 mg/ml) was detected at temperature 50 °C, pH 5.5 with 2 U of enzyme dose after 6 h of hydrolysis; while maximum GF3 (4.33 mg/ml) was recorded at 60 °C, 5.5 pH with 0.5 U enzyme dose after 2 h of hydrolysis. Nevertheless, complete hydrolysis of inulin was noticed with 99% total oligosaccharide yield at 55 °C, 5.5 pH with 0.5 U enzyme dose after 4 h of hydrolysis with negligible amount of mono- and di-saccharides. The present finding demonstrated the process for higher yield of inulin from chicory roots followed by its conversion into SC-FOS applying fungal endoinulinase.  aPublisher supplied data  aFile No. 09/1158(0002)2K17cCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research, India 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aambient temperature 3abiotechnology 3achicory 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3afungi 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ainulin 3akestose 3anystose 3apH 3apolymerization 3aprebiotics1 aSamanta, Ashis Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1646-294X1 aKolte, Atul P.1 aDhali, Arindam1 aRoy, Sohini0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2020 June, v. 191, no. 2 p.695-715dSpringer USwJournal:jnl32867x0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-019-03215-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245012700136300001400263520171300277592002801990650001902018650002202037650001902059650002702078650001102105650001302116650002602129650001002155650001202165650002502177650001302202650001302215650001102228650001802239650001102257650002802268650001402296650001502310650004302325650001002368650002302378651001302401653002402414653001502438653002202453653002002475653002202495653001902517700002402536700002402560773011902584852000902703655001202712IND60128935020221118004804.0151124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012893502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Chʻang-hyŏn,10aBacterial Communities and Midgut Microbiota Associated with Mosquito Populations from Waste Tires in East-Central Illinois  ap. 63-75.  aMosquito—microbe interactions tend to influence larval nutrition, immunity, and development, as well as fitness and vectorial capacity of adults. Understanding the role of different bacterial species not only improves our knowledge of the physiological and ecological consequences of these interactions, but also provides the basis for developing novel strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases. We used culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques to characterize the bacterial composition and abundance in water and midgut samples of larval and adult females of Aedes japonicus (Theobald), Aedes triseriatus (Say), and Culex restuans (Theobald) collected from waste tires at two wooded study sites in Urbana, IL. The phylum-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay revealed a higher proportion of Actinobacteria and a lower proportion of gamma-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in water samples and larval midguts compared to adult female midguts. Only 15 of the 57 bacterial species isolated in this study occurred in both study sites. The number of bacterial species was highest in water samples (28 species from Trelease Woods; 25 species from South Farms), intermediate in larval midguts (13 species from Ae. japonicus; 12 species from Ae. triseriatus; 8 species from Cx. restuans), and lowest in adult female midguts (2 species from Ae. japonicus; 3 species from Ae. triseriatus). These findings suggest that the composition and richness of bacterial communities varies both between habitats and among mosquito species and that the reduction in bacteria diversity during metamorphosis is more evident among bacteria detected using the culture-dependent method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aAedes triseriatus 3aCulex restuans 3aOchlerotatus japonicus 3aadults 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3afarms 3afemales 3agamma-Proteobacteria 3ahabitats 3aimmunity 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3amidgut 3amosquito-borne diseases 3anutrition 3apopulation 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atires 3avectorial capacity 3aIllinois 0abacterial community 0awaste tire 0amidgut microbiota 0aAedes japonicus 0aAedes triseriatus 0aCulex restuans1 aLampman, Richard L.1 aMuturi, Ephantus J.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2015 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.63-75dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016600160520246500326592002802791650001502819650000902834650001602843650001402859650001302873650001902886650001102905650001502916650002902931651001002960700001402970700001802984700002203002700001403024700001303038773012903051856007403180852000903254655001203263IND60744088520221117175108.0210709e20210629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074408852DNAL7 a10.3390/rs131325412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bingqian 10aRetrieving Three-Dimensional Large Surface Displacements in Coal Mining Areas by Combining SAR Pixel Offset Measurements with an Improved Mining Subsidence Model  aInterferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can obtain one-dimensional surface displacements in the radar line of sight (LOS). In the field of mining subsidence, large 3D movements often occur at the same time, and hence InSAR derived one-dimensional LOS displacements can hardly reflect the actual surface motion in mining areas. To realize the monitoring of three-dimensional large surface displacements in mining areas, a method for monitoring three-dimensional large surface displacements in mining areas that combines SAR pixel offset tracking (OT) and an improved mining subsidence model is proposed in this article. First, a new functional relationship between surface subsidence and horizontal movement combined with the characteristics of the overburden rock stress and the deformation characteristics of the fractured rock mass in coal mining areas is established. Then, a three-dimensional surface deformation model is established based on the proposed relationship between surface subsidence and horizontal movement and the radar projection equation, and finally, the optimal parameters of the deformation model are inverted iteratively using LOS deformation results obtained by OT method to retrieve the three-dimensional large displacements of the surface. The significant advantage of the method proposed in this article is that it can accurately acquire the 3D large surface displacements using only two SAR amplitude images with the same imaging geometry. To verify the accuracy and reliability of the proposed algorithm, two scenes of high-resolution spotlight TerraSAR-X images are used in this paper to conduct a three-dimensional surface displacement monitoring experiment on a working panel in the Daliuta mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, based on the proposed method. Experimental monitoring results show that the maximum surface subsidence is approximately 4.5 m, and the maximum horizontal movements in the strike and dip directions are approximately 1.4 m and 1.2 m, respectively. Using GPS measurements to verify the monitoring results, the root mean square error (RMSE) of vertical subsidence is 6.8 cm, and the RMSE of horizontal movement is 7.1 cm. Compared with those in the original mining subsidence model, the accuracies of vertical subsidence and horizontal movement in the proposed model are increased by 28.2% and 37.5%, respectively, which proves the reliability and accuracy of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoal 3adeformation 3aequations 3ageometry 3ainterferometry 3amodels 3asubsidence 3asynthetic aperture radar 3aChina1 aMei, Han 1 aLi, Zhenhong 1 aWang, Zhengshuai 1 aYu, Yang 1 aYu, Hao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 June 29, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131325413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014400169520214600313592002802459650000902487650002102496650001402517650002502531650001502556650001202571650001902583650002902602650001202631650002002643650003502663650001202698650002002710653003402730653002002764653001902784653003202803653002702835653002702862700002402889773011002913856008703023852000903110655001203119IND60648513720221120124710.0200424e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064851372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.1037312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKusch, Sarah10aEnvironmental impact judgments of meat, vegetarian, and insect burgers: Unifying the negative footprint illusion and quantity insensitivity  aClimate-related risks for natural and human systems increase with global warming. Meat production contributes considerably to global greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in consumption patterns can help reduce this impact – e.g., by replacing meat with plant or insect-based alternatives. For this to happen, it is important to understand how such products are perceived in terms of their environmental impact. Two cognitive biases – the negative footprint illusion and quantity insensitivity – have been shown to affect this perception. The present study (N = 501; MAgₑ = 47.8, SD = 16.8; 48.9% female) tries to replicate both biases in the context of meat, vegetarian, and insect burgers. In an online experiment, participants viewed pictures of a variety of meals and rated their environmental impact on a “carbon footprint scale” (between-subject design). We found that footprint ratings of a prototypic fast food meal consisting of fries, water, and either a vegetarian or an insect burger did not significantly differ from the ratings given to the meal without the burger (“negative footprint illusion”), while the addition of a meat burger increased the rating. Furthermore, we found that participants’ judgments were insensitive to the quantity of the presented burgers, and they reacted only to the type of the burger patty (“quantity insensitivity”). We did not find that “green consumer values” – the tendency to express the value of environmental conservation through one’s purchase and consumption behavior – influenced the estimation. Throughout all conditions, beef burgers consistently received higher footprint ratings than vegetarian and insect burgers. While we could not strictly replicate the original results, we conclude that our findings are still consistent with previous studies and can enrich the understanding of the underlying cognitive processes causing them. Specifically, we propose that both biases can be attributed to the same general-purpose heuristic of intuitive judgment – namely, “attribute substitution”, and the “prototype heuristic” in particular.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acarbon footprint 3acognition 3aenvironmental impact 3afast foods 3afemales 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainsects 3ameat production 3anatural resources conservation 3apatties 3avegetarian diet 0aEnvironmental impact judgment 0aMeat substitute 0aEdible insects 0aNegative footprint illusion 0aQuantity insensitivity 0aAttribute substitution1 aFiebelkorn, Florian0 tFood quality and preference.g2019 Dec., v. 78 p.103731-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.1037313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006300169300001600232520098100248592002801229650001601257650001901273650002401292650002101316650001301337653004101350653003301391653002301424653003601447700001201483700001901495700001801514773008601532856008401618852000901702655001201711IND60603681120221119120833.0180716e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060368112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.07.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Jiandong10aNonlinear modeling of regenerative cycle micro gas turbine  ap. 168-175.  aIn this paper, a nonlinear mathematical model of modern regenerative MGT (micro gas turbine) with superior accuracy is developed.

However, the uncontrollable plating-stripping process and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer can induce electrode degradation, which hinders its potential applications. In this work, the synergy effects of a composite Na metal anode and fluorine-rich electrolyte were introduced to investigate the Na⁺ plating-stripping process and its potential use in Na-metal batteries (SMBs). The composite anode was fabricated via alloying and capillary action between the sodiophilic carbon matrix and molten Na metal, thus forming an integrated structure, which effectively improved the interconnection between Na and carbon scaffold to obtain uniform deposition. Combined with the fluorine-rich electrolyte, stable SEI layers consisting of ion-permeable NaF and mechanically durable organic components were obtained. When coupled with an Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃ cathode with a high mass loading of ∼9 mg cm⁻², an ultra-stable cycling behaviour (capacity retention of >90% over 1000 cycles) and outstanding rate performance (capacity retention of >80% at 15C) were observed due to the improved Na deposition process and interface stability. This work demonstrates that the synergy effects of the composite metal anode and electrolyte modification can be an effective strategy to fabricate highly stable SMBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acapillarity 3acarbon 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3asodium 3asodium fluoride1 aZhao, Chenglong1 aLv, Xiaohui1 aLu, Yaxiang1 aLin, Kui1 aZhang, Shaoqiong1 aKang, Feiyu1 aHu, Yong-Sheng1 aLi, Baohua0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Nov. 5, v. 7, no. 43 p.24857-24867dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta06877e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03696naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245011900213520197000332592002802302650001502330650002302345650001702368650001402385650001702399650001202416650002202428650002402450650001102474650001102485650001302496650001202509650002202521650001102543650001202554650000902566650001002575650002102585650002002606650001002626650001302636650004402649651001202693653001502705653001002720653001102730653002002741653001502761653001202776653002202788700001902810700002002829700001802849700002302867773009602890856008702986852000903073655001203082IND60648513820221120114943.0190719e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064851382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1067242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGambacorta, Lucia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8870-819810aIncidence and levels of Alternaria mycotoxins in spices and herbs produced worldwide and commercialized in Lebanon  aThe emerging Alternaria mycotoxins tenuazonic acid (TeA), alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), altenuene (ALT) and tentoxin (TTX) are not yet regulated worldwide awaiting for more data on their toxicity and natural occurrence. A total of 131 samples of spices (94) and herbs (37) were collected in Beirut (Lebanon) markets and analysed for TeA, AOH, AME, ALT and TTX by using a UPLC-MS/MS method based on ‘extract, dilute and shoot’ approach. High percentage (89%) of samples were contaminated by 1–5 mycotoxins whereas 14% of samples were contaminated with a mixture of TeA, AOH, AME and TTX. TeA was the predominant mycotoxin with the highest percentages of positive samples (76%), followed by AME (46%), TTX (37%), AOH (34%) and ALT (5%) with overall mean/max levels of 2453.2/106792.8, 17.1/306, 14.8/179.4, 35.0/636.4 and 2.8/22.1 μg/kg, respectively (middle bound approach). Higher percentage of positive samples and mean mycotoxin levels were observed in spices as compared to herbs. The spices with higher levels of mycotoxin contamination were, in descending order, red chili, paprika, caraway, coriander seeds, onion powder, white pepper and garlic powder whereas within the herbs they were corn silk, violets and marjoram. Based on the mean levels of TeA measured in different spices and herbs, the daily consumption of >3.3 g red chili, >3.7 g paprika, >16.7 g caraway or >36 g of corn silk will exceed the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) of TeA (1,500 ng/kg bw per day). For AOH or AME the TTC (2.5 ng/kg bw/day) will be exceeded by a daily consumption >0.5 g of white pepper, >0.9 g of onion powder, > 1.4 g of garlic powder, >1.7 g of black pepper, >1.9 g of sage, >3.3 g of violets or > 4.4 g of thyme leaves. This study provide large information on the natural occurrence of Alternaria mycotoxins in spices and herbs useful for the human exposure assessment and future regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aPiper nigrum 3aaltenuene 3ablack pepper 3acaraway 3acommercialization 3aexposure assessment 3agarlic 3aleaves 3amarjoram 3amarkets 3amass spectrometry 3aonions 3apaprika 3asage 3aseeds 3astyles (flowers) 3atenuazonic acid 3athyme 3atoxicity 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3aLebanon 0aAlternaria 0aHerbs 0aSpices 0aMulti-mycotoxin 0aOccurrence 0aLebanon 0aMass spectrometry1 aEl Darra, Nada1 aFakhoury, Rajaa1 aLogrieco, A.,1 aSolfrizzo, Michele0 tFood control.g2019 Dec., v. 106 p.106724-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1067243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02219naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245019600129300001400325520095400339592002801293650002401321650002001345650002801365650001901393650001501412650002701427650001201454650001201466650001901478650001501497650002001512651001001532653002401542653002501566653001901591653001201610700001701622700001501639700001501654773011901669852000901788655001201797IND60128935220221118004831.0151124e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012893522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, O.

Here, we report presence of two coexisting alternative transversions, A>T and A>C, on the third codon position of L1014 residue in malaria vector Anopheles subpictus Grassi (species A) from Jamshedpur (India), both leading to the same amino acid substitution of Leu-to-Phe with allelic frequencies of 19 and 67%, respectively. A single primer-introduced restriction analysis—polymerase chain reaction (PIRA-PCR) was devised for the identification of L1014F-kdr mutation in An. subpictus resulting from either type of point mutation. Genotyping of samples with PIRA-PCR revealed high frequency (82%) of L1014F-kdr mutation in the study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles subpictus 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aamino acid substitution 3agene frequency 3agenotyping 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsects 3amalaria 3apoint mutation 3apyrethrins 3asodium channels 3aIndia 0aAnopheles subpictus 0aknockdown resistance 0asodium channel 0amalaria1 aDykes, C.

Drained lake basins (DLBs) are often the most common landforms in lowland permafrost regions in the Arctic (50% to 75% of the landscape). However, detailed assessments of DLB distribution and abundance are limited. In this study, we present a novel and scalable remote sensing-based approach to identifying DLBs in lowland permafrost regions, using the North Slope of Alaska as a case study. We validated this first North Slope-wide DLB data product against several previously published sub-regional scale datasets and manually classified points. The study area covered >71,000 km², including a >39,000 km² area not previously covered in existing DLB datasets. Our approach used Landsat-8 multispectral imagery and ArcticDEM data to derive a pixel-by-pixel statistical assessment of likelihood of DLB occurrence in sub-regions with different permafrost and periglacial landscape conditions, as well as to quantify aerial coverage of DLBs on the North Slope of Alaska. The results were consistent with previously published regional DLB datasets (up to 87% agreement) and showed high agreement with manually classified random points (64.4–95.5% for DLB and 83.2–95.4% for non-DLB areas). Validation of the remote sensing-based statistical approach on the North Slope of Alaska indicated that it may be possible to extend this methodology to conduct a comprehensive assessment of DLBs in pan-Arctic lowland permafrost regions. Better resolution of the spatial distribution of DLBs in lowland permafrost regions is important for quantitative studies on landscape diversity, wildlife habitat, permafrost, hydrology, geotechnical conditions, and high-latitude carbon cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acarbon 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adrainage 3alakes 3alandforms 3alandscapes 3alatitude 3amultispectral imagery 3apermafrost 3astatistical analysis 3atopographic slope 3awildlife habitats 3aAlaska 3aArctic region1 aJones, Benjamin M.1 aHinkel, Kenneth 1 aFarquharson, Louise 1 aGaglioti, Benjamin V.1 aParsekian, Andrew D.1 aKanevskiy, Mikhail 1 aOhara, Noriaki 1 aBreen, Amy L.1 aRangel, Rodrigo C.1 aGrosse, Guido 1 aNitze, Ingmar 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 June 29, v. 13, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131325393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003600139245013000175300001800305520189100323592002802214650002502242650002302267650001702290650001302307650003302320650001602353650002302369700002202392700001902414700002002433700002802453773010502481856007502586852000902661655001202670IND60577997020180713000000.0170811e20140812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057799702DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501164u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Márquez, Alfonso
Ramon10aMesomorphism and Shape-Memory Behavior of Main-Chain Liquid-Crystalline Co-Elastomers: Modulation by the Chemical Composition  ap. 5198-5210.  aThe mesomorphic behavior, shape shifting, and shape-memory types of two homologous series of main-chain liquid-crystalline co-elastomers (MC-LCEs) with composition-tunable transition temperatures and mesophases structures are reported. The weakly cross-linked macromolecules were prepared in a one-step procedure by the versatile platinum-catalyzed hydrosilylation reaction between siloxane oligomers (linear spacers and netlike point molecules) and liquid-crystalline binary mixtures, composed of defined proportions of divinylic monomeric mesogens. First, the two sets of alternated, linear copolymers with disiloxane or trisiloxane chain extender, respectively, were investigated. They either exhibit both smectic C (SmC) and nematic (N) phases or a single SmC phase, the nature of which being dictated by the length of the inserted siloxane moieties, and the temperatures ranges regulated by the composition of the mesogenic mixture (mesogens ratio). As anticipated, the thermal behavior of the corresponding co-elastomers is not greatly affected by the weak reticulation (less than 5% w/w), whose transition temperatures (from the ambient to ca. 100 °C) and mesophases types (SmC and N) are quasi-replicated from the polymers and still majority governed by the intermingling of the constitutive components (mesogens ratios, siloxane, and comonomers). Moreover, these MC-LCEs exhibit two types of shape-memory behaviors, which are imposed selectively by the nature of the siloxane extender and which are understood in relation to the mesophases’ structures. The combination of small-angle X-ray scattering and thermoelastic experiments gives some fundamental insights into the relationships between molecular structures and macroscopic elastic properties in MC-LCEs in general, which should be beneficial for future designs of soft materials with desired shape-memory properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3amoieties 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aHeinrich, Benoît1 aBeyer, Nicolas1 aGuillon, Daniel1 aDonnio, B.q(Bertrand),0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Aug. 12, v. 47, no. 15 p.5198-5210dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501164u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03097naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245009900177300001700276520182300293592002802116596003202144596003202176596012602208650001502334650002102349650001602370650002302386650000902409650001602418700003002434700006102464773013002525856008302655852000902738655001202747IND60793581720221116145117.0220920e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079358172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-022-02002-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaya-Elizarrarás, Elisa10aTwo central rectrices: a temporal fingerprint for individual recognition of barred woodpeckers  ap. 997-1011.  aPhoto-identification has gained attention as a method that allows individual recognition in several animal taxa, avoiding the risks associated with artificial marking. However, no studies have determined the existence of individually distinct external markings for small avian species, and the reliability of natural markings as an identification technique has rarely been evaluated. We aimed to determine whether a zebra-backed woodpecker species posed distinctive elements in markings on the two central rectrice tail feathers that enable individual identification. We photographed 29 pairs of central rectrices of the Golden-cheeked Woodpecker (Melanerpes chrysogenys), and characterized tail-feather markings to determine the existence of unique combinations of markings on the two central rectrices. We defined 26 traits of tail-feather markings, and found no individuals with identical natural markings in our free-living population. Cluster analysis confirmed that feather traits were sufficiently individualistic to segregate individuals, and indicated continuity in feather traits over at least two breeding seasons. Cluster analysis also segregated males and females based on feather traits, suggesting sexual differentiation in the pattern of natural markings that is rarely considered in studies. Finally, we performed recognition tests and a field simulation test on 28 volunteers and found that most volunteers made more than 80% correct matches based on feather markings. Our results suggest that natural markings may be a reliable identification technique for barred woodpeckers. Further studies are required to elucidate the continuity of individual markings after successive molts, but natural markings may serve as an identification protocol for woodpecker populations within a specified time-frame.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN205716cUNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT  aIN209120cUNAM-DGAPA-PAPIIT  aPostdoctoral fellowshipcDirección General de Asuntos del Personal Académico, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México 3aMelanerpes 3acluster analysis 3aornithology 3asexual development 3atail 3awoodpeckers1 aRamírez-García, Enrique1 aRenton, Katherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4152-23450 tJournal of ornithology.g2022 Oct., v. 163, no. 4 p.997-1011dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-022-02002-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01702naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245008000170300001600250520035700266592002800623650001400651650001200665650002000677650002000697650002200717650001500739650001300754650001400767650001300781653002100794653003300815653001300848653000800861653001700869700002000886700002200906700002100928700002500949700002000974700002300994773014001017856007801157852000901235655001201244IND60660426420221120235219.0190917e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066042642DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2018.23042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Grootveld, Rebecca10aChlamydia caviae Causing Community-Acquired Pneumonia: An Emerging Zoonosis  ap. 635-637.  aWe describe a case of community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydia caviae in a patient with no direct animal exposure, raising questions about the zoonotic reservoirs and potential transmission routes.

The incipient α′ crystals of loosely packed 10₇ helices, formed at tc = 200 s as detected via both WAXS and FTIR, were hardly identifiable via SAXS or DSC due to its low values of density contrast or latent heat (initially ΔHα′ ≈ 12 J/g, gradually reaching 74 J/g near the end of crystallization, in contrast to ΔHα ≈ 140 J/g), was already large in lateral size (with coherence length Λ₂₀₀/₁₁₀ ≈ 35 nm, increasing to 50 nm during tc = 200–400 s and remained little changed afterward). Once formed, the α′ crystals underwent continuous and persistent perfection for decreasing lattice spacing and partially transformed to smaller α crystals (tc ≈ 800–1800 s, up to a saturated population ratio of 1:4 between α and α′ phases), followed by slower yet steady increases in SAXS invariant without significant changes in the α and α′ contents for tc > 1800 s. It is concluded that the α′ form is a transient structure of continuously increasing packing density and latent heat toward the α form, reminiscent of the mesomorphic phase as precursors to stable crystals in other polymers. Nevertheless, transformation to α crystals occurred when the lattice parameters of the α′ phase were closer but still finitely different from those of the α phase and that the conversion between the two phases was limited in this isothermal case. Both observations suggest that, in spite of the transient nature of the α′ phase, the final transformation step to the stable α form is still achieved via a first-order route.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray scattering 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3alatent heat 3apolymers1 aYang, Ching-Feng1 aJeng, U-Ser1 aSu, An-Chung0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Aug. 12, v. 47, no. 15 p.5144-5151dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma501167e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012200170520143200292592002801724650003201752650001501784650001501799650001001814650001101824650001701835650001101852650001401863650001201877650001901889650002101908650001201929700002301941700002201964700001901986700002002005700002002025700002202045700002402067700002102091773012402112856008202236852000902318655001202327IND60757899520221119100029.0211125e20211105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075789952DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens101114412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCitron, Michael P.10aTransplacental Antibody Transfer of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Specific IgG in Non-Human Primate Mother-Infant Pairs  aOne approach to protect new-borns against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is to vaccinate pregnant women in the last trimester of pregnancy. The boosting of circulating antibodies which can be transferred to the foetus would offer immune protection against the virus and ultimately the disease. Since non-human primates (NHPs) have similar reproductive anatomy, physiology, and antibody architecture and kinetics to humans, we utilized this preclinical species to evaluate maternal immunization (MI) using an RSV F subunit vaccine. Three species of NHPs known for their ability to be infected with human RSV in experimental challenge studies were tested for RSV-specific antibodies. African green monkeys had the highest overall antibody levels of the old-world monkeys evaluated and they gave birth to offspring with anti-RSV titers that were proportional to their mother. These higher overall antibody levels are associated with greater durability found in their offspring. Immunization of RSV seropositive AGMs during late pregnancy boosts RSV titers, which consequentially results in significantly higher titers in the vaccinated new-borns compared to the new-borns of unvaccinated mothers. These findings, accomplished in small treatment group sizes, demonstrate a model that provides an efficient, resource sparing and translatable preclinical in vivo system for evaluating vaccine candidates for maternal immunization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRespiratory syncytial virus 3aantibodies 3adurability 3afetus 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3amodels 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aseroprevalence 3asubunit vaccines 3aviruses1 aMcAnulty, Jessica 1 aCallahan, Cheryl 1 aKnapp, Walter 1 aFontenot, Jane 1 aMorales, Pablo 1 aFlynn, Jessica A.1 aDouglas, Cameron M.1 aEspeseth, Amy S.0 tPathogens.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens101114413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01803naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245014500168300001800313520060700331592002800938650001400966650002600980650002501006650001001031650001301041650002201054650001601076700002401092700002401116700002901140700006201169773013401231856007901365852000901444655001201453IND60694966820221120061836.0200515e20200429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069496682DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c007422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Elena Yu.10aOxaazabicyclooctene Oxides, Another Type of Bridgehead Nitrones: Diastereoselective Assembly from Acetylene Gas, Ketones, and Hydroxyl Amine  ap. 6732-6740.  aUnique bridgehead nitrones, 8-oxa-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-ene 6-oxides, have been assembled diastereoselectively via acetyldihydropyrans, products of one-pot self-organization of two molecules of ketones and two molecules of acetylene, which after oximation undergo acid-catalyzed ring closure.

A case study in Northeastern Italy  ap. 63-75.  a2019-12-06  aThe Venetian plain is a densely populated area and one of the most economically competitive regions in Europe. Therefore, a sustainable management of the water resources has to be accomplished to preserve both the social and economic value of this area and the regional environment in accordance with the European water policy directives. This paper presents the analysis of hydrologic and hydrogeological water balances of the high alluvial plain (approximately 790km²) highlighting some important peculiarities that could be crucial for the local water policy. By focusing on the importance of different water budget components, the obtained results indicate in the irrigation the most relevant component of the aquifer recharge. Thus, the irrigation management policy of the Land Reclamation Consortia strongly influences aquifer recharge. Moreover, future scenarios (2071–2100) for the high Venetian plain are performed taking into account the changes of climate and irrigation policy. The inflow of the aquifer suffers a decrease ranging from 18% in the scenario influenced by climate change to 28% in the scenario affected by both the variations. In particular, the irrigation recharge shows the highest reduction due to both an increase in evaporation, owing to an increase in the surface temperature, or the irrigation methods. Therefore, the irrigation management policy adopted by the Land Reclamation Consortia is a fundamental concern. Changes from surface irrigation to spray or drip irrigation could strongly affect the aquifer recharge. The classical technique of surface irrigation is very useful in terms of aquifer recharge in comparison with drip or spray irrigation. However, it also requires a huge volume of water compared with the minimum desirable streamflow of a river and its management policy. Currently in Italy, the transition from conventional irrigation systems to water saving techniques is favored by the Land Reclamation Consortia in response to European and Italian directives. However, the possible reduction of the aquifer recharge could influence the actual social and economic condition of the Venetian plain because the human and industrial water needs are mostly dependent by groundwater exploitation. Therefore, water saving activities should be accompanied by appropriate corrective actions to reduce the environmental and social impact due to the decrease in aquifer recharge.  aPublisher supplied data 3arivers 3astream flow 3awater conservation 3ahumans 3asurface irrigation 3amicroirrigation 3asprinkler irrigation 3aalluvial plains 3aaquifers 3aclimate change 3aevaporation 3asurface temperature 3airrigation management 3awater policy 3acase studies 3agroundwater 3asocial impact 3aclimate 3aeconomic valuation 3aItaly 0aWater management policy 0aFuture scenarios 0aHydrogeological budget 0aHydrologic budget 0awater balance 0aVeneto Region (NE, Italy)1 aPiccinini, Leonardo1 aMarcolongo, Enrico1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6057-37111 aPola, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9773-63341 aConchetto, Enrico1 aZàngheri, Pietro,0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2016 Sept., v. 63 p.63-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2016.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012800159300002000287520172000307592002802027650002102055650002202076650001402098650002302112650001402135650001502149650002802164650002102192650001702213650001502230650001302245650001302258650001002271700002002281700001902301700001702320700001702337700002002354773014302374856007402517852000902591655001202600IND60675747820221120042627.0191108e20191105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067574782DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta07941f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Sung-Won,10aTolerance to carbon corrosion of various carbon structures as catalyst supports for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells  ap. 25056-25065.  aTo overcome the stability issue at high voltages related to the carbon corrosion of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells, different types of platelet carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) featuring a wide range of fiber stems are employed as a Pt catalyst supporting material. Further, PCNFs are hybridized with spherical activated carbons (SC) as a Pt support to improve the electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts by increasing the surface area and electrical conductivity with well-distributed meso- and macro-pores, while maintaining tolerance to carbon corrosion of electrocatalysts. Tafel slopes of the catalysts for the kinetic current of electrocatalysts are in the order of Pt/PCNF (−58.2 mV dec⁻¹) < Pt/Hybrid (−57.0 mV dec⁻¹) < Pt/SC (−54.3 mV dec⁻¹), showing the rapid kinetics of Pt/SC and Pt/Hybrid for the oxygen reduction reaction. The Pt catalysts are subjected to accelerated stress tests (AST) in which the cell voltage is cycled between 1.0 and 1.5 V in 2 s (1 cycle), and the Pt/PCNF and Pt/Hybrid catalysts are highly durable in carbon-corrosion durability testing. Furthermore, the MEAs with the Pt/PCNF, Pt/SC, and Pt/Hybrid catalysts are operated at 65 °C, and the maximum power densities of MEAs were 0.708, 0.674, and 0.507 W cm⁻² for Pt/SC, Pt/Hybrid, and Pt/PCNF, respectively, as is consistent with the characteristics of catalysts. The MEAs are also subjected to AST at 80 °C, and a relatively small performance decay occurred at 0.6 V for the Pt/PCNF (36.2%) and Pt/Hybrid MEAs (44.0%), but considerably more degradation was observed for Pt/SC MEA (73.2%), signifying that the mechanochemically durable PCNF effectively prevented carbon corrosion with Pt agglomeration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3acarbon nanofibers 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acorrosion 3adurability 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3aplatinum 3apolymers 3astems1 aChoi, Sung Ryul1 aJang, Jeongyun1 aPark, Gu-Gon1 aYu, Seung Ho1 aPark, Jun-Young0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2019 Nov. 5, v. 7, no. 43 p.25056-25065dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta07941f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245011600159300001600275520174400291592002802035650002002063650003102083650002502114650002202139650001502161650001602176650002102192650002402213650003802237650001502275650001302290650001102303650001202314650001902326650001102345650001202356653003202368653002302400653001002423700001702433700001602450700001602466700001702482700001702499700001502516700001702531773014002548856007802688852000902766655001202775IND60660426620221121005620.0191004e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066042662DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2018.23942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Dana10aSurvey of Angiostrongylus cantonensis Infection Status in Host Animals and Populations in Shenzhen, 2016–2017  ap. 717-723.  aThe study was to understand Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection status in host animals and populations in Shenzhen. In 2016–2017, 10 different ecological environments were selected, and intermediate and definitive hosts collected at the sites were examined using the enzyme digestion and dissection method to determine their infection status. Meanwhile, serum was collected from outpatients and healthy people. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test was performed to detect serum IgG-specific antibodies to A. cantonensis, and serological characteristics of the populations were analyzed. A total of 300 Achatina fulica samples had an A. cantonensis infection rate of 10.67% (32/300) and an average infection intensity of 68.7 per snail, whereas 302 Pomacea canaliculata samples had an infection rate of 6.29% (19/302) and an average infection intensity of 31.4 per snail. Although both infection rate and infection intensity were lower in P. canaliculata than in A. fulica, infection intensity was significantly different (p < 0.001). Among 238 definitive-host rodents, 22 were infected with A. cantonensis. The infection rate in Rattus norvegicus was 14.68% (16/109), significantly higher than that in Rattus flavipectus (p < 0.05). The seroprevalence of A. cantonensis in the 900 outpatients and 1500 healthy people was 7.11% (64/900) and 1.87% (28/1500), respectively. Thus, the infection rate was significantly higher in outpatients than in healthy people in Shenzhen (p < 0.001). This study revealed a wide distribution and the prevalence of A. cantonensis in host animals and populations in Shenzhen, therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the current monitoring of the disease to prevent a potential outbreak.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchatina fulica 3aParastrongylus cantonensis 3aPomacea canaliculata 3aRattus norvegicus 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3adefinitive hosts 3aenzymatic reactions 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amonitoring 3apatients 3apeople 3arodents 3aseroprevalence 3asnails 3asurveys 0aAngiostrongylus cantonensis 0aangiostrongyliasis 0ahosts1 aHuang, Yalan1 aTang, Yijun1 aZhang, Qian1 aLi, Xiaoheng1 aGao, Shitong1 aHua, Wuwei1 aZhang, Renli0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 19, no. 10 p.717-723dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:J000000160x1557-77597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2018.23943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03147naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013200168520169300300592002801993650002802021650002102049650000902070650001702079650001202096650001202108650002202120650001802142650001602160650001302176650001402189650001502203650002502218650001102243650001102254650001602265651001002281653001802291653001202309653002102321653003002342700005602372700001502428700001802443773009602461856008702557852000902644655001202653IND60648514120221121104656.0190705e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064851412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1067392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Miaoyun10aGrowth of Clostridium perfringens in roasted chicken and braised beef during cooling – One-step dynamic analysis and modeling  aRoasted chicken (RC) and braised beef (BB) are two important commercial products widely consumed in China. Prepared with a mixture of different spices and other ingredients, these products may be contaminated with Clostridium perfringens spores. The spores may germinate, outgrow, and multiply to a dangerous level during cooling after cooking if the cooling process is not sufficiently fast, causing outbreaks of food poisoning due to production of C. perfringens enterotoxin.This study was conducted to investigate the growth of C. perfringens from spores in these products under various cooling conditions and to develop predictive models. Inoculated samples were exposed to different cooling profiles to observe the bacterial growth. Analyzed with the one-step dynamic kinetic analysis method, various kinetic parameters were determined. The estimated Tmin, Topt, and Tmax were 8.8, 46.4, and 51.5 °C in RC, and 10.3, 43.5, and 53.4 °C in BB, all agreeing well with the cardinal temperatures of this microorganism in meats. The optimum specific growth rate (μopt) was 6.06 ln CFU/g per h in RC, and 5.64 ln CFU/g per h in BB.The validation of the growth models showed that the RMSE of prediction was relatively low (0.2–0.3 log CFU/g). The majority (94%) of the residual errors of prediction was within ±0.5 log CFU/g, and 76% within ±0.3 log CFU/g of the experimental observations. While accurate, the predictions are mostly fail-safe. The estimated kinetic parameters and predictive models developed in this study can be used to predict the growth of C. perfringens in RC and BB during cooling after cooking to prevent the outbreaks caused by the growth of this pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium perfringens 3abacterial growth 3abeef 3achicken meat 3acooking 3acooling 3afoodborne illness 3agrowth models 3aingredients 3akinetics 3apathogens 3aprediction 3aspecific growth rate 3aspices 3aspores 3atemperature 3aChina 0aStabilization 0aCooling 0aDynamic modeling 0aOne-step kinetic analysis1 aHuang, Lihan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9565-45031 aZhu, Yaodi1 aWei, Qingying0 tFood control.g2019 Dec., v. 106 p.106739-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1067393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007500170300001600245520158800261592002801849650002301877650002101900650002401921650001001945650001601955650001701971651001601988651001202004700002102016700001802037700006202055773012902117856008302246852000902329655001202338IND60793582020221116145114.0220920e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079358202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-022-02005-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlastino, Kaitlyn10aHitting all the notes: Connecticut warblers sing an extended song type  ap. 953-966.  aBirds use songs to communicate with mates and rivals and thus these signals have important social and fitness consequences. Understanding the pattern of vocalization and repertoire use of a species is valuable for population monitoring and species recovery plans. The Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis) is an enigmatic passerine bird for which we know little about its vocal repertoire and behavior. We examined autonomous recordings from boreal avian monitoring projects from Ontario, Canada, and discovered a previously undescribed extended song type, similar to that of other related warbler species. Extended songs are composed of a number of syllables including the species’ primary song and averaged 7.1 ± 0.2 s (SE) in length, five times longer than primary songs. The song appears to have a structure similar to Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) song with introductory syllables preceding the first primary syllables followed by a mix of terminal syllables that were often interspersed with additional primary syllables. Individuals have on average 13.0 ± 0.5 different syllables and songs are composed of 10.8 ± 0.2 syllable types and 14.8 ± 0.4 total syllables. While primary songs occurred more often before sunrise and throughout the morning, extended songs were more often detected before and after sunset suggesting temporal separation in song type use. Our results extend our understanding of the vocal behavior of the Connecticut Warbler and related species within the Oporornis-Geothlypis complex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeothlypis trichas 3aOporornis agilis 3aSeiurus aurocapilla 3abirds 3aornithology 3avocalization 3aConnecticut 3aOntario1 aHannah, Kevin C.1 aRussell, Rich1 aFoote, Jennifer R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9128-34960 tJournal of ornithology.g2022 Oct., v. 163, no. 4 p.953-966dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-022-02005-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245011700171300001400288520128000302592002801582650002401610650002201634650001901656650001801675650001301693650003001706650002001736650001401756653002301770653000901793653001801802653002001820653004101840653004501881653004501926653002701971700001901998700002702017700002202044773012302066856008202189852000902271655001202280IND60599289820221121015059.0180702e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059928982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComelles, Francesc10aMicellization of sodium laurylethoxysulfate (SLES) and short chain imidazolium ionic liquids in aqueous solution  ap. 44-51.  aIn the present study the interactions between an anionic surfactant sodium laurylethoxysulfate (SLES) and three short chain imidazolium (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium) based ionic liquids (bmim-octyl SO4, bmim-methyl SO4 and bmim-BF4) in aqueous solution have been investigated. Generally when a surfactant is dissolved in a hydrophilic ionic liquid aqueous solution the critical micelle concentration (cmc) obtained is attributed to the surfactant because the ionic liquid (IL) is considered to be only a cosolvent. However, some short hydrophilic ionic liquids posses surface activity in aqueous solution and behave like a surfactant. In that case mixed aggregates between surfactant and ionic liquid can be formed. The three SLES/IL systems here studied have been treated as typical binary surfactant mixtures in aqueous solution. Surface tension measurements have revealed that mixed aggregates and monolayers of surfactant and ionic liquid instead of single surfactant are responsible for the surface active properties of these aqueous solutions. From the Regular Solution Theory, negative interaction parameters (β) for mixed aggregates and monolayers have been found for all SLES/IL mole ratios indicating synergism between the anionic surfactant and the ionic liquids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3aaqueous solutions 3ahydrophilicity 3aionic liquids 3amicelles 3asurface active properties 3asurface tension 3asynergism 0aAnionic surfactant 0aSLES 0aIonic liquids 0aSurface tension 0aCritical micelle concentration (cmc) 0aCritical aggregation concentration (cac) 0aMixed aggregates Regular Solution Theory 0aInteraction parameters1 aRibosa, Isabel1 aGonzález, Juan José,1 aGarcia, M.

Despite their unique ecological character, little is known about these patterns in Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl. (Coast Redwood) forests. We examined the composition and structure of naturally regenerating stands with 360 randomly located sample plots across a chronosequence of five replicated age-classes (18 to 127 yr) and three old-growth reference sites. Results indicate a progression of stand characteristics towards old-growth conditions, with several measures reaching old-growth equivalence within the timeframe of the chronosequence. Stand density, canopy cover, and species richness reached old-growth equivalence within 41––80 yr; Shannon-diversity reached old-growth equivalence between 80––100 yr; and the density of redwood seedlings and shrub cover reached old-growth equivalence between 100––130 yr. Basal area, herb cover, and the relative dominance of S. sempervirens progressed toward, but did not reach, old-growth equivalence. Size-class analysis indicated an increase in the density of large diameter trees, with no change in the density of smaller size-classes after forty yr. Coast redwood associated understory species were favored on the older sites with the cover of Calypso bulbosa (L.) Oakes, Trillium ovatum Pursh, and Viola sempervirens Greene reaching old-growth equivalence, while Iris douglasiana Herb., Tiarella trifoliate L., and Achlys triphylla (Sm.) DC. did not. No non-native species were recorded in stands older than 60 yr. We conclude that coast redwood forests are resilient to human disturbance, though some old-growth characteristics may require more than a century to develop.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChronosequence 0acoast redwood 0anatural regeneration 0asecond-growth 0aSequoia sempervirens1 aMichels, Kristin Hageseth0 tMadroño.g2011 May 4, v. 57, no. 4 p.229-241dCalifornia Botanical Society, Inc.x0024-96377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3120%2F0024-9637-57.4.2293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014000157300001800297520071300315592002801028650004401056650002801100650001401128650006601142650004401208650002401252650003701276700002401313700002701337700002401364773010501388856007501493852000901568655001201577IND60577997420221116164554.0170811e20140812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057799742DNAL7 a10.1021/ma501200e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYau, Hin Chun10aDiamond Rings or Dumbbells: Controlling the Structure of Poly(ethylene glycol)–Fullerene [60] Adducts by Varying Linking Chain Length  ap. 4870-4875.  aFullerene [60] (C₆₀) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) adducts were prepared via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of bis-azido-terminated linear PEG (N₃-PEG-N₃) and C₆₀.

Both dumbbell and diamond ring structures were characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS, ¹H NMR, FTIR, UV–vis, and elemental analysis (EA).

Four different pretreatments strategies were used: sample submerged in distilled water, water + US pretreatment, ethanol pretreatment, and ethanol + US pretreatment. The results showed that all pretreatments reduced drying time, and sample pretreatment by ethanol + US had the highest drying efficiency, hardness, highest total phenolic content, and total flavonoid content retention. However, these pretreatments slightly decreased the rehydration ratio and gingerol content. The possible explanation for these results has been put forward by microstructure analysis. CIR-dried ginger samples were pretreated by four methods required by the agricultural standards of China. This study provides a new perspective on the commercial application of ethanol + US pretreatment for CIR-dried ginger slices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZingiber officinale 3aethanol 3aflavonoids 3afood chemistry 3aginger 3ahardness 3amicrostructure 3arehydration 3aultrasonics 3aChina 0aCIR 0aUS 0aTPC 0aTFC 0aMR 0aSEM 0aRR 0aGAE 0aSD 0aRE 0aE-nose 0aPCA 0aPTFE 0aPb 0aCd 0aGFAAS 0aHCL 0aAs 0aHg 0aHG-AFS 0aGC 0aFID 0aCRD 0aANOVA 0aMPL 0aSG 0aGinger 0aCatalytic infrared drying 0aEthanol 0aContamination 0aUltrasound1 aRen, Zifei1 aChen, Li1 aZhou, Cunshan1 aOkonkwo, Clinton Emeka1 aMujumdar, Arun S.0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Aug. 30, v. 386 p.132759-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.1327593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010000171300001600271520038700287592002800674653001700702653001300719653003000732653001700762653001700779700002100796700002400817773010300841856008400944852000901028655001201037IND60128541820151116000000.0151116e20110504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012854182DNAL7 a10.3120/0024-9637-57.4.2422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPreston, Robert E.10aRediscovery of Plagiobothrys hystriculus (Boraginaceae) and Notes on its Habitat and Associates  ap. 242-245.  aThe rediscovery of bearded popcorn flower, the last confirmed collection of which was in 1892, is documented.

Pectin methylesterase (PME) treatments are an important process for texture improvement. These treatments can be applied either by means of endogenous PME activation or by infusion of exogenous PME in combination with or without a calcium salt; along with the use of temperatures around 60 °C, in order to attain the maximum activity of PME. In the present study, jalapeño pepper PME showed its highest activity at 55 °C. Likewise, it displayed a great thermal stability below 50 °C, as well as a long-time retention of its initial activity at such temperature. In the same way, when a solution of 15 U·mL−1 of PME with 10 mM CaCl2 was applied through ultrasound-assisted vacuum-infusion for 5 min, blanching-induced changes in texture and exocarp color of jalapeño pepper were reduced. Simultaneously, an increase of fruit tissue PME activity was observed with specific treatment conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapsicum annuum 3ablanching 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acolor 3aexocarp 3apectinesterase 3asensory properties 3atemperature 3atexture 3athermal stability 3aultrasonic treatment 3avegetables 0aPectin methylesterase 0aUltrasound 0aVacuum-infusion 0aTexture1 aFlores-Gallegos, Adriana C.1 aContreras-Esquivel, Juan C.1 aEscobedo-García, Sarai1 aGonzález-Herrera, Silvia M.1 aMorales-Castro, Juliana1 aRodríguez-Herrera, Raúl0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Sept., v. 95 p.150-156dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.04.0813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245011700170300001600287520130200303592002801605650002701633650001901660650002501679650001401704650001101718650001301729650001201742651001601754651001801770653001501788653001901803653002701822653002801849653001601877653001101893653001501904653002701919653003601946700001901982700002202001700002502023773011102048856008502159852000902244655001202253IND60531422720221120143938.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053142272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2016.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Witt, Annick12aA new tool to map the major worldviews in the Netherlands and USA, and explore how they relate to climate change  ap. 101-112.  aFor addressing climate change, public support for changes in policy is needed, as well changes in individual lifestyles. Both of these appear to be intimately related with people’s worldviews. Understanding these worldviews is therefore essential. In order to research and ‘map’ them, we translated the theoretical ‘Integrative Worldview Framework’ (IWF) into an empirical, quantitative approach. We constructed a worldview-scale aiming to distinguish between four major worldviews – labeled traditional, modern, postmodern, and integrative – and explored their interface with opinions and behaviors with respect to climate change. The survey was conducted with representative samples of citizens in the Netherlands and the USA (n=527 and n=556). The hypothesized worldviews were found in the data with a reasonable degree of reliability, especially in the Dutch sample. We also found consistent relationships between these worldview-clusters and a range of opinions, political priorities, and behaviors. In both countries postmoderns and integratives displayed significantly more concern about climate change as well as more sustainable behaviors, compared with moderns and traditionals. The implications of these findings for environmental policy and social science are noteworthy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental policy 3alifestyle 3apeople 3apolitics 3asurveys 3aNetherlands 3aUnited States 0aWorldviews 0aClimate change 0aSustainable lifestyles 0aEnvironmental behaviors 0aTraditional 0aModern 0aPostmodern 0aIntegrative worldviews 0aIntegrative worldview framework1 aBoer, Joop de,1 aHedlund, Nicholas1 aOsseweijer, Patricia0 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2016 Sept., v. 63 p.101-112dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2016.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001400150245011200164300001600276520140400292592002801696650001801724650002001742650001701762650001301779650002201792650003101814650001001845650002401855650001101879650002101890650004301911650001301954650001601967650002001983650002902003700001502032700001302047700001602060700001802076773009402094856008602188961001302274852000902287655001202296IND4456660520221121230131.0141112e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445666052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei10aDifferentially expressed genes in Populus simonii×Populus nigra in response to NaCl stress using cDNA-AFLP  ap. 796-801.  aSalinity is an important environmental factor limiting growth and productivity of plants, and affects almost every aspect of the plant physiology and biochemistry. The objective of this study was to apply cDNA-AFLP and to identify differentially expressed genes in response to NaCl stress vs. no-stress in Populus simonii×Populus nigra in order to develop genetic resources for genetic improvement. Selective amplification with 64 primer combinations allowed the visualization of 4407 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs), and 2027 were differentially expressed. Overall, 107 TDFs were re-sequenced successfully, and 86 unique sequences were identified in 10 functional categories based on their putative functions. A subset of these genes was selected for real-time PCR validation, which confirmed the differential expression patterns in the leaf tissues under NaCl stress vs. no stress. Differential expressed genes will be studied further for association with salt or drought-tolerance in P. simonii×P. nigra. This study suggests that cDNA-AFLP is a useful tool to serve as an initial step for characterizing transcriptional changes induced by NaCl salinity stress in P. simonii×P. nigra and provides resources for further study and application in genetic improvement and breeding. All unique sequences have been deposited in the Genbank as accession numbers GW672587–GW672672 for public use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus nigra 3aPopulus simonii 3abiochemistry 3abreeding 3adrought tolerance 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3aleaves 3aplant physiology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhou, Boru1 aWu, Lili1 aGuo, Baozhu1 aJiang, Tingbo0 tPlant science.g2011 June, v. 180, no. 6 p.796-801dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-94527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245009500172300001400267520133000281592002801611650001401639650001801653650002201671650001501693650002001708650001801728650002501746650000701771650001601778650001601794650001201810653001501822653001301837653001501850653001601865653002101881653001801902700002701920700001701947700001801964700001501982773015001997856008202147852000902229655001202238IND60648514420221120114857.0190916e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064851442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fbp.2019.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrera-Márquez, O.10aStability studies of an amylase and a protease for cleaning processes in the food industry  ap. 64-73.  aAn α-amylase and a protease suitable to be used as detergent additives in Cleaning-In-Place processes in the food industry have been studied in terms of their stability during storage as well as under washing conditions. Enzymatic solutions have been prepared with addition of two non-ionic surfactants at the pH of operation, an amine oxide and an alkylpolyglucoside. Activity assays have been carried out in order to obtain deactivation kinetics. The study of stability at storage during 21 days at 40°C and 60°C reveals that the enzymatic solutions in the absence of surfactants preserve their activity for longer. The protease showed to be more sensitive to thermal deactivation, undergoing a complete loss of activity at 60°C before 24h in all solutions studied. On the other hand, activity assays have been carried out at concentrations, time and temperature values usually found during cleaning processes of hard surfaces. The presence of the alkylpolyglucoside showed to preserve enzymatic activity of α-amylase at all temperatures assayed. The amine oxide, nevertheless, seemed to contribute to α-amylase deactivation and did not have a significant effect on protease. The results of this work suggest the need of stabilize enzymes in detergent formulations even when they do not contain potential denaturants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aalpha-amylase 3acleaning in place 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3afood industry 3anonionic surfactants 3apH 3aproteinases 3atemperature 3awashing 0aα-Amylase 0aProtease 0aDetergents 0aSurfactants 0aEnzyme stability 0aKinetic model1 aFernández-Serrano, M.1 aPilamala, M.1 aJácome, M.B.1 aLuzón, G.0 tFood and bioproducts processing.g2019 Sept., v. 117 p.64-73dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:jnl47636x0960-30857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbp.2019.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007700166520135200243592002801595650002201623650002001645650001301665650001501678650002201693650002701715650002101742650001101763650002601774651001101800651001401811651001001825651001101835700002001846700002101866773010901887856008101996852000902077655001202086IND60757899920221119100115.0211125e20211106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075789992DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens101114472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Abhinav14aThe Global Emergence of Human Babesiosis [Erratum: August 2022, v.11(8)]  aBabesiosis is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa that are primarily transmitted by hard-bodied (Ixodid) ticks and rarely through blood transfusion, perinatally, and organ transplantation. More than 100 Babesia species infect a wide spectrum of wild and domestic animals worldwide and six have been identified as human pathogens. Babesia microti is the predominant species that infects humans, is found throughout the world, and causes endemic disease in the United States and China. Babesia venatorum and Babesia crassa-like agent also cause endemic disease in China. Babesia divergens is the predominant species in Europe where fulminant cases have been reported sporadically. The number of B. microti infections has been increasing globally in recent decades. In the United States, more than 2000 cases are reported each year, although the actual number is thought to be much higher. In this review of the epidemiology of human babesiosis, we discuss epidemiologic tools used to monitor disease location and frequency; demographics and modes of transmission; the location of human babesiosis; the causative Babesia species in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia; the primary clinical characteristics associated with each of these infections; and the increasing global health burden of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia divergens 3aBabesia microti 3aProtozoa 3ababesiosis 3ablood transfusion 3ademographic statistics 3aendemic diseases 3ahumans 3aorgan transplantation 3aAfrica 3aAustralia 3aChina 3aEurope1 aO’Bryan, Jane1 aKrause, Peter J.0 tPathogens.g2021 Nov. 06, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institutex2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens101114473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245008600166300001300252500001100265520067600276592002800952650001900980650001000999650002001009650002101029650001801050650003101068650001501099650001501114650002301129650001501152700002901167700002501196700002301221700002101244700002201265700003201287700003201319700002201351700002301373700002001396700002701416700002901443700002001472773014001492856007901632852000901711655001201720IND60592034220221118055457.0180327e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059203422DNAL7 a10.1111/1471-0307.123942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Renata O10aPrebiotic flours in dairy food processing: Technological and sensory implications  ap. 1-10.  aREVIEW  aThis review aims to evaluate the prebiotic potential of vegetable flours in the manufacture of dairy products and their effects on technological and sensory properties. Overall, studies have shown positive results, not only with regard to the growth of the lactic and/or probiotic bacteria but also for sensory acceptance, rheological and physicochemical properties. In addition, integrated studies focusing on the development of dairy functional foods must be conducted in order to optimise the amount of flour to be added in each dairy food formulation and also to assess the impact of prebiotic flour addition on the intrinsic quality parameters of the dairy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy products 3aflour 3afood processing 3afunctional foods 3amanufacturing 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3asensory properties 3avegetables1 aSilva, Marcus Vinicius F1 aNascimento, Kamila O1 aBatista, Aline L D1 aMoraes, Jeremias1 aAndrade, Marlon M1 aAndrade, Luiz Guilherme Z S1 aKhosravi‐Darani, Kianoush1 aFreitas, Monica Q1 aRaices, Renata S L1 aSilva, Marcia C1 aBarbosa Junior, Jose L1 aBarbosa, Maria Ivone M J1 aCruz, Adriano G0 tInternational journal of dairy technology.g2018 Mar., v. 71 Suppl S1 p.1-10dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl55233x1364-727X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1471-0307.123943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03212naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245019500204300001600399520143400415592002801849650002401877650002701901650001601928650001701944650002001961650001701981650001701998650002602015650001602041650001202057650001902069650002502088650001802113650001102131650001302142650002002155650001102175650002402186650001802210653001702228653002002245653002402265653002702289653001602316700001902332700001702351700001802368700006002386773012202446856008102568852000902649655001202658IND60632819920221122213900.0190617e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063281992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2018.04.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbosa, M.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4597-506910aEffect of proteins, glucose and NaCl on growth, biosynthesis and functionality of bacteriocins of Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a in foods during storage at 4 °C: Tests in food models  ap. 167-171.  aBacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria are used as food biopreservatives. In consequence of amphiphilic characteristics and high content of hydrophobic amino acids, biosynthesis and antimicrobial functionality of bacteriocins can be affected by components in the food matrix. This study evaluated the influence of proteins/peptides, glucose and NaCl on growth and bacteriocins production by Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a, using simulated food models prepared with combinations of meat extract, yeast extract, proteose-peptone, starch, glucose and NaCl. A semi-purified extract of bacteriocins was used to investigate their functionality against Listeria monocytogenes added to the models, stored at 4 °C for 10 days. Results were compared to those obtained with a similar extract of a non-bacteriocinogenic strain of Lb. sakei, prepared according to the same purification protocol. Results indicated that growth and bacteriocin production in the tested conditions was minimal. Glucose had a small but positive affect on both measurements. However, the functionality of the bacteriocins against Listeria monocytogenes in the models during refrigerated storage was similar, indicating that none of the components at the tested concentrations had an evident influence on the activity. These results subsidize the correct application of bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria in protein-based foods for biopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus sakei 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aamino acids 3abacteriocins 3abiopreservation 3abiosynthesis 3acold storage 3afood biopreservatives 3afood matrix 3aglucose 3ahydrophobicity 3alactic acid bacteria 3ameat extracts 3amodels 3apeptides 3asodium chloride 3astarch 3astorage temperature 3ayeast extract 0aBacteriocins 0aBiopreservation 0aLactobacillus sakei 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aFood models1 aJurkiewicz, C.1 aLandgraf, M.1 aTodorov, S.D.1 aFranco, B.D.G.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9312-28880 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Sept., v. 95 p.167-171dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.04.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02190naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245019600167300001600363520083300379592002801212650001601240650001201256650001201268650001601280650001201296650001701308650001101325650001201336651001101348651001801359651001401377653002701391653002201418653001601440653001601456653002801472653001501500700001901515700002201534773009701556856008201653852000901735655001201744IND60126037520221120075923.0151104e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012603752DNAL7 a10.1525/cond.2012.1102122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilty, Steven L.12aA New Species of Softtail (Furnariidae: Thripophaga) from the Delta of the Orinoco River in VenezuelabUna Nueva Especie de Furnariidae (Thripophaga) de la Delta del Río Orinoco en Venezuela  ap. 143-154.  aWe describe a new species of softtail, genus Thripophaga, from the southern portion of the delta of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. In plumage the new species is most similar to the Orinoco Softtail (T. cherriei) from the upper Rio Orinoco and to the Striated Softtail (T. macroura) of southeastern Brazil. It differs from either in voice, plumage, and mensural characters, but, like these two species, it has a small and geographically isolated range. The new taxon, as far as is currently known, is restricted to seasonally flooded forest along streams and rivers in the vicinity of the Brazo Imataca, a closed loop branch of the Rio Grande, which is the largest branch of the Rio Orinoco passing through the southern part of the Orinoco delta. We also present notes on the behavior, ecology, and conservation of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFurnariidae 3aecology 3aforests 3anew species 3aplumage 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3astreams 3aBrazil 3aOrinoco River 3aVenezuela 0aDelta Amacuro Softtail 0afloodplain forest 0aFurnariidae 0anew species 0aThripophaga amacurensis 0aVenezuela.1 aAscanio, David1 aWhittaker, Andrew0 tCondor.g2013 Feb., v. 115, no. 1 p.143-154dUniversity of California Pressx1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fcond.2012.1102123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03296naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245012800198300001500326520192200341592002802263650001302291650002502304650000902329650001302338650002202351650001902373650001802392650002602410650001502436700002802451700002402479700002302503773015302526856007002679856010502749990002302854852000902877655001202886IND60608438920221120040617.0190510e20160916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060843892DNAL7 a10.3791/534962doi7 aPMC50920282pmcid7 a276844302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShandilya, Neeraj10aExperimental protocol to investigate particle aerosolization of a product under abrasion and under environmental weathering  ap. e53496.  aThe present article presents an experimental protocol to investigate particle aerosolization of a product under abrasion and under environmental weathering, which is a fundamental element to the approach of nanosafety-by-design of nanostructured products for their durable development. This approach is basically a preemptive one in which the focus is put on minimizing the emission of engineered nanomaterials' aerosols during the usage phase of the product's life cycle. This can be attained by altering its material properties during its design phase without compromising with any of its added benefits. In this article, an experimental protocol is presented to investigate the nanosafety-by-design of three commercial nanostructured products with respect to their mechanical solicitation and environmental weathering. The means chosen for applying the mechanical solicitation is an abrasion process and for the environmental weathering, it is an accelerated UV exposure in the presence of humidity and heat. The eventual emission of engineered nanomaterials is studied in terms of their number concentration, size distribution, morphology and chemical composition. The purpose of the protocol is to study the emission for test samples and experimental conditions which are corresponding to real life situations. It was found that the application of the mechanical stresses alone emits the engineered nanomaterials' aerosols in which the engineered nanomaterial is always embedded inside the product matrix, thus, a representative product element. In such a case, the emitted aerosols comprise of both nanoparticles as well as microparticles. But if the mechanical stresses are coupled with the environmental weathering, the experimental protocol reveals then the eventual deterioration of the product, after a certain weathering duration, may lead to the emission of the free engineered nanomaterial aerosols too.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3achemical composition 3aheat 3ahumidity 3amechanical stress 3amicroparticles 3ananoparticles 3aultraviolet radiation 3aweathering1 aLe Bihan, Olivier Louis1 aBressot, Christophe1 aMorgeneyer, Martin0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Sept. 16, , no. 115 p.e53496-e53496dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/534963Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53496/experimental-protocol-to-investigate-particle-aerosolization-product  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003600113040001800149100001800167245007900185300001200264500000900276520088600285592002801171650002001199650001801219650002301237650001401260650001601274650002001290650001701310650001601327650002001343650002301363650003401386650001901420650001401439651001801453700002201471700001701493700001501510773013001525852000901655856011201664856008301776961001301859655001201872IND4417583520221122101722.0191122e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441758352DNAL7 a10113/314982hdl7 a10.3198/jpr2007.07.0421crc2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBregitzer, P.10aRegistration of ‘RWA 1758’ Russian Wheat Aphid-Resistant Spring Barley  ap. 5-9.  aepub  a‘RWA 1758’ (Reg.

RWA 1758 was selected and released on the basis of competitive agronomic performance and resistance to damage caused by RWA feeding. RWA 1758 derives from a BC₃F₃:₄ selection from the cross ‘Baronesse’*4/STARS 9577B. It was tested under the experimental designation 01ST1758. STARS 9577B is a six-rowed spring RWA-resistant germplasm line developed and released by the USDA-ARS. STARS 9577B is resistant to the five RWA biotypes known to be present in the United States. STARS 9577B was developed via selection from CIho 4165, a landrace originally collected in Afghanistan. The main component of the resistance is tolerance, conferred by two dominant genes with recessive epistasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare 3aspring barley 3agermplasm releases 3acultivars 3agrain yield 3aDiuraphis noxia 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3apest resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aAgricultural Research Service 3adominant genes 3aepistasis 3aUnited States1 aMornhinweg, D.

As shown for a few cases, these functions may be mediated by trans-acting factors, in particular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, the specific interaction partners for most circRNAs remain unknown. This is mainly due to technical difficulties in their identification and in differentiating between interactors of circRNAs and their linear counterparts.

Previous studies have identified bacteria but not detected yeasts in the gut of Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), one of Australia's most economically damaging insect pests of horticultural crops and of significant biosecurity concern domestically and internationally. Here we demonstrate that cultivable yeasts are commonly found in the gut of B. tryoni larvae from fruit hosts. Analysis of the ITS1, 5.8S rRNA gene, and ITS2 sequences of randomly selected isolates identified yeasts and yeast-like fungi of the genera Aureobasidium, Candida, Cryptococcus, Hanseniaspora, Pichia, and Starmerella. The prevalence of these yeasts in fruits suggests that larvae consume the yeasts as part of their diet. This work highlights that yeasts should be considered in future tephritid larval gut microbiota studies. Understanding tephritid–microbial symbiont interactions will lead to improvements in artificial diets and the quality of mass-reared tephritids for the sterile insect technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAureobasidium 3aBactrocera tryoni 3aCandida 3aHanseniaspora 3aPichia 3aStarmerella 3aadults 3aartificial diets 3abacteria 3abiosecurity 3adigestive system 3afruit flies 3afruits 3agenes 3ahorticultural crops 3ahosts 3ahydrolysis 3aingredients 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect pests 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amass rearing 3aribosomal RNA 3asterile insect technique 3asymbionts 3ayeasts 3aAustralia 0ainsect rearing 0ainsect nutrition 0aQueensland fruit fly 0amicrobial symbiont1 aReynolds, Olivia L.1 aChapman, Toni A.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2016 Dec. 29, v. 110, no. 1 p.298-300dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow2623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04503naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005200145245011500197300001800312500002000330520231000350592002802660596013402688596005502822596005402877596007502931596005903006596005903065596007303124596006303197596005503260650001303315650002603328650001703354650002003371650001903391650002303410650001803433650002003451650001703471650001703488650002403505651001003529700005603539700005803595700005003653700005303703773012803756856008003884852000903964655001203973IND60782343120221116155831.0220708e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078234312DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.142022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6844-391410aEffects of Spartina invasion on the soil organic carbon content in salt marsh and mangrove ecosystems in China  ap. 1937-1946.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCoastal wetlands are large reservoirs of soil carbon (C) and have been invaded globally by the exotic species Spartina alterniflora. However, the effects of these invasions on soil C content remain unclear. We performed a meta‐analysis of 2479 soil organic C (SOC) content observations collected from 91 field studies conducted in coastal China, the world's largest introduced range for S. alterniflora. Spartina alterniflora invasions had no significant effect on the SOC content in vegetated native wetlands in coastal China. S. alterniflora increased the SOC content in the top 30 cm of salt marshes after invading only one of the nine marsh types, which was dominated by a dwarf succulent species, Suaeda salsa in the northern subtropics and decreased the SOC content in the top 60 cm of mangroves dominated by Kandelia obovata and mixed communities after invasion in the southern subtropics. S. alterniflora invasions did not significantly affect the SOC content in the other salt marsh or mangrove ecosystems. Moreover, the SOC content in S. alterniflora‐invaded ecosystems increased only on a decadal scale and then decreased, rather than increasing monotonically. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reveal that the SOC content of S. alterniflora‐invaded ecosystems is similar to or lower than that of most native ecosystems. As soil bulk density is often reduced by S. alterniflora invasions, the C storage capabilities of vegetated native ecosystems might be substantially reduced after S. alterniflora invasions. Moreover, the SOC content in these invaded ecosystems gradually decreased after long‐term S. alterniflora invasions (>20 years). Therefore, the displacement of native salt marsh or mangrove species by S. alterniflora may not be considered a natural climate solution to increase the C sink in coastal China. Future efforts are required to control S. alterniflora preferentially in coastal wetlands where S. alterniflora invasions do not increase the SOC content, and to conserve and restore native coastal wetlands, which are the core areas of the World Natural Heritage site serving as China's Migratory Bird Sanctuaries that have been severely threatened by S. alterniflora invasions, to increase ecological integrity and C sinks and to mitigate climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a21SG02c“Shuguang Program” supported by Shanghai Education Development Foundation and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission  a2020M681164cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  aBX20200094cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a2021YFC2600102cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a41630528cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a91951112cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21XD1420700cProgram of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader  a21DZ1201902cScience and Technology Department of Shanghai  a21TQ004cShanghai Pilot Program for Basic Research 3aKandelia 3aSpartina alterniflora 3aSuaeda salsa 3aapplied ecology 3aclimate change 3aintroduced species 3ameta-analysis 3amigratory birds 3asalt marshes 3asoil density 3asoil organic carbon 3aChina1 aWei, Shujuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4677-05721 aChen, Hongyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7394-17471 aLi, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0439-56661 aNie, Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0702-80090 tJournal of applied ecology.g2022 July, v. 59, no. 7 p.1937-1946dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.142023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011400167300001600281520104300297592002801340650001401368650001801382650001801400650001701418650001301435650001801448650001901466650002801485650002601513650001601539650001501555653001501570653001701585653001301602653000901615653000801624653001501632700002001647700001901667700001801686773008901704856008501793852000901878655001201887IND60599402920221122051417.0180702e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059940292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2013.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbad, Sergi10aRapid monitoring of glycerol in fermentation growth media: Facilitating crude glycerol bioprocess development  ap. 210-214.  aRecently, the need for crude glycerol valorisation from the biodiesel industry has generated many studies for practical and economic applications. Amongst them, fermentations based on glycerol media for the production of high value metabolites are prominent applications. This has generated a need to develop analytical techniques which allow fast and simple glycerol monitoring during fermentation. The methodology should be fast and inexpensive to be adopted in research, as well as in industrial applications. In this study three different methods were analysed and compared: two common methodologies based on liquid chromatography and enzymatic kits, and the new method based on a DotBlot assay coupled with image analysis. The new methodology is faster and cheaper than the other conventional methods, with comparable performance. Good linearity, precision and accuracy were achieved in the lower range (10 or 15g/L to depletion), the most common range of glycerol concentrations to monitor fermentations in terms of growth kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3abioprocessing 3aculture media 3afermentation 3aglycerol 3agrowth models 3aimage analysis 3aindustrial applications 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 0aMonitoring 0aFermentation 0aGlycerol 0aHPLC 0aTLC 0aBioprocess1 aPérez, Xavier,1 aPlanas, Antoni1 aTuron, Xavier0 tTalanta.g2014 Apr., v. 121 p.210-214dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2013.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01386naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011700154300001800271520033900289592002800628650001100656650002300667650002300690650002200713650001800735650001200753700002100765700001700786700001300803700001600816773013300832856007400965852000901039655001201048IND60682085020221118044804.0200124e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068208502DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc07255a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fei10aOne-pot solution synthesis of carbon-coated silicon nanoparticles as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries  ap. 1109-1112.  aCarbon-coated silicon nanoparticles were in situ synthesized via a facile one-pot solution synthesis method, which delivered an excellent cycling performance with a retained discharge capacity of 1120 mA h g⁻¹ and almost no capacity decay after 500 cycles at 2 A g⁻¹ when evaluated as an anode material in lithium ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3alithium batteries 3ananoparticles 3asilicon1 aSong, Changsheng1 aZhao, Baoxun1 aSun, Lin1 aDu, Hongbin0 tChemical communications.g2020 Jan. 23, v. 56, no. 7 p.1109-1112dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cc07255a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01418naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012300171300001400294520046000308592002800768650001700796650000900813650001300822650001600835650001000851650001700861650002500878773012200903856008201025852000901107655001201116IND60681741620221122202950.0200117e199309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068174162DNAL7 a10.1177/0898756493010003042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandenbergh, Lucia14aThe use of a Modified Quad-Helix Appliance in the Correction of Lingually Displaced Mandibular Canine Teeth in the Dog  ap. 20-25.  aWhen deciduous mandibular canine teeth are retained in the dog the permanent mandibular canine teeth are often lingually displaced.

Burea plant was examined using two antioxidant assays. Selected volatile chemicals identified in these plants were also tested for antioxidant activity. All extracts exhibited antioxidant activity with a clear dose response in the aldehyde/carboxylic acid and the malonaldehyde/gas chromatography (MA/GC) assays. Antioxidant activity of extracts at the level of 500 μg/mL ranged from 77.02 ± 0.51% (stems of Burea plant) to 52.57 ± 0.92% (fermented tea of Camellia and stems of Mulberry tea) in the aldehydes/carboxylic acid assay. Their antioxidant activity at the level of 160 μg/mL ranged from 76.17 ± 0.27% (roots of Burea plant) to 59.32 ± 0.27% (stems of Mulberry tea) in the MA/GC assay. Among the positively identified compounds (11 terpenes and terpenoids, 15 alkyl compounds, 26 nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds, 9 oxygen containing heterocyclic compounds, 18 aromatic compounds, 7 lactones, 6 acids, and 4 miscellaneous compounds), eugenol, 2,5-dihydroxyl acetophenone, and isoeugenol exhibited antioxidant activity comparable to that of BHT in both assays. Vanillin and 2-acetylpyrrole showed potent antioxidant activity in the aldehydes/carboxylic acid assay but only moderate activity in the MA/GC assay. These results suggest that consumption of antioxidant-rich beverages prepared from these plants may be beneficial to human health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aMaclura tricuspidata 3aMorus alba 3aacids 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3adose response 3aeugenol 3agas chromatography 3ahuman health 3alactones 3amalondialdehyde 3amedicinal plants 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aroots 3astems 3atea 3aterpenoids 3avanillin 3avolatile compounds 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aCamellia sinensisxchemistry 2aMoraceaexchemistry 2aMorusxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxanalysis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis 0aantioxidants 0avolatile constituents 0anatural plants 0atea1 aJang, Hae Won1 aShibamoto, Takayuki0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 60, no. 36 p.9097-9105dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf301800x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02878naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245009300179300001800272520102200290592002801312650003101340650001601371650001901387650002201406650001101428650001901439650001101458650001901469650001801488650001101506650000901517650001501526650001201541650007301553650002301626650006301649650003301712650007101745653002201816653001901838653003101857653001701888653001401905700002301919700002301942700001801965700002401983700002102007700002002028700002202048773013402070852000902204856007502213655001202288IND4464700820221120193535.0160905e20120912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446470082DNAL7 a228497242pmid7 a10.1021/jf30213172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarumoto, Shinsuke10aIdentification of a Germicidal Compound against Picornavirus in Bamboo Pyroligneous Acid  ap. 9106-9111.  aThe germicidal activity of pyroligneous acid (PA) against a picornavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), was analyzed, and the component responsible for its disinfectant activity was identified. Bamboo PA (BPA) inactivated EMCV, but neutralization of BPA abolished this activity. Using liquid–liquid phase extraction and silica gel column chromatography, the hydrophobic active fraction of BPA was separated and its 12 major components were identified. The active fraction was reconstructed by mixing synthetic chemicals at the determined concentrations, and a subtraction series of one chemical from the complete mixture was prepared. An in vitro virus assay demonstrated that phenol was the sole germicidal component, and acetic acid augmented the phenol’s inactivating activity resulting in >5-log decrease in EMCV infectivity. Considering the low environmental risk of PA, these findings suggest that BPA is a potentially useful agent for preventing viral epidemics in agricultural and human environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEncephalomyocarditis virus 3aacetic acid 3achromatography 3adisease outbreaks 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3amixing 3aneutralization 3apathogenicity 3aphenol 3arisk 3asilica gel 3aviruses 2aAntiviral Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aBambusaxchemistry 2aPhenolxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aPicornaviridaexdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 0apyroligneous acid 0abamboo vinegar 0aencephalomyocarditis virus 0apicornavirus 0agermicide1 aYamamoto, Seiji P.1 aNishimura, Hiroshi1 aOnomoto, Koji1 aYatagai, Mitsuyoshi1 aYazaki, Kazufumi1 aFujita, Takashi1 aWatanabe, Takashi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Sept. 12, v. 60, no. 36 p.9106-9111dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf30213173Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03314naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006800152245009300220300001600313520146500329592002801794650001301822650001301835650002901848650002601877650002701903650002001930650002001950650001201970650001101982650001201993650001102005650001102016650000902027650000902036650001402045650001302059650001402072650001502086650001802101650001502119650001302134650001102147651001902158651001902177653001402196653002702210653002202237653001202259653000902271653003702280700007602317700003102393700007602424773010402500856008702604852000902691655001202700IND60557497020221120163342.0180904e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055749702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-García, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4689-277510aSolubility of aerosol trace elements: Sources and deposition fluxes in the Canary Region  ap. 167-174.  aAfrican dust inputs have important effects on the climate and marine biogeochemistry of the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. The impact of dust inputs on oceanic carbon uptake and climate is dependent on total dust deposition fluxes as well as the bioavailability of nutrients and metals in the dust. In this work, the solubility of trace metals (Fe, Al, Mn, Co and Cu) and ions (Ca, sulphate, nitrate and phosphate) has been estimated from the analysis of a long-time series of 109 samples collected over a 3-year period in the Canary Islands. Solubility is primarily a function of aerosol origin, with higher solubility values corresponding to aerosols with more anthropogenic influence. Using soluble fractions of trace elements measured in this work, atmospheric deposition fluxes of soluble metals and nutrients have been calculated. Inputs of dissolved nutrients (P, N and Fe) have been estimated for the mixed layer. Considering that P is the limiting factor when ratios of these elements are compared with phytoplankton requirements, an increase of 0.58 nM of P in the mixed layer (∼150 m depth) and in a year can be estimated, which can support an increase of 0.02 μg Chla L⁻¹ y⁻¹. These atmospheric inputs of trace metals and nutrients appear to be significant relative to the concentrations reported in this region, especially during the summer months when the water column is more stratified and deep-water nutrient inputs are reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaluminum 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aatmospheric deposition 3abioavailability 3abiogeochemistry 3acalcium 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acobalt 3acopper 3aions 3airon 3amanganese 3anitrates 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphytoplankton 3asolubility 3asulfates 3asummer 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aCanary Islands 0aNutrients 0aTrace metal solubility 0aDeposition fluxes 0aAerosol 0aDust 0aSubtropical North Atlantic Ocean1 aGelado-Caballero, María Dolores1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4001-96731 aCollado-Sánchez, Cayetano1 aHernández-Brito, José Joaquín1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5305-16670 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Jan., v. 148 p.167-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013700165300001600302520172700318592002802045650001002073650001402083650001202097650000902109650001702118651001702135651001402152651000902166653002802175653001002203653002302213653001602236653001202252653001202264653002502276653001302301653001802314653001802332700001802350773009702368856008202465852000902547655001202556IND60126038020221120084731.0151104e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012603802DNAL7 a10.1525/cond.2012.1200392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAreta, Juan I.10aSpecies Limits and Clinal Variation in a Widespread High Andean Furnariid: The Buff-Breasted Earthcreeper (Upucerthia validirostris)  ap. 131-142.  aThe Buff-breasted Earthcreeper (Upucerthia validirostris) is endemic to western Argentina, and the Plain-breasted Earthcreeper (U. jelskii, including subspecies saturata in the north and pallida in the south), ranges from northern Peru to northwestern Argentina. They have been considered subspecies, as constituents of a superspecies, and as different species. From north to south, a morphocline, involving an increase of rustiness of the plumage and of ∼15% in bill length, 10% in wing length, and 20% in tail length, links jelskii to validirostris. The cline linking jelskii and pallida is gradual, over ∼1800 km; that between pallida and validirostris is steep, over ∼80 km. The northernmost record of validirostris is from the northern Calchaquies Valley, Salta, northwestern Argentina, a valley surrounded by mountains of up to ∼6300 m above sea level through which the lowest pass is at over 4900 m, forming a barrier between validirostris and the southernmost record of pallida to the north. The song, continuous song, duet, and call of validirostris are structurally indistinguishable from those of jelskiilpallida and from the single available recorded song of saturata. In all playback experiments, validirostris answered by approaching and vocalizing to voices of validirostris and jelskii /pallida and vice versa. Treatment of validirostris as a single species is warranted, and three subspecies can be tentatively recognized: southern validirostris (large, rufescent birds with buff bellies restricted to Argentina), central and northern jelskii (small, pale birds ranging from northwestern Argentina to central Peru), and northern saturata (small, dark, and brownish birds in northern central Peru).  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3amountains 3aplumage 3atail 3avocalization 3aAndes region 3aArgentina 3aPeru 0aallopatric distribution 0aAndes 0aCalchaquies Valley 0aFurnariidae 0ajelskii 0apallida 0aplayback experiments 0asaturata 0avalidirostris 0avocalizations1 aPearman, Mark0 tCondor.g2013 Feb., v. 115, no. 1 p.131-142dUniversity of California Pressx1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1525%2Fcond.2012.1200393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010800176300001600284520101600300592002801316650001501344650001301359650001701372650001701389650001601406650001001422650001601432650001201448650001101460650002601471650002101497650002001518650001401538650001801552650002701570650001301597650003301610653001301643653002801656653003101684653002601715700003101741700002301772700001801795700002401813700002101837773010801858856008601966852000902052655001202061IND60540747720221123000412.0190318e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054074772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.10.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamora-Mora, Vanessa10aMagnetic core–shell chitosan nanoparticles: Rheological characterization and hyperthermia application  ap. 691-698.  aStabilized magnetic nanoparticles are the subject of intense research for targeting applications and this work deals with the design, preparation and application of specific core–shell nanoparticles based on ionic crosslinked chitosan. The nanometric size of the materials was demonstrated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) that also proved an increase of the size of chitosan nanoparticles (NPs) with the magnetite content. Steady oscillatory rheology measurements revealed a gel-like behavior of aqueous dispersions of chitosan NPs with concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 2.0% (w/v). The cytotoxicity of all the materials synthesized was analyzed in human fibroblasts cultures using the Alamar Blue and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. The measured specific power absorption under alternating magnetic fields (f=580kHz, H=24kA/m) indicated that magnetic core–shell chitosan NPs can be useful as remotely driven heaters for magnetic hyperthermia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3acytotoxicity 3adispersions 3afever 3afibroblasts 3aheaters 3ahumans 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alight scattering 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetite 3ananoparticles 3arheological properties 3arheology 3ascanning electron microscopy 0aChitosan 0aSodium tripolyphosphate 0aCore–shell nanoparticles 0aMagnetic hyperthermia1 aFernández-Gutiérrez, Mar1 aSan Román, Julio,1 aGoya, Gerardo1 aHernández, Rebeca,1 aMijangos, Carmen0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 102 p.691-698dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.10.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01662naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245006800176300001400244520064200258592002800900650001100928650000900939650001100948650001600959650001000975650001500985650002501000700001601025700002201041700001701063700002001080773012101100856008201221852000901303655001201312IND60681741920221122202943.0200117e199312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068174192DNAL7 a10.1177/0898756493010004032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarretta, Sandra Manfra10aIdeal Coronal Endodontic access Points for the Canine Dentition  ap. 12-15.  aThe ideal coronal access sites to the canine dentition are described and pictured in this report.

Despite the importance of assessing migrants' survival through all phases of their life-cycle, data from their tropical winter ranges are few. In this study we used 14 years of data on captured birds to quantify the influence of mass on the annual survival of the Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea) in northeastern Costa Rica and compared our results to survival estimates generated from the breeding grounds. Furthermore, from estimates of population growth (λ) based on marked individuals, we projected the Prothonotary Warbler's demographic trajectory at our study site. Our results suggest that heavier individuals had higher rates of annual survival. Population growth at our study sites was stable, punctuated by swings in growth and decline. We believe the benefits of weight gain (preparation for migration and intraspecific competition for territories) outweigh inherent costs (greater susceptibility to predation).  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3abreeding sites 3aintraspecific competition 3alatitude 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3aweight gain 3aCosta Rica 0aCosta Rica 0amigrant 0asurvival 0apopulation growth 0amass 0aover-winter.1 aJohnson, Matthew D.1 aRalph, C.

One-week-old upland rice (Oryza sativa indica DOURADOAGULHA) seedlings were separately exposed to 100 μM arsenite [As(III)] and arsenate [As(V)] in hydroponic culture for 12 h. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis revealed that 2983 and 1844 genes were responsive under As(III) and As(V) stresses, respectively. There were 915 shared genes between As(III) and As(V) treatments. Arsenic stress induced changes in complicated gene regulatory pathway of upland rice seedlings, including transcriptional regulation, hormone signaling, redox, transporters and detoxification process. In upland rice separately exposed to As(III) and As(V) for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h, qRT-PCR analysis showed that WRKY4, bHLH and AP2-EREBP associated with transcriptional regulation were significantly down-regulated, while NAC [NAM (no apical meristem), ATAF (Arabidopsis thaliana activating factor) and CUC (cup-shaped cotyledon)] transcription factor was up-regulated. The hormone signaling related gene OZG2, the redox related genes encoding Prx, GST, oxidoreductase and cytochrome P450, the transporter process related genes OsABCC9 and ZIP3 were affected under As stress. Under As(III) and As(V) treatments for 1 and 3 d, the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in upland rice were increased, while catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) contents were significantly declined. In addition, transcriptomic analysis showed that the genes encoding SOD, Prx, Grx and TrxR were mostly down-regulated. In conclusion, the combination of transcriptome and physiological response may provide a deeper understanding about the molecular mechanism in the response to As in upland rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aOryza sativa 3aapical meristems 3aarsenates 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3acatalase 3acotyledons 3acytochrome P-450 3agenes 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahighlands 3ahydroponics 3amalondialdehyde 3aperoxidase 3aphysiological response 3arice 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3atransporters 0aAntioxidant enzyme 0aArsenate 0aArsenite 0aGene expression 0aUpland rice1 aZheng, Feng1 aNorton, Gareth J.1 aBeesley, Luke1 aZhang, Zulin1 aLin, Hui1 aZhi, Suli1 aLiu, Xuncheng1 aDing, Yongzhen0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2021 Mar., v. 183 p.104366-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1043663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007600168300001600244520124000260592002801500650002601528650002301554650002001577650003401597650001401631650001001645650002201655650002001677650001701697650001301714650001101727651001501738651001401753653002201767653002601789653002301815653001901838653001301857700002001870700002601890700002101916700001701937700002001954700002301974773010401997856008502101852000902186655001202195IND60581684320221119003845.0171005e20161215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058168432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntturi, Jim10aCosts and benefits of low-sulphur fuel standard for Baltic Sea shipping  ap. 431-440.  aThe maximum allowable fuel sulphur content for shipping in the Baltic Sea dropped from 1%S to 0.1%S in 1 January 2015. We provide a cost-benefit analysis of the sulphur reduction policy in the Baltic Sea Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA). We calculated the abatement costs based on shipowners' optimal decision-making in choosing between low-sulphur fuel and a sulphur scrubber, and the benefits were modelled through a high-resolution impact pathway analysis, which took into account the formation and dispersion of the emissions, and considered the positive health impacts resulting from lowered ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Our basic result indicates that for the Baltic Sea only, the latest sulphur regulation is not cost-effective. The expected annual cost is roughly €465 M and benefit 2200 saved Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) or monetized €105 M. Based on our sensitivity analysis, the benefits yet have a potential to exceed the costs. The analysis neither takes into account the acidifying impact of sulphur nor the impact North Sea shipping has on the cost-benefit ratio. Lastly, a similar approach is found highly recommendable to study the implications of the upcoming Tier III NOx standard for shipping.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost benefit analysis 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3adisability-adjusted life year 3aemissions 3afuels 3aissues and policy 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulates 3ashipping 3asulfur 3aBaltic Sea 3aNorth Sea 0aSulphur Directive 0aCost-benefit analysis 0aParticulate matter 0aHealth impacts 0aShipping1 aHänninen, Otto1 aJalkanen, Jukka-Pekka1 aJohansson, Lasse1 aPrank, Marje1 aSofiev, Mikhail1 aOllikainen, Markku0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Dec. 15, v. 184 p.431-440dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245011800168300002000286520080900306592002801115650002201143650003801165650001001203650002101213650001601234650001201250650001601262650002301278700002401301773012401325856007501449852000901524655001201533IND60636136620221123015704.0190505e20170209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063613662DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra00298j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoura Ramos, Joaquim J.10aThermal behavior and molecular mobility in the glassy state of three anti-hypertensive pharmaceutical ingredients  ap. 10831-10840.  aThe slow molecular mobility in the amorphous solid state of three active pharmaceutical drugs (valsartan, telmisartan and irbesartan) has been studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the dielectric technique of thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC). The thermal behavior of the three substances (melting, glass forming ability, glass stability) and the features of their amorphous solid state (glass transition, activation energy for the structural relaxation) were studied by DSC. The TSDC study of the mobility in the glassy state yielded the main kinetic features of the α- and of the secondary relaxations.

C.,10aCircular RNA circBbs9 promotes PM2.5-induced lung inflammation in mice via NLRP3 inflammasome activation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) is one of the most important components of environmental pollutants, and is associated with pulmonary injury. However, the biological mechanisms of pulmonary damage caused by PM₂.₅ are poorly defined, especially the molecular pathways related to inflammation. Following system exposure to PM₂.₅ for 3 months in normal mice and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) model mice, it was found that PM₂.₅ exposure increased the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 in lung tissues via NLRP3 activation, and these effects were more intense in COPD model mice. Circular RNA (circRNA) sequencing showed that the expression profiles of circRNAs were changed after PM₂.₅ exposure, and the positive roles of circBbs9 in inflammation induced by PM₂.₅ were verified. The circBbs9 knockdown alleviated PM₂.₅-induced inflammation via NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation, as well as IL-1β and IL-18 inhibition in RAW264.7 cells, while overexpression of circBbs9 had the opposite effect. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays showed that circBbs9 bound to microRNA-30e-5p (miR-30e-5p) and co-regulated the expression of Adar, a downstream target gene of miR-30e-5p. Taken together, these results revealed that PM₂.₅ induced pulmonary inflammation through NLRP3 inflammasome activation regulated by the circBbs9-miR-30e-5p-Adar pathway. Our findings provide a new target, circBbs9, for the assessment of lung inflammation and COPD exacerbation induced by PM₂.₅ exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioinformatics 3acircular RNA 3aenvironment 3agenes 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-18 3aluciferase 3alungs 3aparticulates 3arespiratory tract diseases 0aPM2.5 0aNLRP3 inflammasome 0aLung inflammation 0aCOPD exacerbation1 aHua, Qiuhan1 aShao, Yueting1 aZeng, Huixian1 aLiu, Yufei1 aDiao, Qinqin1 aZhang, Han1 aQiu, Miaoyun1 aZhu, Jialu1 aLi, Xun1 aLing, Yihui1 aZhang, Rong1 aJiang, Yiguo0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Oct., v. 143 p.105976-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1059763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01867naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245008900156300001800245520070400263592002800967650002200995650001101017650001401028650003501042650001301077650003701090650001401127700001501141700001301156700001201169700001501181700001901196700001701215700001501232700001601247773012201263856007501385852000901460655001201469IND60636136720221120181944.0190505e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063613672DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra00305f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Yongshi10aFuran-carboxamide derivatives as novel inhibitors of lethal H5N1 influenza A viruses  ap. 9620-9627.  aIn this study, we reported the synthesis and biological characterization of a novel series of furan-carboxamide derivatives that were potent inhibitors of the influenza A H5N1 virus.

Overt immune responses is suspected to cause severe symptoms, so anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids have been recommended for treatment. However, one clinical study reported that treatment with glucocorticoids, dexamethasone (Dex) exacerbates disease severity. Here we investigated Dex treatment on EV71 infection using the murine model and found that both long-term (14-day) and short-term (4-day) Dex treatment starting from 1 or 3 days postinfection increased the mortality and disease severity of infected mice. Dex treatment starting from 4 or 8 days postinfection did not affect mouse mortality and disease severity. Early Dex treatment starting from 1 day postinfection caused atrophy and enhanced apoptosis in lymphoid organs to decrease the numbers of lymphocytes (CD4⁺ T cells, CD8⁺ T cells, and CD19⁺ B cells) and to increase viral loads in infected tissues of mice. Our results demonstrate that Dex treatment has no beneficial effect on EV71 infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aEnterovirus A 3aanimal diseases 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3aatrophy 3adexamethasone 3aencephalitis 3aglucocorticoids 3aimmune response 3alymphatic system 3amice 3amortality 3atissues 3aviral load 0aEV71 0aLymphocyte 0aAnti-inflammatory1 aShen, Ting-Jing1 aChang, Tung-Miao1 aSu, Ih-Jen1 aChen, Shun-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4585-92790 tVirology.g2014 Sept., v. 464-465 p.218-227dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.07.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01482naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006800159300002000227520055000247592002800797650001200825650001900837650002300856650001400879700001600893700001700909700001500926700001900941773012400960856007501084852000901159655001201168IND60636136820221120171101.0190505e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063613682DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra00308k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Dongqin13aAn electrostatic nanosecond switch in a nanoscale water channel  ap. 17720-17723.  aWe proposed a nanoscale water switch composed of CNTs.

The utility of E1 was specifically improved by mutating active site residues, including 245 and 213, which led to up to a 2-fold increase in activity in 10% w/v 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM][Cl]). Improvements in activity resulted from altering the balance of affinity between [BMIM][Cl] and the substrate for E1. Furthermore, stability studies revealed that the presence of a tyrosine at position 245 not only prevents competitive inhibition by [BMIM][Cl] but also stabilizes E1 (2.5-fold in 10% w/v [BMIM][Cl]) against [BMIM][Cl]-induced denaturation. These studies uncovered the previously unknown role of aggregation in the inactivation of E1, which was linked to structural fluctuations in the region of residues 120–150 and 160–180. By engineering a non-native disulfide within this region, the stability of E1 toward [BMIM][Cl] was improved even further, which correlated with lower aggregation kinetics. While leading to novel variants of E1 with improved activity and stability in the presence of [BMIM][Cl], our findings suggest a new strategy for reducing the inactivation of cellulases and potentially other enzymes by ionic liquids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidothermus cellulolyticus 3aactive sites 3abiomass 3achlorides 3adenaturation 3adisulfide bonds 3adisulfides 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agreen chemistry 3amutagenesis 3atyrosine 0acellulase 0abiofuels 0a1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride 0arational mutagenesis 0abiocatalysis 0aenzyme engineering1 aKraft, Casey1 aAlamdari, Sarah1 aPfaendtner, Jim1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6727-29571 aKaar, Joel L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0794-39550 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 July 10, v. 8, no. 30 p.11299-11307dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c032423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200385 u 4500001001100000005001700011008004100028016002100069024003300090040001800123100001700141245007200158300001800230520096900248592002801217650001901245650001201264650001901276650001501295650000801310650001301318650002501331651002101356700001901377700001801396700002201414700002501436700001701461700002201478700002301500773012601523856008301649852000901732655001201741IND608023220221117233600.0170526e20111202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND60802322DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12039092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPagani, Mark14aThe Role of Carbon Dioxide During the Onset of Antarctic Glaciation  ap. 1261-1264.  aEarth’s modern climate, characterized by polar ice sheets and large equator-to-pole temperature gradients, is rooted in environmental changes that promoted Antarctic glaciation approximately 33.7 million years ago. Onset of Antarctic glaciation reflects a critical tipping point for Earth’s climate and provides a framework for investigating the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) during major climatic change. Previously published records of alkenone-based CO2 from high- and low-latitude ocean localities suggested that CO2 increased during glaciation, in contradiction to theory. Here, we further investigate alkenone records and demonstrate that Antarctic and subantarctic data overestimate atmospheric CO2 levels, biasing long-term trends. Our results show that CO2 declined before and during Antarctic glaciation and support a substantial CO2 decrease as the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation, consistent with model-derived CO2 thresholds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aglaciation 3aice 3alatitude 3atemperature profiles 3aAntarctic region1 aHuber, Matthew1 aLiu, Zhonghui1 aBohaty, Steven M.1 aHenderiks, Jorijntje1 aSijp, Willem1 aKrishnan, Srinath1 aDeConto, Robert M.0 tScience.g2011 Dec. 2, v. 334, no. 6060 p.1261-1264dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12039093Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03909naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006700145245008400212300001800296500002000314520214900334592002802483596008502511596008502596596007502681596007702756596007702833650002002910650002502930650002202955650001502977650001902992651001103011700007003022700005603092700007203148700006203220773012803282856008003410852000903490655001203499IND60782343920221116155818.0220708e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078234392DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.141952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCirino, Douglas William1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2273-921510aBalanced spatial distribution of green areas creates healthier urban landscapes  ap. 1884-1896.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe benefits of green infrastructure on human well‐being in urban areas are already well‐established, with strong evidence of the positive effects of the amount and proximity to green areas. However, the understanding of how the spatial distribution and type of green areas affect health is still an open question. Here, through a land sharing and sparing framework, we explore how different spatial configurations of green and built‐up areas and how different types of green areas can affect cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations in São Paulo city, Brazil. Sharing/sparing indicators were selected as the main explanatory factors in the control of all groups of diseases. Land sharing appeared as a favourable spatial condition to prevent cardiovascular hospitalization, while land sparing and arboreal vegetation were relevant to reduce hospitalization by lower respiratory diseases. For upper respiratory diseases, forests seem to provide a disservice, once they were associated with increased rates of hospitalization by respiratory allergies causes. Considering that hospitalization rates and severity of cardiovascular diseases are substantially higher than those of upper respiratory ones, dense vegetation tends to provide more services than disservices. The land sharing configuration, which is characterized by green areas spread throughout the urban network (in streets, gardens, small squares or parks), should lead to higher exposure and use of the benefits of green areas, which may then explain the greater prevention of cardiovascular diseases. These novel results indicate that a more balanced distribution of green areas across built‐up areas creates healthier urban spaces, and thus can be used as an urban planning strategy to leverage the health benefits provided by green infrastructure. Policy implications. Aiming to reduce hospitalizations by cardiovascular and pulmonary causes, urban planning should promote the spreading of green areas across the cities, in order to increase daily contact with natural attributes, giving preference to distribution over total quantity of green in urban landscape.  aPublisher supplied data  a131823/2019‐1cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a309767/2021‐0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a20/15785‐7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2013/23457‐6cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2020/06694‐8cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aapplied ecology 3agreen infrastructure 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3asocial welfare 3aBrazil1 aTambosi, Leandro Reverberi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5486-73101 aMauad, Thais1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3354-14661 ade Freitas, Simone Rodrigues1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5864-48161 aMetzger, Jean Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0087-52400 tJournal of applied ecology.g2022 July, v. 59, no. 7 p.1884-1896dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.141953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010200165300002000267500001900287520158500306592002801891650001101919650001401930650001101944650001301955650002001968650001401988650001902002650001102021650001402032650001402046653000802060653002702068653002502095653002502120653001902145700001802164700005702182700001402239700001702253700005602270700005302326773014602379856008502525852000902610655001202619IND60705289720221119230428.0200803e20200708xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070528972DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c032732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Dan10aRational Design of N-Doped CuS@C Nanowires toward High-Performance Half/Full Sodium-Ion Batteries  ap. 11317-11327.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTransition-metal sulfides (TMSs) are considered excellent anode materials for sodium-ion batteries by virtue of decent capabilities based on multielectron conversion reactions. Herein, N-doped carbon-coated CuS nanowires (CuS NWs@NC) were facilely fabricated via a refluxing method, following in situ dopamine polymerization and sulfidation process. Employed as anodes for SIBs, the CuS NWs@NC deliver a highly invertible capacity of 571.1 mA h g–¹ after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g–¹ and a competitive rate capability of 294.4 mA h g–¹ even at 20 A g–¹. Remarkably, they exhibit a competitive long-life cyclic stability (216.7 mA h g–¹ at 20 A g–¹, 81.7% capacity retention over 10,000 cycles). Furthermore, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique test reveals that the unique nanoarchitecture boosts the Na⁺ diffusion ability, guaranteeing superb cyclability and exceptional rate performance. Finally, a NVP/C||CuS NW@NC full battery was facilely constructed, which demonstrates a steady capacity of 220 mA h g–¹ at 0.2 A g–¹ over 200 cycles. The superior sodium storage performance is likely due to the one-dimensional coaxial core–shell nanoarchitecture and synergistic effect of the inner CuS nanowires with the outer conductive nitrogen-doped carbon layer, which provide a highway for fast electron/ion transport, restrain stress and agglomeration of CuS during cycling, and offer a significant capacitive-controlled capacity contribution. This scalable design provides a new strategy for improving the sodium storage property of other TMSs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abatteries 3acarbon 3adopamine 3agreen chemistry 3ananowires 3apolymerization 3asodium 3asynergism 3atitration 0aCuS 0acore−shell structure 0aN-doped carbon layer 0asodium-ion batteries 0afull batteries1 aYin, Mengmeng1 aFeng, Caihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2825-09041 aZhan, Kun1 aJiao, Qingze1 aLi, Hansheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6582-22701 aZhao, Yun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4432-93050 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2020 July 08, v. 8, no. 30 p.11317-11327dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c032733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04082naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245016900179300001600348520225000364592002802614650001302642650002602655650001102681650001102692650001102703650002502714650001302739650001102752650001902763650001402782650002002796650002202816650000902838650001402847650001102861650001702872650003702889650001002926650002202936650000902958651001502967653002302982653002403005653003103029653004003060653002403100653001403124700001803138700002403156700001803180700002203198700002203220700002603242773010403268856008703372852000903459655001203468IND60557497620221120230036.0180904e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055749762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirmohammadi, Farimah10aOxidative potential of on-road fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measured on major freeways of Los Angeles, CA, and a 10-year comparison with earlier roadside studies  ap. 102-114.  aThis study describes on-road measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using a mobile instrumentation platform to assess the chemical composition and oxidative potential of PM2.5, using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay, over three representative roadways in the Los Angeles Basin: the I-110 and I-710 freeways, the Wilshire/Sunset boulevards as well as the main campus of the University of Southern California (USC), used as a reference urban background site. Samples were chemically analyzed for elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 50 elements. The cumulative mass fraction of the measured PAHs was highest on the freeways (0.16 ± 0.01 and 0.15 ± 0.01 ng/μg PM, on I-110 and I-710, respectively); which on average was 3 and 3.3-fold higher than at Wilshire/Sunset and USC site, respectively. Mass fractions of Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb and Zn, tracers of vehicular abrasion, were 3.8 ± 0.8 times higher on both freeways in comparison to Wilshire/Sunset. The observed intrinsic (normalized per PM mass) DTT activity was greatest on freeways, averaging 30.13 ± 3.15 nmol/min mg PM and being roughly 1.9 and 2.1 times higher than the values obtained at Wilshire/Sunset and USC, respectively.Furthermore, comparison of our results with previous on-road and roadside studies conducted in the last decade in Los Angeles indicated an overall reduction in the contribution of carbonaceous species and PAHs (important tracers of exhaust emissions) to PM mass, especially on I-710 freeway with the higher heavy-duty diesel vehicle fraction, indicating the effectiveness of diesel vehicle emissions control policies implemented in recent years in California. In contrast, greater contributions of certain groups of metals and trace elements that are indicators of non-tailpipe emissions compared to previous studies provide evidence on the increasing importance of non-tailpipe emissions to the oxidative potential of on-road PM2.5 as vehicular exhaust emissions becomes cleaner. This finding was also reflected in the increased levels of on-road DTT activity by factors of 1.4–1.5 in comparison to the DTT activity of vehicular emissions estimated in previous dynamometer studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abarium 3abasins 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3achromium 3acopper 3adithiothreitol 3aemissions 3ainstrumentation 3aissues and policy 3alead 3amanganese 3anickel 3aparticulates 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aroads 3atracer techniques 3azinc 3aCalifornia 0aParticulate matter 0aOxidative potential 0aDithiothreitol (DTT) assay 0aTailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions 0aMetals and elements 0aEC and OC1 aWang, Dongbin1 aHasheminassab, Sina1 aVerma, Vishal1 aSchauer, James J.1 aShafer, Martin M.1 aSioutas, Constantinos0 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Jan., v. 148 p.102-114dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03840naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245016000167300001800327500002000345520212800365592002802493596006302521650002302584650002402607650002002631650002202651650001702673650001002690650001702700650001502717650003002732650002302762650001102785650001802796650002002814650001002834650001202844651001202856700005802868700006502926700002002991700006003011700005803071773012803129856008003257852000903337655001203346IND60782344020221116160004.0220708e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078234402DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.141842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagnara, Maurizio10aSimulating the spread and establishment of alien species along aquatic and terrestrial transport networks: A multi‐pathway and high‐resolution approach  ap. 1769-1780.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe introduction and further spread of many alien species have been a result of trade and transport. Consequently, alien species are often found close to traffic infrastructure and urban areas. To contain and manage the spread of alien species, it is essential to identify and predict major routes of spread, which cannot be obtained by applying common modelling approaches such as species distribution models. Here, we present a new model called CASPIAN to simulate the dispersal of alien species along traffic infrastructure and the establishment of populations along these routes. The model simulates simultaneous spread of species of up to eight different modes of transport along roads, railways and waterways. We calibrated and validated the model using two species that spread within Germany as case studies: the terrestrial plant Senecio inaequidens and the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, and performed a shortest path analysis to quantify the relative importance of individual routes for spread. The application of the model yielded detailed predictions of dispersal and establishment for >600,000 segments of the traffic network throughout Germany. Once calibrated, the model captured the general spread dynamics of the two species with higher accuracy for the freshwater environment due to the higher quality of data available for the aquatic species. The quantification of spread routes using the shortest path analysis revealed a clear backbone of major routes of spread, which varied depending on the type of traffic network and the starting points considered. Major routes of spread aligned with high traffic intensities, but high traffic per se did not necessarily result in high spread intensities. Synthesis and application. By simulating the spreading dynamics of alien species along transport networks across multiple pathways, CASPIAN enables the identification of major spread routes along different dispersal pathways and quantification of their relative importance, which helps prioritising pathways of introduction as required by international biodiversity goals such as the CBD Aichi targets.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017‐U‐10‐1210cFederal Railway Authority of Germany 3aCorbicula fluminea 3aSenecio inaequidens 3aapplied ecology 3aaquatic organisms 3abiodiversity 3aclams 3adata quality 3afreshwater 3ageographical distribution 3aintroduced species 3amodels 3apath analysis 3aplants (botany) 3atrade 3atraffic 3aGermany1 aNowak, Larissa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1910-80411 aBoehmer, Hans Juergen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9176-48361 aSchöll, Franz,1 aSchurr, Frank M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4518-06021 aSeebens, Hanno1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8993-64190 tJournal of applied ecology.g2022 July, v. 59, no. 7 p.1769-1780dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.141843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245011800164300001400282520165800296592002801954650001201982650002001994650001102014650001202025650001802037650002102055650002302076650001602099650001102115650003402126650001002160650001102170650001002181650002502191650001402216650001302230650000902243650004302252650001502295650001002310650001502320653003002335653002402365700001902389700003302408700002202441700002402463700002002487773014202507856007402649961002302723852000902746655001202755IND60680460920221120104849.0200105e20161228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068046092DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/tow2732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCondon, Catriona H.10aEffects of Low-Oxygen Environments on the Radiation Tolerance of the Cabbage Looper Moth (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)  ap. 80-86.  aIonizing radiation is used as a phytosanitary treatment to mitigate risks from invasive species associated with trade of fresh fruits and vegetables. Commodity producers prefer to irradiate fresh product stored in modified atmosphere packaging that increases shelf life and delays ripening. However, irradiating insects in low oxygen may increase radiation tolerance, and regulatory agencies are concerned modified atmosphere packaging will decrease efficacy of radiation doses. Here, we examined how irradiation in a series of oxygen conditions (0.1–20.9 kPa O₂) alters radiotolerance of larvae and pupae of a model lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) (Diptera: Noctuidae). Irradiating in severe hypoxia (0.1 kPa O₂) increased radiation tolerance of insects compared with irradiating in atmospheric oxygen (20.9 kPa O₂). Our data show irradiating pharate adult pupae at 600 Gy in moderately severe hypoxia (5 kPa O₂) increased adult emergence compared with irradiation in atmospheric oxygen (20.9 kPa O₂). Our data also show that in one of the three temporal replicates, irradiating T. ni larvae in moderately severe hypoxia (5 kPa O₂) can also increase radiotolerance at an intermediate radiation dose of 100 Gy compared with irradiating in atmospheric oxygen conditions, but not at higher or lower doses. We discuss implications of our results in this model insect for the current generic doses for phytosanitary irradiation, including the recently proposed 250 Gy generic dose for lepidioptera larvae, and temporary restriction on irradiating commodities in modified atmosphere packaging that reduces the atmosphere to < 18 kPa O₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aTrichoplusia ni 3aadults 3ahypoxia 3ainsect larvae 3ainvasive species 3aionizing radiation 3airradiation 3amodels 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3amoths 3aoxygen 3apupae 3aradiation resistance 3araw fruit 3aripening 3arisk 3asanitary and phytosanitary regulations 3ashelf life 3atrade 3avegetables 0aphytosanitary irradiation 0amodified atmosphere1 aWhite, Sabrina1 aMeagher, R.

In this study, by using age-stage, two-sex life-table parameters, the resistance of seven tomato cultivars, namely, ‘Primo Early’, ‘Rio Grande’, ‘Cal JN3’, ‘Petomech’, ‘Early Urbana Y’, ‘Super 2270’, and ‘Super Strain B’ to T. absoluta, was evaluated under laboratory conditions (25 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% RH, and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h). Larval and pupal periods were longest on Early Urbana Y, 13.86 and 6.52 d, respectively, and shortest on Cal JN3, 10.92 and 5.5 d, respectively. The longest and shortest development times of immature stages lasted 26.42 and 20.83 d on Early Urbana Y and Cal JN3, respectively. Male and female adult longevity was longest on Early Urbana Y, 30.42 and 38.52 d, respectively, and shortest on Cal JN3, 11.67 and 18.8 d, respectively. The net reproductive rate (R₀) ranged between 80.94 (Cal JN3) and 45.87 (Primo Early) offspring. The lowest and the highest values of the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (λ) were on Early Urbana Y and Cal JN3, 0.1052 and 0.1522 and 1.1109 and 1.1644 d–¹, respectively. The mean generation time (T) on different cultivars varied from 30.47 to 37.28 d. Our results indicated that Cal JN3 was the most susceptible to infestation and Primo Early and Early Urbana Y were the most resistant to T. absoluta among the tomato cultivars tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aTuta absoluta 3aadults 3acrop production 3acultivars 3afemales 3aimmatures 3alaboratory experimentation 3alarvae 3alife tables 3alongevity 3amales 3apests 3aprogeny 3apupae 3atomatoes 3aIran 3aSouth America 0atomato moth 0atomato cultivars 0atwo-sex life-table1 aFathipour, Yaghoub1 aAsgari, Shahriar0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2017 Feb. 19, v. 110, no. 2 p.421-429dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow2753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245018900170300001600359520134500375592002801720650002601748650003001774650001901804650001001823650001201833650001201845650001301857650001501870650001101885650001301896651001801909653002401927653002201951653001501973653001501988653002102003653001302024653001502037700002002052700002602072773009702098856008202195852000902277655001202286IND60126039020221120055145.0151104e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012603902DNAL7 a10.1525/cond.2013.1200552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDornak, L.

Henslow's Sparrows have been documented to be unpredictable at breeding sites from year to year, but studies to date have considered only local spatial scales. We compared resettlement behavior (prevalence of occurrence and variation in abundance) of Henslow's Sparrows to that of two other grassland sparrows, Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum) and Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), across multiple spatial resolutions. In Henslow's Sparrows, prevalence was lower and variation in abundance was greater than in the other two species. Indeed, Henslow's Sparrows do not occur consistently at extents of less than 120 000 km², suggesting nomadic characteristics of where they breed from year to year. We suggest that these patterns reflect Henslow's Sparrows' responses to frequently changing habitat, such that this species is tracking spatiotemporal changes in optimal habitat that result from disturbances broadly across regional landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmmodramus savannarum 3aPasserculus sandwichensis 3abreeding sites 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amowing 3aprairies 3aNorth America 0aGrasshopper Sparrow 0aHenslow's Sparrow 0apopulation 0aprevalence 0aSavannah Sparrow 0anomadism 0avariation.1 aBarve, Narayani1 aPeterson, A.

Copper(0) nanoparticles (Cu(0) nanoparticles) of ∼5 nm were used as a catalyst with different nitrogen(N)-ligands for the single-electron transfer mediated LRP (SET-LRP) of methyl methacrylate (MMA) using a biphasic water–toluene system as the reaction media. The polymerization was studied by varying the catalyst concentration (0.15 ppm to 28.5 ppm) as well as by varying the mole ratios of monomer, initiator and N-ligands such as N,N,N′,N′′,N′′′-pentamethyldiethylene-triamine (PMDETA), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine(TMHDA), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and N,N-dimethylhexadecylamine (DMHA). Among the various N-ligands studied PMDETA provided best control over molecular weight while TMHDA gave worst control resulting in a polydispersity of 1.15 and 2.11, respectively at high monomer conversion. The rate of polymerization (kappp) of MMA using Cu(0) nanoparticles/PMDETA at 25 °C and 70 °C was found to be 0.00076 min⁻¹ and 0.0048 min⁻¹, respectively. Under these polymerization conditions, the reactivity ratio of MMA and styrene (St) was found to be 0.41 and 0.23 at 70 °C, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3apolymerization 3asolvents 3astyrene 3atoluene1 aSinghal, Nikita1 aPanwar, Vineeta1 aKumar, Arvind1 aKumar, Umesh1 aRay, Siddharth S.0 tRSC advances.g2017 Feb. 13, v. 7, no. 18 p.11191-11197dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra00368d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008500172300001800257520149300275592002801768650001501796650002201811650002501833700002301858773009401881856008101975852000902056655001202065IND60080233220221116173308.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008023322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-014-0063-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutzwiller, Kevin J.10aRigor and transparency in statistical analyses can help to ensure valid research  ap. 1115-1122.  aAdherence to important assumptions of statistical methods has significant ramifications for development of new knowledge in landscape ecology for two fundamental reasons: these methods will continue to be used widely and will thus affect much of the research on which advances in landscape ecology will be founded; and the degree to which statistical methods are applied appropriately will influence the statistical validity of that research. Rigorous statistical analyses are essential because no discipline can efficiently advance scientifically if one of its primary approaches for generating new knowledge is used incorrectly. Assessing and communicating compliance with statistical assumptions should be standard practice in confirmatory analyses. Better understanding of the robustness of statistical methods to deviations from assumptions can improve investigators’ decisions about which methods to apply. Explanations about the consequences of actual or possible violations of assumptions can clarify the validity of results. Many of the papers in a sample of 215 research articles published in Landscape Ecology during 2004–2013 exhibited substantial lack of clarity about adherence to statistical assumptions. Brief author statements about whether important statistical assumptions were adequately met would improve confidence in results. Ultimately, rigor and transparency in confirmatory statistical analyses will help to ensure the validity of landscape ecology research.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompliance 3alandscape ecology 3astatistical analysis1 aRiffell, Samuel K.0 tLandscape ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 29, no. 7 p.1115-1122dSpringer-Verlagx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-014-0063-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03111naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001400162245011900176300001800295520160400313592002801917650002801945650002001973650001401993650001002007650001402017650000902031650000702040650002302047650001702070650001402087650000902101650001102110650002402121650001202145650002502157650002402182650001702206650002702223650003102250650002002281650001202301650003602313700001402349700001802363700001502381773009902396856007702495852000902572655001202581IND60083330420221122115041.0141101e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008333042DNAL7 a214269582pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2010-39182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, S.H.10aEffect of Dioscorea opposita Thunb. (yam) supplementation on physicochemical and sensory characteristics of yogurt  ap. 1705-1712.  aA study was conducted to examine the physicochemical, microbial, and sensory properties of yogurt made by supplementing powdered yam Dioscorea opposita Thunb. (YPT) at different concentrations (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8%, wt/vol) into milk, which was pasteurized and then fermented at 43°C for 6h and stored for 16 d. The pH values of all samples decreased, whereas viscosity values and mean microbial counts increased during storage. The L* and a* color values (indicators of lightness and redness, respectively) of yogurt samples were not remarkably influenced by adding YPT, whereas the b* values (indicating yellowness) significantly increased with the addition of YPT at all concentrations at 0 d of storage, probably due to the original yellow color of yam powder. In functional component analyses, when the concentration of YPT increased, the amount of allantoin and diosgenin proportionally increased. The content of allantoin was 3.22 and diosgenin 4.69 μg/mL when 0.2% (wt/vol) YPT was supplemented and did not change quantitatively during the storage period (16 d). The sensory test revealed that the overall acceptability scores of YPT-supplemented yogurt samples (0.2 to 0.6%, wt/vol) were quite similar to those of the control throughout the storage period of 16 d. Based on the data obtained from the present study, it was concluded that the concentrations (0.2 to 0.6%, wt/vol) of YPT could be used to produce YPT-supplemented yogurt without significant adverse effects on physicochemical, microbial, and sensory properties, and enhance functional components from the supplementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea oppositifolia 3aadverse effects 3aallantoin 3acolor 3adiosgenin 3amilk 3apH 3asensory properties 3astorage time 3aviscosity 3ayams 3ayogurt 2aAllantoinxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aDioscoreaxchemistry 2aDiosgeninxanalysis 2aFermentation 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPowders 2aYogurtxanalysisxmicrobiology.1 aLee, S.Y.1 aPalanivel, G.1 aKwak, H.S.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2011 Apr., v. 94, no. 4 p.1705-1712dElsevier Inc.x0022-03027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2010-39183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012500168300001800293520189900311592002802210650002902238650002802267650002202295650002902317650001702346650001702363650001402380650001202394650001302406650001502419650001202434650001002446650001202456650001402468700002102482700001802503700002202521773009402543856008102637852000902718655001202727IND60080233320221116173255.0150216e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008023332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-014-0065-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, Simon J.10aEffects of landscape composition and connectivity on the distribution of an endangered parrot in agricultural landscapes  ap. 1249-1259.  aThe extent and connectivity of individual habitat types strongly affects the distribution and abundance of organisms. However, little is known of how the level of connectivity and the interactions between different habitat types influences the distribution of species. Here, we used the geographically restricted and endangered regent parrot Polytelis anthopeplus monarchoides as a case study to examine the importance of composition and connectivity between different elements in 39 complex landscape mosaics (each 10 km radius). We compiled a database of 674 regent parrot nesting records, regional vegetation maps and measures of multipath connectivity between core vegetation types under different scenarios of resistance to movement provided by landscape elements. The occurrence of regent parrot nests was strongly affected by landscape composition, being positively related to the extent Eucalyptus camaldulensis riverine forest, but negatively related to the extent of semi-arid woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus largiflorens. Connectivity between E. camaldulensis forest (principal nesting habitat) and mallee (preferred feeding habitat) was a strong predictor of nest locations. Our study shows that the suitability of fragmented agricultural landscapes for supporting species can be greatly affected by connectivity and interactions between preferred and non-preferred habitats. For species that require complementary habitats such as the regent parrot, conservation management activities may be ineffective if they simply focus on a single core habitat type or the impacts of human land uses without regard to the interrelationships among landscape elements. While increasing the amount of primary preferred habitat should remain a cornerstone goal, increasing the extent and improving connectivity with alternative landscape elements also should be priority management objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aEucalyptus largiflorens 3aagricultural land 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiogeography 3acase studies 3adatabases 3aforests 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3anesting 3anests 3aparrots 3awoodlands1 aWatson, David M.1 aLuck, Gary W.1 aSpooner, Peter G.0 tLandscape ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 29, no. 7 p.1249-1259dSpringer-Verlagx0921-29737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-014-0065-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013400172500001900306520171700325536006202042592002802104650001602132650001102148650002302159650001602182650000902198651001302207653003002220653001602250653001902266653002102285653002302306653002102329653001902350700001702369700002502386773010902411856008602520852000902606655001202615IND60725460320221117203944.0210529e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072546032DNAL7 a10.1080/23311932.2020.17561422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerede, Misganaw10aParticipatory evaluation of malt barley (Hordium disticum L.) varieties in barley-growing highland areas of Northwestern Ethiopia  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough in Ethiopia, improved varieties of malt barley are released year after year, on-time promotion and distribution of released varieties to smallholder farmers are major research limitations. The study was initiated to explore the magnitude and extent of the performance of recently released malt barley varieties through farmers’ participation. The study was conducted at Guagusa Shikudad, Debaytilatgn, Farta and Lay Gaint, which represent barley-growing highland areas of Northwestern Ethiopia. Twelve malt barley varieties, Bahati, Bekoji-1, EH1847, Fanaka, Grace, HB1963, HB1964, Holker, IBON174/03, Sabini, Sington and Traveller, were used as experimental treatments. Treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Malt barley varieties EH1847, HB1963 and IBON174/03, showed wider adaptabable as well as relative stable across tested climatic zones. The farmers’ preference traits in malt barley varieties were relatively similar across tested highland areas. Moreover, disease resistant was ranked first across all climatic zones. The rank correlation analysis between varieties’ rank by farmers and varieties’ grain yield rank was positive across the tested climatic zones. Hereby, farmers could select the higher grain yield malt barley varieties based on agronomic preference traits to their agro-ecologies. Therefore, by considering both grain yield performance of the varieties and varieties’ rank by farmers, the recently released malt barley variety HB1963 should be pre-scale in barley-growing highland areas; also relatively older varieties EH1847 and IBON174/03 are used as genetic materials for the seed source in Northwestern Ethiopia.  aThe authors received no direct funding for this research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3abarley 3adisease resistance 3agrain yield 3amalt 3aEthiopia 0afarmers preference traits 0amalt barley 0amatrix ranking 0apairwise ranking 0apreference ranking 0arank correlation 0astable variety1 aDemsie, Zina1 aTejada Moral, Manuel0 tCogent food & agriculture.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 6, no. 1 p.1756142-dCogentwJournal:21312x2331-19327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2020.17561423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165300001600259520143700275592002801712650002001740650001101760650002201771650001601793650001001809650001801819650003701837700001701874700001601891700001801907700001401925773009201939856004802031852000902079655001202088IND50067751120221116142107.0130817e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006775112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-012-1565-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haishui10aPlant neighbor effects mediated by rhizosphere factors along a simulated aridity gradient  ap. 165-176.  aAIMS: We investigated how rhizosphere factors (total rhizosphere, roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal hyphae [AMF], and soil solution) and water availability affect interactions between neighboring Medicago sativa plants. METHODS: A three-compartment mesocosm was used to test the effects of rhizosphere factors on plant–plant interactions. A relative interaction index (RII) was calculated to indicate whether effects of neighbor plant on target plant were positive or negative (facilitative or competitive). Isotope tracers were used to test whether AMF hyphae mediated competition for nitrogen (N) between target and neighbor plants. RESULTS: The effects of rhizosphere factors on the interactions between neighboring M. sativa plants depended on water availability. The effects of total rhizosphere shifted RII from negative to positive as water availability increased. Interaction with the roots and rhizosphere soil solution of neighbor plants shifted RII from negative to positive as water availability increased but the opposite was true for AMF hyphae. AMF hyphae helped neighbor plants compete for ¹⁵N when water was available but not when water was limiting. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of total rhizosphere on plant–plant interaction of M. sativa shifted from competitive to facilitative as water availability increased. Competition was reduced by neighboring soil solution and roots but was increased by AMF hyphae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3ahyphae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil solution 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aYu, Zhenxing1 aZhang, Qian1 aTang, Jianjun1 aChen, Xin0 tPlant and soil.g2013 Aug., v. 369, no. 1-2 p.165-176dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-012-1565-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02241naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245013600167300001600303520103000319592002801349650000801377650002001385650002101405650001901426650001601445650001101461650001401472653001301486653001301499653001401512653002501526653003401551700006201585773009301647856008301740990002301823852000901846655001201855IND60697432620221122112211.0200605e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069743262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2014.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Haomin10aBacteriophage P1 pac sites inserted into the chromosome greatly increase packaging and transduction of Escherichia coli genomic DNA  ap. 274-282.  aThe Escherichia coli bacteriophage P1 packages host chromosome separately from phage DNA, and transfers it to recipient cells at low frequency in a process called generalized transduction. Phage genomes are packaged from concatemers beginning at a specific site, pac. To increase transduction rate, we have inserted pac into the chromosome at up to five equally spaced positions; at least this many are fully tolerated in the absence of P1 infection. A single chromosomal pac greatly increases transduction of downstream markers without decreasing phage yields; 3.5× as much total chromosomal DNA is packaged. Additional insertions decrease phage yield by >90% and also decrease phage DNA synthesis, although less dramatically. Packaging of chromosomal markers near to and downstream of each inserted pac site is, at the same time, increased by greater than 10 fold. Transduction of markers near an inserted pac site can be increased by over 1000-fold, potentially allowing identification of such transductants by screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteriophages 3achromosomes 3agenome 3ascreening 0aPhage P1 0aPac site 0aPackaging 0aE. coli transduction 0aE.coli chromosome engineering1 aMasters, Millicent1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1396-08660 tVirology.g2014 Nov., v. 468-470 p.274-282dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.07.0293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03750naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245011600182300001800298520162100316592002801937650001101965650001701976650001501993650001702008650001202025650002602037650001502063650001302078650002202091650001502113650002202128650001502150651001102165653001802176653002102194653002802215653002202243700008202265700003902347700003502386700003102421700003502452700003302487700003102520700003002551700003402581700002902615700004702644700003202691700003002723700002202753700003202775700002702807700002902834700003402863773012002897856008603017852000903103655001203112IND60581685220221119004000.0220830e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058168522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Alexandre Rosa dos10aGeotechnology and landscape ecology applied to the selection of potential forest fragments for seed harvesting  ap. 1050-1063.  aThe Atlantic Forest biome is recognized for its biodiversity and is one of the most threatened biomes on the planet, with forest fragmentation increasing due to uncontrolled land use, land occupation, and population growth. The most serious aspect of the forest fragmentation process is the edge effect and the loss of biodiversity. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of forest fragmentation and select potential forest fragments with a higher degree of conservation for seed harvesting in the Itapemirim river basin, Espírito Santo State, Brazil. Image classification techniques, forest landscape ecology, and multi-criteria analysis were used to evaluate the evolution of forest fragmentation to develop the landscape metric indexes, and to select potential forest fragments for seed harvesting for the years 1985 and 2013. According to the results, there was a reduction of 2.55% of the occupancy of the fragments in the basin between the years 1985 and 2013. For the years 1985 and 2013, forest fragment units 2 and 3 were spatialized with a high potential for seed harvesting, representing 6.99% and 16.01% of the total fragments, respectively. The methodology used in this study has the potential to be used to support decisions for the selection of potential fragments for seed harvesting because selecting fragments in different environments by their spatial attributes provides a greater degree of conservation, contributing to the protection and conscious management of the forests. The proposed methodology can be adapted to other areas and different biomes of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3aedge effects 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aharvesting 3aland use 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3apopulation growth 3awatersheds 3aBrazil 0aGeotechnology 0aSpatial analysis 0aMulti-criteria analysis 0aForestry planning1 aAntonio Alvares Soares Ribeiro, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0514-68531 ade Oliveira Peluzio, Telma Machado1 aEsteves Peluzio, João Batista1 ade Queiroz, Vagner Tebaldi1 aFigueira Branco, Elvis Ricardo1 aLorenzon, Alexandre Simões,1 aDomingues, Getulio Fonseca1 aMarcatti, Gustavo Eduardo1 ade Castro, Nero Lemos Martins1 aTeixeira, Thaisa Ribeiro1 ados Santos, Gleissy Mary Amaral Dino Alves1 aSantos Mota, Pedro Henrique1 aFerreira da Silva, Samuel1 aVargas, Rozimelia1 ade Carvalho, José Romário1 aMacedo, Leandro Levate1 ada Silva Araújo, Cintia1 ade Almeida, Samira Luns Hatum0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 183 p.1050-1063dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001800162245011100180300001800291520075700309592002801066650001401094650001601108650002701124650001001151650002401161650002301185650001801208650001101226650002301237650001801260650002701278650001301305650001201318650002401330650005901354650004101413650001001454650002201464650002901486650002501515650004201540650004501582650002701627650001101654650002201665650001501687650001301702700001601715700001601731773009801747856007701845852000901922655001201931IND60083330620221122114957.0141101e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008333062DNAL7 a215245142pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2010-39892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArancibia, C.10aFat replacers in low-fat carboxymethyl cellulose dairy beverages: Color, rheology, and consumer perception  ap. 2245-2258.  aLow-fat foods are an interesting option for consumers interested in health-related issues or in maintaining adequate body weight; however, fat reduction may influence consumer acceptance of the end product. This study aims to obtain information about the effectiveness of λ-carrageenan and a blend (50:50) of short- and long-chain inulin as fat replacers in dairy beverages prepared with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and to determine to what extent consumers perceive instrumental color and rheological differences among samples.

Nepal offers suitable climate, soil, and topography for profitable production of the orthodox tea having exceptional flavor, aroma, and taste. The study was designed to analyze the production trend, annual growth rate, export and import, and prospects of the Nepali orthodox tea. Findings showed that production of tea is in increasing trend with an average annual growth rate of 9.55%. Despite possessing ample opportunity in domestic and international markets, yet country only produces little amount of orthodox tea. Further, 90% of the total produced orthodox tea was imported primarily to India which has been one of the factors for not being able to receive optimum premium as compared to other tea exporting countries like China and India. Thus to revitalize tea subsector, it is recommended to focus on improving tea productivity with proper mechanization, establishing tea processing industries, easy and reliable certification, price intervention, market recognition, and enhancing diplomatic relations for easy market accessibility and duty-free trade.  aThe authors received no direct funding for this research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3acertification 3aclimate 3aexports 3aflavor 3aimports 3amechanization 3aodors 3aprices 3asoil 3ataste 3atea 3atopography 3aworld markets 3aChina 3aIndia 3aNepal 0aCultivation 0ahigh-value 0aorthodox tea 0atrade 0apolicy1 aJoshi, Binod1 aJoshi, Arati1 aYildiz, Fatih0 tCogent food & agriculture.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 6, no. 1 p.1757227-dCogentwJournal:21312x2331-19327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2020.17572273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01450naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011300155300001800268520033700286592002800623650002300651650001300674650001100687650002200698650001100720700001800731700001900749700001400768700002000782700002000802700001200822700001200834700001400846773013300860856007400993852000901067655001201076IND60682086320221118044858.0200124e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068208632DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc08493b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Jianqi10aDefect formation-induced tunable evolution of oxygen functional groups for sodium storage in porous graphene  ap. 1089-1092.  aThe coinciding effects of carbon defects and oxygen functional groups in porous graphene were demonstrated in this work.

The RNA1 (6552nt) of Coffee ringspot virus is organized into five open reading frames (ORFs) capable of encoding the viral nucleocapsid (ORF1p), phosphoprotein (ORF2p), putative cell-to-cell movement protein (ORF3p), matrix protein (ORF4p) and glycoprotein (ORF5p). Each ORF is separated by a conserved intergenic junction. RNA2 (5945nt), which completes the bipartite genome, encodes a single protein (ORF6p) with homology to RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Phylogenetic analysis of L protein sequences firmly establishes CoRSV as a member of the recently proposed Dichorhavirus genus. Predictive algorithms, in planta protein expression, and a yeast-based nuclear import assay were used to determine the nucleophillic character of five CoRSV proteins. Finally, the temperature-dependent ability of CoRSV to establish systemic infections in an initially local lesion host was quantified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aCoffea canephora 3aDichorhavirus 3aRNA 3aalgorithms 3aamino acid sequences 3acrop production 3agenome 3aglycoproteins 3amodels 3anucleocapsid 3aopen reading frames 3aphosphoproteins 3aphylogeny 3aphysiological transport 3aprotein synthesis 3aviruses 0aRhabdovirus 0aProtein localization 0aClimate change 0aNegative-strand RNA virus 0aBrazil 0aVirus emergence1 aFigueira, A.R.1 aSotero, A.J.1 aWang, Ruic(Researcher)1 aGeraldino Duarte, P.S.1 aFarman, M.1 aGoodin, M.M.0 tVirology.g2014 Sept., v. 464-465 p.385-396dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.07.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013400164300001800298520122500316592002801541653002001569653001701589653001801606653001401624653001701638653001201655700001701667700002101684773016901705856008201874852000901956655001201965IND60517036620221117171419.0190728e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051703662DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154120000332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCribb, Nardi10aSite fidelity and behaviour of spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) in Moon Reef, Fiji Islands: implications for conservation  ap. 1793-1798.  aSpinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) were observed to frequent a tropical reef complex off the coast of Fiji on a regular basis. Boats from surrounding tourist destinations visit this reef on a nearly daily basis to observe the dolphins and partake in various tourist activities, such as snorkelling. The aim of the study was to determine whether this reef is a resting habitat for this population. Specifically, we objectively and quantitatively investigated whether spinner dolphins were primarily resting whilst present within the reef and also assessed whether the same individuals revisited the reef over time. Photo-identification techniques and boat based observations were conducted over two study periods (September 2009 and May 2010). Fifty-six recognizable individuals were identified during this period, with 70% resighted on 2 or more occasions. Resting was identified as the most consistent behaviour dolphins engaged in whilst present inside the reef. These preliminary results provide vital information which can be used as a tool in the development and implementation of conservation initiatives as well as providing a basis for future studies investigating the habitat characteristics of this reef.  aPublisher supplied data 0aspinner dolphin 0aFiji Islands 0asite fidelity 0abehaviour 0aconservation 0atourism1 aMiller, Cara1 aSeuront, Laurent0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2012 Dec., v. 92, no. 8 p.1793-1798dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154120000333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245016800158300001600326520071400342592002801056650001701084650001901101650001401120650002301134650002301157650001501180650002101195650001301216650000901229650001801238650001301256650001401269700002001283700001801303700001501321700001801336700001801354700002201372773013101394856007401525852000901599655001201608IND60681743120221120051443.0200117e20200116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068174312DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc07772c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Tingting10aSingle iron atoms coordinated to g-C₃N₄ on hierarchical porous N-doped carbon polyhedra as a high-performance electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction  ap. 798-801.  aCatalysts composed of isolated single Fe atoms coordinated to graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄) dispersed on hierarchical porous N-doped carbon polyhedra (Fe-g-C₃N₄/HPNCPs) were successfully prepared.

Substantial resources are allocated to the evaluation of model performance. The Regionalized Air quality Model Performance (RAMP) method introduced here explores novel ways of visualizing and evaluating CMAQ model performance and errors for daily Particulate Matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) concentrations across the continental United States. The RAMP method performs a non-homogenous, non-linear, non-homoscedastic model performance evaluation at each CMAQ grid. This work demonstrates that CMAQ model performance, for a well-documented 2001 regulatory episode, is non-homogeneous across space/time. The RAMP correction of systematic errors outperforms other model evaluation methods as demonstrated by a 22.1% reduction in Mean Square Error compared to a constant domain wide correction. The RAMP method is able to accurately reproduce simulated performance with a correlation of r = 76.1%. Most of the error coming from CMAQ is random error with only a minority of error being systematic. Areas of high systematic error are collocated with areas of high random error, implying both error types originate from similar sources. Therefore, addressing underlying causes of systematic error will have the added benefit of also addressing underlying causes of random error.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abias 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aUnited States 0aModel performance evaluation 0aRegulatory modeling 0aPM2.5 0aCMAQ 0aModeled data1 aXu, Yadong1 aVizuete, William1 aSerre, Marc L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3145-40240 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Jan., v. 148 p.258-265dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245006900213300001800282506007600300520162300376592002801999506003702027650003402064650001902098650002502117650001002142650001702152650001202169650002002181650001802201650002102219650001302240650001902253650001002272650002302282650001002305650001602315700006602331700001902397700002602416773013302442856008202575852000902657655001202666IND60660423520221207073303.0190823e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066042352DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-019-03900-92doi7 aPMC67065162pmcid7 a314780012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisiecka, Katarzyna14aThe influence of Cistus incanus L. leaves on wheat pasta quality  ap. 4311-4322.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aModern nutritional trends and looking for functional food and dedicated products for various consumers are a source of inspiration for scientists to develop new pro-health supplemented foods with high quality. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the selected properties of common wheat pasta fortified with dried Cistus incanus in amount from 1 to 5% as a replacement of wheat flour. Pasta was made with a spaghetti shape and dried. Supplemented pasta was tested for total phenolics content, the total activity against DPPH, the ability to neutralize free radicals to ABTS and the antioxidant capacity reduction power, using various extraction procedures. Selected physicochemical properties of pasta were evaluated: cooking time, cooking weight, cooking loss, hardness and color profile of dry and cooked pasta in CIE-Lab scale, as well as the sensory properties of supplemented products. The addition of C. incanus to fortify wheat pasta increased total phenolics content and antioxidant activity with some significant differences according to the extraction procedure used. Methanolic extraction was more efficient than buffer extraction. Increased addition of dry Cistus herb caused higher cooking weight, cooking loss and increased hardness of cooked pasta. Studies have shown that C. incanus addition had a slight effect on color change with the largest decrease in brightness, especially for cooked products. Finally, it was found that advisable application of C. incanus addition to achieve nutritionally improved composition of pasta should not exceed 3% due to the proper sensory characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCistus incanus 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3acooked foods 3acooking 3acooking quality 3afree radicals 3afunctional foods 3ahardness 3aneutralization 3apasta 3asensory properties 3awheat 3awheat flour1 aWójtowicz, Agnieszka,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5981-61091 aDziki, Dariusz1 aGawlik-Dziki, Urszula0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2019 Sept., v. 56, no. 9 p.4311-4322dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-019-03900-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01719naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013300159300002000292520072400312592002801036650001601064650002101080650001001101700001601111700001601127700001601143700002001159700001901179773012401198856007401322852000901396655001201405IND60675744720221121015332.0191108e20191029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067574472DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07610g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Shou-Jie10aCombined inorganic base promoted N-addition/[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement to construct homoallyl sulfur-containing pyrazolones  ap. 34912-34925.  aThe first sequentially combined inorganic base promoted N-addition/[2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement reaction of α-alkylidene pyrazolinones and propargyl sulfonium salts has been reported to construct homoallyl sulfur-containing pyrazolones with moderate to excellent yields. α-Alkylidene pyrazolinones function as N-nucleophilic agents distinguished from the reported C-addition reactions.

Uptake of both thallium ions is very fast in the first 10min. The adsorption isotherm of Tl(I) follows the Langmuir model with maximum adsorption capacity of 709.2mgg⁻¹. Ion-exchange between Tl⁺ and Na⁺ in the interlayers of TNTs is the primary mechanism for Tl(I) adsorption. Excess Tl⁺ undergoes further exchange with H⁺. The adsorption mechanism is different for Tl(III), and involves either ion-exchange with Na⁺ at low Tl(III) concentration or co-precipitation in the form of Tl(OH)3 with TNTs at high Tl(III) concentration. XPS analysis indicates that the ion-exchange process does not change the basic skeleton [TiO6] of TNTs, whereas Tl(OH)3 precipitation increases the percentage composition of O within the surface hydroxyl groups. XRD analysis also confirms the formation of Tl(OH)3 on TNTs at high initial concentration of Tl(III). Coexisting Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ hardly inhibit adsorption, indicating good selectivity for thallium by TNTs. Furthermore, TNTs can be reused efficiently after HNO3 desorption and NaOH regeneration, making TNTs a promising material to remove thallium from wastewaters. This study also confirms that co-precipitation is another important adsorption mechanism for easily hydrolytic metals by TNTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acalcium 3acoprecipitation 3adesorption 3aion exchange 3aions 3amoieties 3ananotubes 3anitric acid 3aprotons 3asodium 3asodium hydroxide 3asorption isotherms 3athallium 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aThallium 0aTitanate nanotubes 0aAdsorption 0aIon-exchange 0aCo-precipitation1 aZhang, Pan1 aBorthwick, Alistair G.L.1 aChen, Hao1 aNi, Jinren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2735-43060 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 June 01, v. 423 p.67-75dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.02.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245013000156300001600286500002000302520174200322592002802064650002102092650003502113650001802148650001502166650001102181650001302192650002402205650001102229650001902240650001402259650001902273650002202292650002202314650001202336650002202348650002002370650001502390651001702405773013002422856007202552852000902624655001202633IND60592030920221119023708.0180327e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059203092DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.27532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Roux, J.J.10aSediment Yield Potential in South Africa's Only Large River Network without a Dam: Implications for Water Resource Management  ap. 765-775.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSoil erosion not only involves the loss of fertile topsoil but is also coupled with sedimentation of dams, a double barrel problem in semi‐arid regions where water scarcity is frequent. Due to increasing water requirements in South Africa, the government is planning water resource development in the Mzimvubu River Catchment, which is the only large river network in the country without a dam. However, previous soil erosion studies indicate that large parts of the catchment are severely eroded. These studies, nonetheless, focussed only on rill and interill erosion processes and provided insufficient information about sediment yield. The present study maps and models the sediment yield potential by considering important connectivity factors (flow path length, slope steepness and surface roughness) over a 5‐year timeframe (from 2007 to 2012). Sediment yield contribution from rill–interrill erosion was modelled with ArcSWAT‐2012, whereas gully erosion contributions were estimated using sequential gully mapping with SPOT 5 imagery followed by gully‐derived sediment modelling in a GIS. Integration of the rill–interrill and gully results provided the total sediment yield potential, with an average of 5100 Mg km⁻² y⁻¹. The average sediment yield where the irrigation and hydropower dams are planned is around 20 000 Mg km⁻² y⁻¹. This study provides relative differences of the potential sediment yield and a framework to predict sediment yield to assist area‐specific rehabilitation in large, ungauged catchments. Without catchment rehabilitation, the life expectancies of the future irrigation and hydropower dams could be 55 and 43 years, respectively.

The proteolysis concentrations were significantly higher in probiotic cheeses and the antioxidant activity was at its maximum at the end of ripening. Cheeses made with added Lactobacillus rhamnosus had significantly higher proteolytic activity and antioxidant activity (P < 0.05) than those without probiotics during the entire ripening time. After digestion, the number of bacteria in cheese decreased significantly (P<0.05), but the polypeptide content was increased by 37.97% and the DPPH radical scavenging ability and reducing power were increased by 7.46% and 17.58%. More small peptides were produced after digestion and the antioxidant activity of cheese correlated with proteolysis and production of small molecule polypeptides that were further enhanced upon incorporation of probiotics. The total acceptability of cheese was not affected by the addition of probiotic bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aCheddar cheese 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3acheese ripening 3agastrointestinal system 3ain vitro digestion 3apolypeptides 3aprobiotics 3aproteolysis 3aviability 0aLactobacillus rhamnosus 0aCheddar cheese 0aAntioxidant activity 0aRipening 0aSimulated gastrointestinal digestion1 aQu, Xiuwei1 aXia, Qina1 aWang, Haixia1 aChen, Ping1 aLi, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2348-926X1 aWang, Lina1 aYang, Wanshuang0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2018 Sept., v. 95 p.99-106dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2018.04.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245011100207300001600318520128800334592002801622653001001650653001501660653001301675653001701688653001301705653001801718700001901736700001801755700001701773700001701790773007301807856008301880852000901963655001201972IND60124571020221121175118.0151025e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012457102DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-011-0208-72doi7 aPMC33578742pmcid7 a222010042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöhler, S.

In this article, we report on an application of MAGIC to model acidification at the four Swedish IM forested catchments that have been subject to differing degrees of acidification stress. Uncertainties in the modeled mass balances were mainly associated with the deposition scenario and assumptions about sulfate adsorption and soil mass. Estimated base cation (BC) release rates (weathering) varied in a relatively narrow range of 47–62 or 42–47 meq m⁻² year⁻¹, depending on assumptions made about soil cation exchange capacity and base saturation. By varying aluminum solubility or introducing a dynamic weathering feedback that allowed BC release to increase at more acidic pHs, a systematic effect on predicted changes in acid neutralizing capacity (ΔΔANC ca. 10–41 µeq l⁻¹) and pH (ca. ΔΔpH = 0.1–0.6) at all sites was observed. More robust projections of future changes in pH and ANC are dependent on reducing uncertainties in BC release rates, the timing, and extent of natural acidification through BC uptake by plants, temporal changes in soil element pools, and fluxes of Al between compartments.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMAGIC 0aWeathering 0aModeling 0aBase cations 0aAluminum 0aAcidification1 aZetterberg, T.1 aFutter, M.

In order to achieve highly effective amylolysis by α-amylase, freezing/thawing pre-treatment (FTF) of starch was performed to produce damaged starch with raised surface area. Afterwards, the effect of non-activated and activated α-amylase by the concomitant performance of ultrasonication (64.5 W, 25 + 40 kHz, 5 min) and Ca²⁺ ions (12.5 and 25 mM) on starch digestibility were investigated. Corn (NCS) and potato (NPS) starches were suspended in water by being exposed to activated and non-activated α-amylase (0.15% w/v) for a period of 10 h at a temperature of 25 °C. The physicochemical, morphological, and structural properties of native, FTF starches and hydrolyzed starches were studied. An increasingly damaged starch was the result of FTF according to the porous and cracking surface observed on starch granules. FTF of potato (PFTF) and corn (CFTF) starches exposed to non-activated and activated α-amylase showed a significantly greater percentage of hydrolysis, consequently destroyed the integrity of starch granules. The ratio of 1047/1022 cm⁻ ¹ reduced from 1.112 to 0.947 (NPS), 0.987 to 0.670 (PFTF), 1.293 to 1.154 (NCS) and 1.211 to 1.038 (CFTF) after being treated with activated α-amylase by 25 mM Ca²⁺ + 64.5 W sonication; additionally, relative crystallinity decreased respectively from 34.1% to 13.8% (PFTF) and 39.3%–17.7% (CFTF). Significantly low pasting viscosities (determined by RVA) along with the gelatinization temperature and enthalpy (determined by DSC) of FTF treated with α-amylases could be the reason behind the degradation of granular and molecular structures and low swelling power as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3acalcium 3acorn 3acrystal structure 3adigestible carbohydrates 3aenthalpy 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agelatinization temperature 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrolysis 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3asonication 3asurface area 3aultrasonic treatment 0aActivated α-amylase 0aCorn starch 0aPotato starch 0aFreezing/thawing cycle 0aFunctional properties1 aSayadi, Mehran1 aPourmohammadi, Kiana0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Aug., v. 129 p.107676-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245004300168300001200211520100600223592002801229653000901257653001001266653000801276653001501284653001101299653002201310653001201332653002801344653002201372653001401394653001301408653001201421700001801433700001801451700001701469700002001486773007201506856008301578852000901661655001201670IND60124571120221121175040.0151025e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012457112DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-011-0210-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallaghan, T.

Burned areas pose management challenges and opportunities, and increasing our understanding of post-fire plant colonization may assist management decision-making. We examined plant communities, soils, and soil seed banks two years after the 2005 Loop Fire, located in a creosote-blackbrush community in Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in southern Nevada's Mojave Desert. Based on a spring sampling of 20, 0.01-ha plots, live ++ dead cover of the exotic annual Bromus rubens averaged nine times lower on the burn than on a paired unburned area. Perennial species composition shifted from dominance by late-successional native shrubs (e.g., Coleogyne ramosissima) on the unburned area, to dominance by native perennial forbs (e.g., Sphaeralcea ambigua, Baileya multiradiata) on the burn. Species richness of live plants averaged 26%% (100 m² scale) and 239%% (1 m² scale) greater on the burn compared to the unburned area. Only 5%% of Larrea tridentata individuals resprouted, compared to 64%% of Yucca schidigera and baccata. Fire and microsite (interspace, below L. tridentata, or below Yucca) interacted to affect several 0––5 cm soil properties, with higher pH, conductivity, and total P and K on burned Yucca microsites. Bromus rubens density in 0––5 cm soil seed banks was four times lower on the burn, and its distribution among microsites reversed. Below-shrub microsites contained the most B. rubens seeds on the unburned area, but the least on the burned area. Intense fire below shrubs may have increased seed mortality, an idea supported by >3-fold decreases we found in emergence density after heating seed bank samples to 100°°C. Our study occurred after a post-fire period of below-average precipitation, underscoring a need for longer term monitoring that characterizes moister years.  aPublisher supplied data 0aColonization window 0aexotic species 0agrass-fire cycle 0asoil seed bank 0awildfire1 aEngel, E.

The effect of B₂O₃ on glass formation was discussed by changing the molar ratio of B₂O₃ in the matrix. When B₂O₃ content is 50 mol% and sintering temperature is 600 ℃, the amorphous degree of quaternary glass is the highest. The sintered body with the highest degree of amorphous was selected to study radioactive iodine. Then, the effects of different iodine loading concentrations for sintering borosilicate glass in terms of microstructure and phase change were discussed. With the increase in iodine content on silica-gel, the degree of amorphous of the specimens presented a decreasing trend, and there are obvious SiO₂ peaks. When the content was 20 wt.%-30 wt.%, a large number of new phases were generated. When the iodine content is 20 wt.%, in addition to the enrichment of Si and O elements, the elemental distribution for B, Bi, Zn, I, and Ag was even. TEM results also showed that there was a crystalline phase in the sinter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass 3aiodine 3amicrostructure 3anuclear power 3aphase transition 3asilica gel 3atemperature 0aBorosilicate glass 0aImmobilization 0aLow sintering temperature1 aLi, Bingsheng1 aShu, Xiaoyan1 aZhang, Zhentao1 aWei, Guilin1 aLiu, Yi1 aChen, Shunzhang1 aXie, Yi1 aLu, Xirui0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Feb. 05, v. 403 p.123588-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1235883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245012600153300001600279500002000295500001500315520171300330592002802043650001202071650001302083650002102096650001102117650002902128650002102157650001202178650002602190650001802216650002002234650002102254650001802275650002202293650001202315650001402327650001502341650001502356650002202371650002102393650001402414651001002428653001502438700001402453700001202467700001702479700002002496773013002516856007202646852000902718655001202727IND60592031120221119023804.0180327e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059203112DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.28782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Chun10aRapid increases in fine root biomass and production following cessation of anthropogenic disturbances in degraded forests  ap. 461-470.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aDespite the critical importance of fine roots (FRs, ø ≤ 2 mm) in terrestrial carbon and nutrient cycling, we know little about FR dynamics following cessation of anthropogenic disturbances in degraded forests. We hypothesized that (a) FR biomass and production increase rapidly following cessation of anthropogenic disturbances and then decline with stands ageing and (b) FR mortality and turnover are highest in degraded forests due to recurring disturbances. We used a replicated chronosequence to examine the effect of cessation of disturbances on FR dynamics by sampling stands with ongoing anthropogenic disturbances such as fuelwood collection and domestic animal grazing and stands after 6, 11, 21, and 31 years prohibited from anthropogenic disturbances using mountain closure in subtropical forests of eastern China. We found that FR biomass and production increased rapidly from stands without closure to those after 6 years of closure. As stands overmatured, biomass and production declined and stabilized thereafter. Both FR mortality and turnover decreased over time from stands without closure and after 6 years of closure to those closed for longer times. Biomass, production, and mortality correlated positively with the proportion of bamboo, overstorey species richness, and herb layer cover, whereas turnover rate correlated negatively with stand density and basal area. Our results show evidence for rapid increases in FR biomass and production following cessation of anthropogenic disturbances. Our results suggest that stand‐level FR dynamics following mountain closure are influenced by changes in overstorey species composition and richness and understorey vegetation cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrazing 3afuelwood 3avegetation cover 3acarbon 3aanthropogenic activities 3adomestic animals 3abamboos 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aforest damage 3achronosequences 3atropical forests 3astand density 3aspecies diversity 3abiomass 3amortality 3aunderstory 3afine roots 3aground vegetation 3astand basal area 3aoverstory 3aChina 0abasal area1 aWang, Zhe1 aZhu, Qi1 aFu, Songling1 aChen, Han Y.

This work addresses the interaction and dispersity of GO with nitrocellulose (NC)/diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN)-based nanocomposites. The GO and DEGDN were successfully synthesised and characterised. The NC/DEGDN proved to be a good hosting matrix for the dispersion of GO nanosheets. Analysis of atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the thicknesses of dispersed GO were in the range of 1–4 nm suggesting that the GO in the nanocomposite consists of 1–2 layers for a 0.5% w/w GO containing nanocomposite and 2–4 layers for a 0.75% w/w nanocomposite. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis established red-shifting of 744 to 752 cm⁻¹ for the O–NO₂ bond stretching vibrations, indicating bond stabilization by donor electron from the GO. The Raman spectra analysis showed GO peaks blue-shifting and broadening which is attributed to hydrogen bonding interaction between GO sheets and –NO₂ groups. The activation energy of nitrate ester decomposition of NC/DEGDN/GO nanocomposites increases as a function of GO content from 167 kJ mol⁻¹ and reaches a maximum of 214 kJ mol⁻¹ for a 0.5% w/w GO loading. This suggests an improvement of the nitrate ester bond stability. These findings open a new direction to the application of GO in nitrate ester-based materials for increased stability, safety and shelf life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aatomic force microscopy 3adiethylene glycol 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3anitrates 3ashelf life1 aMoniruzzaman, Mohammed1 aGill, Philip P.0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 31, v. 9, no. 60 p.35158-35164dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07717k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245013600175300001600311520112500327592002801452650002801480650001301508650002201521650001501543650002001558650001201578650002201590650001501612650001801627650001701645653003301662653001901695653002801714653001001742653002001752653001201772700002001784773012501804856008201929852000902011655001202020IND60599287520221120192546.0180702e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059928752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDemirocak, Dervis Emre10aIn situ atomic force microscopy analysis of morphology and particle size changes in Lithium Iron Phosphate cathode during discharge  ap. 151-157.  aLi-ion batteries offer great promise for future plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and pure electric vehicles (EVs). One of the challenges is to improve the cycle life of Li-ion batteries which requires detailed understanding of the aging phenomenon. In situ techniques are especially valuable to understand aging since it allows monitoring the physical and chemical changes in real time. In this study, in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) is utilized to study the changes in morphology and particle size of LiFePO4 cathode during discharge. The guidelines for in situ AFM cell design for accurate and reliable measurements based on different designs are presented. The effect of working electrode to counter electrode surface area ratio on cycling data of an in situ cell is also discussed. Analysis of the surface area change in LiFePO4 particles when the cell was cycled between 100% and 70% state of charge is presented. Among four particles analyzed, surface area increase of particles during Li intercalation of LiFePO4 spanned from 1.8% to 14.3% indicating the inhomogeneous nature of the cathode surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3acathodes 3aelectric vehicles 3aguidelines 3airon phosphates 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amonitoring 3aparticle size 3asurface area 0aIn situ electrochemical cell 0aLi-ion battery 0aAtomic force microscopy 0aAging 0aRate capability 0aLiFePO41 aBhushan, Bharat0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 June 01, v. 423 p.151-157dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018900168520174100357592002802098650002102126650001802147650001402165650001502179650001902194650001802213650001102231650001202242650002102254650000702275650001802282650001302300650001302313650002002326650002202346650001602368650001402384653003502398653001502433653003302448653001802481700001802499700001402517700003002531700001302561700002902574700001302603773010302616856008602719852000902805655001202814IND60771612220221119082842.0220502e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077161222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Fangzhou10aGreen approaches for dietary fibre-rich polysaccharide production from the cooking liquid of Adzuki beans: Enzymatic extraction combined with ultrasonic or high-pressure homogenisation  aThis research follows the current trend of food waste valorisation via green approaches. The structural and functional characteristics of active polysaccharides from the cooking liquid of Adzuki beans were examined, filling an existing knowledge gap. Enzymatic extraction (EE) followed by ultrasonic modification (UM) or high-pressure homogenisation modification (HM) were effective in producing dietary fibre-rich polysaccharide products: EU-P and EH-P (total dietary fibre: 86.3% and 82.4% dry weight (DW); insoluble/soluble dietary fibre ratio: 2.21 and 2.10; protein: 1.26% and 1.09% DW; Lipid: 1.50% and 1.94% DW, respectively). Both contained Rha, Gal, Glu, Ara, Xyl and GlcNAc, and had statistically identical total phenolic content (0.33% DW) and particle size (1000–1032 nm) and very similar DPPH scavenging activities. EU-P and EH-P exhibited good capacities for water-holding (10.15 and 8.34 g/g), oil-holding (15.48 and 15.57 g/g), cholesterol-adsorption (17.34 and 18.41 mg/g at pH 2; 29.47 and 29.72 mg/g at pH 7) and nitrite-adsorption (285.31 and 296.44 μg/g at pH 2; 141.39 and 122.95 μg/g at pH 7). EH-P had a lower molecular weight (Mw 68420 Da; Mn 21350 Da; Mw/Mn 3.20), lower thermal stability, higher viscosity at shear rates above 1 s⁻¹, higher emulsifying capacity, and comparable and lower emulsion stability at 1% and 2% concentrations, respectively, compared with EU-P (Mw 102101 Da; Mn 24810 Da; Mw/Mn 4.11). EE was effective in loosening the compact polysaccharide-based polymeric network via cleaving glycosidic and peptide bonds in the samples. Subsequent UM or HM further facilitated depolymerisation then re-assembly of some EE-disintegrated fragments to form new networks/structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3adepolymerization 3adietary fiber 3aemulsions 3afood waste 3ahomogenization 3ahydrocolloids 3alipids 3aliquids 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aparticle size 3apeptides 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3athermal stability 3aultrasonics 3aviscosity 0aCooking liquid of adzuki beans 0aUltrasonic 0aHigh-pressure homogenisation 0aDietary fibre1 aZhang, Shikai1 aZhou, Tao1 aWaterhouse, Geoffrey I.N.1 aDu, Yuyi1 aSun-Waterhouse, Dongxiao1 aWu, Peng0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Sept., v. 130 p.107679-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011000160520197800270592002802248650002002276650001302296650001202309650001202321650000902333650002202342650001802364650001502382650002302397650001602420650001202436650002602448650002002474650001302494650002202507650001502529650002502544651001002569651002102579653002602600653001802626653002202644653002002666700001602686773010902702856008202811852000902893655001202902IND60648511620221120052917.0190705e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064851162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2019.1075582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Tao10aAlfalfa-corn rotation and row placement affects yield, water use, and economic returns in Northeast China  aPlanting systems in the corn belt of Northeast China (CBNC) have been adjusted to solve the problem of black soil productivity decline caused by long-term intensive cultivation. To this end, field experiments with the alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-corn (Zea mays L.) rotation and row placement were conducted to evaluate soil water, crop yield, and economic returns in the CBNC from 2014 to 2018. The three treatments included continuous corn (CC), continuous alfalfa (CA), and three years of alfalfa followed by two years of corn (3A2C). Corn was planted in the row (R) or interrow (IR) space of the previously planted alfalfa in the 3A2C treatment in 2017 and 2018. Planting alfalfa increased farmer income, and the 5-yr total revenue of the CA treatment was 41% greater than that of the CC treatment. There was no difference in total evapotranspiration (ET) between the CC and CA treatments, and the 5-yr biomass water use efficiency (WUEB) of the CA treatment decreased by 48%, compared with that of the CC treatment. The 3A2C treatment increased corn leaf area index, biomass, and yield. Corn yield of the 3A2C treatment was 8% greater than that of the CC treatment in 2017. The 5-yr net revenue of the 3A2C treatment increased by 24% compared with that of the CC treatment. Corn planting in the first year after alfalfa removal reduced ET. The ET of the 3A2C treatment decreased by 12% in 2017 compared with that of the CC treatment, The WUEB of the 3A2C treatment was 18% and 14% greater than that of the CC treatment in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Corn planted into the previously planted alfalfa row produced 4% and 6% greater yield and 12% and 18% greater WUEB than corn planted in the interrow space in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Therefore, an alfalfa-corn rotation system suitable for use in the CBNC and found to economically benefit farmers consisted of three years of alfalfa followed by two years of corn planted in the previous alfalfa crop row (3A2C-R).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago sativa 3aZea mays 3aalfalfa 3abiomass 3acorn 3acosts and returns 3acrop rotation 3acrop yield 3aevapotranspiration 3afarm income 3afarmers 3afield experimentation 3aleaf area index 3aplanting 3asoil productivity 3asoil water 3awater use efficiency 3aChina 3aCorn Belt region 0aAlfalfa-corn rotation 0aRow placement 0aWater consumption 0aEconomic return1 aLi, Zizhong0 tField crops research.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 241 p.107558-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.1075583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02495naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245017800157300002000335520124400355592002801599650002201627650001501649650001501664650002201679650001401701650001901715650002501734650001901759650001501778650001101793650001601804700001801820700001701838700001601855700001901871773012401890856007402014852000902088655001202097IND60675745220221120090629.0191108e20191029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067574522DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra07745f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yanzhuo10aConvenient synthesis of uncovered imprinted microspheres by Ganoderma lucidum spore-stabilized pickering emulsion polymerization and their enhanced recognition of spiramycin  ap. 34772-34783.  aIn this work, a new and simple method was developed for the synthesis of uncovered and high-selectivity spiramycin-based molecularly imprinted microspheres (SP-MIMs) by Pickering emulsion polymerization using spiramycin as templates. And surprisingly the solid particles were absent on the surface of imprinted microspheres, which can be ascribed to the Ganoderma lucidum spores (GLS): they were firstly selected to be the stabilizers for the Pickering emulsion in this new strategy. Through a series of adsorption experiments, the uncovered SP-MIMs were proven to possess more excellent selective recognition and removal ability for template SP in aqueous solution. And SP-MIMs could be reused for many times without significant loss of adsorption capacity, indicating the satisfactory regeneration performance. Therefore, SP-MIMs can be employed as a promising adsorbent for the selective removal of SP from aqueous media, and this strategy will contribute to overcoming the shortcomings of stabilizer particles on the surface of the as-prepared imprinting microspheres, because these solid particles lack the special selective recognition activity of template molecules, and may disturb the adsorption effect of imprinting microspheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aemulsions 3amicroparticles 3amolecular imprinting 3apolymerization 3aspiramycin 3aspores 3astabilizers1 aTeng, Honghui1 aSun, Dongshu1 aJiang, Dayu1 aYan, Yongsheng0 tRSC advances.g2019 Oct. 29, v. 9, no. 60 p.34772-34783dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra07745f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012500165300001600290520128300306592002801589650000901617650001901626650001801645650001501663650001701678650001901695650001501714650001301729650001401742650001901756650001101775650001101786650002001797650002101817650001301838653001501851653002001866653001801886653001301904700001601917700001901933700001801952773012501970856008202095852000902177655001202186IND60599287720221120182135.0180702e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059928772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2014.02.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuy, Do Xuan10aRattle-type hierarchical particles containing multilevel cores (Ag@AgCl@SiO2 and Au/Ag@AgCl@SiO2) as versatile catalysts  ap. 178-185.  aA protocol for the synthesis of rattle-type core@shell particles containing Ag@AgCl or Au/Ag@AgCl core structures was developed, and the use of these particles as catalysts for the decomposition of toxic materials was demonstrated. A monometallic Ag or bimetallic Au/Ag core was incorporated into the interior of SiO2 capsules via controlled heat treatment of metal nanoparticle/SiO2-coated polymer particles, resulting in the formation of rattle-type core@shell structures. By appropriate treatments, it was possible to transform the Ag or Au/Ag core into multilevel cores (Ag@AgCl or Au/Ag@AgCl) within the SiO2 capsules (Ag@AgCl@SiO2 or Au/Ag@AgCl@SiO2). This method for the synthesis of rattle-type core@shell particles is useful for further introducing AgCl fused with plasmonic materials into the capsule structures. The rattle-type core@shell structures were used as photocatalysts for the decomposition of organic pollutants such as methyl orange. Furthermore, these nanocatalysts containing semiconductors such as AgCl were also applied toward the reduction of nitrophenol (NPh) to aminophenol (APh). The Ag@AgCl@SiO2 or Au/Ag@AgCl@SiO2 catalysts showed excellent catalytic properties in the decomposition of toxic substances in terms of their activity and reusability.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3aheat treatment 3amethyl orange 3ananosilver 3anitrophenols 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3apolymers 3aprotocols 3asemiconductors 3asilica 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aCore@shell 0aPolyelectrolyte 0aPhotocatalyst 0aCatalyst1 aLee, Ha-Jin1 aLee, Young Boo1 aChoi, Won San0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2014 July 01, v. 425 p.178-185dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2014.02.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03066naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245020300136300001800339520129400357592002801651650002501679650002101704650002201725650002301747650002801770650002601798650001101824650001301835650001001848650001201858650003501870650001001905650001101915650001101926650001101937650003001948650001801978650001901996650001002015651001102025651001302036653001002049653002802059653002302087653004302110700002502153700002202178700002502200700002602225700002302251700002402274700002202298700002402320773012302344852000902467655001202476IND60128932920221118010132.0151124e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012893292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Alvair Da S.10aSeroprevalence of Rickettsia spp. in Equids and Molecular Detection of ‘Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii’ in Amblyomma cajennense Sensu Lato Ticks from the Pantanal Region of Mato Grosso, Brazil  ap. 1242-1247.  aThe aim of the study was to evaluate exposure of equids to rickettsial agents (Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia parkeri, ‘Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii’, Rickettsia rhipicephali, and Rickettsia bellii) and rickettsial infection in ticks of a Pantanal region of Brazil. Sera of 547 equids (500 horses and 47 donkeys) were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay. In total, 665 adults and 106 nymphal pools of Amblyomma cajennense F. sensu lato, 10 Dermacentor nitens Neumann ticks, and 88 larval pools of Amblyomma sp. were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Overall, 337 (61.6%) equids were reactive (titer ≥64) to at least one antigen of Rickettsia spp. The prevalence values for Rickettsia were 66%, and the highest endpoint titers were observed for ‘Ca. R. amblyommii’. By PCR 3 (0.45%) A. cajennense s.l. females were positive for ‘Ca. R. amblyommii’. Minimum infection rates of 0.75% for nymphs and 0.34% for larvae were calculated. Positive samples of ticks have had a fragment of the 16S mitochondrial rRNA gene sequenced and sequences showed 99% identity to Amblyomma sculptum Berlese. This study reports a wide exposure of equids to Rickettsia agents, and PCR evidence of infection with ‘Ca. R. amblyommii’, for the first time, in A. sculptum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma cajennense 3aAnocentor nitens 3aRickettsia bellii 3aRickettsia parkeri 3aRickettsia rhipicephali 3aRickettsia rickettsii 3aadults 3aantigens 3aasses 3afemales 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3ahorses 3alarvae 3anymphs 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aseroprevalence 3aticks 3aBrazil 3aPantanal 0aequid 0aPantanal mato-grossense 0aAmblyomma sculptum 0a‘Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii’1 aMelo, Andréla L.
